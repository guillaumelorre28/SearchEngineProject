As Donald Trump stacks his cabinet with advocates of continued wartime 
detention atGuantánamo Bay <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/guantanamo-bay>
, 40 Democratic legislators have written to Barack Obama urging a last-ditch 
effort to shut down the detention center once and for all.


A letter sent to the White House on Wednesday by the Congressional Progressive 
Caucus, and obtained by the Guardian, warns of “torture’s resurgence” under the 
Trump administration unless Obama fulfills his thwarted “laudable” pledge to 
close Guantánamo.

The letter comes on the 15th anniversary of the opening of the detention 
center.

“[W]ith only days before your term ends, we ask that you definitively close 
the site by rapidly pursuing any and all options within your existing authority 
to seek lawful disposition of all of the 55 remaining individuals languishing 
in the camp,” the 40 Democratic members of the caucus wrote.

“Mr Trump must be deprived of the use of Guantánamo Bay.”

Signatories to the letter include civil rights icon John Lewis of Georgia, 
Iraq war veteran Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, senior justice committee member 
John Conyers of Michigan, and Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who is running for 
the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee.

“Given the very real threat that the Trump administration will resume the 
barbaric forced interrogation practices utilized in the Bush era, we must act 
now to bring an end to this dark chapter in American history,” said 
Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California, another signatory, in a statement 
provided to the Guardian.

As an additional preventative measure against a return to torture, the caucus 
letter urges Obama to declassify additional sections of the landmark 2014 
Senate intelligence committee investigation into CIA torture and to instruct 
officials throughout the security apparatus to read it. Obama, whose White House
obstructed release of the report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/cia-torture-report-aftermath-daniel-jones-senate-investigation>
, in Decemberagreed to preserve it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/12/obama-senate-cia-torture-report-september-11-classified>
 as part of his presidential records, but doing so prevents its release for 12 
years.

“[A] review of the Senate report and reaffirmation of torture’s illegality 
will empower federal employees to resist any possible effort by the 
president-elect to undermine torture’s prohibition,” the progressives’ letter 
contends.

The letter is agnostic about how Obama should close Guantánamo.

Legislative restrictions, which the caucus acknowledges, prevent Obama from 
transferring Guantánamo detainees to the US for any purpose. In its waning days 
in office, the White House hopes to transfer 18 detainees cleared by a 
multi-agency review panel as posing a minimal threat, a move that would leave 
37 detainees at Guantánamo.

On Tuesday, outgoing defense secretary Ashton Carter said further transfers 
were unlikely

, as there is insufficient time in the administration to provide a 
legally-mandated congressional notification for transfer.

 to a defense of its Guantanamo record offered by spokesman Josh Earnest last 
week.

Trump has embraced Guantánamo detentions despite international condemnation 
and persistent domestic outcry from human rights monitors. On the campaign 
trail, Trump said he was open totrying Americans

 in Guantánamo military tribunals and to torturing terrorism detainees, even “
if it doesn’t work, they deserve it anyway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/24/donald-trump-on-waterboarding-even-if-it-doesnt-work-they-deserve-it>
”. Both proposals are illegal.

Several of Trump’s cabinet nominees in relevant positions have expressed their 
support for retaining Guantánamo Bay as a detention facility, including 
attorney general pick Jeff Sessions, CIA pick Mike Pompeo and director of 
national intelligence pick Dan Coats. James Mattis, Trump’s choice for 
secretary of defense, opposes torture but has criticized Guantánamo Bay 
transfers and advocated for detaining terror suspects for the duration of an 
amorphous war with no foreseeable end.

Trump’s nominee to run the department of homeland security, John Kelly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/10/john-kelly-homeland-security-confirmation-hearing-news>
, oversaw Guantánamo Bay as head of US Southern Command and internally 
dissented from the Obama administration’s efforts to shutter it.


The caucus letter is supported by a dozen human rights organizations, 
including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Credo, the Friends 
Committee on National Legislation, Demand Progress and Open the Government.

“This letter from Congress is an important message at a crucial time. 
Guantánamo cannot be allowed to become a permanent institution of injustice,” 
said Margaret Huang, the US executive director of Amnesty International.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
