The cost of the payment protection insurance scandal, which has already 
reached £37bn, is likely to escalate after the financial regulator extended its 
proposed deadline for claims by customers mis-sold policies by more than a year.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stunned the industry on Tuesday by 
proposing a deadline of June 2019, rather than the spring 2018 cutoff it had
suggested in October

 in a move intended to draw a line under the costliest ever misselling scandal.

Banks, which had been operating on the basis of the 2018 deadline, are now 
expected to increase their provisions while consumer experts urged individuals 
to make claims.

According to an estimate by the New City Agenda thinktank, PPI has already 
cost £37.3bn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/11/misconduct-has-cost-uks-banks-53bn-over-15-years-ppi>
 and the prospect of the rising cost drove bank shares lower. Lloyds Banking 
Group closed off by 1%, Royal Bank of Scotland was down by 1.7% and Barclays 
was 3.5% lower.

The FCA calculates that £24.2bn has been paid out to 12 million consumers 
since 2011 – when the payouts first started – from more than 50m policies sold 
since the 1990s.

Guy Anker, managing editor at MoneySavingExpert.com, said: “The urgent 
clarion-call to consumers is if you’ve had a loan, credit card or mortgage in 
the last 10 years you should be checking now whether you had PPI on it and if 
so, was it mis-sold? Many people are shocked they had PPI when they didn’t 
think so, as one way it was mis-sold was it was added even though they said 
‘no’.”

Most focus was on Lloyds, which already has a bill of £16bn – the largest of 
any of the banks.

Gary Greenwood, a banks analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital, said the cost 
for Lloyds could be up to £1bn.

“Whether additional provisions are required and how material these may be is 
uncertain at this stage, and we await further comment from the companies in 
this respect. However, we would not be surprised to see top-ups of a few 
hundred million pounds, and perhaps as high as £1bn, for each of the large UK 
banks, with Lloyds being the worst affected.”

Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, suggested £2bn as an estimate of the 
likely extra cost for the major players due to the FCA’s proposed extension.

The regulator’s decision is a blow to the banks, which had hoped for an easier 
ride after the former chancellorGeorge Osborne ousted

 the hardline then FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley last year. Andrew 
Bailey, Wheatley’s successor,took over last month

, but has been on the FCA board since 2013.

Bailey said: “Putting a deadline on PPI complaints will bring the issue to an 
orderly conclusion in a way that protects both consumers and market integrity.”

Consumer groups remained cautious about the impact of a deadline for claims. 
Alex Neill, director of policy and campaigns, at Which?, said: “If a PPI 
deadline is to be introduced, when millions of pounds are still being set aside 
for payouts, the FCA must work with banks to ensure that customers who might 
not know they were mis-sold PPI get back the money they are owed. The process 
for making a claim must be much more straightforward.”

Lloyds said it was disappointed by the extension. “While we welcome the 
clarity provided by today’s update, we are disappointed that the two-year 
deadline suggested by the regulator won’t commence until June 2017, delaying a 
prompt to action and therefore potential redress for consumers,” said the bank, 
which is9% owned by taxpayers

.

Lloyds did not increase its provision immediately. It has £2bn of unused 
provisions and pointed out that complaints had fallen to 7,500 a week, from an 
average of 8,500 in the first half of 2016. In the past week, the bank said the 
number of complaints had declined to 6,700, the lowest since 2011, when 
compensation started being paid out.

The banks sold insurance to borrowers from the late 1990s onwards, claiming 
that it would protect their payments if they fell ill or lost their jobs. But 
many policies were ineffective, foisted on people who did not need them or were 
sold them in an underhand manner.
