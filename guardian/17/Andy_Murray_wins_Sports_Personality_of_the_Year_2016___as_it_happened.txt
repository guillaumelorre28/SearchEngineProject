That’s all from me. Congratulations to Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray>, who has chalked up another 
piece of history with his third SPOTY crown after rising to the top of the 
tennis world. One of the few prizes left for him to sew up is the title of 
Britain’s greatest ever athlete.

It was also a good night for runners-up Alistair Brownlee and Nick Skelton, 
while away from the Olympics, Leicester City took home team and coach of the 
year for their fairytale Premier League success. Thanks for joining me. 
Goodnight.

Murray picks up the award from Lennox Lewis poolside in Miami, and his speech 
is another low-key, bone-dry masterpiece:

“I’d like to thank everyone who voted, I really appreciate your support. And 
I’d like to thank my team, they make a lot of sacrifices for me, they’re away 
from their family at times of the year like this.

“Also I’d like to thank my family. I think my mum is in the crowd there, my 
dad as well, he just got married 10 days ago, I miss you guys. I’d like to say 
a huge thanks to my wife and my daughter, who won’t know what this means yet, 
but maybe in a few years she will. Actually, I’ve got a bone to pick with my 
wife because about an hour ago she told me she’d voted for Nick Skelton. Not 
smart from her with Christmas coming up.

“It’s been a great year for British sport and I am so proud to have been a 
part of it.”

Team of the year! Has this ever been more closely fought? England’s rugby 
union team. Wales’ football team. The British women’s hockey team. Team GB. 
ParalympicsGB. Leicester, for god’s sake.

The award goes to... Leicester City! I had a feeling the hockey team would 
sneak it, but it’s hard to argue. 5000-1, an unrepeatable, unbelievable triumph.

Phelps is here, and receives his award from Ian Thorpe and Prince William, the 
Duke of Cambridge. A balanced relay team, there.

“My career started with a dream to win an Olympic medal” says Phelps. “I had a 
lot of memorable races in my career, but to be able to retire the way I wanted 
to has been the dream. It’s an honour to stand in front of these athletes, the 
goals and dreams they have, and not giving up. Thank you, this means absolutely 
the world.”

Staying with American Olympic superheroes, it’s time for the lifetime award. 
It’s going toMichael Phelps, the man with the wingspan of a light aircraft, and 
the gold medal haul of an Eastern bloc country.

Phelps completed a comeback from a drink-driving arrest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/10/michael-phelps-did-not-want-to-be-alive-anymore-after-dui-arrest>
 to win five golds in Rio, taking his lifetime total to 23. It’s hard to see 
that ever being matched. All in all, a better year than Ryan Lochte.

We’re into the home straight now – the US win the Ryder Cup, Wigan take the 
Super League, Bangladesh beat England for the first time in a Test, and Chicago 
is rocked by the Cubs, and the Irish, in the same week. Nico Rosberg wins the 
F1 title, then retires. And finally: Anthony Joshua, the heavyweight champion 
who, unlike Tyson Fury, didn’t merit a nomination.

The Helen Rollason award goes to Ben Smith. Bullied as a teenager, he helped 
to raise money for anti-bullying charities by running 401 marathons in 401 
days. An extraordinary achievement.

“I found running as my sanctuary, to be who I was, and not have to lie 
anymore” says Smith. “It gave me back my confidence and self-esteem, but most 
importantly, I’m not afraid any more”.

So we’ve had the entire British women’s team, and the whole Leicester City 
squad, out on the stage – but no team of the year prize yet. Is this Aston 
Villa’s year?

Voting for the main award is now open, by the way. You can vote via the BBC 
website <http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/sports-personality/38135745>, but hurry 
back.

Time for the final contender: Kate Richardson-Walsh, captain of the British 
women’s hockey team, who won gold against the odds in Rio. Kate’s wife Helen 
scored the winning penalty in a shootout against the Netherlands, before the 
captain ended her career on the ultimate high. She’s the first ever hockey 
player (field or ice) to get a SPOTY nomination.

Here’s Simon McMahon:

“If (when) Murray wins, you can bet his acceptance speech will be as low key 
and laid back as the one just shown. Andy doesn’t do exaggeration or hype. 
That’s why I love him. Britain’s greatest ever sportsperson ...?”

A recent poll gave Murray that accolade, and was met with widespread derision. 
I find it baffling; Murray is in the conversation, at the very least.

A man in an Iceland shirt is banging a big drum, coercing the crowd into an 
awkward ‘Viking thunderclap’. That means one thing – time for aEuro 2016 
look-back. England are wisely sidestepped, with Tom Jones talking us through a 
Wales-centric montage.

Gareth Bale is nominated for the award, having also won the Champions League 
this year, although for me, Hal Robson-Kanu should be handed the trophy 
outright forthat goal against Belgium. Portugal won the whole thing, of course 
– the 87th biggest surprise of 2016.

Mickelson. England v Pakistan, Hull FC won the Challenge Cup, and Argentina 
ended Great Britain’s Davis Cup unbeaten run. Thanks for nothing, Andy.

Next up, Nick Skelton, whose long equestrian career looked over in 2000, when 
he broke his neck in a fall. 16 years later, he won a six-way jump-off to claim 
Olympic gold at the age of 58. He’s an outside bet for a podium place later on.
Fun fact: Skelton and his children learned to ride on the same pony – Oxo, who 
lived to the age of 39.Fun fact two: Skelton’s autobiography is called Only 
Falls and Horses.

Murray’s 2016 started badly (by his standards), with defeats to Novak Djokovic 
in Paris and Melbourne. Then Sam Querrey dumped Djokovic out of Wimbledon, and 
Murray grasped the nettle – winning a second Wimbledon (and third Grand Slam), 
defending his Olympic title and then, most remarkable of all, becoming the 
world No1 after an astonishing run of form.

to an all-round great year for tennis.

speech.

Cox: “Sport saved my life... it kept me going, kept me driven. It helped me 
forget the situation I was in, the times I was up all night with spasms.”
Storey: “Swimming led me to cycling, and the dedication I needed then helped 
me. It was four years ago that I announced I was pregnant – don’t worry, I’m 
not doing that tonight – and I realised after winning at the worlds that Rio 
was on.”

It’s unlikely, but I’d be delighted to see either of those two on the podium 
later.

The focus is now on Cox and Storey, two of the most extraordinary athletes on 
this, or any shortlist. Cox won golds and set two world records in two sports – 
athletics and cycling – just two years after a stroke led to a diagnosis of MS.

Storey, meanwhile, is nothing less than a gold medal machine – two golds in 
Rio made her Britain’s greatest female Paralympian, with 14 golds across five 
different Games.

Sarah Storey: ‘It would be amazing to see a Paralympian with the Spoty trophy’

Next nominee (they’re racing through them) – it’s Mo Farah, double-double 
Olympic gold medallist and conqueror of the Cube. It’s not all been plain 
sailing off the track for Farah, but his 10,000m triumph after falling was one 
of the year’s most gripping moments. He’s in Dubai, a reflection of his 66-1 
odds, which is faintly ridiculous given what he’s achieved. He is Britain’s 
most successful track and field athlete of all time.

Claudio Ranieri is coach of the year! They rather snuck that one on us, 
mid-interview with Ranieri, who looks close to tears.

“I didn’t expect this, it’s fantastic. I can only say thank you again to my 
players, my chairman, all my staff – but without our fans, it wasn’t possible.”

When did he think Leicester could win the league? “When Hazard scored”, but 
adds, “when it took Arsenal 95 minutes to beat us, I thought maybe we can do 
something special”.

Does anyone else still wake with a start at 3am, and remember that Leicester 
City won the Premier League? No? Just me? We’re now enjoying a feature-length 
montage of their miracle success, culminating inJamie Vardy’s ultimate house 
party when they clinched the title.

Vardy, in contention for the main individual award, but is quick to point out 
“I couldn’t have done any of it without the boys behind me”. Can they win the 
Champions League, asks Lineker. “Stranger things have happened.” Indeed they 
have.

The Kennys are on stage now. Jason has a nice line in dry humour: “I didn’t 
know how many keirin experts were out there,” while Laura talks about her pride 
at being part of so much female success this year. There’s a slightly risqué 
magazine shot on the screen behind them that sends them into embarrassed 
giggles. And now,the year in snooker

Next up, it’s a pair that Balding introduces as “the king and queen of the 
velodrome” – it’s Shane Sutton and  Jason and Laura Kenny. The cameras visit 
them at home, in a bit of VT that’s unbearably twee, before going over their 
Rio achievements.

They won five Olympic gold medals and three World golds between them this 
year. If it were an independent republic, the Kenny household would have 
finished 19th in theRio 2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rio-2016> medal

Next, the second favourite for the award, and the first triathlete to ever be 
nominated. It’sAlistair Brownlee, who added triathlon gold in Rio to his 
victory in London with a dominant performance, before helping his brother Jonny

misremembered as the Olympic race itself.

Poor overlooked Justin Rose provides a neat segue from Olympics to golf, and 
Danny Willett, who won the Masters from nowhere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/11/masters-2016-danny-willett-thanks-fate-for-help-in-unlikely-victory>
 in April. Willett thought he would miss the Masters with his wife due to give 
birth – but his son arrived early and he travelled to Augusta, held his nerve 
as Jordan Spieth collapsed, and ended a 20-year wait for a British green jacket.

Whitlock: “It’s crazy, really exciting... where we are today, we could never 
have imagined this ten years ago. I believe success breeds success, so I hope I 
can inspire the next generation”

He says that he got a standing ovation outside a restaurant, which was 
“unheard of for a gymnast”. Don’t they get one every time they nail a big 
landing?

Here’s a third Olympian, Max Whitlock – putting Peaty and Adams to shame by 
doing his sport live on stage. Hard as it is to weigh up the scale of each 
Olympic, and Paralympic, achievement, I think Whitlock should be shorter than 
100-1 for this award – he ended a 116-year wait for a British gymnastic gold, 
then got another two hours later.

Peaty and Adams take the stage together. Here’s a few words from both:

Peaty: “How did I do it? Just swim two lengths. It’s as simple as that... I’m 
massively proud to be British, and I was so happy to get the first gold.”

Adams: “It was a lot harder defending the title, and everyone wants to be an 
Olympic champion. It was tough, but I got the job done!”

Moving swiftly on (there are a lot of Olympians to get through), it’s boxer 
Nicola Adams.She became the first British boxer to retain an Olympic title 
after winning gold in the women’s flyweight in Rio, and also won a world 
amateur title this year. Next up: Adams will guest-edit Radio 4’s Today 
programme next week.

Time to introduce the first contender: Adam Peaty, who got Team GB’s party 
started in Rio, winning their first gold medal in thunderous fashion – beating 
his own world record in the 100m breaststroke final. It was also the first gold 
for a British male swimmer since 1988. Well worth staying up until 3am for, and 
not bad for a guy who grew up scared of water.

The three amigos are now running through how to vote. It would be remiss of me 
not to point youover here 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/sports-personality/38135745>, where you can place a 
vote for free. There are clearly a lot of Leicester fans in the house – every 
mention of nominee Jamie Vardy and his fabulous Foxes is getting a big old 
cheer.

We open with a montage – the first, I’ll wager, of many – with Birmingham’s 
own Laura Mvula providing the soundtrack, performing ‘Feeling Good’. Usain Bolt 
pops up on a VT to introduce “the three amigos” – Gabby Logan, Clare Balding 
and Gary Lineker.

Gary Lineker will be getting the show started in Birmingham imminently. Last 
year, he cut his finger on the trophy, and has since presented a live TV show 
in his pants, so it can only get better.

What’s coming up tonight? The main award will close the night (unless there’s 
a spectacular break from tradition), with a selection of other gongs to be 
handed out:

Coach of the year: England’s Eddie Jones and Leicester’s Claudio Ranieri are 
among the favourites.

Team of the year: Likewise, England’s unbeaten rugby union side and 
Leicester’s title winners are in contention here, but I fancy it’ll go to Team 
GB’s gold medal winning women’s hockey team.

Young sports personality: This one has already been announced, with Paralympic 
gold medallistEllie Robinson a deserving winner.

Overseas personality: Usain Bolt v Cristiano Ronaldo.

There’s also the Helen Rollason award for achievement in the face of 
adversity, and a lifetime achievement award forMichael Phelps, the swimmer with 
23 Olympic gold medals and no room in his house for more awards.

Who will win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year team award?

In an Olympic year, I’d like to nominate pole vaulter Thiago Braz da Silva, 
who won a home gold medal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/brazilthiago-braz-da-silva-elevated-to-national-hero-status-after-pole-vault-gold>
 after an epic duel with favourite Renaud Lavillenie, armed with nothing but 
grit, inspiration and a giant wobbly pole. It was a shame that Lavilleniemade 
it about booing fans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/brazil-fans-olympic-stadium-pole-vault-booing-rio-2016>
, intimidated by the 12 hopeful Brazilians who had stayed behind to watch the 
day’s final event.

Preamble

2016: it was, within the specific field of British sporting prowess, a very 
good year.

After 12 months of success headlined by unprecedented Olympic and Paralympic 
gold medal hauls, 13 Rio winners join the Masters golf champion and winners of 
the Premier and Champions League on a glittering feature-length shortlist.

There are several absentees who, in leaner years, could have won the whole 
thing. Jessica Ennis Hill, Anthony Joshua, Jo Konta, Lewis Hamilton, Alastair 
Cook, Maro Itoje and Tour de France winner Chris Froome all failed to make the 
cut for an award that’s been won by Greg Rusedski and Zara Phillips.


Despite the packed field, one name stands above the rest; Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> is the odds-on favourite to win 
his third award, and add another little piece of history to a year where he 
defended his Olympic title, won Wimbledon and overtook Novak Djokovic to become 
the world No1.

The main award is announced at around 8.50pm. Before the moment of truth, 
there’s time to ease into those jogging bottoms, crack open the Celebrations 
and relive Britain’s greatest ever sporting year.

That’s all from me. Congratulations to Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray>, who has chalked up another 
piece of history with his third SPOTY crown after rising to the top of the 
tennis world. One of the few prizes left for him to sew up is the title of 
Britain’s greatest ever athlete.

It was also a good night for runners-up Alistair Brownlee and Nick Skelton, 
while away from the Olympics, Leicester City took home team and coach of the 
year for their fairytale Premier League success. Thanks for joining me. 
Goodnight.

Team of the Year: Leicester City

Coach of the Year: Claudio Ranieri

Helen Rollason Award: Ben Smith

Unsung Hero Award: Marcellus Baz

Lifetime Achievement Award: Michael Phelps
 
Murray picks up the award from Lennox Lewis poolside in Miami, and his speech 
is another low-key, bone-dry masterpiece:

“I’d like to thank everyone who voted, I really appreciate your support. And 
I’d like to thank my team, they make a lot of sacrifices for me, they’re away 
from their family at times of the year like this.

“Also I’d like to thank my family. I think my mum is in the crowd there, my 
dad as well, he just got married 10 days ago, I miss you guys. I’d like to say 
a huge thanks to my wife and my daughter, who won’t know what this means yet, 
but maybe in a few years she will. Actually, I’ve got a bone to pick with my 
wife because about an hour ago she told me she’d voted for Nick Skelton. Not 
smart from her with Christmas coming up.

“It’s been a great year for British sport and I am so proud to have been a 
part of it.”
 
He becomes the first player to win the award three times, completing a stellar 
year in style.
 
The triathlete is the second Rio 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rio-2016> gold medallist on the podium. I 
predict a third...
 
As the bookies predicted, equestrian and Rio gold medallist Skelton comes home 
in third place.
 
Before the main award is announced, there will be a moment to remember those 
lost to the sporting world this year, beginning with Muhammad Ali and Johan 
Cruyff, both among the greatest athletes who ever lived.

Team of the year! Has this ever been more closely fought? England’s rugby 
union team. Wales’ football team. The British women’s hockey team. Team GB. 
ParalympicsGB. Leicester, for god’s sake.

The award goes to... Leicester City! I had a feeling the hockey team would 
sneak it, but it’s hard to argue. 5000-1, an unrepeatable, unbelievable triumph.
 
Phelps is here, and receives his award from Ian Thorpe and Prince William, the 
Duke of Cambridge. A balanced relay team, there.

“My career started with a dream to win an Olympic medal” says Phelps. “I had a 
lot of memorable races in my career, but to be able to retire the way I wanted 
to has been the dream. It’s an honour to stand in front of these athletes, the 
goals and dreams they have, and not giving up. Thank you, this means absolutely 
the world.”
 
Staying with American Olympic superheroes, it’s time for the lifetime award. 
It’s going toMichael Phelps, the man with the wingspan of a light aircraft, and 
the gold medal haul of an Eastern bloc country.

 to win five golds in Rio, taking his lifetime total to 23. It’s hard to see 
that ever being matched. All in all, a better year than Ryan Lochte.

Two hours in, and we’ve given up on sensible segues – lurching from a round-up 
of England’s unbeaten year under Eddie Jones, to an Olympic montage, featuring 
Bolt, Phelps, Van Niekerk, Neymar, the Fiji sevens team – all your favourites.
 
Up next: Robbie Williams – not the former Barnsley and Stockport stalwart, but 
the popular singer. What did our Olympic heroes do to deserve this?
Owen Gibson (@owen_g) 
Can only assume Robbie Williams is contractually obliged to appear on every BBC

We’re into the home straight now – the US win the Ryder Cup, Wigan take the 
Super League, Bangladesh beat England for the first time in a Test, and Chicago 
is rocked by the Cubs, and the Irish, in the same week. Nico Rosberg wins the 
F1 title, then retires. And finally: Anthony Joshua, the heavyweight champion 
who, unlike Tyson Fury, didn’t merit a nomination.
 
The Helen Rollason award goes to Ben Smith. Bullied as a teenager, he helped 
to raise money for anti-bullying charities by running 401 marathons in 401 
days. An extraordinary achievement.

“I found running as my sanctuary, to be who I was, and not have to lie 
anymore” says Smith. “It gave me back my confidence and self-esteem, but most 
importantly, I’m not afraid any more”.

So we’ve had the entire British women’s team, and the whole Leicester City 
squad, out on the stage – but no team of the year prize yet. Is this Aston 
Villa’s year?

Voting for the main award is now open, by the way. You can vote via the BBC 
website <http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/sports-personality/38135745>, but hurry 
back.
 
Time for the final contender: Kate Richardson-Walsh, captain of the British 
women’s hockey team, who won gold against the odds in Rio. Kate’s wife Helen 
scored the winning penalty in a shootout against the Netherlands, before the 
captain ended her career on the ultimate high. She’s the first ever hockey 
player (field or ice) to get a SPOTY nomination.

Here’s Simon McMahon:

“If (when) Murray wins, you can bet his acceptance speech will be as low key 
and laid back as the one just shown. Andy doesn’t do exaggeration or hype. 
That’s why I love him. Britain’s greatest ever sportsperson ...?”

A recent poll gave Murray that accolade, and was met with widespread derision. 
I find it baffling; Murray is in the conversation, at the very least.
 
A man in an Iceland shirt is banging a big drum, coercing the crowd into an 
awkward ‘Viking thunderclap’. That means one thing – time for aEuro 2016 
look-back. England are wisely sidestepped, with Tom Jones talking us through a 
Wales-centric montage.

Gareth Bale is nominated for the award, having also won the Champions League 
this year, although for me, Hal Robson-Kanu should be handed the trophy 
outright forthat goal against Belgium. Portugal won the whole thing, of course 
– the 87th biggest surprise of 2016.

 And the Open, won by Henrik Stenson after a brilliant battle with Phil 
Mickelson. England v Pakistan, Hull FC won the Challenge Cup, and Argentina 
ended Great Britain’s Davis Cup unbeaten run. Thanks for nothing, Andy.
 
Also nominated from the equestrian world is Paralympic gold medallist Sophie 
Christiansen. She won three gold medals in Rio, bringing her career total to 10 
golds. When she’s not piling up medals, Christiansen works as a statistical 
analyst for Goldman Sachs.
 
Next up, Nick Skelton, whose long equestrian career looked over in 2000, when 
he broke his neck in a fall. 16 years later, he won a six-way jump-off to claim 
Olympic gold at the age of 58. He’s an outside bet for a podium place later on.
Fun fact: Skelton and his children learned to ride on the same pony – Oxo, who 
lived to the age of 39.Fun fact two: Skelton’s autobiography is called Only 
Falls and Horses.

Murray’s 2016 started badly (by his standards), with defeats to Novak Djokovic 
in Paris and Melbourne. Then Sam Querrey dumped Djokovic out of Wimbledon, and 
Murray grasped the nettle – winning a second Wimbledon (and third Grand Slam), 
defending his Olympic title and then, most remarkable of all, becoming the 
world No1 after an astonishing run of form.

He’s not in Birmingham – he’s over in Miami for training, with Lennox Lewis 
hopefullynowhere to be seen 
<http://www.digitalspy.com/fun/news/a445603/andy-murray-lennox-lewis-in-sports-personality-award-goof-video/>
. He’s quick to praise Jo Konta, Gordon Reid, and his brother Jamie, and point 
to an all-round great year for tennis.

Can he dominate tennis in the coming years? “I don’t know about that – I’m not 
getting any younger, and there are a lot of young guys coming through.” Never 
knowingly overstated, but maybe he’s keeping his powder dry for the winner’s 
speech.
 
Now we relive Chris Froome’s imperious Tour de France victory, a historic 
triumph for which he was not even nominated. Moving swiftly on, time to talk
Andy Murray...
 
Eddie Izzard takes to the stage, alongside tireless Hillsborough campaigner 
Margaret Aspinall, to introduce the Unsung Hero award. Fifteen volunteer 
coaches from Britain’s nations and regions were nominated for the prize, with
Marcellus Baz, coach at the Nottingham School of Boxing, announced as the 
winner.
 
The Annual Montage, part two: Highlights include Alistair Cook getting to 
10,000 runs, ring titles for Michael Bisping and Tony Bellew, and Alan Pardew’s 
dance.
 
Cox: “Sport saved my life... it kept me going, kept me driven. It helped me 
forget the situation I was in, the times I was up all night with spasms.”
Storey: “Swimming led me to cycling, and the dedication I needed then helped 
me. It was four years ago that I announced I was pregnant – don’t worry, I’m 
not doing that tonight – and I realised after winning at the worlds that Rio 
was on.”

It’s unlikely, but I’d be delighted to see either of those two on the podium 
later.
 
The focus is now on Cox and Storey, two of the most extraordinary athletes on 
this, or any shortlist. Cox won golds and set two world records in two sports – 
athletics and cycling – just two years after a stroke led to a diagnosis of MS.

Storey, meanwhile, is nothing less than a gold medal machine – two golds in 
Rio made her Britain’s greatest female Paralympian, with 14 golds across five 
different Games.

Now we’re headlong into another montage, this time for the Paralympic Games, 
where Britain came second in the medal table with 64 golds. Three winners are 
nominated for tonight’s main award –Sarah Storey, Sophie Christiansen and 
Kadeena Cox – while 15-year-old swimmer Ellie Robinson has won the Young Sports 
Personality award.
 
Next nominee (they’re racing through them) – it’s Mo Farah, double-double 
Olympic gold medallist and conqueror of the Cube. It’s not all been plain 
sailing off the track for Farah, but his 10,000m triumph after falling was one 
of the year’s most gripping moments. He’s in Dubai, a reflection of his 66-1 
odds, which is faintly ridiculous given what he’s achieved. He is Britain’s 
most successful track and field athlete of all time.
 
Jessica Ennis-Hill gets a special mention, after her 2011 world championship 
silver was upgraded to gold after Tatyana Chernova wasfound guilty of doping 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/29/jessica-ennis-hill-2011-gold-medal-chernova>
. Weird thing to draw attention to, if I’m honest.

Claudio Ranieri is coach of the year! They rather snuck that one on us, 
mid-interview with Ranieri, who looks close to tears.

“I didn’t expect this, it’s fantastic. I can only say thank you again to my 
players, my chairman, all my staff – but without our fans, it wasn’t possible.”

When did he think Leicester could win the league? “When Hazard scored”, but 
adds, “when it took Arsenal 95 minutes to beat us, I thought maybe we can do 
something special”.
 
Does anyone else still wake with a start at 3am, and remember that Leicester 
City won the Premier League? No? Just me? We’re now enjoying a feature-length 
montage of their miracle success, culminating inJamie Vardy’s ultimate house 
party when they clinched the title.

Vardy, in contention for the main individual award, but is quick to point out 
“I couldn’t have done any of it without the boys behind me”. Can they win the 
Champions League, asks Lineker. “Stranger things have happened.” Indeed they 
have.

The Kennys are on stage now. Jason has a nice line in dry humour: “I didn’t 
know how many keirin experts were out there,” while Laura talks about her pride 
at being part of so much female success this year. There’s a slightly risqué 
magazine shot on the screen behind them that sends them into embarrassed 
giggles. And now,the year in snooker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/28/ronnie-osullivan-snooker-bbc-spoty-insult>
.
 
Next up, it’s a pair that Balding introduces as “the king and queen of the 
velodrome” – it’s Shane Sutton and  Jason and Laura Kenny. The cameras visit 
them at home, in a bit of VT that’s unbearably twee, before going over their 
Rio achievements.

They won five Olympic gold medals and three World golds between them this 
year. If it were an independent republic, the Kenny household would have 
finished 19th in theRio 2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rio-2016> medal 
table, above Canada and New Zealand.
 
Willett and Brownlee out on the stage now, with the latter getting a big round 
of applause from his fellow athletes. What did Brownlee say to his brother 
Jonny as he hauled him over the line in Mexico? “You effing idiot” is the gist.
Alistair Brownlee gives up chance to win race and helps brother Jonny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/19/alistair-brownlee-gives-chance-win-helps-brother-jonny-video> 
Next, the second favourite for the award, and the first triathlete to ever be 
nominated. It’sAlistair Brownlee, who added triathlon gold in Rio to his 
victory in London with a dominant performance, before helping his brother Jonny 
over the finish line at an event in Mexico, destined to be forever 
misremembered as the Olympic race itself.

Poor overlooked Justin Rose provides a neat segue from Olympics to golf, and 
Danny Willett, who won the Masters from nowhere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/11/masters-2016-danny-willett-thanks-fate-for-help-in-unlikely-victory>
 in April. Willett thought he would miss the Masters with his wife due to give 
birth – but his son arrived early and he travelled to Augusta, held his nerve 
as Jordan Spieth collapsed, and ended a 20-year wait for a British green jacket.
 
Time for a montage from the start of the year: Jo Konta’s Australian Open run, 
Peyton Manning wins the Super Bowl, Gary Anderson defends his PDC darts title, 
and Ross County win a League Cup they’vealready had to hand over 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/27/aberdeen-celtic-scottish-league-cup-final-report>
 to Celtic.
 
Whitlock: “It’s crazy, really exciting... where we are today, we could never 
have imagined this ten years ago. I believe success breeds success, so I hope I 
can inspire the next generation”

He says that he got a standing ovation outside a restaurant, which was 
“unheard of for a gymnast”. Don’t they get one every time they nail a big 
landing?
 
Here’s a third Olympian, Max Whitlock – putting Peaty and Adams to shame by 
doing his sport live on stage. Hard as it is to weigh up the scale of each 
Olympic, and Paralympic, achievement, I think Whitlock should be shorter than 
100-1 for this award – he ended a 116-year wait for a British gymnastic gold, 
then got another two hours later.
 
Peaty and Adams take the stage together. Here’s a few words from both:

Peaty: “How did I do it? Just swim two lengths. It’s as simple as that... I’m 
massively proud to be British, and I was so happy to get the first gold.”

Adams: “It was a lot harder defending the title, and everyone wants to be an 
Olympic champion. It was tough, but I got the job done!”

 
Moving swiftly on (there are a lot of Olympians to get through), it’s boxer 
Nicola Adams.She became the first British boxer to retain an Olympic title 
after winning gold in the women’s flyweight in Rio, and also won a world 
amateur title this year. Next up: Adams will guest-edit Radio 4’s Today 
programme next week.

Time to introduce the first contender: Adam Peaty, who got Team GB’s party 
started in Rio, winning their first gold medal in thunderous fashion – beating 
his own world record in the 100m breaststroke final. It was also the first gold 
for a British male swimmer since 1988. Well worth staying up until 3am for, and 
not bad for a guy who grew up scared of water.

The three amigos are now running through how to vote. It would be remiss of me 
not to point youover here 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/sports-personality/38135745>, where you can place a 
vote for free. There are clearly a lot of Leicester fans in the house – every 
mention of nominee Jamie Vardy and his fabulous Foxes is getting a big old 
cheer.
 
We open with a montage – the first, I’ll wager, of many – with Birmingham’s 
own Laura Mvula providing the soundtrack, performing ‘Feeling Good’. Usain Bolt 
pops up on a VT to introduce “the three amigos” – Gabby Logan, Clare Balding 
and Gary Lineker.
 
Gary Lineker will be getting the show started in Birmingham imminently. Last 
year, he cut his finger on the trophy, and has since presented a live TV show 
in his pants, so it can only get better.
 
What’s coming up tonight? The main award will close the night (unless there’s 
a spectacular break from tradition), with a selection of other gongs to be 
handed out:

Coach of the year: England’s Eddie Jones and Leicester’s Claudio Ranieri are 
among the favourites.

Team of the year: Likewise, England’s unbeaten rugby union side and 
Leicester’s title winners are in contention here, but I fancy it’ll go to Team 
GB’s gold medal winning women’s hockey team.

Young sports personality: This one has already been announced, with Paralympic 
gold medallistEllie Robinson a deserving winner.

Overseas personality: Usain Bolt v Cristiano Ronaldo.

There’s also the Helen Rollason award for achievement in the face of 
adversity, and a lifetime achievement award forMichael Phelps, the swimmer with 
23 Olympic gold medals and no room in his house for more awards.

Now, the ceremony doesn’t get under way on TV for 20 minutes yet, so rather 
than live blogging Countryfile, I’m asking foryour highlights of the sporting 
year. Here’s John McEnerney:

In an Olympic year, I’d like to nominate pole vaulter Thiago Braz da Silva, 
who won a home gold medal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/16/brazilthiago-braz-da-silva-elevated-to-national-hero-status-after-pole-vault-gold>

grit, inspiration and a giant wobbly pole. It was a shame that Lavilleniemade 
it about booing fans

2016: it was, within the specific field of British sporting prowess, a very 
good year.

After 12 months of success headlined by unprecedented Olympic and Paralympic 
gold medal hauls, 13 Rio winners join the Masters golf champion and winners of 
the Premier and Champions League on a glittering feature-length shortlist.

There are several absentees who, in leaner years, could have won the whole 
thing. Jessica Ennis Hill, Anthony Joshua, Jo Konta, Lewis Hamilton, Alastair 
Cook, Maro Itoje and Tour de France winner Chris Froome all failed to make the 
cut for an award that’s been won by Greg Rusedski and Zara Phillips.


Despite the packed field, one name stands above the rest; Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> is the odds-on favourite to win 
his third award, and add another little piece of history to a year where he 
defended his Olympic title, won Wimbledon and overtook Novak Djokovic to become 
the world No1.

The main award is announced at around 8.50pm. Before the moment of truth, 
there’s time to ease into those jogging bottoms, crack open the Celebrations 
and relive Britain’s greatest ever sporting year.
