As ever for the British Summer Time shows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/british-summer-time-festival>, how near you 
get to stand to the stage depends on how much you are willing to pay. General 
admission costs £79.50, with various tiers of tickets, including gold circle 
for £149.50, diamond view for £399.50, and £699 for “ultimate bar”, which 
perhaps enables you to buy something other than plastic bottles of lager.

Tickets for the five Royal Albert Hall shows, between 4 and 9 June, sold out 
in 15 seconds.

“I thought I would retire quietly,” Collins said when he announced his 
comeback. “But thanks to the fans, my family and support from some 
extraordinary artists, I have rediscovered my passion for music and performing. 
It’s time to do it all again, and I’m excited. It just feels right.”

Phil Collins returns: ‘I got letters from nurses saying, “That’s it, I’m not 
buying your records”’
