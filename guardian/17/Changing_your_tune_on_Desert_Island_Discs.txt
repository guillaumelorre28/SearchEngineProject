Stephen Moss isn’t the first to raise the point about Elisabeth Schwarzkopf 
choosing seven of her own recordings for Desert Island Discs, nor of Moura 
Lympany choosing all eight (The key moments of Desert Island Discs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/06/desert-island-discs-75-defining-moments-from-75-years-castaways>
, 7 January). There was the suspicion that Schwarzkopf misunderstood what was 
expected. Arguments will no doubt continue. As for Moura Lympany, she said that 
she found she was choosing pretty much the same records as for her first 
appearance, so, to make a change, about the only one available to her, she 
chose records of her own performances. I always thought that second appearances 
on the programme were rather pointless. At least for musicians such as Lympany, 
there was the opportunity for an alternative selection.

• If memory serves, the (joint?) record holder for a guest choosing their own 
records is John Lee Hooker: all eight.

• Elisabeth Schwarzkopf may have chosen seven of her own records when 
putatively stranded, but at least they were good. When Norman Wisdom appeared 
on the programme in 2000, five out of eight of his choices were his own, 
including his favourite one. I can’t imagine a more efficient way of turning 
a paradisal island into hell.

• Stephen Moss omitted one unforgettable interview from his review of 75 years 
ofDesert Island Discs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/desert-island-discs>. It would 
require a heart of ice not to have been moved by Dr David Nott’s recollections 
in June last year of carrying out life-saving surgery under rocket fire and 
while bombs were dropping around him in various war zones, from Sarajevo to 
Aleppo. Dr Nott came across as a remarkable individual not just because of his 
courage and humanitarianism but for his manifest modesty and humility. He has 
received a number of honours including an OBE but I wondered at the time why he 
had not been knighted. I still do.
