And here is some reaction to Theresa May’s interview.

From the Lib Dem leader Tim Farron

Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has confirmed 
she is taking us towards a disastrous hard Brexit that will leave our country 
poorer and more divided.

Reckless plans to leave the single market would deal a huge blow to jobs, 
investment and the public finances, meaning less funding for services like the 
overstretched NHS.

From Richard Tice, co-chair of Leave Means Leave

We welcome the Prime Minister’s commitment to taking back control of Britain’s 
borders therefore ending preferential treatment for EU citizens.

She is right that issues of trade and immigration are not binary because when 
Britain leaves the single market and the customs union, though freedom of 
movement will cease, Britain’s ability to trade with the EU and access the 
single market will continue.

And that’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Here is some Labour reaction to the Theresa May

From Yvette Cooper, the Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>

Yvette Cooper (@YvetteCooperMP) 
V unwise of TMay to try to dismiss crisis in NHS - doesn't get what's 
happening in hospitals, with staff shortages & big social care cuts

From Labour MP Chris Bryant (a former vicar himself)
Chris Bryant MP (@RhonddaBryant) 
Every time May speaks the chasm between her words and actions grows wider. 
Like listening to a nice but ineffectual vicar.

leave because anything else is too complex.

Theresa May's interview - Verdict from the Twitter commentariat

This is what journalists and commentators are saying about Theresa May’s 
interview on Twitter. People are generally quite impressed by Sophy Ridge, but 
not so much by May herself.

From the Observer’s Toby Helm
Toby Helm (@tobyhelm) 
Sophy Ridge pressing May hard but it is like getting blood out of a stone. 
Harder in fact.

Is it just me or is May struggling in this @RidgeOnSunday

What this interview shows is that whatever May's aspiration for setting out 
wider agenda, it won't happen till she gives Brexit clarity.

Theresa May's Sophy Ridge interview - Snap verdict and summary

It is always a coup getting an interview with the prime minister, but it is 
not always a blessing. Theresa May is famously unilluminating as an interviewee 
and she is fast acquiring a reputation as the hardest prime minister to 
interview since Clement Attlee. In the circumstances Sophy Ridge did a pretty 
good job. She was polite but firm, pressing May repeatedly on immigration 
versus the single market, and it was good to see her challenge May over Donald 
Trump’s comment about grabbing women by the pussy.Andrew Marr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr> or Robert Peston might have 
drawn the line at that one.

But even genitalia-speak did not get May to open up much. There were no news 
scoops in the interview, but a few lines of some interest. Here is a summary.

 * May rejected claims that her government was “muddled” over Brexit. 
 * She implicitly criticised David Cameron’s government for not making any 
preparations for Brexit. 
 * She implied that EU leaders would find it in their interests to give the UK 
tariff-free access to the single market, without forcing the UK to accept free 
movement. May has always implied that in the Brexit talks getting full control 
over immigration will take precedence over single market membership (which 
would require accepting free movement) and she implied that again today. But, 
despite being pressed, she refused to confirm this explicity. She said: 
Often people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the EU but we still 
want to kind of keep bits of membership of the EU. We are leaving. We are 
coming out. We are not going to be a member of the EU any longer. So the 
question is what is the right relationship for the UK to have with theEuropean 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> when we are outside. We will be 
able to have control of our borders, control of our laws.

But May also said that it would be wrong to look at this as a “zero sum game” 
and that what was best for the UK would be best for the EU too.

Anybody who looks at this question of free movement and trade as a sort of 
zero sum game is approaching it in the wrong way. I’m ambitious for what we can 
get for the UK in terms of our relationship with the European Union because I 
also think that’s going to be good for the European Union. Our thinking on this 
isn’t muddled at all.

That implies that she thinks the EU will grant the EU tariff-free access to 
the single market because it will be in the interests of both parties, even if 
the UK does not accept free movement. (This is also known as the ‘have cake and 
eat it’ position.)

 * She said that addressing the stigma around mental health was more important 
than just spending more money on improving mental health services.She will 
speak about mental health in a speech tomorrow. But here plans would also 
involve some extra money, she said. 
Money is going into mental health. But it is always wrong for people to assume 
that the only answer to these issues is about funding. Yes, there [are] some 
issues there and we have been looking at those and addressing those. But 
actually if we look at the issue of mental health in this country, I think it’s 
more about the stigma that still attaches to mental health.

 * She rejected the British Red Cross’s claim that there is a “humanitarian 
crisis” in the NHS. “I don’t accept the description the Red Cross has made of 
this,” she said. Asked about the problems in the NHS, she said:

There are pressures in the NHS, we see those pressures. We have an ageing 
population, this brings pressures, particularly in the interface between the 
health service and social care.

We have taken some immediate steps in relation to that issue but we are also 
looking to ensure best practice in the NHS and looking for a long-term solution 
to what has been a problem that has been ducked by government over the years.

The NHS is facing the pressures of the ageing population, that is why it is 
important that it is the NHS that has produced its five-year plan and is now 
putting that plan into practice.

 * She implied she would not be making a Commons statement on the NHS 
tomorrow, as Jeremy Corbyn has demanded. 
 * She said that Donald Trump’s comments about grabbing women by the pussy 
were “unacceptable”.When asked how Trump’s comment made her feel, she replied. 
I think that’s unacceptable and in fact Donald Trump himself has said that and 
has apologised for it.

 * She said her call for a “shared society” was about recognising that there 
is a role for government in addressing social problems. 
 * She said that from the conversations she had had she thought the US would 
remain committed to Nato under Trump.

Q: Donald Trump tweeted last night that he was looking forward to meeting you. 
But how do you feel about him? He talked about grabbing women by the pussy.

May says that is unacceptable. Trump himself said that was unacceptable, and 
apologised for it, she says. But the relationship between the UK and the US is 
not just about leaders. She has had two positive conversations with Trump.

Q: So does pragmatism trump principle?

May says she is talking about a relationship that goes beyond individuals. 
Both countries can benefit if they build on relations.

And that’s it. 

I will post a summary and reaction shortly.

UPDATE: I’ve corrected the second paragraph above because the original version 
implied that May was describing Trump’s language as unacceptable, not 
necessarily his behaviour. I was paraphrasing what she was saying as she spoke 
and inserted the word “language”, wrongly giving that impression. In fact, when 
asked how Trump’s comment made her feel, she replied:

I think that’s unacceptable and in fact Donald Trump himself has said that and 
has apologised for it.

Q: Would the UK come to the aid of a Nato country invaded by Russia.

May says article 5 says Nato countries do treat that as a joint attack.

Q: So the answer is yes.

May says people are wrong to think that the US will weaken its support for 
Nato under Trump.

May says addressing “stigma” around mental health more important than just 
increasing spending on services

Q: What does your plan for a “shared society” mean?

May says this is about recognising there is a role for government.

She will talk about mental health tomorrow. We must get over the stigma around 
this. If you break your arm and go into work, people will sympathise. If you 
have a mental health condition, people won’t want to talk about it.

Q: Is there extra money going into it?

May says there will be extra money. An extra £1bn has already been set aside 
for this.

She says, as home secretary, she took steps to reduce by 80% the number of 
people with mental health conditions being held in police cells.

Q: So how much more money is going in?

May says more money is going in.

But it is wrong to assume this is just about money. Addressing the stigma 
problem is more important, she says. She says one in four people will develop a 
mental health condition.

And here is some reaction to Theresa May’s interview.

From the Lib Dem leader Tim Farron

Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> has confirmed 
she is taking us towards a disastrous hard Brexit that will leave our country 
poorer and more divided.

Reckless plans to leave the single market would deal a huge blow to jobs, 
investment and the public finances, meaning less funding for services like the 
overstretched NHS.

From Richard Tice, co-chair of Leave Means Leave

We welcome the Prime Minister’s commitment to taking back control of Britain’s 
borders therefore ending preferential treatment for EU citizens.

She is right that issues of trade and immigration are not binary because when 
Britain leaves the single market and the customs union, though freedom of 
movement will cease, Britain’s ability to trade with the EU and access the 
single market will continue.

And that’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

This is what journalists and commentators are saying about Theresa May’s

not so much by May herself.

It is always a coup getting an interview with the prime minister, but it is 
not always a blessing. Theresa May is famously unilluminating as an interviewee 
and she is fast acquiring a reputation as the hardest prime minister to 
interview since Clement Attlee. In the circumstances Sophy Ridge did a pretty 
good job. She was polite but firm, pressing May repeatedly on immigration 
versus the single market, and it was good to see her challenge May over Donald 
Trump’s comment about grabbing women by the pussy.Andrew Marr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr> or Robert Peston might have 
drawn the line at that one.

But even genitalia-speak did not get May to open up much. There were no news 
scoops in the interview, but a few lines of some interest. Here is a summary.

 * May rejected claims that her government was “muddled” over Brexit. 
 * She implicitly criticised David Cameron’s government for not making any 
preparations for Brexit. 
 * She implied that EU leaders would find it in their interests to give the UK 
tariff-free access to the single market, without forcing the UK to accept free 
movement. May has always implied that in the Brexit talks getting full control 
over immigration will take precedence over single market membership (which 
would require accepting free movement) and she implied that again today. But, 
despite being pressed, she refused to confirm this explicity. She said: 
Often people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the EU but we still 
want to kind of keep bits of membership of the EU. We are leaving. We are 
coming out. We are not going to be a member of the EU any longer. So the 
question is what is the right relationship for the UK to have with theEuropean 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> when we are outside. We will be 
able to have control of our borders, control of our laws.

But May also said that it would be wrong to look at this as a “zero sum game” 
and that what was best for the UK would be best for the EU too.

Anybody who looks at this question of free movement and trade as a sort of 
zero sum game is approaching it in the wrong way. I’m ambitious for what we can 
get for the UK in terms of our relationship with the European Union because I 
also think that’s going to be good for the European Union. Our thinking on this 
isn’t muddled at all.

That implies that she thinks the EU will grant the EU tariff-free access to 
the single market because it will be in the interests of both parties, even if 
the UK does not accept free movement. (This is also known as the ‘have cake and 
eat it’ position.)

 * She said that addressing the stigma around mental health was more important 
than just spending more money on improving mental health services.She will 
speak about mental health in a speech tomorrow. But here plans would also 
involve some extra money, she said. 
Money is going into mental health. But it is always wrong for people to assume 
that the only answer to these issues is about funding. Yes, there [are] some 
issues there and we have been looking at those and addressing those. But 
actually if we look at the issue of mental health in this country, I think it’s 
more about the stigma that still attaches to mental health.

 * She rejected the British Red Cross’s claim that there is a “humanitarian 
crisis” in the NHS. “I don’t accept the description the Red Cross has made of 
this,” she said. Asked about the problems in the NHS, she said:

There are pressures in the NHS, we see those pressures. We have an ageing 
population, this brings pressures, particularly in the interface between the 
health service and social care.

We have taken some immediate steps in relation to that issue but we are also 
looking to ensure best practice in the NHS and looking for a long-term solution 
to what has been a problem that has been ducked by government over the years.

The NHS is facing the pressures of the ageing population, that is why it is 
important that it is the NHS that has produced its five-year plan and is now 
putting that plan into practice.

 * She implied she would not be making a Commons statement on the NHS 
tomorrow, as Jeremy Corbyn has demanded. 
 * She said that Donald Trump’s comments about grabbing women by the pussy 
were “unacceptable”.When asked how Trump’s comment made her feel, she replied. 
I think that’s unacceptable and in fact Donald Trump himself has said that and 
has apologised for it.

 * She said her call for a “shared society” was about recognising that there 
is a role for government in addressing social problems. 
 * She said that from the conversations she had had she thought the US would 
remain committed to Nato under Trump.  
Q: Donald Trump tweeted last night that he was looking forward to meeting you. 
But how do you feel about him? He talked about grabbing women by the pussy.

May says that is unacceptable. Trump himself said that was unacceptable, and 
apologised for it, she says. But the relationship between the UK and the US is 
not just about leaders. She has had two positive conversations with Trump.

Q: So does pragmatism trump principle?

May says she is talking about a relationship that goes beyond individuals. 
Both countries can benefit if they build on relations.

And that’s it. 

I will post a summary and reaction shortly.

UPDATE: I’ve corrected the second paragraph above because the original version 
implied that May was describing Trump’s language as unacceptable, not 
necessarily his behaviour. I was paraphrasing what she was saying as she spoke 
and inserted the word “language”, wrongly giving that impression. In fact, when 
asked how Trump’s comment made her feel, she replied:

I think that’s unacceptable and in fact Donald Trump himself has said that and 
has apologised for it.
 
Q: Would the UK come to the aid of a Nato country invaded by Russia.

May says article 5 says Nato countries do treat that as a joint attack.

Q: So the answer is yes.

May says people are wrong to think that the US will weaken its support for 
Nato under Trump.
 
Q: What does your plan for a “shared society” mean?

May says this is about recognising there is a role for government.

She will talk about mental health tomorrow. We must get over the stigma around 
this. If you break your arm and go into work, people will sympathise. If you 
have a mental health condition, people won’t want to talk about it.

Q: Is there extra money going into it?

May says there will be extra money. An extra £1bn has already been set aside 
for this.

She says, as home secretary, she took steps to reduce by 80% the number of 
people with mental health conditions being held in police cells.

Q: So how much more money is going in?

May says more money is going in.

But it is wrong to assume this is just about money. Addressing the stigma 
problem is more important, she says. She says one in four people will develop a 
mental health condition.

 * May says addressing “stigma” around mental health more important than just 
increasing spending on services.  
Q: Things look pretty bad for the NHS. What are you going to do?

May says she does not accept the Red Cross’s claim there is a “humanitarian 
crisis”.

 * May says she does not accept the Red Cross’s claim there is a “humanitarian 
crisis”. 
She pays tribute to the work of NHS staff.

But the government has put more money in.

Q: So you won’t be making a Commons statement tomorrow?

May says the NHS is facing problems with an ageing population. That is why the 
NHS has developed a plan. It is putting it into practice.
