This week EU fisheries ministers meet to decide the north-east Atlantic 
fishing quotas for 2017 at their annual December conference. Let’s hope our 
minister, George Eustice, does not repeat his performance of last year, when – 
in the face of a desperate need to end overfishing – he acquired for the UK a 
2016 quota that exceeded scientific advice by more than any other EU country 
and proclaimed this as a good deal. Overfishing is “a good deal” only for the 
short-term interests of the smallest but wealthiest sector of the fishing 
industry, whose mega-trawlers hoover up the stocks, destroy their habitats and 
exacerbate their chronic over-exploitation. It is to be hoped that Eustice will 
also conform to another requirement of the common fisheries policy – the 
provision of a greater share of the quota to the small, under 10-metre, boats 
that constitute the largest part of the fleet, fish more sustainably, employ 
more fishermen, provide real benefits for their communities and enhance their 
prospects of both survival and a renewed prosperity. While representing about 
80% of the Welsh and English fleet, they have just 6% of the quota.
