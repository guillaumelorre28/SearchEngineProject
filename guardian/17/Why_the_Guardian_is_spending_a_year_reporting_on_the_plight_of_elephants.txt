Welcome to the elephant conservation hub. Over the next year, with the support 
ofVulcan <http://www.vulcan.com/>, Guardian journalists will be taking a closer 
look at the situation of elephant herds around the world.

Elephant conservation has been a particular focus for Vulcan, a private 
company set up by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen to look for solutions to 
problems like endangered species, climate change and ocean health. The future 
of this particular species is precariously balanced. Although in some areas (a 
very few) elephant herds are expanding and thriving, the overall picture is one 
of decline, with falls ofas much as 60%

 in elephant population in countries such as Tanzania.

With your help, we want to probe some of the different factors that have led 
us here. We’ve opened with an essay from wildlife specialistPatrick Barkham

, looking at the awe-inspiring lineage of the modern elephant, and asummary

 of the current situation.

We’ve sent one of our writers to Kenya to meet the elephants, and some of the 
people who seek to look after them, just as news breaks that elephant numbers 
are dramatically down.

In the months to come we’ll be looking at this species in close detail - both 
past and future. How can we conserve that future? What really works? What 
happens if you pull away a ‘keystone species’?

We’ll also be looking into the modern ivory trade. Who are the criminals 
behind these international networks? Where does the ivory go (not always where 
you’d think) and how does it get there? We’ll dig into the economics of 
different policy approaches, the people who make the big decisions, and the 
countries who have managed to change their ivory culture and cut demand.

Finally we’ll be talking to the people on the frontline in Africa, Asia and 
Europe; the rangers and investigators and campaigners, some of whom risk their 
lives regularly to protectLoxodonta africana and Elephas maximus. An inspiring 
network of conservationists from China, Africa, the US is at work on behalf of 
elephants, and other species, and is growing in strength and power. With your 
support we can make that global network stronger and more powerful still.
