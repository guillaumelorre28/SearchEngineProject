Leading foreign academics from the LSE acting as expert advisers to the UK 
government were told they would not be asked to contribute to government work 
and analysis on Brexit because they are not British nationals.

The news was met with outrage by many academics, while legal experts 
questioned whether it could be legal under anti-discrimination laws and senior 
politicians criticised it as bewildering.


“It is utterly baffling that the government is turning down expert, 
independent advice on Brexit simply because someone is from another country,” 
said Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrats’ EU spokesman.

“This is yet more evidence of the Conservatives’ alarming embrace of petty 
chauvinism over rational policymaking.”



Sara Hagemann, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics who 
specialises in EU policymaking processes, EU treaty matters, the role of 
national parliaments and the consequences of EU enlargements, said she had been 
told her services would not be required. Hagemann tweeted on Thursday:

Asked to clarify whether she was responding to speeches at the Conservative 
party conference 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/06/theresa-may-to-tell-tory-conference-that-mass-migration-threatens-uk-cohesion>
 pledging tough new immigration controls, Hagemann, who is Danish, said she had 
been informed specifically that she would not be contributing to any further 
government Brexit work.

It is understood up to nine LSE academics specialising in EU affairs have been 
briefing the Foreign Office on Brexit issues, but the school was informed by a 
senior FCO official that submissions from non-UK citizens would no longer be 
accepted.

The staff concerned were then made aware of the instruction in an email from 
the head of the LSE’s European Institute, Kevin Featherstone, which said the 
Foreign Office planned to approach academics to contract staff for a Brexit 
advisory panel – but that those to be contracted “must be UK passport-holders.”

One of the group is understood to be a dual national, with citizenship of both 
the UK and another EU member state.


The Foreign Office was said to be concerned about the risk of sensitive 
material being exposed asarticle 50 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu>
 negotiations over Britain’s exit from the EU – and subsequent talks on its 
future trade and other relations with the bloc – start to get under way.

The LSE said in statement that the government regularly called on its 
academics for advice, adding: “We believe our academics, including non-UK 
nationals, have hugely valuable expertise which will be vital in this time of 
uncertainty around the UK’s relationship withEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and the rest of the world. Any 
changes to security measures are a matter for the UK government.”

The Foreign Office denied non-British nationals had been barred from the work, 
saying it had been misunderstood. “The FCO regularly works with academic 
institutions to assist in its policy research and nothing has changed as a 
result of the referendum,” a spokesman said.

“It has always been the case that anyone working in the FCO may require 
security clearance depending on the nature and duration of their work. Britain 
is an outward-looking nation and we will continue to take advice from the best 
and brightest minds, regardless of nationality.”

LSE interim director Prof Julia Black said in an internal school update memo 
on the matter that the world-renowned university stood by its academic 
principles of independence.

“You may have seen reports in the media that the Foreign Office have advised 
us that they will be issuing tenders to contract for advisory work, but that 
only UK nationals will be eligible to apply,” she said in the memo,which was 
posted on Twitter <https://twitter.com/JakubKrupa/status/784429042418196480>.

“Whilst the Foreign Office has long had a rule restricting the nationality of 
employees or secondees, the extension of the bar to advisory work seems to be 
new. However, it is for the Foreign Office to determine what its national 
security arrangements are, and their legality, not for us.


“We are standing firm to our principles of academic independence and valuing 
our truly international community of scholars. We will continue to stand by our 
colleagues and we strongly value the work that you all do.”

Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at the University of Essex who has advised 
the government, said it should be “perfectly possible to get useful input from 
some of the best-qualified people in the country” without anything sensitive 
being revealed.

“I don’t really get the security or sensitivity argument,” he said. “Whatever 
the reasons, this will come across as hostile, narrow and xenophobic.” He 
tweeted:

Legal experts questioned whether the FCO could be in breach of UK public 
procurement law by requiring the work be carried out by British nationals. 
Albert Sanchez Graells, a senior law lecturer at Bristol university, said it 
“definitely” would be if the work was in the context of a services contract.

Simon Cox, a migration lawyer at the Open Society Justice Initiative, said it 
might be possible for the government to legally restrict high-level advisers to 
British citizens, but added that the way the situation had been handled was 
“beyond disrespectful, and in a worryingly xenophobic context”.

UK in a Changing Europe, a thinktank on UK-EU relations of which Hagemann is a 
senior fellow, said it believed there was “a more pressing need than ever 
before for academic expertise to inform the multitude of difficult decisions to 
be taken in connection with Brexit” and that it would continue to publish 
research “whatever the nationality of the author”.

Separately, the Guardian has learned that another EU national – a migration 
specialist who asked not to be identified – was approached by a private 
recruitment firm for a Foreign Office post for which she was well qualified, 
but informed after several conversations that only British citizens would be 
eligible.

European academics, who make up about 15% of research and teaching staff at 
British universities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/25/brexit-may-force-15-of-staff-at-uk-universities-to-leave-warns-group>
, responded with dismay. Jan Eichhorn, a fellow in social policy at Edinburgh 
university,tweeted <https://twitter.com/eichhorn_jan/status/784391714324766720>
: “For the first time this makes me question whether it makes sense to continue 
working at a UK university as an EU policy-focussed academic.”

The government has come under sustained fire over immigration since the 
Conservative conference when the home secretary, Amber Rudd, said it was 
consideringrequiring companies to declare the proportion of international staff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers>
 in their workforce.

Ministers were said to want to see lists of companies published and those 
employers with the highest proportions of foreign staff “named and shamed” for 
not employing British people when they could.

Rudd, who was forced to defend herself on radio against allegations of 
xenophobia, also announced acrackdown on overseas students and work visas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas>
, and pledged to prevent migrants “taking jobs British people could do”.

Theresa May was also accused after her conference speech of stoking 
anti-immigrant sentiment in the country by playing to fears about the impact of 
foreign workers on jobs and wages.

The prime minister said the EU referendum result legitimised a tougher line on 
immigration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement>
 and some people did not like to admit that British workers could “find 
themselves out of work or on lower wages because of low-skilled immigration”.
