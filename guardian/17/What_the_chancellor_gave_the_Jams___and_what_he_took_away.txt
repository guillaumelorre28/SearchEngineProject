The gains and losses for the “just about managing” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2016/nov/20/jam-the-new-government-acronym-just-about-managing-to-make-sense>
 households in the 2016 autumn statement.

The gains

 * Universal credit The chancellor said 3m households will be better off due 
to changes to universal credits, which he described as a “targeted tax cut 
worth £700m from 2021-22”. From April, the “taper rate” on universal credit 
will drop from 65% to 63%. Effectively this means those on low incomes can hold 
on to an extra 2p in every additional pound they earn.
Minimum wage The “national living wage” will rise from £7.20 an hour to £7.50 
an hour from April.

 * Personal allowances The starting point for basic rate tax will rise from 
£11,000 to £11,500 from April 2017, with a promise to raise it to £12,500 by 
the end of the parliament in a pledge first set out by George Osborne. 
 * Petrol prices Fuel duty was frozen again, saving 2p a litre or £1.36 on 
filling the average tank. 
 * Letting fees Renters will save around £300 each from the ban on fees to 
tenants, plus there was a total £7.2bn package in measures to support housing.

The losses

 * Work allowance This is the amount recipients of the universal credit can 
earn before their benefits start to be taken away, andHammond continued with 
Osborne’s already-announced cuts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/philip-hammond-rejects-calls-to-reverse-3bn-annual-cut-to-work-allowance>
. The £3bn in cuts far outweigh the £1bn giveaway from reducing the taper rate. 
A single parent with one child, earning £15,000 a year, will lose around £3,000 
from the planned cuts, according to the Child Poverty Action Group. 
 * Children Universal credit will be limited to two children from April 2017. 
Housing support for under-21s within UC will also be removed from the same 
month. Neither were mentioned in the speech, as they were announced in 2015. 
 * Insurance tax The typical car insurance premium will rise by £10.70 a year, 
said the AA, after insurance premium tax was hiked to 12%. Buildings and 
contents cover will also increase in price.
