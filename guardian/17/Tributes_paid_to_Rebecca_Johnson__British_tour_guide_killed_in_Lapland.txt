A British tour guide who was stabbed to death in Lapland  
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/05/british-woman-working-in-lapland-stabbed-to-death>
has been described as a “beautiful girl” by family.

The 26-year-old from Burntisland, Fife, who has been named locally as Rebecca 
Johnson, was discovered in the village of Kuttanen, by Enontekio,Finland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/finland>, on Saturday.

She was a member of the Santa Safari team, which works with Oxford-based tour 
operator Transun Travel to organise Christmas-themed excursions to Lapland.

It is understood Johnson’s parents have travelled to Lapland.

Speaking to the Courier newspaper, her great-aunt, Val Laing, said Johnson 
would be greatly missed.


“Rebecca was a beautiful girl,” she said. “I had come home from Edinburgh when 
her grandad was on the phone to tell me what had happened. I couldn’t take it 
in at first. For her parents and grandparents to lose her just before Christmas 
is devastating. I’ll be there for them but I don’t know how they are going to 
cope.”

Her 36-year-old Czech boyfriend was arrested on suspicion of killing Johnson 
after a police manhunt in temperatures of -30C (-22F).

The man, who remains in custody, is to be formally charged with murder on 
Wednesday, a statement from Lapland police said.

A spokeswoman for Santa Safari said: “We are deeply saddened to confirm that a 
member of the Santa Safari team was discovered dead on 3 December. We are all 
in shock from this tragic news and our thoughts go out to her family.

“Our team is working closely with the Finnish police and relevant authorities 
to support the investigation that is now under way. It goes without saying that 
we will do everything we can to support the family and our staff at this 
incredibly difficult time.”

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokeswoman said: “We are supporting the 
family of a British national who died in Finland on 3 December.”
