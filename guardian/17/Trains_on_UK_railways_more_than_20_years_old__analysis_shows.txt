Trains on Britain’s railways are more than 20 years old on average, the 
highest figure for at least 15 years, according to analysis of rolling stock.

With rail fares increasing by an average of 2.3% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/dec/02/train-fares-to-go-up-by-23-in-2017>
 across the UK from Monday, a thinktank claimed that passengers were “paying 
through the nose for decrepit trains”.

Statistics from the Office of Rail and Road showed that trains were an average 
of 21 years old

 between January and March, the oldest they have been since July 2000 – the 
earliest publicly available records.

The ORR said older trains could result in less comfortable journeys, and have 
worse reliability and performance than modern rolling stock, but noted that 
older trains could be refurbished.

Passengers on the Caledonian Sleeper service between London and Scotland 
travel on Britain’s oldest trains, introduced 41 years ago on average.

Merseyrail has the second-oldest fleet at 37 years. Both operators plan to 
bring in new rolling stock in the coming years.

TransPennine Express trains, which run between cities and major towns in 
northern England and Scotland, are the newest in Britain at nine years old on 
average.

Trains in London and south-east England are typically 19 years old, while 
regional services are 24 years old on average.

Ed Cox, the director of thinktank IPPR North, said: “It is little wonder that 
Britain lags behind other developed nations when commuters pay through the nose 
for decrepit trains. Northerners in particular will be familiar with Pacer 
trains, which leak whenever it gets wet. This is a national disgrace and just 
not what you’d see in Germany, France or Japan, or even down south.

“To make journeys cheaper, cleaner and greener, areas outside the capital must 
be givenTransport <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> for London-style 
powers to raise money to invest in transport and take back control over 
spending decisions.”

The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, said it 
expected the average age of Britain’s trains to fall to 16 years by 2019, after 
the introduction of more than 4,500 new carriages at a cost of more than £7.5bn.

Lianna Etkind from the Campaign for Better Transport said the current age of 
trains “exemplifies the lack of public and passenger involvement” in the 
network.

“More people than ever rely on the railways. They contribute a bigger 
percentage to running costs than ever, they pay more for their tickets than 
ever, and yet there is a postcode lottery in the kind of trains they are served 
by,” she said.

“We need a strategy from the government that involves passengers and the wider 
public in decision making, makes clear what their future plans are on things 
such as electrification and clarifies the roles of the rolling stock companies, 
the train operators and the government in paying for updated rolling stock.”

Last month, the National Audit Office warned that delays in the 
electrification of the great western main line could mean passengers in the 
north and west of England have to wait longer for newer trains as the 
reallocation of rolling stock is held up.

The railway historian Christian Wolmar said investment in new trains in 
Britain was “very lumpy” because it “isn’t properly planned and we don’t really 
have a principal domestic supplier”.

“If we had a sensible process, we would have a steady, smooth production line 
that we operate all year round, producing rolling stock at regular intervals,” 
he said. “The whole thing would be rational and much cheaper.”

A Department for Transport spokesman said: “We are delivering the biggest rail 
modernisation programme for more than a century and will be rolling out more 
than 5,000 carriages over the next four years, which offer more seats, Wi-Fi 
and air conditioning.

“South West Trains will start testing the first of 150 new carriages in the 
new year and the first new trains on the great western main line will begin 
operating next summer, before they are brought in on the east coast route.

“Through rail franchising, we also expect the rail industry to come up with 
more proposals to introduce new carriages and improve services.”
