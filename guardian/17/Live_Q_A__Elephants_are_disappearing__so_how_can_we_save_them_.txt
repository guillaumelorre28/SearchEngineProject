Will my grandkids get to see elephants in the wild?

An entirely self-indulgent question, I will admit, but that’s my prerogative! 
This excellent panel give us measured hope for the future.

In many countries I'm afraid it will not possible. We often forget Central and 
West Africa where elephants are in many areas doomed. If we cannot stop the 
current elephant poaching crisis, your grandchildren will probably be able to 
see wild elephants only in a handful of African countries, in the Eastern and 
Southern Africa, tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people.

Yes, but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat poaching, build 
community support for conservation, reduce HEC, reduce trafficking (including 
through market closures), and dramatically reduce demand for ivory, the number 
of places with significant numbers of wild elephants, functioning as they 
should, will be very much smaller than now. But there is real hope!

I think so Karl, because high value tourism areas will be maintained. They 
might be private, however, like Ol Pejeta and Lewa in Kenya. Unfortunately, in 
getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and 
livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the wildlife.

You know what the word in English is for pest animals with no value - vermin. 
Current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of 
rural African communities.

Karl, I think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant 
specialists talking about the species, (not just local abundant populations in 
one or two countries), we can get ivory under control and poaching 
significantly lessened. And I strongly believe that if we don't want simply 
islands of elephants but connected, migrating herds, we have to plan this now 
and in the next 5-10 years while we have something to work with. This applies 
in Asia too, where the IUCN Asian elephant specialist group just met last week. 
For all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the 
question is back to you all, are you with us? We need you to make your desire 
known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and 
corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their 
habitat.

What are the distinct threats faced by Asian elephants?

Asian elephants are Monica Wrobel, whose organisation Elephant Family focuses 
on Asian elephants paints a frightening picture of the future.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> MonicaWrobel  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> 22 November 2016 2:19pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87996088> 
In the past 100 years 90% of Asian elephant populations have been wiped out. 
Without action, this iconic animal could be facing extinction within 3 decades, 
which is why this species is listed as Endangered. They now number as few as 
40,000 across 13 countries in Asia, with probably 60% occurring in India. 
Habitat loss (lack of food) and fragmentation of populations are causing 
declines, and then the results of that such as train strikes are killing them, 
as well as hunting (sometimes for ivory though not all elephants have tusks and 
females don't have tusks). However, retaliatory killing for crop-raiding such 
as by electrocution traps hooked up to the mains wires, or setting out poison 
bait - such as poisoned pineapples are killing what these superb wild giants 
have been reduced to - crop pests, especially in places where people have 
settled and have no history of living with, or knowing how to live with 
elephants.

Dan Stiles also thinks things are looking bleak.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87995942> 
Habitat destruction and fragmentation is the obvious answer. It's remarkable 
how well they've done in India and Sri Lanka when you think of the population 
pressures. Unfortunately, it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase 
in India and carvers are still churning out the Ganeshas and Saraswatis. I've 
read how various states are planning corridors, etc.

Here’s what can be done. Says Wrobel:
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> MonicaWrobel  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> 22 November 2016 2:23pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87996418> 
In Asia though, we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected 
and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more 
where elephants need to move and what they need to eat. We can lessen the 
interaction between people and elephants and help people co-exist safely. We 
can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change 
will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are 
ready with the answers! So there IS hope, but we need to act now. Importantly, 
as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal 
poaching in Africa, we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in Africa 
to protect space and empower people to allow our spectacular, largest land 
mammal still have room to roam. Our biggest project at the moment with other 
NGOs is our Corridors Campaign.

Why is there not enough money to stop poaching?

On email, Wim Kerkhoven asks why we can’t use funds from tourism to support 
local communities so they don’t turn to poaching.

There’s just not enough to go around, says Andrea Crosta.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17019737> Wild60

Throughout Africa there are working examples of involving local communities in 
the way you suggest, it's simply a drop in the ocean. There are million and 
millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually "blessed" with 
tourism. And you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or 
brokers to create havoc. There;s a huge Human Toll behind the ivory trade and 
poor exploited people are a big part of it.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17046054> Rahul Raman  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17046054> 22 November 2016 2:02pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87994899> 
Thats the same situation here, in India. Even with tourism, the number of poor 
people who actually benefit from it i.e. whose lives are uplifted by its 
effects is a very small number. Whatever the solution is, it has to be more 
though out and must benefit the poor community in large.

The money also fails to reach the communities says Simon Hedges.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> SimonHedgesWCS  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> 22 November 2016 2:03pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87994994> 
Sometimes the reason is that entrenched big businesses that are not set up to 
provide significant benefits to the local people in and around the eco-tourism 
areas. Corruption is sometimes a problem too. Governments need to do more to 
support, facilitate, and otherwise help local initiatives and to require more 
equitable benefit sharing by the big operations. You are correct to say that 
ecotourism in Africa can generate 'big bucks', see the paper I referenced 
earlier: Naidoo R., Weaver C.L., Diggle R.W., Matongo G., Stuart-Hill G. & 
Thouless C. (2015) Complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal 
conservancies in Namibia. Conserv Biol.

Monica Wrobel says there is an important role for development aid to play to 
fill these gaps.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> MonicaWrobel  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> 22 November 2016 2:04pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87995073> 
I think community needs are greater than the support they are getting, 
especially in many African countries, but the rural poor in all countries where 
elephants range are too often left on their own. In reality, the places where 
wildlife still exists are in places where the most dis-enfranchised people 
live. They may not even know when there is a government compensation scheme 
that can help them. So I don't think elephant populations always need to "pay 
for themselves" through trophy hunting or tourism income. But I think that 
better access to development aid, or government aid or even an NGO-started 
farming co-op and access to markets can boost the morale and empowerment of 
communities. Those communities also do not want to be a target for criminal 
gangs preying on the unemployed to poach. Strong communities are a very 
important part of this answer, and support so they can use techniques or 
understand elephant routes help prevent human-elephant interaction.

Can we create a connected network of parks and protected areas in Africa?

Dan Stiles says this is already underway in Kenya:

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87992845> 
This is a critical question and in Kenya right now there is a group doing 
exactly that, planning protected corridors to be left open to connect protected 
areas and private conservancies. All range states should conduct such 
exercises, including cross-border corridors

 And Simon Hedges agrees.

Indeed! Elephants do need large areas of habitat and even in Africa we are now 
seeing habitat fragmentation and loss become a significant problem for elephant 
conservation. In Asia, of course, habitat loss has long been one of the biggest 
threats to elephants, which are now largely confined to protected areas, many 
of which are too small for long term viability and have huge HEC problems on 
their borders. Maintaining connectivity or restoring it if already lost is 
essential. Fortunately, as Dan notes there are some encouraging examples from 
countries such as Kenya and India but much more needs to be done in many more 
places.

For those feeling far away and helpless, here are some concrete actions you 
can take today.

I agree with lobbying governments. These should be considered World Heritage 
Animals and as global citizens we can help strengthen that argument and get 
more resources put towards Forest andWildlife 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife> Departments. Stronger 
departments aid better resource management, and not only help provide stability 
locally, but can stand up for protection of habitat for the good of communities 
and wildlife. Preventing environmental damage (loss of forest, pollution, 
silting of rivers, floods, polluted water courses) which de-stabilises 
communities later. I also endorse that people worldwide support the 
conservation organisations that can help direct research and aid to experts and 
communities for bringing about local solutions.

Is trophy hunting an option?

No, say most panelists. Although there are some caveats.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> MonicaWrobel

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87994093> 
I think the quote "Necessity is the Mother of Invention" applies here. Some of 
the most innovative community schemes have come about when trophy hunting was 
not an option, and then other aid schemes and other government departments 
participated in community well-being, not just under-resourced wildlife 
departments.

Dan Stiles says it could work for some species. But not elephants.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17022209> Kenyadan

I'm not convinced that trophy hunting is essential to conserving elephants, at 
least elephant hunting, maybe other species. It's a complicated question.

Andrea Crosta from Elephant Action League says:
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17019737> Wild60  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17019737> 22 November 2016 1:43pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87993371> 
Trophy hunting is often the "lazy answer" of government that do not want to 
pro-actively protect wildlife and provide local communities with real economic 
development.

Simon Hedges agrees it’s complicated. But also perhaps an issue over-egged by 
both advocates and critics, relative to its potential impact.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87995794> 
While I would personally never shoot an animal for its trophy there have been 
some successful examples of trophy hunting for some species generating revenues 
for - and encouraging pro-conservation attitudes among - local people. Trophy 
hunting has the potential to provide those benefits in remote, difficult places 
where there are few other options for wildlife-based landuses. Trophy hunting 
can therefore help keep significant areas of land under wildlife - land that 
might otherwise not be so used. But in some places trophy hunting operations 
have practised predator control, introduced species, or bred overly-developed 
trophies - all of which are bad for biodiversity conservation. So, yes, it's 
complicated. It is also hard to see that trophy hunting is likely to ever play 
a significant role in elephant conservation. The amount of money generated by 
trophy hunting is also small relative to the funding needs for conservation in 
Africa, and so in some ways the heated debates post-Cecil are a distraction 
from the bigger issues. See: Lindsey P.A., Balme G.A., Funston P.J., Henschel 
P.H. & Hunter L.T.B. (2016) Life after Cecil: channelling global outrage into 
funding for conservation in Africa. Conservation Letters 9, 296-301.

How do we fight the illegal trade when it is so lucrative?

Carey Ostrer has asked via email how we go about fighting the illegal trade 
when it is so lucrative?


 Dan Stiles responds: 

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17022209> Kenyadan  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17022209> 22 November 2016 1:25pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87991799> 
On the demand side, where consumers buy, law enforcement in pretty much every 
country has proven ineffective if high demand prevails. If shops are closed 
down, traders and consumers move to online websites and members only social 
media. Demand must be lowered, but this is a long process.

Monica Wrobel of Elephant Family points out: 

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> MonicaWrobel  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> 22 November 2016 1:26pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87991960> 
From the words of a wildlife enforcement specialist: “On illegal trade, 
investigation and enforcement is still woefully inadequate in the countries 
that matter (range states and consumer/transit countries.). There's a need to 
recognise this is a crime problem and the response needs to be police led. 
Customs have demonstrated they have capacity, mandate and therefore little will 
to investigate the hundreds of ivory seizures made to date. Many techniques 
still aren't being adopted, such as controlled deliveries, forensic analysis of 
crime scenes for links to suspects, and lack of proactive responses. Sources 
within the trade have indicated that serious offenders are only afraid of 
imprisonment if actually prosecuted, yet such a deterrent barely exists.

And Simon Hedges of WCS adds: 

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> SimonHedgesWCS  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> 22 November 2016 1:30pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87992250> 
Dan is correct to stress the challenges inherent in demand reduction and there 
needs to be a much greater focus on effecting behavioural change not just 
raising awareness; we have seen to little of the former in demand reduction 
campaigns to date. But demand for wildlife products including ivory and rhino 
horn has been reduced in the past in a number of countries, so we know it can 
be done.

Avoiding elephant-human conflict

Elephants are wild animals and so conflict is hard to avoid, according to the 
panel. Consultant Dan Stiles says we can only control how humans respond.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87992117> 
For those who suffer the depredations of elephants, the only thing that has 
been demonstrated to prevent retaliation is if the people gain tangible 
benefits. Very few places have mechanisms in place for that now.

Solutions have to involve communities, says Wildlife 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife> Direct’s Trish Sewe.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17044898> TrishSewe

Conflict between humans and wildlife cannot be avoided. However solutions have 
to come from the people living with wildlife. Innovative ideas of how to live 
harmoniously can't take a top down approach.

And they have to build economic prosperity, says Simon Hedges in a comment too 
long to post so I’ll link to ithere 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87992862>. He also 
suggests further investigating insurance and other ways to manage or understand 
the impact on humans.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87993247> 
In addition to trying to ensure local people derive direct financial benefits 
from the presence of wildlife such as elephants whenever possible, a key part 
of mitigating human-elephant conflict (HEC) or human-wildlife conflict (HWC) 
more generally is to adopt a sound evidence-based approach to testing and 
promoting effective HEC/HWC reduction methods. There are methods that can help 
reduce HEC (under some circumstances at least) out there but they need to be 
deployed more effectively. Approaches such as insurance need to be further 
tested and developed too.

Is China doing enough?

Most panelists, including Simon Hedges from WCS, agree that the Chinese mean 
it when they say they will phase out their legal ivory trade:

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87991014> 
Yes, I think the Chinese Government is serious about shutting down the 
domestic market in ivory in China. That commitment was announced at the highest 
level in a joint communique from President Xi and President Obama in September 
2015. Earlier this year the Chinese authorities said publicly that they would 
announce the timetable for implementing the ban, so we can expect to see that 
announcement soon.

But Rahul Raman points out that there has been little movement since they made 
their announcement a year ago.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87991246> 
While this is true, Chinese Govt hasn't announced a date, even though Hong 
Kong has, which is 2020. Can we be sure that China is serious about this, even 
after we now that officials from high office are involved in the trade?

But Isabel Hilton, of chinadialogue, points out the difficulty in enforcing 
laws in a country as vast as China.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87993876> 
Re the ending of the domestic legal trade in China, whiles it will undoubtedly 
help we should also be aware that it is a recurring pattern in China that good 
laws can be passed but that enforcement failure can lead to unexpected results. 
China often resists legislation for as long as possible, then acts when the 
diplomatic costs become too high. But that is not the same as effective 
enforcement. China is a very big country, Beijing's reach is less effective 
than many outsiders imagine, and enforcement may not be a priority. If you look 
at the overall movements in demand, the relatively recent surge in demand from 
Vietnam for both ivory and rhino horn: I suspect that the bulk of both are 
being smuggled into China -- it's a change of route rather than a drop in 
demand.

Dan Stiles, who works with the IUCN elephant specialist group, believes some 
news might be imminent.

I've heard they will announce the plan in December. It will involve a phased 
closing, allowing ivory traders and factories to dispose of their stocks, as 
Hong Kong has done

We know that elephant populations are collapsing at a frightening rate and 
that the driving forces behind this collapse are a global appetite for ivory 
and, just as worryingly, human/elephant conflict for space and resources.

Earlier this year, the world’s governments agreed to recommend the closure of 
domestic ivory markets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/02/worlds-nations-agree-elephant-ivory-markets-must-close>
. This is a serious step towards the eventual complete shutting down of the 
ivory trade, but now new questions are arising:

 * How do governments go about shutting down the legal ivory market? 
 * Fighting an illegal ivory market could be even harder. How do we strengthen 
forces against the black market? 
 * As human populations move into elephant territory, human/elephant conflict 
is a real and growing problem that may even come to dwarf the ivory trade. Can 
we avoid these conflicts? What works in terms of supporting local communities? 
What works in terms of preserving elephant territory? 
 * This is a global challenge, but with different challenges for every region. 
What are the specific challenges for your region?

We have convened a panel of experts to answer these questions, and more. The 
discussion will take place in the comments thread, and we will post highlights 
in the live blog as it proceeds. If you would like to ask a question email 
bibi.vanderzee@theguardian.com, or join in the comments thread during the 
discussion on Tuesday.

In many countries I'm afraid it will not possible. We often forget Central and 
West Africa where elephants are in many areas doomed. If we cannot stop the 
current elephant poaching crisis, your grandchildren will probably be able to 
see wild elephants only in a handful of African countries, in the Eastern and 
Southern Africa, tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people.

Yes, but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat poaching, build 
community support for conservation, reduce HEC, reduce trafficking (including 
through market closures), and dramatically reduce demand for ivory, the number 
of places with significant numbers of wild elephants, functioning as they 
should, will be very much smaller than now. But there is real hope!

I think so Karl, because high value tourism areas will be maintained. They 
might be private, however, like Ol Pejeta and Lewa in Kenya. Unfortunately, in 
getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and 
livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the wildlife.

You know what the word in English is for pest animals with no value - vermin. 
Current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of 
rural African communities.

Karl, I think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant 
specialists talking about the species, (not just local abundant populations in 
one or two countries), we can get ivory under control and poaching 
significantly lessened. And I strongly believe that if we don't want simply 
islands of elephants but connected, migrating herds, we have to plan this now 
and in the next 5-10 years while we have something to work with. This applies 
in Asia too, where the IUCN Asian elephant specialist group just met last week. 
For all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the 
question is back to you all, are you with us? We need you to make your desire 
known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and 
corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their 
habitat.
 
Asian elephants are Monica Wrobel, whose organisation Elephant Family focuses 
on Asian elephants paints a frightening picture of the future.

In the past 100 years 90% of Asian elephant populations have been wiped out. 
Without action, this iconic animal could be facing extinction within 3 decades, 
which is why this species is listed as Endangered. They now number as few as 
40,000 across 13 countries in Asia, with probably 60% occurring in India. 
Habitat loss (lack of food) and fragmentation of populations are causing 
declines, and then the results of that such as train strikes are killing them, 
as well as hunting (sometimes for ivory though not all elephants have tusks and 
females don't have tusks). However, retaliatory killing for crop-raiding such 
as by electrocution traps hooked up to the mains wires, or setting out poison 
bait - such as poisoned pineapples are killing what these superb wild giants 
have been reduced to - crop pests, especially in places where people have 
settled and have no history of living with, or knowing how to live with 
elephants.

Dan Stiles also thinks things are looking bleak.

Habitat destruction and fragmentation is the obvious answer. It's remarkable 
how well they've done in India and Sri Lanka when you think of the population 
pressures. Unfortunately, it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase 
in India and carvers are still churning out the Ganeshas and Saraswatis. I've 
read how various states are planning corridors, etc.

Here’s what can be done. Says Wrobel:

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87996418> 
In Asia though, we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected 
and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more 
where elephants need to move and what they need to eat. We can lessen the 
interaction between people and elephants and help people co-exist safely. We 
can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change 
will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are 
ready with the answers! So there IS hope, but we need to act now. Importantly, 
as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal 
poaching in Africa, we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in Africa 
to protect space and empower people to allow our spectacular, largest land 
mammal still have room to roam. Our biggest project at the moment with other 
NGOs is our Corridors Campaign.

On email, Wim Kerkhoven asks why we can’t use funds from tourism to support 
local communities so they don’t turn to poaching.

There’s just not enough to go around, says Andrea Crosta.

Throughout Africa there are working examples of involving local communities in 
the way you suggest, it's simply a drop in the ocean. There are million and 
millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually "blessed" with 
tourism. And you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or 
brokers to create havoc. There;s a huge Human Toll behind the ivory trade and 
poor exploited people are a big part of it.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87994899> 
Thats the same situation here, in India. Even with tourism, the number of poor 
people who actually benefit from it i.e. whose lives are uplifted by its 
effects is a very small number. Whatever the solution is, it has to be more 
though out and must benefit the poor community in large.

The money also fails to reach the communities says Simon Hedges.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> SimonHedgesWCS

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87994994> 
Sometimes the reason is that entrenched big businesses that are not set up to 
provide significant benefits to the local people in and around the eco-tourism 
areas. Corruption is sometimes a problem too. Governments need to do more to 
support, facilitate, and otherwise help local initiatives and to require more 
equitable benefit sharing by the big operations. You are correct to say that 
ecotourism in Africa can generate 'big bucks', see the paper I referenced 
earlier: Naidoo R., Weaver C.L., Diggle R.W., Matongo G., Stuart-Hill G. & 
Thouless C. (2015) Complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal 
conservancies in Namibia. Conserv Biol.

Monica Wrobel says there is an important role for development aid to play to 
fill these gaps.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> MonicaWrobel  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> 22 November 2016 2:04pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87995073> 
I think community needs are greater than the support they are getting, 
especially in many African countries, but the rural poor in all countries where 
elephants range are too often left on their own. In reality, the places where 
wildlife still exists are in places where the most dis-enfranchised people 
live. They may not even know when there is a government compensation scheme 
that can help them. So I don't think elephant populations always need to "pay 
for themselves" through trophy hunting or tourism income. But I think that 
better access to development aid, or government aid or even an NGO-started 
farming co-op and access to markets can boost the morale and empowerment of 
communities. Those communities also do not want to be a target for criminal 
gangs preying on the unemployed to poach. Strong communities are a very 
important part of this answer, and support so they can use techniques or 
understand elephant routes help prevent human-elephant interaction.
 
Dan Stiles says this is already underway in Kenya: 

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17022209> Kenyadan  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17022209> 22 November 2016 1:37pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87992845> 
This is a critical question and in Kenya right now there is a group doing 
exactly that, planning protected corridors to be left open to connect protected 
areas and private conservancies. All range states should conduct such 
exercises, including cross-border corridors

 And Simon Hedges agrees. 
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> SimonHedgesWCS  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> 22 November 2016 1:53pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87994219> 
Indeed! Elephants do need large areas of habitat and even in Africa we are now 
seeing habitat fragmentation and loss become a significant problem for elephant 
conservation. In Asia, of course, habitat loss has long been one of the biggest 
threats to elephants, which are now largely confined to protected areas, many 
of which are too small for long term viability and have huge HEC problems on 
their borders. Maintaining connectivity or restoring it if already lost is 
essential. Fortunately, as Dan notes there are some encouraging examples from 
countries such as Kenya and India but much more needs to be done in many more 
places.
 
For those feeling far away and helpless, here are some concrete actions you 
can take today.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87992758> 
I agree with lobbying governments. These should be considered World Heritage 
Animals and as global citizens we can help strengthen that argument and get 
more resources put towards Forest andWildlife 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife> Departments. Stronger 
departments aid better resource management, and not only help provide stability 
locally, but can stand up for protection of habitat for the good of communities 
and wildlife. Preventing environmental damage (loss of forest, pollution, 
silting of rivers, floods, polluted water courses) which de-stabilises 
communities later. I also endorse that people worldwide support the 
conservation organisations that can help direct research and aid to experts and 
communities for bringing about local solutions.
 
No, say most panelists. Although there are some caveats.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> MonicaWrobel

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87994093> 
I think the quote "Necessity is the Mother of Invention" applies here. Some of 
the most innovative community schemes have come about when trophy hunting was 
not an option, and then other aid schemes and other government departments 
participated in community well-being, not just under-resourced wildlife 
departments.

Dan Stiles says it could work for some species. But not elephants.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17022209> Kenyadan  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17022209> 22 November 2016 1:47pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87993671> 
I'm not convinced that trophy hunting is essential to conserving elephants, at 
least elephant hunting, maybe other species. It's a complicated question.

Andrea Crosta from Elephant Action League says:
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17019737> Wild60  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17019737> 22 November 2016 1:43pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87993371> 
Trophy hunting is often the "lazy answer" of government that do not want to 
pro-actively protect wildlife and provide local communities with real economic 
development.

Simon Hedges agrees it’s complicated. But also perhaps an issue over-egged by 
both advocates and critics, relative to its potential impact.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> SimonHedgesWCS  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> 22 November 2016 2:15pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87995794> 
While I would personally never shoot an animal for its trophy there have been 
some successful examples of trophy hunting for some species generating revenues 
for - and encouraging pro-conservation attitudes among - local people. Trophy 
hunting has the potential to provide those benefits in remote, difficult places 
where there are few other options for wildlife-based landuses. Trophy hunting 
can therefore help keep significant areas of land under wildlife - land that 
might otherwise not be so used. But in some places trophy hunting operations 
have practised predator control, introduced species, or bred overly-developed 
trophies - all of which are bad for biodiversity conservation. So, yes, it's 
complicated. It is also hard to see that trophy hunting is likely to ever play 
a significant role in elephant conservation. The amount of money generated by 
trophy hunting is also small relative to the funding needs for conservation in 
Africa, and so in some ways the heated debates post-Cecil are a distraction 
from the bigger issues. See: Lindsey P.A., Balme G.A., Funston P.J., Henschel 
P.H. & Hunter L.T.B. (2016) Life after Cecil: channelling global outrage into 
funding for conservation in Africa. Conservation Letters 9, 296-301.
 
Carey Ostrer has asked via email how we go about fighting the illegal trade 
when it is so lucrative?


 Dan Stiles responds: 

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17022209> Kenyadan  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17022209> 22 November 2016 1:25pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87991799> 
On the demand side, where consumers buy, law enforcement in pretty much every 
country has proven ineffective if high demand prevails. If shops are closed 
down, traders and consumers move to online websites and members only social 
media. Demand must be lowered, but this is a long process.

Monica Wrobel of Elephant Family points out: 

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> MonicaWrobel  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17045967> 22 November 2016 1:26pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87991960> 
From the words of a wildlife enforcement specialist: “On illegal trade, 
investigation and enforcement is still woefully inadequate in the countries 
that matter (range states and consumer/transit countries.). There's a need to 
recognise this is a crime problem and the response needs to be police led. 
Customs have demonstrated they have capacity, mandate and therefore little will 
to investigate the hundreds of ivory seizures made to date. Many techniques 
still aren't being adopted, such as controlled deliveries, forensic analysis of 
crime scenes for links to suspects, and lack of proactive responses. Sources 
within the trade have indicated that serious offenders are only afraid of 
imprisonment if actually prosecuted, yet such a deterrent barely exists.

And Simon Hedges of WCS adds: 

 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> SimonHedgesWCS  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> 22 November 2016 1:30pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87992250> 
Dan is correct to stress the challenges inherent in demand reduction and there 
needs to be a much greater focus on effecting behavioural change not just 
raising awareness; we have seen to little of the former in demand reduction 
campaigns to date. But demand for wildlife products including ivory and rhino 
horn has been reduced in the past in a number of countries, so we know it can 
be done.
 
Elephants are wild animals and so conflict is hard to avoid, according to the 
panel. Consultant Dan Stiles says we can only control how humans respond.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17022209> Kenyadan  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17022209> 22 November 2016 1:28pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87992117> 
For those who suffer the depredations of elephants, the only thing that has 
been demonstrated to prevent retaliation is if the people gain tangible 
benefits. Very few places have mechanisms in place for that now.

Solutions have to involve communities, says Wildlife 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife> Direct’s Trish Sewe.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17044898> TrishSewe  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17044898> 22 November 2016 1:34pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87992571> 
Conflict between humans and wildlife cannot be avoided. However solutions have 
to come from the people living with wildlife. Innovative ideas of how to live 
harmoniously can't take a top down approach.

And they have to build economic prosperity, says Simon Hedges in a comment too 
long to post so I’ll link to ithere 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87992862>. He also 
suggests further investigating insurance and other ways to manage or understand 
the impact on humans.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> SimonHedgesWCS  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> 22 November 2016 1:42pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87993247> 
In addition to trying to ensure local people derive direct financial benefits 
from the presence of wildlife such as elephants whenever possible, a key part 
of mitigating human-elephant conflict (HEC) or human-wildlife conflict (HWC) 
more generally is to adopt a sound evidence-based approach to testing and 
promoting effective HEC/HWC reduction methods. There are methods that can help 
reduce HEC (under some circumstances at least) out there but they need to be 
deployed more effectively. Approaches such as insurance need to be further 
tested and developed too.
 
Most panelists, including Simon Hedges from WCS, agree that the Chinese mean 
it when they say they will phase out their legal ivory trade:
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> SimonHedgesWCS  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17042773> 22 November 2016 1:15pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87991014> 
Yes, I think the Chinese Government is serious about shutting down the 
domestic market in ivory in China. That commitment was announced at the highest 
level in a joint communique from President Xi and President Obama in September 
2015. Earlier this year the Chinese authorities said publicly that they would 
announce the timetable for implementing the ban, so we can expect to see that 
announcement soon.

But Rahul Raman points out that there has been little movement since they made 
their announcement a year ago.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17046054> Rahul Raman  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17046054> 22 November 2016 1:18pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87991246> 
While this is true, Chinese Govt hasn't announced a date, even though Hong 
Kong has, which is 2020. Can we be sure that China is serious about this, even 
after we now that officials from high office are involved in the trade?

But Isabel Hilton, of chinadialogue, points out the difficulty in enforcing 
laws in a country as vast as China.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17046004> isabelh1  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17046004> 22 November 2016 1:49pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/87993876> 
Re the ending of the domestic legal trade in China, whiles it will undoubtedly 
help we should also be aware that it is a recurring pattern in China that good 
laws can be passed but that enforcement failure can lead to unexpected results. 
China often resists legislation for as long as possible, then acts when the 
diplomatic costs become too high. But that is not the same as effective 
enforcement. China is a very big country, Beijing's reach is less effective 
than many outsiders imagine, and enforcement may not be a priority. If you look 
at the overall movements in demand, the relatively recent surge in demand from 
Vietnam for both ivory and rhino horn: I suspect that the bulk of both are 
being smuggled into China -- it's a change of route rather than a drop in 
demand.

Dan Stiles, who works with the IUCN elephant specialist group, believes some 
news might be imminent.

I've heard they will announce the plan in December. It will involve a phased

We know that elephant populations are collapsing at a frightening rate and 
that the driving forces behind this collapse are a global appetite for ivory 
and, just as worryingly, human/elephant conflict for space and resources.

Earlier this year, the world’s governments agreed to recommend the closure of 
domestic ivory markets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/02/worlds-nations-agree-elephant-ivory-markets-must-close>
. This is a serious step towards the eventual complete shutting down of the 
ivory trade, but now new questions are arising:

 * How do governments go about shutting down the legal ivory market? 
 * Fighting an illegal ivory market could be even harder. How do we strengthen 
forces against the black market? 
 * As human populations move into elephant territory, human/elephant conflict 
is a real and growing problem that may even come to dwarf the ivory trade. Can 
we avoid these conflicts? What works in terms of supporting local communities? 
What works in terms of preserving elephant territory? 
 * This is a global challenge, but with different challenges for every region. 
What are the specific challenges for your region?

We have convened a panel of experts to answer these questions, and more. The 
discussion will take place in the comments thread, and we will post highlights 
in the live blog as it proceeds. If you would like to ask a question email
