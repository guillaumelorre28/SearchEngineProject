I feel very lucky to have experienced student life around the world, but 
Sydney has always been the place for me.

When I applied to university, all the institutions I opted for were based in 
Sydney because I enjoy the wealth of opportunities and the lively culture the 
city offers students.

This year the QS best student cities rankings 
<http://www.topuniversities.com/best-student-cities> rated Sydney the fourth 
best city in the world for students, and from where I sit it’s easy to see why.

The rankings are organised by four main categories: student mix, quality of 
life, employer activity and affordability. How does Sydney fare in each of 
these?

Social inclusion, diversity and tolerance 

Australian universities have always held good ties with universities in Asia. 
Sydney, as one of the biggest student cities in Australia, has a large number 
of students from India and elsewhere in Asia, making for a multicultural 
student mix.

Western Sydney University (WSU) has campuses all around Sydney’s vibrant and 
diverse western suburbs. Caitlyn Charles, 22, who studies journalism at WSU, 
says this multiculturalism has positively affected her outlook on life. “At WSU 
we have diversity week, which champions the kind of university it is – a 
diverse and accepting university that gives students the opportunity to expand 
their knowledge of other cultures,” she says.

Sydney universities also offer a choice to students wanting to explore the 
city and its culture. Most of the five major universities – the University of 
Sydney, the University of Technology Sydney, the University of New South Wales, 
Macquarie University and Western Sydney University – have many different 
campuses around the city.

Lecturers genuinely seem to be chilled, and at my uni shoes seem to be optional
Imogen Leaning, student 
Jacalyn Phillips, 21, who is also at WSU and is studying for a master’s in 
primary education, has taken advantage of the 10 campus options available to 
WSU students. “Each campus has its own personality and culture,” she says.


Quality of life

Many students flock to Sydney because of its laid-back culture and relaxed 
vibe. Imogen Leaning, 19, grew up in Australia but moved to the UK seven years 
ago. She has returned on a student exchange from the University of Nottingham 
to study in Sydney. “I agree with the cliche that Australian universities are 
more laid-back. Lecturers genuinely seem to be chilled, and at my uni shoes 
seem to be optional,” she says.

 She adds that university in Australia is a lot more flexible for students 
wanting to study a wide range of subjects. “In the UK, people tend to start and 
finish uni on the same course, whereas in Australia people seem freer to change 
what they study,” she says.

Job opportunities


In recent years the New South Wales state government has invested millions of 
dollars in innovation, construction and technology. In addition, the government 
isinvesting millions of dollars

 into scholarships for university students.


According to City of Sydney 
<http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/business/business-e-news/business-news-april-2014/city-leads-sydney-jobs-growth>
 data, 50,000 new jobs were created in Sydney between 2010 and 2014, with the 
state government is promising 150,000 new jobs over the next four years.

The number of jobs in technology has increased dramatically, with 9,000 new 
jobs in tech created in Sydney over the seven-year period leading up to 2014.

Samuel Roberts, 22, who studies communication at the University of Sydney, 
says the city is full of promise for students. “The city is what you make of 
it. Sydney has so much to offer, and if you’re willing to throw yourself into 
it, you’ll always be able to find some great opportunities,” he says.

Affordability 

Sydney is fairly expensive for students compared with other university cities, 
largely because of high fees and living costs.

The University of New South Wales says the average university student pays 
$375 AUD (about £182) a week for on-campus accommodation in Sydney. An average 
arts degree for an Australian student costs nearly $19,000 AUD, with different 
rates for international students.

The high living and study costs require many students to take on part-time and 
casual work. Danielle Smith, 22, studying education at the University of 
Sydney, is approaching her final year and has to work to support herself.

“I can’t afford to study and live in Sydney without earning a part-time 
income. As well as paying for living expenses, I need to have money for my 
unpaid full-time internships, which are a part of my studies,” she says.

Unlike in other student-centric cities, it can be hard for students in Sydney 
to live near their universities. According to David Nolan, 21, who studies arts 
at Macquarie University, unless you share housing with other students it is 
often unaffordable.

“My options were either getting campus accommodation, which is really 
expensive, or moving closer to uni and working nearby. Neither was realistic 
without getting a group together,” he says.

Even so, students looking for a bustling, multicultural city with a chilled 
vibe should look no further than Sydney, Australia.
