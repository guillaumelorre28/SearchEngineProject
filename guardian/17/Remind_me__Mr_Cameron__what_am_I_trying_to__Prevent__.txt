I’m walking on the moors, watching my dog race around clumps of soggy gorse 
looking for an evasive rabbit. It’s bleak, grey and raining – the prevailing 
wind is so strong that I can hardly think.

An hour later and I’m sitting in a quiet old pub, enjoying a pint. There’s no 
television but the radio is bleating out the latest headlines about the 
terrorist threat from Islamic State. One of the old boys at the bar laughs at 
the thought of terrorists on the moor, and I find myself smiling in agreement.

A few days earlier, I attended a presentation given by the Prevent team at my 
university. As a result of theCounter-terrorism and Security Act 2015 
<http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/6/contents/enacted>, higher education 
institutions now have a statutory duty to report potential radicals to the 
authorities.

“There are six terrorist groups in the UK,” the presenter explained. “Can you 
name them?”

The first few came easy, but “extreme left wing” groups and animal rights 
protestors were a little harder. An audience member asked about the biggest 
local threat in Cornwall. We were told that it is, indeed, the animal rights 
protestors.

I must admit to underestimating them – I’d never thought of them as 
terrorists. I understand the divide between those who find it socially 
acceptable to hunt and those who find it barbaric. But I still don’t expect 
their activists to be blowing up the (somewhat antiquated) Cornish rail network 
any time soon.

As the presentation continued, we heard several theories about what drives 
young people to become radicals.

But is being a radical really such a bad thing? Don’t we want our students to 
think radically? Don’t we want to be challenged? Don’t we want our students to 
question us, and to think outside the box?

Academics Anonymous: an open letter to university 'leaders'

We strive to ignite innovation in our students, who are often catalysts for 
the production of groundbreaking research. We encourage conversation, welcome 
diversity and understand that both identity and agency can come from 
recognising our differences.

Our work is underpinned by the belief that we have freedom of speech. “You 
need to think about the type of people you invite to talk to your students,” 
the presenter said. “Make sure that you have completed the necessary paperwork 
and background checks. Young people can be impressionable.”

It was as if our normal working practices didn’t take account of the 
suitability of presenters. As if we couldn’t be trusted to make those decisions 
without the authorisation of a higher authority – or at least a paper trail for 
them to peruse. We will be checking, was the overpowering message.

“If students are having inappropriate conversations, we need to know,” the 
speech continued. “You need to be aware of the processes and be reporting these 
incidents through the right channels. Terrorism is like an iceberg, you will 
only ever see the top of it. The reasons for radicalisation can be as unique as 
a fingerprint.”

If the lines are being drawn between “them” and “us”, it seems we academics 
have equal responsibility for creating them. Big Brother is watching and we are 
being asked to watch with Big Brother, too.

But who decides what is radical? How do we decide that a person is a 
terrorist? Perhaps it’s about appearance – maybe they need a beard, or to be 
wearing a headscarf. Or perhaps we need to be looking out for individuals who 
sport peace tattoos, long hair and tunics.

“The threat level is now severe and an international terrorist attack in the 
UK is highly likely,” we were told. I look out into the grey mizzle and wonder 
again what a terrorist would want with a few oddballs pottering around the 
moors.

I wonder if we aren’t already engaged in a war, one that we can’t win. The 
enemy isn’t an international faction or student radicals. The enemy is 
difference, and that enemy comes from within.

I finish my beer and head to the door, just as a shooting party make an 
entrance, adorned with several brace of pheasants. Maybe this is a place facing 
a terrorist threat after all.
