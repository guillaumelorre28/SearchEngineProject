Darker decor creates instant warmth and depth in a home, but this can be 
contrasted with intense pops of colour through accessories and styling. 
Bringing fun and interest into a room, bright colours inject pure personality. 
Teal, mustard, coral and terracotta are great examples, lifting a space, even 
when used sparingly. If you want to add colour pops to a neutrally styled home, 
consider tableware, soft furnishings, small pieces of furniture (such as coffee 
tables and foot rests), ornaments and art: a big, bold and bright canvas is 
particularly effective if you have dark walls.

If you’ve gone for dark and inviting, with tones such as inky blue, bitter 
chocolate or deepest, darkest green, ceramics make characterful accessories. As 
a general rule, choose pots that reflect your own style – options could be 
quirky, or sleek and chic. If you’re looking for aesthetics alone, consider 
flasks and vases of varying heights. On a more practical level, consider 
tableware, from misshapen bowls and plates to hand-painted ceramic cups. As for 
the palette, white, pale grey or putty-coloured pottery looks classy against a 
dark backdrop, or choose colour pop pieces, hand-painted with intense jewel 
shades.

 Homely hues. Photograph: Ola Smit for the Guardian 
To make a space feel homely and sociable, deep hues create an ideal backdrop: 
damson, turmeric and deep burgundy look lovely in dining and living rooms, 
giving a lived-in look that’s also stylish and welcoming. A clever use of 
texture adds even more cosiness and character. Contrast a leather sofa with 
velvet chairs in the same colour, drape varying styles of knitted throws over 
seating, and mix ‘n’ match shimmering silk, knitted and faux fur scatter 
cushions. A rug also makes a statement: choose one in a warm but bright colour 
to cheer up a neutral interior.
