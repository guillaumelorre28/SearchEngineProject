With The Voice and Gary Barlow-led Let It Shine battling it out on traditional 
TV on Saturday night, Netflix’s big budget family series, based on the 
bestselling children’s novels and starring How I Met Your Mother’s Neil Patrick 
Harris, enters the fray on Friday.

For Netflix the show forms part of a plan to woo audiences and add to its 90 
million global subscribers, providing new opportunities for TV producers.

About 20% of Netflix’s $6bn (£4.9bn) annual programming budget will be spent 
on original productions this year, according to analyst estimates, with a major 
focus on making shows with a “multigenerational appeal”.

“These new players have a big vision and are commissioning high quality shows 
with big writers and big casts,” says Jane Turton, chief executive of 
All3Media, maker of Midsomer Murders, Shameless and Skins.

“Their plans are ambitious, creatively and commercially. It’s been a very good 
thing for content producers with commissioning revenues coming into the sector, 
especially in drama and now in factual, factual entertainment, and 
entertainment too.”

All3Media owns Lime Pictures, the Liverpool-based producer of Hollyoaks and 
The Only Way Is Essex, which is making a Netflix drama series about an American 
teenager’s coming-of-age adventures during a stay at a British riding stables.

This year Netflix will also make its first British children’s programmes with 
an adaptation of Jill Murphy’s The Worst Witch series of books for pre-teens.

The challenge for traditional broadcasters, still smarting after recording the 
lowest-ever Christmas Day TV ratings on record

, is stark.

“The growth of traditional broadcaster’s catch-up TV services has not offset 
the decline in people watching the night a show first airs,” says Richard 
Broughton, a director at Ampere Analysis.

“There are a variety of factors for the decline in TV viewing and one of those 
is services like Netflix. We estimate it attracts about as much viewing as 
Channel 5. It is fair to say they are taking some viewing.”

Netflix, which has a total TV content budget almost double that of the BBC, 
ITV andChannel 4 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> combined, will be 
making 1,000 hours of its own programming this year, a 66% rise on the 600 
hours made in 2016.

Amazon, which is estimated to have spent $3.2bn on content in 2016, also plans 
to double spending on video content and triple spending on original productions 
this year, increasing the competitive pressure on broadcasters.


“The competition is getting hotter and there is a new world order,” says one 
senior TV industry executive.

Netflix has built its business and reputation on drama series with adult 
themes, such as House of Cards and Orange is The New Black, but now it must 
branch out to new genres to broaden its appeal and continue to add to its 90 
million global subscribers.

“Family and kids shows are the next front,” says Broughton “Now Netflix is 
available globally quick growth can’t be got by launching in new territories. 
Netflix is looking to tap into those slightly more reluctant streaming groups 
for growth, and family viewing is a segment it has not addressed to the full 
extent.”

Netflix has been spurred on by the success of shows such as Stranger Things, 
the family-friendly 80s-themed sci-fi horror hit, which it says “offered 
variety to families and content that doesn’t pander to the younger generation”.


“We don’t see a lot of premium shows made for both adults and kids,” said 
Brian Wright, vice president of original series at Netflix. “There [are] very 
few series made with a high production value for enjoyment by a broader 
audience, that includes families.

“When we decided to diversify our programming slate, it was very clear to us 
that the movie industry does a great job here. Take examples such as Star Wars, 
Pixar, and the Harry Potter franchise. These movies are all aimed at equal 
enjoyment whether you’re 10, 40 or 60 years old.”

Wright highlighted the start on production of Lost In Space, a remake of the 
1960s family survival story, later this month as another example of targeting 
the family audience. The show will premiere next year.
