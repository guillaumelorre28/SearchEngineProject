The questioning of Julian Assange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/julian-assange> by Swedish prosecutors at 
the Ecuadorean embassy in London has been postponed until mid-November.

Ecuador’s attorney general said on Wednesday that the long-awaited interview, 
due to take place on Monday, would be delayed until 14 November to ensure that 
Assange’s legal team could attend.

Assange has been confined to the embassy since June 2012, when he sought and 
was granted asylum by Ecuador. He is wanted for questioning by Sweden over an 
allegation of rape in August 2010, which he denies. The Australian WikiLeaks 
founder has said he fears he could be transferred to the US to face potential 
espionage charges arising fromWikiLeaks
