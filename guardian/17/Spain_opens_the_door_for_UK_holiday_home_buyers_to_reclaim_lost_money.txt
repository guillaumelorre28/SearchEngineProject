Surrounded by mountains but half an hour’s drive from Costa Blanca’s beaches, 
the old fortress town of Castalla offered the best of life inSpain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/spain> for Gary Wainwright and his wife 
Lesley.

But when they put down a deposit of €66,875 (£53,200) on a three-bedroom 
apartment in the town at the end of 2007, it was the start of a nightmare which 
continues to this day. After the credit crunch struck the following year, work 
ceased on the new-build and everyone involved in the transaction, from estate 
agents to lawyers, stopped taking calls.

Still trying to retrieve their deposit, the Wainwright’s tale is familiar to 
many Britons who tried to buy holiday and retirement homes in Spain, but were 
left high and dry by the global financial crisis or unwittingly bought 
illegally built homes.

However, after almost a decade of frustration some hope has emerged for the 
couple and other investors who lost their deposits on unfinished off-plan 
properties. In December, the supreme court in Madrid issued a landmark judgment 
stating that Spanish banks are responsible for missing money deposited in their 
accounts, with interest on top.

Why Brits are tearing up their timeshares

Now lawyers in Spain believe this offers hope to thousands of Britons who lost 
deposits ranging from £20,000-£70,000. The Wainwrights are among a group who 
have taken fresh steps to reclaim their money.

Gary, who ran a ticketing agency in London and is now semi-retired, could do 
little when the work on the apartment ceased in September 2008.

“I knew the builders, they weren’t bad guys, and the project was almost 
complete – but the bank would not give them the rest of the money to finish it 
off,” he said.

Gary fell seriously ill with cancer and spent a year fighting for his life in 
hospital in Valencia. After recovering he was told the project had restarted, 
and it was finally finished in May 2014. But while the apartments are finished, 
they are boarded up and he still has not got his money back.

“I wouldn’t move in if you paid me. After all the stress I never want to see 
it again,” he said. Now living in a caravan park near Herne Bay, Kent, it is a 
far cry from his planned apartment overlooking the olive groves of Alicante.

He is focusing on a bid to reclaim his money as a result of the supreme court 
ruling and is pursuing his case through law company Spanish Legal Reclaims. Its 
chief executive, Luis Cuervo, says the judgment could force Spanish banks to 
hand back up their money to Britons.

While some UK investors took their property developer to court after the 
crash, it was to little avail.

“Most firms were in administration and buyers were at the bottom of the list 
of creditors,” said Cuervo, adding that the difference now is that the banks 
that held buyers’ deposits may be liable for their loss, he said.

“When somebody puts down a deposit, it should be held in a separate bank 
account but this wasn’t done.”

Many smaller lenders have been taken over by larger banks, but the new bank 
will still be responsible, Cuervo said. “Claims can only be filed once, and 
must be defended one by one in court.”

Cases taken by Spanish Legal Reclaims are on a no-win, no-fee basis, although 
problems have arisen that some people have lost track of their paperwork over 
the past decade.

“This means we will only take on strong cases that we think we can win,” said 
Cuervo. Somebody who put down a €50,000 deposit in 2006 could claim around 
£72,000 including interest, he added. “Our fee would be around €15,000, so you 
would get back your deposit and a bit more.”

Mark Stucklin, founder of expat homes website Spanish Property 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/property> Insight, says those seeking 
redress through a lawyer should ensure there are no payments in advance.

“If anybody asks you to, say, put down £5,000 to win back £50,000, that should 
ring alarm bells,” he said.

Spanish lenders Banco Santander and CaixaBank refused to comment on the 
matter.Juan Valdés Castelló, director of communications at Banco Sabadell, said 
the bank faces a small number of cases arising from failed housing projects 
started by Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo, an Alicante-based bank it bought 
in 2011 for €1 (83p). “We are only involved in a few cases and this is a matter 
that we must solve with our clients,” he said

Spanish property lawyer Raymundo Larraín Nesbitt says the recent change is 
just one of a long string of positive supreme court rulings which favour 
off-plan buyers. However, he warned buyers against being over-optimistic and is 
sceptical of suggestions that up to 100,000 UK payers could be due 
compensation. Claimants face a lengthy battle first.

“Knowing lenders, they are going to put up one heck of a fight, supreme court 
rulings or not,” he said. “Do not expect a swift out-of-court settlement on 
this matter – it won’t happen.”

Legal redress

Thousands of Britons who bought in southern Spain several years before 
the financial crisis found they had poured their money into an overseas 
property only to be told it was illegally built and must be demolished without 
compensation.

In 2002, Maura and John Hillen invested almost £200,000 in a property in the 
Almanzora valley, Andalucia, when they discovered it had been illegally 
constructed and faced demolition.

“The case never went to trial and, though we did incur legal fees, it was a 
small amount compared to some,” Maura said. Afterwards, they joined campaign 
group Abusos Urbanisticos Almanzora (AUAN), which was fighting for Britons and 
other nationalities in a similar position.

Meanwhile, Robert Marsh and his wife Gillian, both in their 70s, sold their 
Kent home in 2005 and invested more than €300,000 on a three-bedroom villa in 
Albox, Almeria, that was subsequently declared illegal.

Stamp duty and second homes: what will I pay?

Maura, now president of AUAN, says it has successfully worked with a network 
of similar associations in Axarquia, Cantabria and Valencia. “We took our case 
to the Senate of Spain, which, after much wrangling, ruled that if a buyer had 
bought their property in good faith they should get compensation if it is 
demolished.”

A second ruling regularised the position of thousands of illegal Andalusian 
properties, while another impending change will help buyers who bought 
properties built on illegally divided parcels of farming land.

AUAN has around 500 members who have contributed over €160,000 to the campaign 
over 10 years.

The Andalusian regional government estimates that 300,000 properties have been 
illegally constructed.

“If you are well organised and stubborn you can eventually get things done, 
even in Spain where everyone told us it was impossible,” Maura said. “But it 
has taken years to get this far and many people have given up or died before 
getting redress.”

AFTER EL BREXIT

For anyone hoping to buy a holiday home in Spain, the vote to leave the 
European Union has raised uncertainties about the future and whether they will 
retain the ability to live and work - as well as own a property - in an EU 
country.

New arrivals could face stricter residency requirements, while existing expats 
could face new administrative arrangements, possibly including residency and 
work permits, or higher property taxes. However, whatever the reality is for 
British people hoping to live abroad, it is not likely to be ascertained until 
the terms around Britain’s exit are finalised.

Seek specialist advice from an English-speaking solicitor who is not connected 
to your seller, estate agent or developer
Clare Nessling, Conti 
Fluctuations in currency - the pound dived against the euro - will be the most 
immediate concern for homebuyers as properties in Spain will immediately be 
more expensive as a result.

Clare Nessling at Conti, an overseas mortgage specialists, says buyers should 
ensure whatever contracts are signed are clear. “Ask your solicitor to confirm 
that the English version is a true translation, to ensure it doesn’t contain 
errors, omissions or extras,” she says. “Lawyer’s fees, local and national 
taxes and insurance can add at least a further 10% to the purchase cost, so 
confirm exactly how much you will have to pay.”

Buyers should get an independent valuation of the property to highlight 
defects such as subsidence, damp, dodgy wiring or boundary disputes. They 
should also confirm that all required permissions, licences and planning 
consents have been obtained, and that they are registered as the official owner.

“Seek specialist advice from an English-speaking solicitor who is not 
connected to your seller, estate agent or developer,” says Nessling.

If buying a new-build property, buyers should check how long the developer has 
been trading and seek references from previous buyers, she says, as well as 
looking at the transport alternatives which are available.

“Your property may be served by a budget airline today, but there is no 
guarantee these cheap flights will continue indefinitely.”
