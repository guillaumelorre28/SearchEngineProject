Australia is being warned its foreign debt levels are “extreme” and savings 
need to be made to avoid a ratings downgrade.

The country’s net foreign debt grew by $28.1bn to $1.045tn over the June 
quarter, prompting the warning by ratings agency Standard & Poors.

“The government will point out that its fiscal position is strong – but it’s 
not quite as strong as it used to be,” John Chambers, chairman of the firm’s 
sovereign ratings committee, told the Australian.

The finance minister, Mathias Cormann

lower than what it would have been if the government had not changed policies 
it inherited from Labor three years ago.

“We are working our way, still, dealing with the messes that they’ve created 
on the fiscal front,” he told ABC Radio.

Last week the International Monetary Fund urged governments around the world 
to take action

 to tackle a record $152tn debt mountain before it triggered a fresh global 
financial and economic crisis.

The IMF said it was vital to intervene early in order to mitigate the risks of 
a repeat of the damaging events that began with the collapse of the US 
sub-prime housing bubble almost a decade ago.

It said that new research in its half-yearly fiscal monitor covering 113 
countries had shown that debt was currently 225% of global GDP, with the 
private sector responsible for two-thirds of the total.

The IMF said fiscal policy, the power governments have over tax and spending, 
could help. It suggested government-led programs to restructure debt and tax 
breaks to persuade creditors to lengthen repayment periods.
