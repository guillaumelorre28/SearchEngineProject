Article 50 court ruling - Summary and analysis

Here are the Guardian’s main stories on today’s article 50 court ruling

 * Theresa May’s plan to trigger Brexit by the end of March will not be 
derailed by a high court ruling that parliament must vote on the decision, No 
10 has insisted. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/brexit-ruling-will-not-derail-article-50-timetable-says-no-10>
 * Official reaction on the continent to the high court’s ruling on article 50 
has been muted, with national governments and the European commission regarding 
the decision as an internal matter. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/article-50-ruling-high-court-brexit-timetable-delay-unwelcome-eu-bloc-diplomats-juncker-may>
 * Parliament alone has the power to trigger Brexit by notifying Brussels of 
the UK’s intention to leave the European Union, the high court has ruled. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules>
 * The pound jumped on the news that negotiations over Britain’s withdrawal 
from the European Union could be delayed, after the high court rejected 
government claims that it has the sole power to trigger article 50.

This is the most important development in the Brexit story since the election 
of Theresa May as prime minister and easily the most encouraging day for those 
who backed remain since the referendum on June 23. I’ve posted vast amounts of 
commentary on this already, but here is what it means in six key points.

1 - The court ruling is much more definitive than anyone expected. (See, for 
example, David Allen Green at4.10pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-581b301be4b0d073c27d112a#block-581b301be4b0d073c27d112a>
The government is appealing to the supreme court, but informed commentators 
seem to think it more likely than not that the government will lose again.

2 - Unless the government does win at the supreme court, parliament will get 
to legislate on invoking article 50. And that means a proper bill, passing 
through the Commons and the Lords, with MPs and peers getting the chance to 
amend it. Theresa May has been refusing to give parliament a vote on the terms 
of Brexit because, once power shifts from the hands of the executive to the 
legislature (see 8.49am) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-581af486e4b0d073c27d0fb0#block-581af486e4b0d073c27d0fb0>
, the prime minister loses some control. The key point about today is that MPs 
and peers have, for the first time, got a strong chance of shaping the start of 
the Brexit process.

3 - The chances of Brexit being overturned are still very minimal. It is just 
about possible to conceive how the UK could stay in the EU (parliament votes to 
insert a second referendum clause into the article 50 Brexit bill, and some 
economic catastrophe results in a sharp change in public opinion by 2018) but 
you would be unwise to bet on it. Most MPs and peers who voted remain accept 
that the result of the referendum should be honoured.

4 - But the chances of Brexit being “soft” not “hard” have increased 
significantly.There is a majority for a “soft” Brexit in parliament and, if 
there is a bill, it will now have the chance to exercise leverage.

5 - There is now a real possibility that Theresa May will not be able to 
trigger article 50 before the end of March.The government says it still intends 
to meet this deadline, but the need to legislate could lead to a delay.

6 - An early election, though by no means inevitable, now does look more 
likely than it did this time yesterday.

That’s all from me for today. I had been intending to cover other stories, but 
I’m afraid this one took over.

Thanks for the comments.

Henry McDonald

The votes of Northern Ireland MPs in the House of Commons could prove critical 
if Theresa May and the government is forced to ask parliament to trigger 
article 50.

All eight Democratic Unionist Party MPs are guaranteed to back Brexit in the 
Commons given that they were the only major political force in the Stormont 
Assembly to active back a leave vote in June’s referendum.

However, the position of the two Ulster Unionist MPs - Fermanagh/South 
Tyrone’s Tom Elliott and Danny Kinahan in South Antrim - is interesting. In 
June UUP leader Mike Nesbitt called for a remain vote.

The UUP has now switched position and said its MPs will back the government to 
allow for the referendum result to be implemented. The party will argue this is 
because the entire electorate of the UK has spoken in the referendum and it is 
their duty to back up that outcome in the Commons.

The switch though may also be due to fears of being further outflanked by the 
DUP especially given a number of recent defections from the UUP to the 
Democratic Unionists. In essence the UUP is again moving to the right in order 
to slow down its decline vis a vis the DUP.

All three SDLP MPs will definitely vote to block Brexit given that the party 
campaigned vigorously for remain and was involved in last week’s failed legal 
action in the Belfast High Court to declare Brexit null and void in Northern 
Ireland only.

Sinn Fein will not vote in the Commons because it boycotts the parliament 
although the party will come under fire accused of failing to add to the Remain 
voices in the chamber that could scupper Brexit.

Yet it is the votes of the unionist bloc that will prove far more critical if 
and when the referendum result is tested in the House of Commons. Expect more 
demands from DUP first Minister Arlene Foster for special treatment for 
Northern Ireland (guaranteed post-Brexit farming subsidies for Ulster 
agriculture for instance) in order to bolster the government’s numbers in a 
Brexit vote .... even one after a general election.

A majority of voters now want Britain to remain in the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, according to a poll, the Press 
Association report.

But there was little sign that the ultra-slim 51%-49% majority in favour of 
remain reflected a change of heart since the 52%-48% referendum vote to leave.

Just 3% of leave voters polled by BMG Research said they would now vote 
remain, while 4% of those who backed EU membership on June 23 said they would 
switch in the other direction.

The remain camp’s advantage came from voters who did not take part in the 
referendum, 46% of whom said they would now back EU membership, against 27% who 
would vote to leave.

BMG found that the Conservatives were ranked the best party to handle Brexit 
negotiations with the remaining EU, with the backing of 36% of voters, against 
10% for Labour, 9% for Ukip and 2% each for Liberal Democrats and Greens.

Osborne calls for a 'substantive discussion' in parliament on Brexit

George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor, has joined those saying 
parliament should now have a proper debate about what Brexit will entail. He 
told Sky News:

The question is not who makes the decision on whether we’re leaving the 
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> because the public have 
made that decision in the referendum.

I think the sooner we get on to the substantive discussion in parliament with 
the government about the nature of our new relationship with Europe, how we’re 
going to trade with these key partners of ours like Germany and France, how 
businesses here in Manchester and across the country are going to have the 
certainty so that they can invest and hire people over the next couple of years 
- for me these are the key issues and I would be arguing for the closest 
possible trading and economic relationship withEurope

we’ve got to respect the referendum.

Tyrie urges government to be 'much more transparent' about its Brexit 
objectives

Here is Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chair of the Commons Treasury committee 
(and a remain voter in June), on the court ruling.

Whatever the supreme court decides, the government should be much more 
transparent about its objectives in the negotiations, in some detail, and the 
sooner the better. It should also ensure that parliament can scrutinise the 
objectives, and vote on them.

There are many good reasons for this. Among several, it can enable the 
construction of broad-based public consent for the UK’s future relationship 
with the EU. The UK is leaving; a public debate is needed about where we want 
to arrive. Before taking off, it is always a good idea for the pilot to discuss 
with the passengers and crew where they might want to land.

Second, clarity about the government’s objectives would enable a serious 
discussion with other Member States to get underway, prior to the triggering of 
article 50.

And third, it can reduce the economic damage caused by uncertainty over the 
likely shape of the UK’s future relationship with the EU. It is the uncertainty 
about the terms of that relationship, far more than the additional time 
required to clarify the negotiating position, that carries the more significant 
cost.

Ladbrokes have cut the odds on a general election taking place next year. It’s 
now at 2/1.

The BBC’s Jeremy Vine seems to agree.

Surely there will now be a general election in 2017. #Brexit

An article 50 court ruling reading list

Here is an article 50 court ruling reading list.

 * David Allen Green, the lawyer and Financial Times legal commentator, says 
the judgment looks “almost appeal-proof”. 
<https://www.ft.com/content/e22dd71e-a1b6-11e6-aa83-bcb58d1d2193> 
The judgment looks, at early glance, to be almost appeal-proof. It was made 
unanimously by three experienced appeal judges, sitting exceptionally at first 
instance: they are the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls and the 
leading public law judge at the court of appeal. It is reasoned and detailed. 
At one point, the court appears to hold that the government’s case was too weak 
to win on its own terms, regardless of the claimants’ case.

Why did the government lose? It seems that the crucial issue is the impact on 
the rights of citizens. If the Article 50notification is irrevocable 
<https://www.ft.com/content/946c95fc-34bb-31f6-855f-ea21d58249c2> then the 
argument is that these rights will be removed automatically in due course. This 
cannot be done, other than by an Act of Parliament.

The government could have side-stepped this difficulty by not accepting that 
the notification was irrevocable (and many, including Lord Kerr who wrote
Article 50 <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50> of the Lisbon 
treaty, say a notification must be revocable). But it saw this legally sensible 
move as politically unacceptable. Looking at the judgment, the impression is 
that the government’s concession on this crucial point determined the outcome 
of the case.

 * Jolyon Maugham, the barrister and legal writer, says in a Financial Times 
article that if the government loses its appeal, Theresa May will not be able 
to trigger article 50 by the end of March as she hopes. 
<http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/11/03/2178734/after-the-high-courts-brexit-decision-forget-about-activating-article-50-in-march/>
Imagine this. It is November 2018. The promised trade deals have failed to 
appear. Unemployment and inflation are on the rise. The public mood towards 
Brexit has turned ugly, and so have negotiations with our biggest and nearest 
trading partner. In that world, any rational MP would wish that, back in 
November 2016, she had left ajar the door to remaining in the EU. Why make the 
decision now, with modest evidence, if you have the opportunity to make it 
later with more?

These points will be debated in the Commons and they must also be debated in 
the Lords.

And, in practical terms, it is difficult to contemplate that these steps – 
drafting a Bill, debating it in the Commons, voting on amendments, placing it 
before the House of Lords and then addressing amendments introduced by the 
Upper Chamber in the Commons again – can sensibly be taken after the result of 
the Supreme Court appeal is known but before March.

So, whatever else the decision means, unless the Supreme Court overturns the 
High Court’s decision, Theresa May’s March deadline will be ancient history.

 * Hannah White at the Institute of Government has a Q&A on what the ruling 
means. 
<http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14858/the-high-courts-ruling-v-the-governments-plan-to-trigger-article-50/>
Will MPs and Lords vote to pass the bill?

This will of course come down to politics. Both the Commons and Lords have a 
majority of members who argued for the UK to remain a member of the EU. But 
politically, they may not wish to vote against the decision of UK voters taken 
through the referendum, particularly as most constituencies outside the 
Scotland, Northern Ireland and the major cities voted against remaining in the 
EU.

Nonetheless, they will wish to ensure that the decision to trigger Article 50 
receives an appropriatedegree of parliamentary scrutiny 
<http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14358/parliaments-role-in-the-brexit-negotiations/>
. Depending on how the bill is drafted – and it is likely to be very short – 
there may be moves to amend it to place conditions on the Government before it 
can trigger Article 50. These could take the form of timing or process 
requirements – for example, a requirement on the Government to provide 
Parliament with information about its negotiating positionbefore triggering 
Article 50 
<http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14819/what-the-government-needs-to-demonstrate-before-it-pulls-the-article-50-trigger/>
.

 * Albert Sanchez-Graells, a law lecturer, says on his EU economic law blog 
that he thinks the appeal to the supreme court will lead to the European Court 
of Justice (or the Court of Justice of the European Union - CJEU) getting 
involved. 
<http://www.howtocrackanut.com/blog/2016/11/3/why-an-appeal-of-the-high-court-parliamentary-brexit>
Now, in case of an appeal of the High Court’s decision before the UKSC, in my 
opinion, the referral to the CJEU is legally unavoidable (I will not deal for 
now with arguments of judicial politics or pragmatic views on the UKSC’s likely 
course of action). Even if the parties do not challenge or even raise to the 
UKSC’s consideration the matter of the (ir)reversibility of and Article 50 
notification, it is a logical given that the UKSC needs to take a stance (even 
if implicit) on this point in order to be able to rule on the case. If it 
quashes the High Court’s decision, it needs to clarify the points of law which 
the High Court would have gotten wrong--one of which concerns the 
irrevocability of an Art 50 notification. if it upholds the High Court’s 
decision, it is (implicitly) accepting the assumption that an Art 50 
notification is irrevocable. Either way, the UKSC cannot escape a substantial 
(implicit) consideration of the interpretation of Article 50.

In my view, this engages the UKSC’s obligation to request a preliminary ruling 
from the CJEU under Article 267(3) TFEU and not doing so triggers a risk of 
infringement of EU law by the UK due to the acts (or omission, in this case) of 
its highest court.

 * Sam Hooper at Semi-Partisan Politics says leave campaigners should not 
worry too much about the judgment. 
<https://semipartisansam.com/2016/11/03/high-court-brexit-article-50-ruling-parliament-vote-leave-eu/>
I don’t really remember the Poll Tax riots 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_Tax_Riots> toward the tail end of 
Thatcher’s government. I mean, I remember seeing stories about it on the news, 
but since I was only eight years old the political ramifications of what I was 
seeing rather eluded me. But despite my hazy memory, I think it is safe to say 
were MPs (and it would have to include many Labour MPs representing 
constituencies which voted to leave the EU) to vote against giving the 
government authority to invoke Article 50, the resulting conflagration would 
make the Poll Tax riots look like a summer picnic on Hampstead Heath.

 * Robert Peston, the ITV political editor, says on Facebook that Brexiteers 
are guilty of hypocrisy. 
<https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1723987487925989> 
It is spectacularly delicious that leading Brexiteers are arguing that the 
High Court today got it wrong today in ruling that we cannot leave the EU 
without the assent of Parliament - in that almost their entire campaign to get 
us out of the EU was that British courts and Westminster must be sovereign, and 
no longer subjugated to Brussels.

 * Jo Murkens at the LSE blog says the ruling was a “proper drubbing” for the 
government. 
<http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/11/03/high-court-article-50-ruling-explained/>
The High Court’s decision is exemplary in its clarity and reasoning. Anyone 
interested in a tutorial on the UK constitution should read the first 56 
paragraphs. The legal challenge was not supposed to be a major obstacle for the 
government. All it needed to assert and defend were the UK’s own constitutional 
requirements. In failing to understand the constitution of its own country, the 
government was taught an embarrassing lesson by the High Court on the Strand.

Grieve says ruling could 'delay slightly' triggering of article 50

Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, has also been 
speaking to Sky News. Here are the key points he made.


 * Grieve said he thought the article 50 ruling could “delay slightly” the 
triggering of article 50.If the government’s appeal failed, there would have to 
be primary legislation, he said. It could be short, but it would be debatable 
and amendable. He said this would not necessarily take a long time. 
At the end of the day you can get primary legislation through parliament quite 
quickly. It has been known to be done in 48 hours, but that’s as an emergency.

But he said this “might delay slightly” the triggering of article 50.

 * He said the government was not ready to trigger article 50 now anway. 
It is worth bearing in mind that the government isn’t ready to trigger article 
50 itself at the moment at all because it doesn’t really know at the moment 
what it is going to do next.

 * He said he did not think Jeremy Wright, his successor as attorney general, 
would have to resign if the government lost its appeal.“This is an issue of 
law, not politics,” he said. 
 * Greive said the high court judgement was “utterly rational”. 
There is a hugely well-established principle in this country that laws and 
statutes conferring rights on people passed by parliament cannot be removed 
without parliament voting to do it. That is what this question is about.

Davis says government will have to pass act of parliament if its appeal to 
supreme court fails

David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has been giving a statement about the 
article 50 ruling to broadcasters. Here are the key points.

 * Davis said that, unless the judgment is overturned on appeal, the 
government will have to pass an act of parliament to trigger article 50.Asked 
if it would be possible for the government to give MPs a say just by having a 
quick vote on a narrow resolution, he said: “That’s not available.” There would 
have to be an act, he said. (In other words, Matthew Scott is right - see 
1.24pm.)

 * He said the government was appealing against the court ruling because, 
although it accepted parliamentary sovereignty, the people were ultimately 
sovereign and 17.4m people voted for Brexit.It was “the biggest mandate in 
history”, he said. And he said that MPs had voted six to one in favour of

<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/high-court-ruling-on-article-50-statement> 
A spokesperson said:

The government is disappointed by the court’s judgment.

The country voted to leave the European Union

referendum.

We will appeal this judgment.

Sturgeon says UK government should accept article 50 ruling and shelve its 
appeal

Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has put out a fresh statement 
about the article 50 ruling. She says the UK government should accept it and 
shelve its appeal. She said:

The high court’s judgment is not a surprise to anyone who has been following 
this case, and the UK government should now accept this decision rather than 
take it to the UK supreme court.

That the UK government is now in the position where the court has ruled 
against it and is insisting that parliament must vote before article 50 can be 
triggered underlines the chaos and confusion at the heart of the Tories’ 
handling of Brexit.

Let’s be clear – the prime minister has not tried to avoid parliament because 
of constitutional principles but because any vote in parliament would expose 
the complete lack of a plan for what Brexit means.

In whatever eventually comes forward from the UK government to parliament, SNP 
MPs will not vote in any way that would undermine Scotland’s interests.

Here are the Guardian’s main stories on today’s article 50 court ruling

 * Theresa May’s plan to trigger Brexit by the end of March will not be 
derailed by a high court ruling that parliament must vote on the decision, No 
10 has insisted. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/brexit-ruling-will-not-derail-article-50-timetable-says-no-10>
 * Official reaction on the continent to the high court’s ruling on article 50 
has been muted, with national governments and the European commission regarding 
the decision as an internal matter. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/article-50-ruling-high-court-brexit-timetable-delay-unwelcome-eu-bloc-diplomats-juncker-may>
 * Parliament alone has the power to trigger Brexit by notifying Brussels of 
the UK’s intention to leave the European Union, the high court has ruled. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules>
 * The pound jumped on the news that negotiations over Britain’s withdrawal 
from the European Union could be delayed, after the high court rejected 
government claims that it has the sole power to trigger article 50.

This is the most important development in the Brexit story since the election 
of Theresa May as prime minister and easily the most encouraging day for those 
who backed remain since the referendum on June 23. I’ve posted vast amounts of 
commentary on this already, but here is what it means in six key points.

1 - The court ruling is much more definitive than anyone expected. (See, for 
example, David Allen Green at4.10pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-581b301be4b0d073c27d112a#block-581b301be4b0d073c27d112a>
The government is appealing to the supreme court, but informed commentators 
seem to think it more likely than not that the government will lose again.

2 - Unless the government does win at the supreme court, parliament will get 
to legislate on invoking article 50. And that means a proper bill, passing 
through the Commons and the Lords, with MPs and peers getting the chance to 
amend it. Theresa May has been refusing to give parliament a vote on the terms 
of Brexit because, once power shifts from the hands of the executive to the 
legislature (see 8.49am) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/03/article-50-high-court-ruling-high-court-set-to-rule-on-whether-mps-should-vote-on-triggering-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-581af486e4b0d073c27d0fb0#block-581af486e4b0d073c27d0fb0>
, the prime minister loses some control. The key point about today is that MPs 
and peers have, for the first time, got a strong chance of shaping the start of 
the Brexit process.

3 - The chances of Brexit being overturned are still very minimal. It is just 
about possible to conceive how the UK could stay in the EU (parliament votes to 
insert a second referendum clause into the article 50 Brexit bill, and some 
economic catastrophe results in a sharp change in public opinion by 2018) but 
you would be unwise to bet on it. Most MPs and peers who voted remain accept 
that the result of the referendum should be honoured.

4 - But the chances of Brexit being “soft” not “hard” have increased 
significantly.There is a majority for a “soft” Brexit in parliament and, if 
there is a bill, it will now have the chance to exercise leverage.

5 - There is now a real possibility that Theresa May will not be able to 
trigger article 50 before the end of March.The government says it still intends 
to meet this deadline, but the need to legislate could lead to a delay.

6 - An early election, though by no means inevitable, now does look more 
likely than it did this time yesterday.

That’s all from me for today. I had been intending to cover other stories, but 
I’m afraid this one took over.

Thanks for the comments.
 
The votes of Northern Ireland MPs in the House of Commons could prove critical 
if Theresa May and the government is forced to ask parliament to trigger 
article 50.

All eight Democratic Unionist Party MPs are guaranteed to back Brexit in the 
Commons given that they were the only major political force in the Stormont 
Assembly to active back a leave vote in June’s referendum.

However, the position of the two Ulster Unionist MPs - Fermanagh/South 
Tyrone’s Tom Elliott and Danny Kinahan in South Antrim - is interesting. In 
June UUP leader Mike Nesbitt called for a remain vote.

The UUP has now switched position and said its MPs will back the government to 
allow for the referendum result to be implemented. The party will argue this is 
because the entire electorate of the UK has spoken in the referendum and it is 
their duty to back up that outcome in the Commons.

The switch though may also be due to fears of being further outflanked by the 
DUP especially given a number of recent defections from the UUP to the 
Democratic Unionists. In essence the UUP is again moving to the right in order 
to slow down its decline vis a vis the DUP.

All three SDLP MPs will definitely vote to block Brexit given that the party 
campaigned vigorously for remain and was involved in last week’s failed legal 
action in the Belfast High Court to declare Brexit null and void in Northern 
Ireland only.

Sinn Fein will not vote in the Commons because it boycotts the parliament 
although the party will come under fire accused of failing to add to the Remain 
voices in the chamber that could scupper Brexit.

Yet it is the votes of the unionist bloc that will prove far more critical if 
and when the referendum result is tested in the House of Commons. Expect more 
demands from DUP first Minister Arlene Foster for special treatment for 
Northern Ireland (guaranteed post-Brexit farming subsidies for Ulster 
agriculture for instance) in order to bolster the government’s numbers in a 
Brexit vote .... even one after a general election.

A majority of voters now want Britain to remain in the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, according to a poll, the Press 
Association report.

But there was little sign that the ultra-slim 51%-49% majority in favour of 
remain reflected a change of heart since the 52%-48% referendum vote to leave.

Just 3% of leave voters polled by BMG Research said they would now vote 
remain, while 4% of those who backed EU membership on June 23 said they would 
switch in the other direction.

The remain camp’s advantage came from voters who did not take part in the 
referendum, 46% of whom said they would now back EU membership, against 27% who 
would vote to leave.

BMG found that the Conservatives were ranked the best party to handle Brexit 
negotiations with the remaining EU, with the backing of 36% of voters, against 
10% for Labour, 9% for Ukip and 2% each for Liberal Democrats and Greens.
 
George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor, has joined those saying 
parliament should now have a proper debate about what Brexit will entail. He 
told Sky News:

The question is not who makes the decision on whether we’re leaving the 
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> because the public have 
made that decision in the referendum.

I think the sooner we get on to the substantive discussion in parliament with 
the government about the nature of our new relationship with Europe, how we’re 
going to trade with these key partners of ours like Germany and France, how 
businesses here in Manchester and across the country are going to have the 
certainty so that they can invest and hire people over the next couple of years 
- for me these are the key issues and I would be arguing for the closest 
possible trading and economic relationship withEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, outside of the EU, because 
we’ve got to respect the referendum.

Here is Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chair of the Commons Treasury committee 
(and a remain voter in June), on the court ruling.

Whatever the supreme court decides, the government should be much more 
transparent about its objectives in the negotiations, in some detail, and the 
sooner the better. It should also ensure that parliament can scrutinise the 
objectives, and vote on them.

There are many good reasons for this. Among several, it can enable the 
construction of broad-based public consent for the UK’s future relationship 
with the EU. The UK is leaving; a public debate is needed about where we want 
to arrive. Before taking off, it is always a good idea for the pilot to discuss 
with the passengers and crew where they might want to land.

Second, clarity about the government’s objectives would enable a serious 
discussion with other Member States to get underway, prior to the triggering of 
article 50.

And third, it can reduce the economic damage caused by uncertainty over the 
likely shape of the UK’s future relationship with the EU. It is the uncertainty 
about the terms of that relationship, far more than the additional time 
required to clarify the negotiating position, that carries the more significant 
cost.

Ladbrokes have cut the odds on a general election taking place next year. It’s 
now at 2/1.

The BBC’s Jeremy Vine seems to agree.

Here is an article 50 court ruling reading list.

 * David Allen Green, the lawyer and Financial Times legal commentator, says 
the judgment looks “almost appeal-proof”. 
<https://www.ft.com/content/e22dd71e-a1b6-11e6-aa83-bcb58d1d2193> 
The judgment looks, at early glance, to be almost appeal-proof. It was made 
unanimously by three experienced appeal judges, sitting exceptionally at first 
instance: they are the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls and the 
leading public law judge at the court of appeal. It is reasoned and detailed. 
At one point, the court appears to hold that the government’s case was too weak 
to win on its own terms, regardless of the claimants’ case.

Why did the government lose? It seems that the crucial issue is the impact on 
the rights of citizens. If the Article 50notification is irrevocable 
<https://www.ft.com/content/946c95fc-34bb-31f6-855f-ea21d58249c2> then the 
argument is that these rights will be removed automatically in due course. This 
cannot be done, other than by an Act of Parliament.

The government could have side-stepped this difficulty by not accepting that 
the notification was irrevocable (and many, including Lord Kerr who wrote
Article 50 <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50> of the Lisbon 
treaty, say a notification must be revocable). But it saw this legally sensible 
move as politically unacceptable. Looking at the judgment, the impression is 
that the government’s concession on this crucial point determined the outcome 
of the case.

 * Jolyon Maugham, the barrister and legal writer, says in a Financial Times 
article that if the government loses its appeal, Theresa May will not be able 
to trigger article 50 by the end of March as she hopes. 
<http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/11/03/2178734/after-the-high-courts-brexit-decision-forget-about-activating-article-50-in-march/>
Imagine this. It is November 2018. The promised trade deals have failed to 
appear. Unemployment and inflation are on the rise. The public mood towards 
Brexit has turned ugly, and so have negotiations with our biggest and nearest 
trading partner. In that world, any rational MP would wish that, back in 
November 2016, she had left ajar the door to remaining in the EU. Why make the 
decision now, with modest evidence, if you have the opportunity to make it 
later with more?

These points will be debated in the Commons and they must also be debated in 
the Lords.

And, in practical terms, it is difficult to contemplate that these steps – 
drafting a Bill, debating it in the Commons, voting on amendments, placing it 
before the House of Lords and then addressing amendments introduced by the 
Upper Chamber in the Commons again – can sensibly be taken after the result of 
the Supreme Court appeal is known but before March.

So, whatever else the decision means, unless the Supreme Court overturns the 
High Court’s decision, Theresa May’s March deadline will be ancient history.

 * Hannah White at the Institute of Government has a Q&A on what the ruling 
means. 
<http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14858/the-high-courts-ruling-v-the-governments-plan-to-trigger-article-50/>
Will MPs and Lords vote to pass the bill?

This will of course come down to politics. Both the Commons and Lords have a 
majority of members who argued for the UK to remain a member of the EU. But 
politically, they may not wish to vote against the decision of UK voters taken 
through the referendum, particularly as most constituencies outside the 
Scotland, Northern Ireland and the major cities voted against remaining in the 
EU.

Nonetheless, they will wish to ensure that the decision to trigger Article 50 
receives an appropriatedegree of parliamentary scrutiny 
<http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14358/parliaments-role-in-the-brexit-negotiations/>
. Depending on how the bill is drafted – and it is likely to be very short – 
there may be moves to amend it to place conditions on the Government before it 
can trigger Article 50. These could take the form of timing or process 
requirements – for example, a requirement on the Government to provide 
Parliament with information about its negotiating positionbefore triggering 
Article 50 
<http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/14819/what-the-government-needs-to-demonstrate-before-it-pulls-the-article-50-trigger/>
.

 * Albert Sanchez-Graells, a law lecturer, says on his EU economic law blog 
that he thinks the appeal to the supreme court will lead to the European Court 
of Justice (or the Court of Justice of the European Union - CJEU) getting 
involved. 
<http://www.howtocrackanut.com/blog/2016/11/3/why-an-appeal-of-the-high-court-parliamentary-brexit>
Now, in case of an appeal of the High Court’s decision before the UKSC, in my 
opinion, the referral to the CJEU is legally unavoidable (I will not deal for 
now with arguments of judicial politics or pragmatic views on the UKSC’s likely 
course of action). Even if the parties do not challenge or even raise to the 
UKSC’s consideration the matter of the (ir)reversibility of and Article 50 
notification, it is a logical given that the UKSC needs to take a stance (even 
if implicit) on this point in order to be able to rule on the case. If it 
quashes the High Court’s decision, it needs to clarify the points of law which 
the High Court would have gotten wrong--one of which concerns the 
irrevocability of an Art 50 notification. if it upholds the High Court’s 
decision, it is (implicitly) accepting the assumption that an Art 50 
notification is irrevocable. Either way, the UKSC cannot escape a substantial 
(implicit) consideration of the interpretation of Article 50.

In my view, this engages the UKSC’s obligation to request a preliminary ruling 
from the CJEU under Article 267(3) TFEU and not doing so triggers a risk of 
infringement of EU law by the UK due to the acts (or omission, in this case) of 
its highest court.

 * Sam Hooper at Semi-Partisan Politics says leave campaigners should not 
worry too much about the judgment. 
<https://semipartisansam.com/2016/11/03/high-court-brexit-article-50-ruling-parliament-vote-leave-eu/>
I don’t really remember the Poll Tax riots 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_Tax_Riots> toward the tail end of 
Thatcher’s government. I mean, I remember seeing stories about it on the news, 
but since I was only eight years old the political ramifications of what I was 
seeing rather eluded me. But despite my hazy memory, I think it is safe to say 
were MPs (and it would have to include many Labour MPs representing 
constituencies which voted to leave the EU) to vote against giving the 
government authority to invoke Article 50, the resulting conflagration would 
make the Poll Tax riots look like a summer picnic on Hampstead Heath.

 * Robert Peston, the ITV political editor, says on Facebook that Brexiteers 
are guilty of hypocrisy. 
<https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1723987487925989> 
It is spectacularly delicious that leading Brexiteers are arguing that the 
High Court today got it wrong today in ruling that we cannot leave the EU 
without the assent of Parliament - in that almost their entire campaign to get 
us out of the EU was that British courts and Westminster must be sovereign, and 
no longer subjugated to Brussels.

 * Jo Murkens at the LSE blog says the ruling was a “proper drubbing” for the 
government. 
<http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/11/03/high-court-article-50-ruling-explained/>
The High Court’s decision is exemplary in its clarity and reasoning. Anyone 
interested in a tutorial on the UK constitution should read the first 56 
paragraphs. The legal challenge was not supposed to be a major obstacle for the 
government. All it needed to assert and defend were the UK’s own constitutional 
requirements. In failing to understand the constitution of its own country, the 
government was taught an embarrassing lesson by the High Court on the Strand.

Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, has also been 
speaking to Sky News. Here are the key points he made.


 * Grieve said he thought the article 50 ruling could “delay slightly” the 
triggering of article 50.If the government’s appeal failed, there would have to 
be primary legislation, he said. It could be short, but it would be debatable 
and amendable. He said this would not necessarily take a long time. 
At the end of the day you can get primary legislation through parliament quite 
quickly. It has been known to be done in 48 hours, but that’s as an emergency.

But he said this “might delay slightly” the triggering of article 50.

 * He said the government was not ready to trigger article 50 now anway. 
It is worth bearing in mind that the government isn’t ready to trigger article 
50 itself at the moment at all because it doesn’t really know at the moment 
what it is going to do next.

 * He said he did not think Jeremy Wright, his successor as attorney general, 
would have to resign if the government lost its appeal.“This is an issue of 
law, not politics,” he said. 
 * Greive said the high court judgement was “utterly rational”. 
There is a hugely well-established principle in this country that laws and 
statutes conferring rights on people passed by parliament cannot be removed 
without parliament voting to do it. That is what this question is about.

David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has been giving a statement about the 
article 50 ruling to broadcasters. Here are the key points.

 * Davis said that, unless the judgment is overturned on appeal, the 
government will have to pass an act of parliament to trigger article 50.Asked 
if it would be possible for the government to give MPs a say just by having a 
quick vote on a narrow resolution, he said: “That’s not available.” There would 
have to be an act, he said. (In other words, Matthew Scott is right - see 
1.24pm.)

 * He said the government was appealing against the court ruling because, 
although it accepted parliamentary sovereignty, the people were ultimately 
sovereign and 17.4m people voted for Brexit.It was “the biggest mandate in 
history”, he said. And he said that MPs had voted six to one in favour of 
letting the people decide through a referendum.  David Davis. Photograph: Sky

Here is the official Downing Street statement on the article 50 ruling. 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/high-court-ruling-on-article-50-statement> 
A spokesperson said:

The government is disappointed by the court’s judgment.

The country voted to leave the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> in a referendum approved by act of 
parliament. And the government is determined to respect the result of the 
referendum.

We will appeal this judgment.
 
MailOnline made its views on the three judges responsible for the article 50 
ruling quite clear in this headline earlier (which has since been amended.)

Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has put out a fresh statement 
about the article 50 ruling. She says the UK government should accept it and 
shelve its appeal. She said:

The high court’s judgment is not a surprise to anyone who has been following 
this case, and the UK government should now accept this decision rather than 
take it to the UK supreme court.

That the UK government is now in the position where the court has ruled 
against it and is insisting that parliament must vote before article 50 can be 
triggered underlines the chaos and confusion at the heart of the Tories’ 
handling of Brexit.

Let’s be clear – the prime minister has not tried to avoid parliament because 
of constitutional principles but because any vote in parliament would expose 
the complete lack of a plan for what Brexit means.

In whatever eventually comes forward from the UK government to parliament, SNP 
MPs will not vote in any way that would undermine Scotland’s interests.
