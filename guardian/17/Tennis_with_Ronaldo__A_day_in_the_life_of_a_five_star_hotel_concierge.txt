My day usually begins in St Pancras station: Eurostar allows us through 
immigration to pick up our guests who are staying in suites. Most of the time, 
the guests are VIPs – they could be a celebrity, a royal or an artist.

Some guests arrive with a list of things they want to do, so I sit down with 
them and suggest the best ways to experience all the things they want to see in 
London. TheSt Pancras Renaissance Hotel London

 also has an app – The Navigator – that helps our guests discover the city. We 
try to make sure our guests discover things that are off the beaten track – not 
just the usual tourist hangouts.

 Mathias Thomas: ‘I constantly need to be in the loop’ 
As you might expect, we get some interesting requests from guests. We once had 
a princess from Saudi Arabia who forgot her mink coat after staying with us, so 
a member of our team had to escort the coat on a train to return it to her in 
Paris – the coat even had its own seat!


I once played tennis in Hyde Park with the football legend Ronaldo. I didn’t 
win, of course, but it was a highlight for me. Meeting Victoria Beckham was 
also pretty special, as was allowing Chris Martin to watch the tennis on my 
mobile phone – he was a pleasure to be around.


In my job, I constantly need to be in the loop and in the know when it comes 
to the latest trends. I’m always reading magazines and checking out lifestyle 
sites online. Even when I’m off duty, everywhere I go I take a mental note of 
what’s available there, in case a guest needs it in future.


In a concierge’s world, in a five-star hotel such as the St Pancras 
Renaissance Hotel London, anything is possible. I recently secured a ticket to 
an Adele gig for a guest at the last minute, and I once arranged for part of 
the Shard’s public viewing platform to be closed down so a guest could propose 
to his girlfriend. You have to know somebody, who knows somebody, who knows 
somebody. We’re well connected: concierges in London all talk to one another 
and help each other out dealing with difficult requests.


There is no such thing as the end of the day for a concierge. My working hours 
are 7am to 7pm, but only the other day I had a call at 10.30pm to help a guest 
get into a private members’ club. I’m always on, but I do get to have some 
great experiences and meet some very interesting people, so it’s all worth it.
