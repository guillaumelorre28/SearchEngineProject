A tunnel is to be built under Stonehenge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/stonehenge> under plans announced by 
ministers, in a move that will reignite the controversy over improving major 
roads around the ancient site.

Chris Grayling <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/chrisgrayling> said he 
was taking a “big decision” to transform the A303, one of the main arteries to 
the south-west and a notorious bottleneck for lorries and holidaymakers, as 
part of a £2bn investment.

The transport secretary said the tunnel could enhance the Stonehenge site by 
removing traffic. The concept has been backed by its custodians, EnglishHeritage
 <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage> and the National Trust.

But others regard it as a scheme that could irreparably damage the world 
heritage site. Last year, the historians Dan Snow and Tom Hollandattacked the 
proposals

.

Snow, the president of the Council for British Archaeology, likened them to 
vandals destroying ancient artefacts. “We have recently started to realise that 
the standing stones are just a beginning. They sit at the heart of the world’s 
most significant and best-preserved stone-age landscape. The government’s plans 
endanger this unique site,” he said.

“Around the world we see pictures of our fellow humans smashing the treasures 
of the past and count ourselves lucky that we live in a country which values 
its rich history and appreciates what it offers modern Britain. Our heritage 
helps us understand ourselves, how we got here and where we are going.”

Holland said: “There is so much waiting to be learned about how Stonehenge was 
built – if we decide, as a country, not to sacrifice it to road building. The 
battle to save our most significant neolithic landscape is an unending one.”

The 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel will run as part of a 7-mile dualled stretch of 
the A303, making the road a more effective link to the M3 and the M5 and 
speeding up journeys to and from the south-west.

A Unesco <https://www.theguardian.com/world/unesco> report approved the plans 
in principle last year, opening the way to resolving two decades of protests 
over new roads around Stonehenge.

Up to £2bn is being spent on the A303

 and other works in the south-west as part of a £15bn road strategyannounced in 
2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/01/government-invest-15bn-roads-strategy-tunnel-stonehenge>
.

Grayling said: “This major investment in the south-west will transform the 
A303 and benefit those locally by cutting congestion and improving journey 
times. It will also boost the economy, linking people with jobs, and businesses 
with customers – driving forward our agenda to build a country that works for 
everyone and not just the privileged few.”

A public consultation will run until March.
