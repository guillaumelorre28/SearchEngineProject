The open question of how Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> will govern is being filled 
in with names of men – and five women, as of early January – floated for 
inclusion in his cabinet and for cabinet-level posts. Trump’s picks reveal a

white men. The picks do not betray a particular faith in the value of prior 
government experience. Here’s the list so far:

, 64, outgoing chairman of ExxonMobil after 41 years with the energy giant. Has 
a history of close business ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who 
bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in 2013. He signed a 2011 
agreement giving his energy company access to the huge resources under the 
Russian Arctic in return for giving the giant state-owned Russian oil company, 
OAO Rosneft, the opportunity to invest in ExxonMobil’s operations overseas.

. According to regulatory filings, Tillerson retains a huge financial interest 
in the energy company, owning $151m in company stock. He may face questions 
from senators over the potential benefits to ExxonMobil from US foreign policy 
if sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea were lifted.

, 66, retired marine corps general. Led troops to combat in both Afghanistan 
and Iraq and rose to top military commands. Stepped down as commander of US 
central command in 2013. Hawkishness especially on Iran put him at odds with 
the Obama administration. Has called for a “new security architecture for the 
Mideast built on sound policy … Iran is a special case that must be dealt with 
as a threat to regional stability, nuclear and otherwise”. Only three years out 
of active duty, would require a congressional waiver of a federal law requiring 
a seven-year cooling off period for defense. Nicknamed “Mad Dog”.Read further

US trade representative: Robert Lighthizer

Lighthizer, 69, a former deputy US trade representative in the Ronald Reagan 
administration. Trump’s pick is intended to add muscle to US trade policy, 
particularly with regard to China. Lighthizer, in his current incarnation as a 
Washington trade lawyer with a top-flight corporate clientele, has testified 
before Congress that the US-China trade deficit is “a major threat to our 
economy” and recommended “a much more aggressive approach in dealing with 
China”. “Bob Lighthizer is very smart, very strategic and totally fearless,” a 
Washington attorney who has worked with him for three decades but asked not to 
be named told Reuters. “You can expect him to use every tool available to 
create leverage to get China and anyone else to stop the cheating. He is no fan 
of the [World Trade Organization].”

misogyny. Seen as opponent of the institutional Republican party, a former 
sharp critic of House speaker Paul Ryan.Read further

Republican pollster who initially backed Ted Cruz for president, Conway joined 
the Trump campaign last July and quickly became one of her boss’s most visible 
– and tenacious – surrogates. Has friends in high places, in the form of 
conservative megadonors Bob and Bekah Mercer. Also has tic of making veiled 
threats – orweren’t those really threats?

Spicer, 45, communications director of the Republican National Committee. In 
transition briefings has been heard to refer reporters’ questions to his boss’s 
Twitter account. A pugnacious critic of the notion that Russia hacked the 
Democratic National Committee or that the Trump administration’s trade policies 
are undercooked. Prepare for a punchy press room.

Icahn, 80, founder of Icahn enterprises. Forbes estimates his net worth at 
$17.6bn. Like Trump, a Queens boy made good. Staunchly anti-regulation. Made a 
fortune as an “activist investor” using minority stakes in companies to do 
battle with corporate boards in order to wring out short-term profits. Said to 
advise Trump closely in his pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, 
which Icahn has criticized, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Homeland security adviser: Thomas Bossert

Former deputy homeland security adviser to president George W Bush. Senior 
cybersecurity fellow at the Atlantic council. Argued ina 2015 op-ed 
<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/18/thomas-bossert-obamas-retreat-from-war-with-the-is/>
 that the use of military force in Iraq “was and remains just” and has argued 
for a more muscular approach in Syria, writing of Barack Obama: “He is seeking 
now to avoid in Syria the use of ground forces for full-scale occupation and 
stabilization. History will decide if unending civil war and global mass 
migration are less costly and disruptive.”
