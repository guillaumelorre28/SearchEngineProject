 Parents of babies whose organs were removed and kept by a Glasgow hospital 
will press for an independent public inquiry when they meet the Scottish health 
minister, Susan Deacon, next week.
The unauthorised removal of baby organs at Yorkhill, Glasgow's main children's 
hospital for sick children, came to light following a public inquiry into 
Bristol royal infirmary this year, which revealed organ retention was common 
practice up and down the country.

Yorkhill admitted in December that it might have failed to explain fully that 
individual organs might be removed during postmortem examinations.

The trust that runs Yorkhill said its practices had been modified in recent 
years, but had always been in line with other hospitals in the UK.

It is not clear how many Scottish families have been affected. 

Yorkhill says it has handled inquiries from concerned families, but declined 
to give an exact figure for the number of children involved.

Some of the Yorkhill parents say they received letters from the hospital 
telling them their babies' organs had been taken without their consent. None 
had been told why the organs were taken.

Roseanne Cadden's son, John Paul, died 14 years ago when he was nine months 
old. Every one of his organs had been removed without her consent.

Morgan Jamieson, Yorkhill trust medical director, said the organs had been 
retained to ensure an exact cause of death or for clinical and education 
purposes.

"We deeply regret the position in which the parents affected now find 
themselves."
