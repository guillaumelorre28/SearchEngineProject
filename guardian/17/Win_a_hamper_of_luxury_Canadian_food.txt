This taste of Canadian history heads up our food hamper: wine marinated smoked 
keta salmon, made by Little Miss Chief, a company founded by a member of 
Esketemc First Nation who uses traditional cold smoking techniques with a 
modern twist. The salmon is Ocean Wise recommended, meaning it is a sustainable 
and ocean-friendly choice.


British Columbia is known for its natural abundance and delicious produce, and 
the hamper has a number of treats in store: from salted caramel pecan popcorn 
or almond butter crunch candy for your sweet tooth, to cooking aids such as 
Solera Pinot Noir Balsamico vinegar or Amola Black Truffle Salt.
