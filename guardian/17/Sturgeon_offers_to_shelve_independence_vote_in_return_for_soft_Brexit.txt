Nicola Sturgeon has said she would take a quick Scottish independence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence> referendum off the 
table if the UK wins a favourable, soft Brexit deal with the EU.

In an apparent retreat from her claims last year that a fast second referendum 
was now “highly likely”, the first minister said her emphasis now was on 
securing a good deal for the Scottish parliament and open access to the single 
market.

“I’m putting these options forward in good faith,” Sturgeon told BBC Radio 
Scotland <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38528058>. 
“I’m deliberately saying put my preferred option [of Scottish independence in 
the EU] to one side and asking people if we can find a consensus and compromise 
option.”

The first minister was asked whether she was now saying that a soft Brexit 
deal meant a quick second independence referendum was no longer “highly likely” 
– the phrase she used immediately after June’s Brexit vote showed thatScotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> wanted to remain in the EU. Sturgeon 
implied the answer was yes.

While insisting she still believed independence would come in time, she said: 
“In the timescale of Brexit, which is what we’re talking about just now, what I 
have just said is if we can find a way of protecting Scotland’s economic 
interests and protecting our democratic interests in the UK, then I’m up for 
trying to do that.”

Sturgeon published a detailed paper just before Christmas asserting that 
Scotland could secure greater, preferential access to the EU single market than 
the rest of the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/20/nicola-sturgeon-make-scotlands-place-in-single-market-integral-to-talks>
, and protect free movement, by becoming part of the European Free Trade 
Association and then the European Economic Area, like Norway.

The Scottish parliament should also be given significant new powers in areas 
currently controlled by the EU such as fisheries, agriculture, environmental 
protection and export policy, when they are repatriated after the UK leaves the 
EU.

Sturgeon’s offer to put independence temporarily aside in favour of a 
compromise deal will be seen as a clear attempt to strengthen her case for a 
second vote if there is a hard Brexit, where the UK is kept out of the single 
market.

EU leaders and diplomats have said this week’s turmoil over the resignation of 
the UK ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, suggested a hard Brexit was now 
far more likely. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/the-guardian-view-on-ivan-rogers-resignation-a-loss-at-a-crucial-time>

Soon after a BBC interview on Friday, Sturgeon tweeted the front page of the 
pro-independence paper the National quoting the Norwegian prime minister, Erna 
Solberg, stating that the UK faces “a very hard Brexit”.

In a further tweet referring to Theresa May, Sturgeon said her quest for an 
amicable solution meant the “ball is in the PM’s court”.

Reasonable assessment. But @ScotGovFM <https://twitter.com/ScotGovFM> 
compromise proposals for so-called 'soft' Brexit put forward in good faith.

Her repositioning also raises the question of what type of Brexit deal will 
satisfy Sturgeon and separately, Scotland’s voters, many of whom could 
reluctantly accept a far more powerful Scottish parliament within the UK.

Constitutional experts say that it will be impossible for Scotland to have 
separate, preferential access to the single market and free movement without 
the rest of the UK included, despite Sturgeon’s stance.

However, all Scottish parties are putting the UK government under increasing 
pressure to greatly strengthen Holyrood’s powers, as a form of Brexit dividend, 
in part to dilute demands for a second independence vote.

On Thursday, Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, warned that Brexit put 
the future of the UK in “terrible peril” because it threatened to bolster 
demand for independence.She said defending the cohesion of the UK was now the 
biggest challenge for 2017. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38512484>

Her critics will argue Sturgeon’s apparent retreat reflects political reality. 
There is little evidence of strong popular support for a quick second 
referendum: a Scottish National party drive to contact 2 million voters before 
Christmas appears to have flopped.


Recent opinion polls have shown a majority of Scottish voters now oppose a 
quick second vote, including a third of SNP supporters, after a short-lived 
surge in support for a fast rerun after the Brexit vote in June.

Setting aside the question of timing, the latest TNS poll in the Herald put 
overall support for leaving the UK at 45.5% (excluding don’t knows) 
<http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/14997280.Majority_of_Scots_oppose_second_independence_vote_in_2017__poll_shows/>
, the same level as the yes vote in the 2014 independence referendum.

While the UK’s departure from the EU would satisfy a key test set by Sturgeon 
for a second independence vote – that of a material change in Scotland’s 
constitutional status – her most important test – that of meeting popular 
demand – has not yet been met.


Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative party leader, said: “The first 
minister knows that if another referendum on independence was called tomorrow, 
she’d lose. Polls show fewer and fewer Scots agree with her separation 
obsession, and support for the question being asked again has collapsed.”

Sturgeon’s advisers accept that voters might also shy away from taking further 
risks given the election of Donald Trump as the next US president and that 
greater global instability could dampen support for a quick independence vote.

However, they also point out that they have not yet started a pro-independence 
campaign and argue that 45% backing for independence puts them in a far 
stronger position than in 2012, when the yes campaign began with support at 35%.
