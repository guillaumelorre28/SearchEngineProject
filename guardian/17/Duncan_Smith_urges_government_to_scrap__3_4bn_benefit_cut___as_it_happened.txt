Afternoon summary

 * Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, has 
urged ministers to abandon planned cuts to universal credit worth £3.4bn.
Speaking in a Commons debate, he said that this was a subject “close to my 
heart” and that work allowances - the amount people can earn before losing 
universal credit - were crucial. He went on: 
If we really want to see the right thing happen to people out there who try 
and get into work and stay in work, the allowances are critical.

And I would recommend and hope that my colleagues in government will think 
very carefully again about the decision to reduce those allowances.

I recognise the problem with the deficit and of course we want to reduce that, 
and I’m not asking for more money. I’m asking for wiser spending of the money 
...

We have a very good opportunity now to do something that is really bold, and 
bold and right for those that we really want to improve the lives of, which the 
prime minister rightly said was her target group.

It is a very conservative thing to do to help people who are doing the right 
thing to improve their lives.

Duncan Smith said if the government cannot reverse the proposed cuts for 
everyone affected it should prioritise single parents and the disabled. He went 
on:

I urge my colleagues, my honourable friends, to do just this, it is the right 
thing to do, it will be the thing to do that changes lives and improves the 
quality of those lives.

He was speaking in a debate on a Labour motion saying the proposed £3.4bn work 
allowance cuts and a £1.4bn cut to employment and support allowance (a 
disability benefit) should be reversed. Labour’s motion has just been defeated.

 * Pollsters underestimated the strength of the leave vote in the EU 
referendum because they failed to pick up the extent to which the less educated 
were prepared to back Brexit, a leading polling expert has said.Professor John 
Curtice - whose exit poll in the 2015 general election was the first to 
indicate an overall Conservative victory - said the way people voted in the 
referendum was different to the way they vote in general elections. As the 
Press Association reports, he told a briefing organised by NatCen Social 
Research: 
There was a very substantial difference by education in people’s willingness 
to vote leave or remain. This was a referendum which was essentially between 
the social liberals and the social conservatives in our society, which is 
rather different division from the one the opinion polls are usually trying to 
estimate, which is between left and right. That is a division which is centred 
much more around class than around education.

 * Exiled islanders will not be allowed to resettle on the British-controlled 
Chagos Islands, the government has announced. 
<http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-11-16/HCWS260/>
In a Commons written statement Sir Alan Duncan, a Foreign Office minister, said:
The manner in which the Chagossian community was removed from the Territory in 
the 1960s and 1970s, and the way they were treated, was wrong and we look back 
with deep regret. We have taken care in coming to our final decision on 
resettlement, noting the community’s emotional ties to BIOT [British Indian 
Ocean Territory] and their desire to go back to their former way of life.

This comprehensive programme of work included an independent feasibility study 
followed by a full public consultation in the UK, Mauritius and the Seychelles.

I am today announcing that the government has decided against resettlement of 
the Chagossian people to the British Indian Ocean Territory on the grounds of 
feasibility, defence and security interests, and cost to the British taxpayer. 
In coming to this decision the Government has considered carefully the 
practicalities of setting up a small remote community on low-lying islands and 
the challenges that any community would face. These are significant, and 
include the challenge of effectively establishing modern public services, the 
limited healthcare and education that it would be possible to provide, and the 
lack of economic opportunities, particularly job prospects. The government has 
also considered the interaction of any potential community with the US Naval 
Support Facility – a vital part of our defence relationship.

The government will instead seek to support improvements to the livelihoods of 
Chagossians in the communities where they now live. I can today announce that 
we have agreed to fund a package of approximately £40m over the next ten years 
to achieve this goal.

 * The Scottish Parliament is to seek expenses from independence campaigners 
who camped out on its grounds after spending more than £100,000 on legal action.
 As the Press Association report, the IndyCamp group were evicted from the site 
earlier this month after losing an appeal against their removal. The parliament 
spent £105,890 of public money on the legal action, including more than £67,000 
on the petition for the campers’ removal and more than £38,000 fighting their 
unsuccessful appeal. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Another Europe is Possible, which was set up as a progressive remain campaign 
during the EU referendum 
<http://www.anothereurope.org/another-europe-is-possible-letter-in-the-guardian/>
, and which was backed by Labour figures, has put out a statement this 
afternoon criticising the shadow chancellor John McDonnell for being too 
willing to accept Brexitin his speech yesterday.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/15/mcdonnell-urges-government-to-adopt-labours-pro-investment-fiscal-rules-politics-live?page=with:block-582af3b9e4b0eb4ebf2743cf#block-582af3b9e4b0eb4ebf2743cf>

Michael Chessum, the group’s national organiser (and a member of Momentum’s 
steering committee), said:

We would not support using parliament to directly block Brexit - but what is 
the point of our MPs having the right to vote on article 50 if they do not use 
it to extract concessions against hard Brexit? Labour must champion the 
progressive elements of EU membership: free movement, workers’ rights, the 
environment and human rights. Doing this is not about betraying the will of the 
people - it is about opening up the negotiating process to public scrutiny. And 
doing it effectively means retaining parliamentary leverage over article 50.

The group also criticises McDonnell for saying in his speech that opposing 
Brexit or even delaying article 50 would place Labour “against the majority 
will of the British people and on the side of certain corporate elites, who 
have always had the British people at the back of the queue”. Luke Cooper, 
Another Europe is Possible’s convenor, said:

We are at a loss to know what kind of political strategy involves condemning 
your own people as ‘certain corporate interests’ against ‘the will of the 
British people’. At a time of rising nationalism and right wing populism this 
choice of language is irresponsible and wrong. The overwhelming majority of 
Labour members backed remain. They were joined by two thirds of Labour voters 
and 48 per cent of the country.

Lunchtime summary

 * Being in or out of the EU customs union was “not a binary decision”, 
Theresa May said during a sometimes noisy prime minister’s questions dominated 
by the strategy for Brexit – or what her critics say is the lack of one. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/16/theresa-may-eu-plan-corbyn-brexit-shambles-pmqs>
 As Peter Walker reports, May repeatedly insisted that she and her ministers 
were devising a coherent plan for exiting the EU but would not share details 
before negotiations began. After the SNP’s Angus Robertson asked about comments 
by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, that the UK would probably leave the 
EU customs union but retain some access to the single market, May said: “The 
right honourable gentleman doesn’t seem to understand that the customs union is 
not just a binary decision.” Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, focused his 
questions almost entirely on Brexit and argued that the government was “making 
a total shambles” of it. 
 * May has expressed “absolute confidence” in Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of 
the child abuse inquiry.She was speaking at PMQs after the Labour MP Lisa Nandy 
asked about the inquiry, and today’s BBC report saying another lawyer working 
there has resigned. 
 * May has refused to say whether the government has discussed giving a 
peerage to the outgoing Ukip leader Nigel Farage.The SNP’s George Kerevan asked 
if there have been any official conversations on this topic and May replied: 
All I can say to you, I’m afraid, is that such matters are normally never 
discussed in public.

Later a spokeswoman for May would not comment on whether Farage might get one 
but added:

You will have heard the prime minister talk in October about her views on the 
honours system and making sure that it recognises people who really contribute 
to society and their communities.

This was a slightly odd answer because peerages are no longer supposed to be 
given out as honours. They are given to people who will contribute to the 
Lords, and the argument for giving Farage a peerage is based on the fact that 
Ukip have only three peers in the Lords (all defectors, not people appointed as 
Ukip peers) despite coming third in terms of vote at the general election, whil 
the Lib Dems have 104 peers.

 * May has refused to condemn Donald Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims from 
entering America. When the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard asked about this, May said 
that the UK would “ensure the dignity of our citizens” but that it was “up to 
the US what rules they put in place”. She also said she wanted the special 
relationship to continue. 
 * An overwhelming majority of voters - 90% - want Britain to continue to 
trade freely in goods and services with its European neighbours after quitting 
the EU, according to a survey.But seven out of 10 (70%) think the UK should be 
able to limit the number of EU citizens coming to live and work in the country 
- something leading European politicians say is not compatible with the single 
market membership required to permit untrammelled free trade. As the Press 
Association reports, forced to choose between the two priorities, voters 
questioned by NatCen Social Research opted by the narrowest of margins for 
immigration controls, with 49% thinking freedom of movement for EU citizens 
should be kept if it enables the UK to keep free trade, and 51% opposing it. 
NatCen senior research fellow Professor John Curtice said the findings 
suggested voters are not attracted by either the “hard Brexit” or “soft Brexit” 
scenarios which are often presented as the only options in Britain’s withdrawal 
negotiations. 
 * Michael Gove, the former cabinet minister and leading Brexit campaigner, 
has pressed experts on how the UK could achieve a “quickie divorce” with the EU 
regardless of the economic consequences, as he raised concerns that civil 
servants were over-complicating the process. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/16/michael-gove-raises-question-of-quickie-divorce-for-uk-from-eu>
 * The generation that grew up under Margaret Thatcher were the first to start 
with lower incomes than their parents and have endured an increasingly divided 
Britain, according to the government’s social mobility commission. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/16/uks-social-mobility-problem-holding-back-thatcher-generation-says-report>
 * There has been a surge in the number of eastern Europeans working in 
Britain since the EU referendum but numbers from France, Germany and other 
western European countries have dipped, according to official figures. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/16/surge-eastern-europeans-working-uk-since-eu-referendum-brexit>
 * British citizens could have to pay to visit continental Europe after 
Brexit, under plans outlined by the EU executive. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/16/british-travellers-face-5-euro-fee-to-visit-europe-after-brexit>
 * Britain’s statements around severing of aid to middle-income countries 
including China and India created the impression that it had stopped all 
funding to the countries, when in fact the government is still giving both 
nations millions of pounds. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/16/uk-government-led-public-to-believe-aid-india-ended-watchdog-says-department-international-development-dfid>
 As Karen McVeigh reports, a review by the watchdog scrutinising 
taxpayer-funded UK aid said that theDepartment for International Development 
(DfID) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/department-for-international-development-dfid>
 had given the impression that “all aid was being phased out”. “The UK may no 
longer have a traditional aid relationship with these countries but it is 
spending [official development assistance] in Brazil, India and China – and it 
is rather diffident about admitting this” the review by theIndependent 
Commission for Aid Impact <http://icai.independent.gov.uk/> (Icai) found. Such 
“obfuscating” about “perfectly legitimate activities in these countries” had 
given opportunities for criticism, it said. 
 * Progressive politicians from all parties must “get out of their tribal 
huddles” and forge a new centrist home for voters who are “desperately worried” 
about the direction Theresa May is taking the country in the wake of the Brexit 
vote, Paddy Ashdown has urged.

Theresa May <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> needs a new

PMQs - Verdict

PMQs - Verdict: That was not an especially memorable PMQs but, as I argued 
earlier, it was one that saw Jeremy Corbyn expose some of the weaknesses in the 
government’s Brexit position (or non-position - the point is, there is no 
agreed strategy) reasonably effectively. Theresa May will not be losing any 
sleep about this yet, but today’s Ipsos MORI poll findings on how the 
government is handling Brexit (see 11.26am)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/16/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-uk-wants-brexit-deal-that-is-intellectually-impossible-says-eurozone-chief-politics-live?page=with:block-582c4144e4b090fc8128173c#block-582c4144e4b090fc8128173c>
ought to generate at least a little concern in Downing Street.

 The main thrust of May’s response was that (and I paraphrase) the splits in 
her government are nothing compared to the divisions on Brexit in the shadow 
cabinet. In the chamber this attack line did not really work, but May is right 
to say there are tensions in Labour on this subject. In his economy speech 
yesterday John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, indicated that the party would 
oppose any move to demand a second referendum on the EU, even though some 
Labour MPs are in favour and the party conference (by mistake) passed a motion 
calling for a second referendum. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-today-interview?page=with:block-57eb7a44e4b04cbd30bc3d39#block-57eb7a44e4b04cbd30bc3d39>
 The lawyer and Labour blogger Jolyon Maugham has written a strong blog today 
criticising McDonnell’s tactics. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/11/labour-has-checkmated-itself-brexit>
 This has not erupted as a full-blown row yet, but at some point in the future 
it might.

As usual, I missed the question from Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at 
Westminster, because I was writing up a snap verdict. So here is a quick 
summary. He started by asking aboutthe Institute for Government analysis saying 
the government’s Brexit plans are “chaotic and dysfunctional”. 
<http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/brexit-autumn-statement-not-leaked-memo-will-tell-us-more>
 May replied:

The most important thing for this government to do is calmly and carefully get 
on with the job of preparing for complex negotiations and one of the most 
important things we can do is not give a running commentary.

Robertson then asked about Boris Johnson’s statement about how the UK would 
probably leave the customs union.

May said that the issue of whether to leave the customs union or remain in it 
was not a “binary choice”. And she said that only two years ago, in the 
independence referendum, the SNP wanted to take Britain out of the single 
market.

May says the common travel area with Ireland started in 1923. She says the

Philip Shipley, a Conservative, asks if May will reverse the Labour rule 
saying prisoners could be released halfway through their sentences.

May says this is an issue that was of concern when she was home secretary. 
What is important is to rehabilitate ex-offenders, she says.

social media companies are held to account for facilitating online bullying.

Labour’s Lisa Nandy says the child abuse inquiry has lost three chairs and 
eight senior lawyers. And there are senior allegations that have gone 
uninvestigated, she says.

May says it is important that the inquiry must continue. Having seen the work 
Prof Alexis Jay did in Rotherham, she has absolute confidence in her ability to 
run the inquiry.

Alberto Costa, a Conservative, says his parents are Italian. They have been 
here 50 years, but have never naturalised. Can May assure him he will never be 
asked to vote for them to leave?

May says she wants EU nationals to be able to stay. But she must protect the 
rights of Britons living in EU countries. She says she hopes they can reach a 
deal “at an early stage”.

 * Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, has 
urged ministers to abandon planned cuts to universal credit worth £3.4bn.
Speaking in a Commons debate, he said that this was a subject “close to my 
heart” and that work allowances - the amount people can earn before losing 
universal credit - were crucial. He went on: 
If we really want to see the right thing happen to people out there who try 
and get into work and stay in work, the allowances are critical.

And I would recommend and hope that my colleagues in government will think 
very carefully again about the decision to reduce those allowances.

I recognise the problem with the deficit and of course we want to reduce that, 
and I’m not asking for more money. I’m asking for wiser spending of the money 
...

We have a very good opportunity now to do something that is really bold, and 
bold and right for those that we really want to improve the lives of, which the 
prime minister rightly said was her target group.

It is a very conservative thing to do to help people who are doing the right 
thing to improve their lives.

Duncan Smith said if the government cannot reverse the proposed cuts for 
everyone affected it should prioritise single parents and the disabled. He went 
on:

I urge my colleagues, my honourable friends, to do just this, it is the right 
thing to do, it will be the thing to do that changes lives and improves the 
quality of those lives.

He was speaking in a debate on a Labour motion saying the proposed £3.4bn work 
allowance cuts and a £1.4bn cut to employment and support allowance (a 
disability benefit) should be reversed. Labour’s motion has just been defeated.

 * Pollsters underestimated the strength of the leave vote in the EU 
referendum because they failed to pick up the extent to which the less educated 
were prepared to back Brexit, a leading polling expert has said.Professor John 
Curtice - whose exit poll in the 2015 general election was the first to 
indicate an overall Conservative victory - said the way people voted in the 
referendum was different to the way they vote in general elections. As the 
Press Association reports, he told a briefing organised by NatCen Social 
Research: 
There was a very substantial difference by education in people’s willingness 
to vote leave or remain. This was a referendum which was essentially between 
the social liberals and the social conservatives in our society, which is 
rather different division from the one the opinion polls are usually trying to 
estimate, which is between left and right. That is a division which is centred 
much more around class than around education.

 * Exiled islanders will not be allowed to resettle on the British-controlled 
Chagos Islands, the government has announced. 
<http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-11-16/HCWS260/>
In a Commons written statement Sir Alan Duncan, a Foreign Office minister, said:
The manner in which the Chagossian community was removed from the Territory in 
the 1960s and 1970s, and the way they were treated, was wrong and we look back 
with deep regret. We have taken care in coming to our final decision on 
resettlement, noting the community’s emotional ties to BIOT [British Indian 
Ocean Territory] and their desire to go back to their former way of life.

This comprehensive programme of work included an independent feasibility study 
followed by a full public consultation in the UK, Mauritius and the Seychelles.

I am today announcing that the government has decided against resettlement of 
the Chagossian people to the British Indian Ocean Territory on the grounds of 
feasibility, defence and security interests, and cost to the British taxpayer. 
In coming to this decision the Government has considered carefully the 
practicalities of setting up a small remote community on low-lying islands and 
the challenges that any community would face. These are significant, and 
include the challenge of effectively establishing modern public services, the 
limited healthcare and education that it would be possible to provide, and the 
lack of economic opportunities, particularly job prospects. The government has 
also considered the interaction of any potential community with the US Naval 
Support Facility – a vital part of our defence relationship.

The government will instead seek to support improvements to the livelihoods of 
Chagossians in the communities where they now live. I can today announce that 
we have agreed to fund a package of approximately £40m over the next ten years 
to achieve this goal.

 * The Scottish Parliament is to seek expenses from independence campaigners 
who camped out on its grounds after spending more than £100,000 on legal action.
 As the Press Association report, the IndyCamp group were evicted from the site 
earlier this month after losing an appeal against their removal. The parliament 
spent £105,890 of public money on the legal action, including more than £67,000 
on the petition for the campers’ removal and more than £38,000 fighting their 
unsuccessful appeal. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
Another Europe is Possible, which was set up as a progressive remain campaign 
during the EU referendum 
<http://www.anothereurope.org/another-europe-is-possible-letter-in-the-guardian/>
, and which was backed by Labour figures, has put out a statement this 
afternoon criticising the shadow chancellor John McDonnell for being too 
willing to accept Brexitin his speech yesterday.  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/15/mcdonnell-urges-government-to-adopt-labours-pro-investment-fiscal-rules-politics-live?page=with:block-582af3b9e4b0eb4ebf2743cf#block-582af3b9e4b0eb4ebf2743cf>

Michael Chessum, the group’s national organiser (and a member of Momentum’s 
steering committee), said:

We would not support using parliament to directly block Brexit - but what is 
the point of our MPs having the right to vote on article 50 if they do not use 
it to extract concessions against hard Brexit? Labour must champion the 
progressive elements of EU membership: free movement, workers’ rights, the 
environment and human rights. Doing this is not about betraying the will of the 
people - it is about opening up the negotiating process to public scrutiny. And 
doing it effectively means retaining parliamentary leverage over article 50.

The group also criticises McDonnell for saying in his speech that opposing 
Brexit or even delaying article 50 would place Labour “against the majority 
will of the British people and on the side of certain corporate elites, who 
have always had the British people at the back of the queue”. Luke Cooper, 
Another Europe is Possible’s convenor, said:

We are at a loss to know what kind of political strategy involves condemning 
your own people as ‘certain corporate interests’ against ‘the will of the 
British people’. At a time of rising nationalism and right wing populism this 
choice of language is irresponsible and wrong. The overwhelming majority of 
Labour members backed remain. They were joined by two thirds of Labour voters 
and 48 per cent of the country.
 
 * Being in or out of the EU customs union was “not a binary decision”, 
Theresa May said during a sometimes noisy prime minister’s questions dominated 
by the strategy for Brexit – or what her critics say is the lack of one. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/16/theresa-may-eu-plan-corbyn-brexit-shambles-pmqs>
 As Peter Walker reports, May repeatedly insisted that she and her ministers 
were devising a coherent plan for exiting the EU but would not share details 
before negotiations began. After the SNP’s Angus Robertson asked about comments 
by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, that the UK would probably leave the 
EU customs union but retain some access to the single market, May said: “The 
right honourable gentleman doesn’t seem to understand that the customs union is 
not just a binary decision.” Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, focused his 
questions almost entirely on Brexit and argued that the government was “making 
a total shambles” of it. 
 * May has expressed “absolute confidence” in Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of 
the child abuse inquiry.She was speaking at PMQs after the Labour MP Lisa Nandy 
asked about the inquiry, and today’s BBC report saying another lawyer working 
there has resigned. 
 * May has refused to say whether the government has discussed giving a 
peerage to the outgoing Ukip leader Nigel Farage.The SNP’s George Kerevan asked 
if there have been any official conversations on this topic and May replied: 
All I can say to you, I’m afraid, is that such matters are normally never 
discussed in public.

Later a spokeswoman for May would not comment on whether Farage might get one 
but added:

You will have heard the prime minister talk in October about her views on the 
honours system and making sure that it recognises people who really contribute 
to society and their communities.

This was a slightly odd answer because peerages are no longer supposed to be 
given out as honours. They are given to people who will contribute to the 
Lords, and the argument for giving Farage a peerage is based on the fact that 
Ukip have only three peers in the Lords (all defectors, not people appointed as 
Ukip peers) despite coming third in terms of vote at the general election, whil 
the Lib Dems have 104 peers.

 * May has refused to condemn Donald Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims from 
entering America. When the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard asked about this, May said 
that the UK would “ensure the dignity of our citizens” but that it was “up to 
the US what rules they put in place”. She also said she wanted the special 
relationship to continue. 
 * An overwhelming majority of voters - 90% - want Britain to continue to 
trade freely in goods and services with its European neighbours after quitting 
the EU, according to a survey.But seven out of 10 (70%) think the UK should be 
able to limit the number of EU citizens coming to live and work in the country 
- something leading European politicians say is not compatible with the single 
market membership required to permit untrammelled free trade. As the Press 
Association reports, forced to choose between the two priorities, voters 
questioned by NatCen Social Research opted by the narrowest of margins for 
immigration controls, with 49% thinking freedom of movement for EU citizens 
should be kept if it enables the UK to keep free trade, and 51% opposing it. 
NatCen senior research fellow Professor John Curtice said the findings 
suggested voters are not attracted by either the “hard Brexit” or “soft Brexit” 
scenarios which are often presented as the only options in Britain’s withdrawal 
negotiations. 
 * Michael Gove, the former cabinet minister and leading Brexit campaigner, 
has pressed experts on how the UK could achieve a “quickie divorce” with the EU 
regardless of the economic consequences, as he raised concerns that civil 
servants were over-complicating the process. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/16/michael-gove-raises-question-of-quickie-divorce-for-uk-from-eu>
 * The generation that grew up under Margaret Thatcher were the first to start 
with lower incomes than their parents and have endured an increasingly divided 
Britain, according to the government’s social mobility commission. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/nov/16/uks-social-mobility-problem-holding-back-thatcher-generation-says-report>
 * There has been a surge in the number of eastern Europeans working in 
Britain since the EU referendum but numbers from France, Germany and other 
western European countries have dipped, according to official figures. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/16/surge-eastern-europeans-working-uk-since-eu-referendum-brexit>
 * British citizens could have to pay to visit continental Europe after 
Brexit, under plans outlined by the EU executive. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/16/british-travellers-face-5-euro-fee-to-visit-europe-after-brexit>
 * Britain’s statements around severing of aid to middle-income countries 
including China and India created the impression that it had stopped all 
funding to the countries, when in fact the government is still giving both 
nations millions of pounds. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/16/uk-government-led-public-to-believe-aid-india-ended-watchdog-says-department-international-development-dfid>
 As Karen McVeigh reports, a review by the watchdog scrutinising 
taxpayer-funded UK aid said that theDepartment for International Development 
(DfID) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/department-for-international-development-dfid>
 had given the impression that “all aid was being phased out”. “The UK may no 
longer have a traditional aid relationship with these countries but it is 
spending [official development assistance] in Brazil, India and China – and it 
is rather diffident about admitting this” the review by theIndependent 
Commission for Aid Impact <http://icai.independent.gov.uk/> (Icai) found. Such 
“obfuscating” about “perfectly legitimate activities in these countries” had 
given opportunities for criticism, it said. 
 * Progressive politicians from all parties must “get out of their tribal 
huddles” and forge a new centrist home for voters who are “desperately worried” 
about the direction Theresa May is taking the country in the wake of the Brexit 
vote, Paddy Ashdown has urged. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/16/paddy-ashdown-urges-british-progressive-centre-to-unite> 
And this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> on Twitter.

It’s mixed, but more pro-Corbyn than pro-May.

agreed strategy) reasonably effectively. Theresa May will not be losing any 
sleep about this yet, but today’s Ipsos MORI poll findings on how the 
government is handling Brexit (see 11.26am)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/16/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-uk-wants-brexit-deal-that-is-intellectually-impossible-says-eurozone-chief-politics-live?page=with:block-582c4144e4b090fc8128173c#block-582c4144e4b090fc8128173c>
ought to generate at least a little concern in Downing Street.

 The main thrust of May’s response was that (and I paraphrase) the splits in 
her government are nothing compared to the divisions on Brexit in the shadow 
cabinet. In the chamber this attack line did not really work, but May is right 
to say there are tensions in Labour on this subject. In his economy speech 
yesterday John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, indicated that the party would 
oppose any move to demand a second referendum on the EU, even though some 
Labour MPs are in favour and the party conference (by mistake) passed a motion 
calling for a second referendum.

 The lawyer and Labour blogger Jolyon Maugham has written a strong blog today 
criticising McDonnell’s tactics.

 This has not erupted as a full-blown row yet, but at some point in the future 
it might.
 
As usual, I missed the question from Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at 
Westminster, because I was writing up a snap verdict. So here is a quick 
summary. He started by asking aboutthe Institute for Government analysis saying 
the government’s Brexit plans are “chaotic and dysfunctional”.

 May replied:

The most important thing for this government to do is calmly and carefully get 
on with the job of preparing for complex negotiations and one of the most 
important things we can do is not give a running commentary.

Robertson then asked about Boris Johnson’s statement about how the UK would 
probably leave the customs union.

May said that the issue of whether to leave the customs union or remain in it 
was not a “binary choice”. And she said that only two years ago, in the 
independence referendum, the SNP wanted to take Britain out of the single 
market.
 
Labour’s Albert Owen says the port of Holyhead in his constituency benefits 
from free trade with Ireland.

May says the common travel area with Ireland started in 1923. She says the 
government recognises the importance of keeping it.
 
The SNP’s George Kerevan asks if there have been any official discussions 
about giving Nigel Farage a peerage.

May says such matters are normally never discussed in public.
 
Philip Shipley, a Conservative, asks if May will reverse the Labour rule 
saying prisoners could be released halfway through their sentences.

May says this is an issue that was of concern when she was home secretary. 
What is important is to rehabilitate ex-offenders, she says.
 
The SNP’s Stewart Malcolm McDonald asks what the government will do to ensure 
social media companies are held to account for facilitating online bullying.

May says the Home Office is aware of this issue. It is best addressed by the 
terms and conditions of the companies themselves.
 
Nigel Evans, a Conservative, asks what May will do to improve trade with 
Donald Trump’s America.

May says she wants to discuss this with Trump at “a very early stage”.
 
Labour’s Lisa Nandy says the child abuse inquiry has lost three chairs and 
eight senior lawyers. And there are senior allegations that have gone 
uninvestigated, she says.

May says it is important that the inquiry must continue. Having seen the work 
Prof Alexis Jay did in Rotherham, she has absolute confidence in her ability to 
run the inquiry.
 
Julian Lewis, the Conservative chair of the defence committee, says the BBC is 
planning to end its monitoring service. If it does that, that would be a 
disaster, he says. He says it only costs £20m.

May says the government recognises how important this service (monitoring 
foreign broadcasts) is for the government. The government is talking to the BBC 
about this, she says.
 
Labour’s Judith Cummins asks May to bring about parity for people with 
dementia for end-of-life care.

May says the government has set a target to increase the number of dementia 
friends, and investment is going up. But the government is committed to 
improving end-of-life care.
 
Alberto Costa, a Conservative, says his parents are Italian. They have been 
here 50 years, but have never naturalised. Can May assure him he will never be 
asked to vote for them to leave?

May says she wants EU nationals to be able to stay. But she must protect the 
rights of Britons living in EU countries. She says she hopes they can reach a 
deal “at an early stage”.
