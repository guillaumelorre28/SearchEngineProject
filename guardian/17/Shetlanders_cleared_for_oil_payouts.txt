 The government has dropped a claim for £1m in compensation over the sinking of 
the Braer oil tanker off Shetland in 1993, it said yesterday.
The move by Westminster and the devolved Scottish administration will enable 
people in Shetland to pursue their compensation claims.

The vessel's insurers have also said they will not pursue a salvage claim. And 
officials said the combined effect of yesteday's moves should enable £5.2m to 
be made available to local people.

The sinking of the Braer off Shetland in January 1993 was one of the world's 
biggest oil spills. Nearly 85,000 tonnes of crude spilled into the sea in 
Britain's worst such calamity since the Torrey Canyon sinking in 1967.

But the widespread environmental catastrophe that was feared was averted by 
hurricane-force winds dispersing and breaking down nearly all the oil.

Three years later, the international oil pollution compensation fund froze 
compensation payouts, fearing that claims could exceed the £50m available.

Last year the fund's governing bodies agreed that payouts could resume when 
the outstanding claim total dropped below £20m, and yesterday's moves bring the 
figure within that threshold.
