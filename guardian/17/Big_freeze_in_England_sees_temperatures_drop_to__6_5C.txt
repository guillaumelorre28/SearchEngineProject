Temperatures in Britain varied by more than 15 degrees on Wednesday morning, 
with the mercury passing 9C (48.2F) inScotland

south-east England.

Cloudy skies resulted in milder weather in the north, while clear skies in the 
south led to a much chillier start to the day.

The Met Office recorded a temperature of 9.1C in Sutherland, Scotland, at 
about 4am, while a low of -6.5C was recorded in Frittenden, Kent, at about 
5.45am.

Writtle in Essex and Goudhurst in Kent experienced lows of -6.1C, with the 
south-east widely seeing temperatures of -5C and -6C.

The south-east had clear skies overnight and, with cold air coming from the 
continent, temperatures dropped. Other parts of the country were under a 
blanket of cloud, which helped keep temperatures up.

“Two ends of the spectrum of winter weather,” said Craig Small, a forecaster. 
“It’s definitely a big contrast today across the country.”

As the day progresses, the difference in temperature is expected to become 
less pronounced, with a high of 10C or 11C forecast for Scotland, and 
temperatures in the south-east expected to climb to 4C or 5C.
