Google <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> has said it will ban 
ads for payday loans because they can be “deceptive or harmful”.

The ban, which will come into force globally from 13 July, will cover loans 
that can be due within 60 days and, in the US, loans that carry an annual 
interest rate of 36% or higher.

In a blog post 
<http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/an-update-to-our-adwords-policy-on.html>
, Google’s director of public policy, David Graff, wrote: “Research has shown 
that these loans can result in unaffordable payment and high default rates for 
users so we will be updating our policies globally to reflect that.

“This change is designed to protect our users from deceptive or harmful 
financial products.”

The ban will not cover mortgages, car loans, student loans, commercial loans 
or credit cards, said Graff, adding: “We’ll continue to review the 
effectiveness of this policy, but our hope is that fewer people will be exposed 
to misleading or harmful products.”

In a quote accompanying the announcement, Wade Henderson, the president and 
chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said: 
“This new policy addresses many of the longstanding concerns shared by the 
entire civil rights community about predatory payday lending.

“These companies have long used slick advertising and aggressive marketing to 
trap consumers into outrageously high-interest loans – often those least able 
to afford it.”

Payday loans <https://www.theguardian.com/money/payday-loans> have come under 
scrutiny in recent years after an explosion in short-term lending following the 
2008 financial crash. Problems experienced by some people in meeting payments 
have provoked concerns both in the UK and the US.

In 2014, tighter regulation was imposed on the industry in the UK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/apr/01/half-payday-lenders-may-leave-market>
, subjecting the market to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority.

Russell Hamblin-Boone, the chief executive of the Consumer Finance 
Association, which represents payday lenders, said the move by Google would 
affect people’s freedom of choice.

“UK consumers enjoy a vibrant, highly competitive credit market and we will be 
interested to read the evidence that Google uses to justify overruling open 
market advertising of a legal, regulated industry to deny people freedom of 
choice,” he said.

“Short-term loans are a legal source of credit used by millions of people 
across the UK and the industry is highly regulated with a cap on the total cost 
of credit. Under such intense scrutiny the rogue firms have been driven out of 
the market and reputable lenders will only lend to people who can afford to 
borrow.”
