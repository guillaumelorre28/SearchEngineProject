Oslo’s new leftist city government said Monday it wants to ban private cars 
from the city centre by 2019 as part of a plan to slash greenhouse gas 
emissions.


The Labour Party and its allies the Socialist Left and the Green Party, 
winners of the 14 September municipal elections in the Norwegian capital, 
presented a platform focused on the environment and the fight against climate 
change.

The programme envisages a ban on private vehicles in the city centre which, 
according to the Verdans Gang newspaper, is home to only about 1,000 people but 
where some 90,000 work.

The new city government did not give details of how the plan would be 
implemented.

But the proposal has sparked concerns among local businessmen, who noted that 
11 of the city’s 57 shopping centres are in the planned car-free zone.

The ban on automobiles is part of a plan to slash emissions of greenhouse 
gases by 50% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.

The new city authorities also plan to divest fossil fuels from their pension 
funds, build more bicycle lanes, subsidise the purchase of electric bicycles 
and reduce automobile traffic over the city as a whole by 20% by 2019 and 30% 
by 2030.

“In 2030, there will still be people driving cars but they must be 
zero-emissions,” Lan Marie Nguyen Berg, a member of the Green Party, told a 
news conference.

Norwegian media said the largely ceremonial post of city mayor would go to 
Marianne Borgen of the Socialist Left and not Shoaib Sultan, the candidate of 
the Green Party, who thereby misses out on becoming one of the first Muslims to 
lead a major European city.
