The news in clues

We do like a spot of the uncanny: the same word clued differently by different 
setters; the overlap between crosswords and real-lifeintelligence

incidents 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/may/12/crossword-unsolved-mystery-d-day-puzzles-leonard-dawe>
.

For example: in a recent prize puzzle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/26968> (here are the annotated 
solutions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2016/aug/26/annotated-solutions-for-prize-26968>
) by Paul (here’s hisMeet the Setter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2011/sep/22/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-paul>
), he offered this clue ...


 * 3d/9ac Slovakia and Jamaica (via Romania) both have breakfast (7,4)
[a breakfast item hidden in SLOVAKIA and JAMAICAVIAROMANIA] 
... where the setter notices that OVA and CAVIAR are secreted away, making 
them POACHED EGGS. Meanwhile, the non-puzzle pages of the papers were reporting 
thatSlovakian police had seized 74 eggs from Amazonian parrots, apparently 
stolen in Jamaica 
<http://www.webnoviny.sk/slovensko/clanok/346847-zabranili-najvacsiemu-pasovaniu-vajec-chranenych-vtakov/>
 and smuggled into the EU.

“Total fluke,” Paul insisted to me upon questioning, just as he insisted in 
April thathis BURGESS / MACLEAN / PHILBY / BLUNT puzzle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/apr/11/crossword-roundup-covert-spies-and-cats-whiskers>
 had nothing to do with a newly unearthed video of Kim Philby that was about to 
appear in the news. Ah, but Paul: whatever it is that you’re involved in, the 
solvers and spooks-manqués at Fifteen Squared are on to you

Corrections and clarifications

In our previous post, I wondered 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/aug/22/crossword-roundup-the-olympics-that-never-were>
 why setters had avoided the Rio Olympics. I had, in fact, the day before, 
solveda Sunday Times puzzle 
<https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/crosswords/cryptic/#crossword/b6649b055515555401567466cc8700fd/open>
 by that paper’s newest setter, David McLean, which included among its answers 
TRACK, THROW, HEAD START and indeed RINGS among many other theme words.

I would love to be able to claim that I was forced by the rules of this blog 
to remain quiet about a puzzle with a solution which had not yet been 
published. The solution hadn’t, but the shameful truth is that I missed the 
connection.My 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/nov/26/crossword-roundup-whose-bad>
 heartfelts to McLean, especially as he had gone to such pains to construct a 
puzzle that (a) took the Olympics as its theme and (b) did not alienate the 
sports-averse by requiring specialist knowledge. One themed puzzle for an 
international event is a stunningly low number, but not as low as the zero I 
claimed.

All I can do in the circumstances, I suppose, is to make the slighted setter’s 
name the subject of our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue DAVID?

Clueing competition

Thanks for your clues for GHAZI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2016/aug/22/crossword-roundup-the-olympics-that-never-were>
. Schroduck gets the ingenuity award for the intricate “Fascist right wing 
replaces left in African country – scandal when backed by the US?”, and I 
enjoyed the geographical reach this time, from Robi23’s tidy “Originally good 
Hashemite and zealous Iraqi king” to Alberyalbery’s domestic “In Scarborough a 
zip incident causes scandal”.

The runners-up are DameSweeneyEggblast’s helpful “At first ‘-gate’ heralded a 
zillion infamies ...” and ComedyPseudonym’s ingenious “A champion of the Arabs, 
though a Zionist at heart”; the winner is ID2155366’s deft “Scandal of 
thousands being exchanged in the toilet”.

Kludos to “ID”; please leave this fortnight’s entries and your pick of the 
broadsheet cryptics below.
