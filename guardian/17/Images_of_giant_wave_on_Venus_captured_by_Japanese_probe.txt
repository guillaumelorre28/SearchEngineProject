A Japanese spacecraft that is circling Venus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/venus> has beamed home pictures of one of 
the largest waves ever seen in the solar system.

The Akatsuki probe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/10/dawn-second-time-venus> 
captured images of the giant wave in the Venusian cloud tops where it became 
one of the most prominent features in the planet’s atmosphere for four days in 
December 2015.


Cameras onboard the spacecraft recorded the pressure wave in the atmosphere 
stretching over 10,000km (6,214 miles) from the northern polar region across 
the equator to the planet’s southern pole.

Named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, Venus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/venus> is the second rock from the sun and 
the hottest planet in the solar system thanks to arunaway greenhouse effect 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/17/was-venus-the-first-habitable-planet-in-our-solar-system>
 that makes temperatures top 460C (860F) – above those found even onMercury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/mercury>.

Scientists at the Japanese space agency believe that surface winds produced 
the massive stationary wave on Venus when they slammed into the 
4,500-metre-high (14,764 feet) Aphrodite Terra mountain range near the planet’s 
equator.

“Such stationary waves can have a very large scale, perhaps the greatest ever 
observed in the solar system,” the researchers write in the journalNature 
Geoscience <http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ngeo2873>. The unusual waves 
may even be powerful enough to affect the climate on the planet, the scientists 
add.


The Akatsuki spacecraft used infrared and ultraviolet cameras to capture 
images of the enormous wave 65km (40 miles) above the ground in the thick 
sulphuric acid clouds that shroud the planet. The centre of the wave was 
directly above the western slope of the Aphrodite Terra highlands.


On Venus, clouds sweep by at 350km per hour (217 miles per hour), which is 
much faster than the speed at which the planet rotates beneath. The planet 
spins so slowly that a day on Venus lasts longer than a year there.


The Japanese spacecraft swung into orbit around Venus in December 2015 and 
snapped pictures of the wave until the observations were cut short to allow 
mission controllers to work on the spacecraft’s trajectory and communications.
