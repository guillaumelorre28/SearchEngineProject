Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to 
help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next 
Saturday’s paper.

This week’s question:

I’ve been given a Fitbit Flex by my partner. I’m a bit of a couch potato and 
reckon I won’t use it that much. Should I try and take it back and swap it for 
something else, or can other Fitbit users convince me it’s worth keeping? Did 
it work for you?
