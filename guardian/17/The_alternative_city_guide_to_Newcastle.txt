Newcastle is famously a party town, a destination for stags and hens keen to 
hit the Bigg Market or the bling bars of Collingwood Street’s so-called Diamond 
Strip. But, as in any great northern city, there is another side to Newcastle. 
Look in the right places (Pilgrim Street’s Creative Quarter, orOuseburn Valley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/dec/22/ouseburn-newcastle-art-scene>, 
a stroll or short bus ride away), and there’s a tight-knit Geordie underground 
of agitators who, in their own punky, persistent way maintain a vibrant arts 
ecology – with a distinctive political edge.

They might be glibly dismissed as hipsters, but Newcastle’s creatives (many of 
them natives) are generally unpretentious doers working on shoestring budgets. 
They are quietly but unapologetically determined to carve out their own space 
in this frequently misunderstood city. That stubborn desire to make things 
happen in Newcastle dates back decades.

In the 1960s, a famous reading room, Morden Tower <http://www.mordentower.org/>
, brought icons such as Allen Ginsberg to town. The photographicSide Gallery 
<http://www.amber-online.com/side-gallery/> has been documenting working-class 
Newcastle since 1977. In a city where making a living from art can seem 
fanciful, projects are often happily uncommercial. Newcastle breeds relative 
musical oddballs such asBeth Jeans Houghton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/beth-jeans-houghton>, Maxïmo Park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/maximopark>, Richard Dawson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/21/richard-dawson-singer-songwriter-one-to-watch>
 orEat Fast <https://www.facebook.com/eatfastmusic/>, as well as tiny, boutique 
record labels (Cel36 <http://cel36.com/>, 104 <https://104records.bandcamp.com/>
,alt.vinyl <http://www.altvinyl.com/>). There is nonetheless real camaraderie 
among its creative tribes and with other marginalised groups. Next year, techno 
night Backdrop will host Sound Of Solidarity, an event exploring the creation 
of safe, racially and sexually diverse club spaces. Such radical ideas are 
never far from the surface in Newcastle.

How much Newcastle city council values this can vary. At times, it has been 
instrumental in practically assisting grassroots creativity. For instance, it 
rehoused the DIY cinemaStar and Shadow <https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/> and 
helped turn several abandoned, city centre office blocks into temporary spaces 
for arts organisations. However, the Creative Quarter is in a precarious 
position. One block will soon go in the name of regeneration, and the council’s 
decision to allowthe demolition of community and arts centre Uptin House 
<http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/campaigners-devastated-after-controversial-uptin-12113546>
 has appalled campaigners such as artist and bar-ownerKathryn Hodgkinson 
<http://kathrynhodgkinson.com/>:

“We’re at the mercy of aggressive development that is annihilating a lot of 
these projects. A lot of what [the council] needs to do to protect this sector 
has nothing to do with money. It’s about having strong policies in place. We’ve 
got a spineless planning department. I think it needs to say no to more.”

You hear a similar complaint from those involved in catering. The past few 
years have seenNewcastle breweries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/feb/20/newcastle-top-10-craft-beer-pubs>
, itsstreet food 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jan/27/top-10-budget-restaurants-cafes-newcastle>
 and even a Michelin-star restaurant,House of Tides <http://houseoftides.co.uk/>
, flourish, butCook House <http://cookhouse.org/> cafe owner Anna Hedworth 
says: “A massive chain restaurant development has just opened at Intu Eldon 
Square and I think that will have an impact on the independent scene.”

Come April, this artists’ studio complex will need to find a new home, but, 
until then, be sure to visit its bookshop (which specialises in rare and 
self-published artists’ works) and its experimental, artist-led gallery, whose 
shows, says artist Kathryn Hodgkinson, are always “serious and very 
interesting”. New Bridge’s latest major project considered contemporary Britain 
under the title Hidden Civil War. In the same building, the “tiny, brilliant”
Alphabetti Theatre <http://www.alphabettitheatre.co.uk/> programmes new work in 
theatre, poetry and cabaret, as well as housing a neat little boho bar.

 Vane Gallery. 
Each May, Newcastle’s art hubs – from the Baltic <http://www.balticmill.com/> 
to hastily banged-together DIY spaces – throw open their doors for a two-day, 
late-night cultural crawl. Many of those involved, such as the self-explanatory
Northern Print <http://northernprint.org.uk/home.html>, exciting contemporary 
galleryVane <http://vane.org.uk/> or Ouseburn’s original, non-profit studio 
complex,36 Lime Street <http://36limestreet.co.uk/>, have exhibition spaces 
that are regularly open to the public, but several normally private spaces 
open, too. Similarly, November’sOuseburn Open Studios 
<http://ouseburnopenstudios.org/> sees artists and designers open workshops to 
talk with and sell directly to the public.

 Social at Breeze Creatives. 
Energetic cultural facilitator Breeze manages artists’ studios and rehearsal

shows diverse, interrogative work from national and international artists in 
all manner of media – from video installation to adventurous oil paintings.

Star and Shadow

More than just a cinema, Star and Shadow is a radical, socially engaged 
cultural nexus that enables grassroots music, debate and more. Following a move 
from its Stepney Bank site, it is being rebuilt by the volunteers who run it – 
opening in May 2017. “They’re a very special group,” says Hodgkinson. “They’ve 
all trained themselves in various techniques and they’re rebuilding it, brick 
by brick.” Star and Shadow has been putting on limited pop-up film events, but, 
otherwise, get your cinematic kicks at the local indie,Tyneside Cinema

Since the early 1980s, and in various incarnations, World HQ has been a 
lynchpin of Newcastle’s underground scene. A politically charged, anti-racist 
rallying point in its early days, it is still commited to inclusivity – without 
being overly earnest about it. It operates over two self-contained floors 
within Curtis Mayfield House. “You might have a dub night going on downstairs 
and a major techno DJ on upstairs,” says Joe Clarke, co-promoter of the techno 
night, Backdrop. “World is incredible at bringing multi-genre music and 
different communities together.”

The Cluny 

It is now owned by regional brewery group Camerons, but the Cluny remains 
independent in spirit. As a meeting place and gig venue, it is essential to 
Newcastle’s alternative music scene. “It’s a venue everyone wants to play and 
be involved with. It just has that feeling,” says Bob Allan of music 
development agencyGenerator <http://generator.org.uk/>. The smaller, 
half-seated Cluny 2 room is, says NARC.’s Dupree, “really good for getting 
personal with a band: the stage isn’t very high, and it’s dark, intimate”.

In Chinatown, this 300-capacity rave den is where, at nights such as ape-X, 
Bleep and Jaunt, Newcastle’s faithful come to restore mind, body and soul via 
the medium of underground electronic music. “Cosmic is true to house and 
techno, both in the club’s build – it has a rough-edged, warehouse feel – and 
in its incredible wall of sound,” says Clarke, whose Backdrop night features 
extended sets from DJs such as Levon Vincent and Jane Fitz (11 January).

Aside from Think Tank? <http://www.thinktanknewcastle.com/#new-page-40>, 
Newcastle lacks tiny basements clubs where new bands can hone their sound. 
Instead, local promoters flit between sympathetic venues such as theCumberland 
Arms <http://www.thecumberlandarms.co.uk/>, the Dog and Parrot 
<http://thedogandparrot.co.uk/>, and the architecturally magnificent Mining 
Institute <https://mininginstitute.org.uk/>. The annual Evolution Emerging 
<http://evolutionemerging.com/> festival (May 2017) happens in bars, rehearsal 
rooms and artist studios across Ouseburn. “It’s a matter of getting creative 
with spaces because there aren’t loads of specific indie venues,” says 
organiser Bob Allan.

SR44 

Newcastle’s LGBT scene revolves around Times Square, and this warehouse space 
is the area’s most musically credible landmark. “It has Berlin style,” says Joe 
Clarke admiringly. Particularly when it plays host to the city’s best house and 
techno nights, such as Body Talk orMilk The Cow 
<http://www.milkthecowpodcast.com/>, expect to find a mixed gay and 
gay-friendly crowd here. “Milk The Cow is a bit of a movement,” says Clarke. 
“Its podcast covers social and political issues and it is great at bringing 
together people of different ages and ethnicities.”
