 * The widower of Jo Cox has become embroiled in a war of words with Nigel 
Farage after criticising the Ukip politician for saying the Berlin Christmas 
market attack would reflect Angela Merkel’s “legacy”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/20/nigel-farage-accuses-jo-cox-widower-brendan-cox-of-supporting-extremism>
 * Nicola Sturgeon has called on Theresa May to make a plan for Scotland to 
remain in the single market – even if the UK leaves – “an integral element” of 
negotiations with the EU after triggering article 50.

 * George Osborne and Nick Clegg have been spotted having lunch near

hard Brexit.

 * Ed Miliband has urged the government to block Rupert Murdoch’s bid for the 
whole of Sky in an impassioned speech to MPs, arguing that the media and 
political landscape had not changed since his previous takeover attempt failed 
five years ago. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/20/ed-miliband-slams-sky-bid-murdoch-has-learned-nothing>
 * Russia has been “a very malign influence” while leading the Syrian peace 
initiative involving Iran and Turkey, the Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan 
has said, adding he is not convinced Moscow wants to solve the crisis. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/20/russia-a-malign-influence-in-syria-says-uk-foreign-minister>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for all the good wishes.

As I said earlier, I’m not expecting to do a live blog tomorrow. But I am 
planning to write a long Brexit article which should go online at some point in 
the day.

Theresa May's evidence to the liaison committee - Summary

Here are the key points from Theresa May’s evidence to the Commons liaison 
committee.

 * May refused to commit to giving MPs a vote on the final Brexit deal. (See 
2.19pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/20/theressa-may-liaison-committee-brexit-sturgeon-single-market-says-leaving-single-market-would-be-potentially-devastating-for-scotland-politics-live?page=with:block-58593d20e4b06265ff0d50c4#block-58593d20e4b06265ff0d50c4>
 * She said she was in favour of a transitional deal to allow time for new 
arrangements to be implemented. But she refused to say that negotiating this 
would be a “priority”. (See 2.23pm  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/20/theressa-may-liaison-committee-brexit-sturgeon-single-market-says-leaving-single-market-would-be-potentially-devastating-for-scotland-politics-live?page=with:block-58593d20e4b06265ff0d50c4#block-58593d20e4b06265ff0d50c4>
and2.27pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/20/theressa-may-liaison-committee-brexit-sturgeon-single-market-says-leaving-single-market-would-be-potentially-devastating-for-scotland-politics-live?page=with:block-58593f22e4b0966513aec014#block-58593f22e4b0966513aec014>
 * She said the government would not be trying to extend the two-year period 
within which the Brexit negotiation is supposed to be concluded. 
 * She signalled that she would not support the plans published by the 
Scottish government earlier today that would allow Scotland to stay in the 
single market if the rest of the UK left. She told the MPs: 
What we will be negotiating is a United Kingdom approach and a United Kingdom 
relationship with theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. I 
think you’ve assumed an acceptance of differential relationships which I don’t 
think it’s right to accept.

I said when I became prime minister and first met the first minister that we 
will look very seriously at any proposals that come forward from the devolved 
administrations, but there may be proposals that are impractical.

 * She hinted that the government was making contingency plans for what it 
might have to do if the two-year Brexit talks end without a deal. 
 * She defended the decision to include students in net migration figures - 
even though Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Philip Hammond, the 
chancellor, have expressed doubts about this. She told the MPs: 
The target figures are calculated from the overall migration figures and 
students are in the overall migration figures because it is an international 
definition of migration, which is used by countries around the world.

Having students in that overall migration figure actually showed us when we 
first came into government that what we had seen in the previous 13 years of 
Labour government was significant abuse of the student visa system into the 
United Kingdom.

 * She confirmed that the government was still committed to getting annual net 
migration below 100,000. 
 * She said she would give a speech in January giving more detail about her 
approach to Brexit. 
I will be making a speech early in the new year setting out more about our 
approach and about the opportunity I think we have as a country to use this 
process to forge a truly global Britain that embraces and trades with countries 
across the world.

 * She refused to confirm that MPs would be given as much information about 
the Brexit negotiations as MEPs.(The European parliament has a formal role in 
the Brexit talks, and there are provisions that will allow some MEPs to be 
briefed in private about the ongoing negotiations.) 
 * She indicated the government would not be producing plans for the long-term 
reform of social care quickly. Facebook

Here is some Twitter comment on Theresa May’s liaison committee appearance.

From the Independent’s Rob Merrick
Rob Merrick (@Rob_Merrick) 
Classic May answer to “You accept there have been public health 
cuts?”….."There have been changes to the way public health is funded” 1/2

From the Sun’s Steve Hawkes
steve hawkes (@steve_hawkes) 
Tobe fair to the PM I don't think the EU will have ever met a politician who 
gives away as little. Britain may bore Brussels in2 Brexit deal

From the Guardian’s Lisa O’Carroll

Can't help noticing Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> twists her head lower and 
further to right under pressure at this v interesting Liaison select committee

May now gives Tyrie the PaddingtonBareHardStare. Asked again if Parl to get a

From the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman
Isabel Hardman (@IsabelHardman) 
Not sure how long May is going to manage to keep answering her own questions 
rather than the ones the Liaison Committee members actually ask

From Business Insider’s Adam Bienkov
Adam Bienkov (@AdamBienkov) 
May so far: "Negotiations are negotiations”… "The answer I gave is the answer 
I gave" and "You will see what we publish when we publish it."

Unless anything very dramatic happens later this week this will be the last 
proper Politics Live of 2017. And, like the Queen, I’ve got a Christmas 
message. It’s thanks. Writing a blog means I engage with readers much more than 
I used to when I was doing conventional news journalism and 80/90% of the time 
it’s a pleasure. I always learn something new when I read comments BTL, 
engaging with readers who criticise constructively definitely sharpens up my 
reporting and I am particularly grateful to those who point out the numerous 
typos etc. Besides, I enjoy the company. So thank you to all those who read, 
and to all those who comment.

Have a very happy Christmas, and I’ll be back on Tuesday 3 January.

Tyrie says three select committee chairs - Meg Hillier from the public 
accounts committee, Betts and Wollaston - all stressed the need for a 
cross-party approach on this.

He ends by thanking May for “an extremely interesting session”. 

He says she will appear again after the Easter recess, by which time people 
will have a much better idea of what is happening on Brexit.

And that’s it. I’ll post a summary soon.

Q: Will the final settlement for adult social care look at the need for health 
and social care to work together. And should they have a combined budget?

May says the government will look at health as part of its social care review. 
The government needs to recognise the interaction between care and health, she 
says.

Q: Will you look at how you fund health in the long term. These issues are 
connected.

May says at the moment she is focusing on social care.

Q: Are you prepared to commission a major long-term review of what to do about

May is now answering questions about the NHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> and social care. Clive Betts, the 
Labour chair of the communities committee, is asking them now.

Q: Spending on social care fell by 9% in real terms in the last parliament. In 
your terms, do you accept crisis means crisis?

May says in some areas more people are getting care. She says an important 
factor is how well services are delivered.

Q: There was no new money in the statement last week. And increasing the 
precept in poor areas will not cover the extra money they have to spent because 
of the “national living wage”.

May says she can name some authorities where more people are getting care. She 
says the announcement allows council to bring forward precept money. After 
that, money from the Better Care Fund becomes available.

She repeats the point about councils needing to improve how services are 
delivered.

And in the long-term further reform is needed, she says.

May refuses to confirm that MPs will get as much information about Brexit 
talks as MEPs

Q: David Davis said parliament would get at least as much information about 
the negotiation as the European parliament. Is that your view?

May says she and Davis both want parliament to be informed.

Q: So that is a yes?

May says she wants parliament to be able to discuss the issues. The European 
parliament has a specific role in the negotiations which the UK parliament does 
not

Tyrie says that sounds like a no. 

 * May refuses to confirm that MPs will get as much information about the 
Brexit negotiations as MEPs. 
He goes on.

Q: Do you want parliament to vote on a final deal?

May says she wants parliament to have every opportunity to consider these 
matters. But she wants to ensure that the government delivers on what the 
people want.

Q: Is that a yes or a no?

That is my answer.

Q: Article 50, subclause 3, specifically says the deal could be implemented at 
some point in the future.

May says subclause 3 is about extending the negotiations.

Tyrie reads out subclause 3 
<http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html>
. It says:

The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of 
entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after 
the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in 
agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this 
period.

Tyrie says he does not accept May’s interpretation. He says May was clear 
about not wanting to extend the negotiating period. But what about delaying 
implementation?

May says there “may be some practical aspects that require a period of 
implementation thereafter”.

Q: So could use article 50, subclause 3, to negotiate an implementation date 
after the end of the two year period.

May says they will discuss this.

She says government may need extra time to implement the deal.

But the amount of time needed will depend on what the deal is.

 * May confirms there may be a case for delaying implementation of the Brexit 
deal.(This is another way of her confirming that there could be a transitional 
deal.) Facebook

 My colleague Anushka Asthana has been sending me some of May’s direct quotes, 
and so I have been beefing up some of the earlier posts - on whether MPs get a 
vote, and on a transition period - to include them. To get them to show up, you 
may need to refresh the page.

May hints government doing contingency planning in case no deal struck in two 
years

Crispin Blunt, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee, goes 
next.

May indicates the government is drawing up contingency plans for what might 
happen if the UK does not get a deal in two years.
Paul Waugh (@paulwaugh) 
Asked by Blunt if Govt has conting planning for no Brexit deal done by 2019, 
May: "We are looking at ALL the scenarios that might pertain"

<https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/811224443792097280> 
Q: Will your article 50 letter cover what aspects of a trade deal can be 
negotiated by the commission, and which have to be agreed by all member states.

May indicates this will not be part of the article 50 letter.

Q: What would happen if there were no deal after two years.

May says the other 27 states would have to decide whether or not to prolong 
the negotiations.

May defends decision to include students in the migration target

Q: The chancellor, the foreign secretary, the home secretary, and the previous 
chancellor, all think students should be excluded from your migration target?

May says they are in the figures ...

Q: I’m asking about the target.

May says the target relates to the figures. She says including students is in 
line with international practice. There used to be a problem with the abuse of 
student visas, she says.

Cooper says:

You don’t have a way to meet the target. It’s a bit of a mess on immigration.

Tyrie says the bogus student issue has been addressed. International students 
are a success story. Shouldn’t students be excluded?

May says she uses the international definition.

Q: So that’s a no.

May says the governments uses the international definition.

This is getting tetchy. Cooper used to shadow May at the Home Office, and so 
these two have “previous”. May is not enjoying Cooper’s line of questioning at 
all, and her bonhomie is evaporating.

May confirms government still committed to getting net migration below 100,000.

Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, goes next.

Q: Will you include plans for immigration controls in the plan?

May says the government is working on plans. It will publish them when they 
are ready.

Q: If there is a tension between what would be in the best interests of 
Britain and your net migration target, will you ditch the target?

May says Cooper is assuming that you can make that judgment.

She says Cooper should know that looking at immigration numbers is not an 
exact science. You cannot look at it in the way Cooper proposes, she says.

She says she wants the best deal for operating in the single market, as well 
as allowing the UK to control immigration.

Q: But you used to blame the EU for not being able to meet your target. Will 
you aim to get EU migration down to 50,000?

May says she will do what is best for the UK?

Q: If you cannot do both, will you ditch the target?

May says the government will maintain its target of getting net migration 
below 100,000. That is important, she says. Migration affects people on low 
incomes.

 * May confirms government still committed to getting net migration below 
100,000. 
Q: Who do you want not to come?

May says people voted to get control of immigration.

Thanks for all the good wishes.

As I said earlier, I’m not expecting to do a live blog tomorrow. But I am 
planning to write a long Brexit article which should go online at some point in

Here are the key points from Theresa May’s evidence to the Commons liaison 
committee.

 * May refused to commit to giving MPs a vote on the final Brexit deal. (See 
2.19pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/dec/20/theressa-may-liaison-committee-brexit-sturgeon-single-market-says-leaving-single-market-would-be-potentially-devastating-for-scotland-politics-live?page=with:block-58593d20e4b06265ff0d50c4#block-58593d20e4b06265ff0d50c4>

arrangements to be implemented. But she refused to say that negotiating this 
would be a “priority”. (See 2.23pm

 * She said the government would not be trying to extend the two-year period 
within which the Brexit negotiation is supposed to be concluded. 
 * She signalled that she would not support the plans published by the 
Scottish government earlier today that would allow Scotland to stay in the 
single market if the rest of the UK left. She told the MPs: 
What we will be negotiating is a United Kingdom approach and a United Kingdom 
relationship with theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. I 
think you’ve assumed an acceptance of differential relationships which I don’t 
think it’s right to accept.

I said when I became prime minister and first met the first minister that we 
will look very seriously at any proposals that come forward from the devolved 
administrations, but there may be proposals that are impractical.

 * She hinted that the government was making contingency plans for what it 
might have to do if the two-year Brexit talks end without a deal. 
 * She defended the decision to include students in net migration figures - 
even though Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Philip Hammond, the 
chancellor, have expressed doubts about this. She told the MPs: 
The target figures are calculated from the overall migration figures and 
students are in the overall migration figures because it is an international 
definition of migration, which is used by countries around the world.

Having students in that overall migration figure actually showed us when we 
first came into government that what we had seen in the previous 13 years of 
Labour government was significant abuse of the student visa system into the 
United Kingdom.

 * She confirmed that the government was still committed to getting annual net 
migration below 100,000. 
 * She said she would give a speech in January giving more detail about her 
approach to Brexit. 
I will be making a speech early in the new year setting out more about our 
approach and about the opportunity I think we have as a country to use this 
process to forge a truly global Britain that embraces and trades with countries 
across the world.

 * She refused to confirm that MPs would be given as much information about 
the Brexit negotiations as MEPs.(The European parliament has a formal role in 
the Brexit talks, and there are provisions that will allow some MEPs to be 
briefed in private about the ongoing negotiations.) 
 * She indicated the government would not be producing plans for the long-term 
reform of social care quickly.  
Here is some Twitter comment on Theresa May’s liaison committee appearance.

Unless anything very dramatic happens later this week this will be the last 
proper Politics Live of 2017. And, like the Queen, I’ve got a Christmas 
message. It’s thanks. Writing a blog means I engage with readers much more than 
I used to when I was doing conventional news journalism and 80/90% of the time 
it’s a pleasure. I always learn something new when I read comments BTL, 
engaging with readers who criticise constructively definitely sharpens up my 
reporting and I am particularly grateful to those who point out the numerous 
typos etc. Besides, I enjoy the company. So thank you to all those who read, 
and to all those who comment.

Have a very happy Christmas, and I’ll be back on Tuesday 3 January.

Tyrie says three select committee chairs - Meg Hillier from the public 
accounts committee, Betts and Wollaston - all stressed the need for a 
cross-party approach on this.

He ends by thanking May for “an extremely interesting session”. 

He says she will appear again after the Easter recess, by which time people 
will have a much better idea of what is happening on Brexit.

And that’s it. I’ll post a summary soon.
 
Q: Will the final settlement for adult social care look at the need for health 
and social care to work together. And should they have a combined budget?

May says the government will look at health as part of its social care review. 
The government needs to recognise the interaction between care and health, she 
says.

Q: Will you look at how you fund health in the long term. These issues are 
connected.

May says at the moment she is focusing on social care.
 
May says the government needs to show people how changes in lifestyle can be 
of benefit to them.
 
Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chair of the health committee, goes next.

Q: The obesity strategy did not say enough about pricing factors.

May says the government is introducing the soft drinks levy. 
 
Q: Are you prepared to commission a major long-term review of what to do about 
care? And will you invite the opposition parties to contribute?

May says she wants a sustainable solution. But it will not be immediate, she 
says. Once plans are published, MPs will be able to comment.

 * May signals that the government will not be proposing a long-term solution 
to social care soon.  
May is now answering questions about the NHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> and social care. Clive Betts, the 
Labour chair of the communities committee, is asking them now.

Q: Spending on social care fell by 9% in real terms in the last parliament. In 
your terms, do you accept crisis means crisis?

May says in some areas more people are getting care. She says an important 
factor is how well services are delivered.

Q: There was no new money in the statement last week. And increasing the 
precept in poor areas will not cover the extra money they have to spent because 
of the “national living wage”.

May says she can name some authorities where more people are getting care. She 
says the announcement allows council to bring forward precept money. After 
that, money from the Better Care Fund becomes available.

She repeats the point about councils needing to improve how services are 
delivered.

And in the long-term further reform is needed, she says.
 
Q: David Davis said parliament would get at least as much information about 
the negotiation as the European parliament. Is that your view?

May says she and Davis both want parliament to be informed.

Q: So that is a yes?

May says she wants parliament to be able to discuss the issues. The European 
parliament has a specific role in the negotiations which the UK parliament does 
not

Tyrie says that sounds like a no. 

 * May refuses to confirm that MPs will get as much information about the 
Brexit negotiations as MEPs. 
He goes on.

Q: Do you want parliament to vote on a final deal?

May says she wants parliament to have every opportunity to consider these 
matters. But she wants to ensure that the government delivers on what the 
people want.

Q: Is that a yes or a no?

That is my answer.

Q: Article 50, subclause 3, specifically says the deal could be implemented at 
some point in the future.

May says subclause 3 is about extending the negotiations.

Tyrie reads out subclause 3 
<http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html>
. It says:

The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of 
entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after 
the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in 
agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this 
period.

Tyrie says he does not accept May’s interpretation. He says May was clear 
about not wanting to extend the negotiating period. But what about delaying 
implementation?

May says there “may be some practical aspects that require a period of 
implementation thereafter”.

Q: So could use article 50, subclause 3, to negotiate an implementation date 
after the end of the two year period.

May says they will discuss this.

She says government may need extra time to implement the deal.

But the amount of time needed will depend on what the deal is.

 * May confirms there may be a case for delaying implementation of the Brexit 
deal.(This is another way of her confirming that there could be a transitional 
deal.)  
 My colleague Anushka Asthana has been sending me some of May’s direct quotes, 
and so I have been beefing up some of the earlier posts - on whether MPs get a 
vote, and on a transition period - to include them. To get them to show up, you 
may need to refresh the page.

 
Crispin Blunt, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee, goes 
next.

May indicates the government is drawing up contingency plans for what might 
happen if the UK does not get a deal in two years.
Paul Waugh (@paulwaugh) 
Asked by Blunt if Govt has conting planning for no Brexit deal done by 2019, 
May: "We are looking at ALL the scenarios that might pertain"

<https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/811224443792097280> 
Q: Will your article 50 letter cover what aspects of a trade deal can be 
negotiated by the commission, and which have to be agreed by all member states.

May indicates this will not be part of the article 50 letter.

Q: What would happen if there were no deal after two years.

May says the other 27 states would have to decide whether or not to prolong 
the negotiations.
 
Q: The chancellor, the foreign secretary, the home secretary, and the previous 
chancellor, all think students should be excluded from your migration target?

May says they are in the figures ...

Q: I’m asking about the target.

May says the target relates to the figures. She says including students is in 
line with international practice. There used to be a problem with the abuse of 
student visas, she says.

Cooper says:

You don’t have a way to meet the target. It’s a bit of a mess on immigration.

Tyrie says the bogus student issue has been addressed. International students 
are a success story. Shouldn’t students be excluded?

May says she uses the international definition.

Q: So that’s a no.

May says the governments uses the international definition.

 * May defends decision to include students in the migration target.  
This is getting tetchy. Cooper used to shadow May at the Home Office, and so 
these two have “previous”. May is not enjoying Cooper’s line of questioning at 
all, and her bonhomie is evaporating.
 
Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, goes next.

Q: Will you include plans for immigration controls in the plan?

May says the government is working on plans. It will publish them when they 
are ready.

Q: If there is a tension between what would be in the best interests of 
Britain and your net migration target, will you ditch the target?

May says Cooper is assuming that you can make that judgment.

She says Cooper should know that looking at immigration numbers is not an 
exact science. You cannot look at it in the way Cooper proposes, she says.

She says she wants the best deal for operating in the single market, as well 
as allowing the UK to control immigration.

Q: But you used to blame the EU for not being able to meet your target. Will 
you aim to get EU migration down to 50,000?

May says she will do what is best for the UK?

Q: If you cannot do both, will you ditch the target?

May says the government will maintain its target of getting net migration 
below 100,000. That is important, she says. Migration affects people on low 
incomes.

 * May confirms government still committed to getting net migration below 
100,000. 
Q: Who do you want not to come?

May says people voted to get control of immigration.
 
Q: Will you rule out passport checks between Northern Ireland and Britain?

May says she is focusing on keeping open the border between Northern Ireland 
and Ireland.

Q: Will the devolved bodies get aspects of EU law?

May says these details will be decided in the great reform bill.
 
Q: Irish citizens have the same rights to come to the UK as Commonwealth 
citizens. Will that continue?

Mays says she wants to look at these issues of how we treat people from other 
EU countries early in the talks.
 
Laurence Robertson, the Conservative chair of the Northern Ireland committee, 
goes next.

May says she does not want to return to the borders of the past in Ireland and 
Northern Ireland.
