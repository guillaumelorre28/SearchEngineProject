The chancellor, Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond>, has been given a boost 
ahead of his maiden autumn statement by a Guardian analysis showing the economy 
continues to confound gloomy forecasts for a post-referendum slump.


A bumper month for retail sales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/17/uk-retail-sales-halloween-brexit-inflation>
, a steady housing market,broad-based business growth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/uk-services-costs-pound-inflation>
 and a drop in the jobless rate have all boosted hopes for a strong finish to 
the year for the UK economy.

Hammond is being warned, however, to look past the signs of early resilience 
to a challenging 2017 when Brexit talks begin in earnest,rising inflation 
starts to bite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/05/higher-inflation-rising-debt-millions-fall-living-standards>
 and the world gets to grips with Donald Trump taking over the US presidency.

For now, however, the pound has steadied on financial markets and the economic 
signals point to resilient consumers. That will provide some solace to Hammond 
as he prepares to deliver his speech on Wednesday, when he will be forced to 
concede thatthe longer-term outlook for the economy is gloomier than at his 
predecessor George Osborne’s budget just eight months ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/20/office-of-budget-responsibility-to-tear-up-forecasts-for-uk-growth>
.

To track the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has 
chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the value of the pound and the 
performance of the FTSE.

The dashboard for November <https://gu.com/p/595jx> shows a better than 
expected performance in five of the eight categories. Two were worse than 
expected andinflation was lower than economists forecast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/15/uk-inflation-rate-dips-to-09>
, defying expectations for it to rise swiftly on the back of the weak pound.

Five months on from the vote to leave the EU, the latest batch of figures show 
unemployment dropped to an 11-year low 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-falls-september-office-for-national-statistics>
, retail sales rose sharply,house prices picked up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/10/homebuyers-return-but-struggle-to-find-suitable-properties-says-rics-october-survey>
, business activity continued to grow andthe public finances improved 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/22/uk-public-finances-economic-healthcheck-autumn-statement-business-live?page=with:block-58340fffe4b0da4920d6b069#block-58340fffe4b0da4920d6b069>
. ButBritain’s trade gap with the rest of the world widened 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/09/uk-trade-deficit-widens-september-exports-fall-pound-drop>
 and wage growth stalled.

The pound has recovered some ground in the latest month, as investor focus 
shifts away from the UK currency and instead to the euro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/11/pound-trump-euro-brexit-sterling>
 after Trump’s victory raised fears of similar anti-establishment gains in a 
host of elections in the eurozone over coming months. Analysts also said the 
pound may have found a floor, having dropped 10% against the euro and 16% 
against the dollar since the referendum.

On stock markets, the FTSE 100 leading index is off a record high hit in 
October 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/ftse-100-record-high-sterling-pound-weakens>
 but is still 8% above it’s pre-referendum level. The more domestically focused 
FTSE 250 is 2% higher than it was on the day of the referendum.

But behind the upbeat headlines there are growing signs the weak pound will 
push up prices and squeeze household budgets in the months ahead. Wage growth 
is expected to slow and economists warn that with employment growth already 
waning, pay will struggle to keep up with living costs next year.

Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England policymaker, said price pressures 
were clearly rising.

“It is clear from the measure of input prices paid by manufacturers that a 
wave of inflation is coming through the pipeline driven by a weaker pound. We 
should therefore still expect to see inflation at around 3% or just below by 
the end of next year.

“That will squeeze real consumer spending growth, adding to the slowdown 
generated by uncertainty affecting investment plans.”

Household worries about inflation 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-inflation-barclays-idUKKBN13G1QK> are 
already rising afterhigh-profile pricing tussles between supermarkets and big 
brands such as Typhoo and Walkers crisps 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/06/birds-eye-walkers-supermarkets-price-rise-brexit-vote-pound>
.


Eight out of 10 consumers said they were worried that changes in inflation 
over the next 12 months would affect the cost of everyday goods, according to 
one YouGov poll for Barclaycard. As a result,people’s overall confidence in the 
UK economy and in their own finances waned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/cinemas-pubs-winter-clothes-consumer-spending-barclaycard>
.

For businesses, the pound’s weakness also weighed heavy. Despite the boost to 
competitiveness for those selling their goods overseas, exports fell in the 
latest trade figures while imports rose.

At the same time, the weak pound ramped up the cost of importing raw materials 
and manufacturers started to pass some of that on to their clients.Putting some 
solid figures behind the rows over Marmite and other foods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/tesco-unilever-resolve-marmite-dispute-price-supermarket>
, the latest official data on manufacturers’ costs showed they soared 12.2% in 
the year to October, the biggest increase for five years. So-called “factory 
gate” prices charged to their customers were up 2.1% on the year, the biggest 
rise for more than four years.

That was echoed in the services sector – encompassing shops, hotels, bars and 
banks – where businesses faced the biggest one-month jump in costs for 20 years 
in October, according to the closely watched Markit/CIPS services PMI report.

Business investment is expected to suffer as company bosses fret about those 
rising costs, as well as political uncertainty.

Economists warn that the nervous climate will translate into firms putting off 
big spending and hiring decisions. The Bank of England predicts a slowdown in 
business investment will weigh on overall economic growth next year.

Writing in the Guardian <https://gu.com/p/5ceyb>, a former member of the 
Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), David Blanchflower, said Hammond should 
heed those longer-term forecasts.

“The UK economy is slowing, there is no doubt about it. The incoming data so 
far though are mixed as it is early days post the Brexit vote,” said 
Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US.

“GDP growth isn’t set to slow sharply in the fourth quarter of 2016 but 2017 
is likely a different matter.”

Boost to public finances lifts chancellor ahead of autumn statement

He urged the chancellor to respond with big initiatives to shore up growth, or 
risk further antagonising voters.

“It is time to condemn austerity into the dustbin of history. It is the 
unnecessary hang-up with debts and deficits that has got us into this fine 
populist mess in the first place.”

There was little hint of such a change of direction in a Treasury reaction to 
public finance data on Tuesday showing the deficit was smaller than expected in 
October.

A Treasury spokesman said: “As the chancellor has made clear, the government 
is committed to fiscal discipline and will return the budget to balance over a 
sensible period of time, in a way that allows space to support the economy as 
needed.”

Headline growth figures have defied gloomy forecasts made during a bitter 
referendum campaign and in the wake of the Brexit vote, when many economists 
predicted a recession.


An update on GDP from the Office for National Statistics later this week is 
expected to confirm its previous estimate that the economy grew a relatively 
strong 0.5% in the three months following the Brexit vote, down only slightly 
from 0.7% growth in the run-up to the referendum. But analysts believe details 
released with this latest GDP report will show business investment slowed 
following the Brexit vote.

Chris Hare, economist at Investec commented: “When economic uncertainty rises, 
business investment tends to be the first casualty – in such episodes 
businesses, tend to revert to ‘wait-and-see’ mode and postpone their capital 
spending plans.”
