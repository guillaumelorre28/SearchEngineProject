Changing your name, by marriage, civil partnership, deed poll or after divorce 
– can be expensive and onerous. Here's how to avoid the pitfalls and keep costs 
down:

Changing your name after marriage or a civil partnership


Your marriage or civil partnership certificate does not in any way indicate 
the surname you'll have after the ceremony, yet you can use it to prove you 
have changed your name.

To change your surname to your spouse or civil partner's surname (or to 
double-barrel your joint surnames) on yourpassport 
<https://www.gov.uk/changing-passport-information> or driving licence 
<https://www.gov.uk/change-name-driving-licence> you need to fill in the 
relevant forms requesting the change and present your marriage certificate.

Financial institutions, such as banks and building societies – should also 
accept your marriage certificate as proof you have taken your partner's surname 
if you are a married woman or civil partner.

This is not always the case if you are a married man taking your wife's 
surname or if you are double-barrelling or meshing your surnames. If one of 
these situations applies to you, you may prefer to change your name by deed 
poll (which should always be acceptable proof).

If you wish to travel on honeymoon under your new name, you can change the 
name on your passport up to three months before the ceremony, using form

 (pdf).

Changing your name by deed poll


A "change of name deed poll" is simply a document that contains the following 
three declarations:

• I am abandoning my previous name.

• I will use my new name at all times.

• I require all persons to address me by my new name only.

You must sign and date this declaration in both your old and your new name. 
Your new name must contain both a forename and a surname and be pronounceable, 
as well complying with other common sense restrictions specified by the Home 
Office. Two witnesses, who aren't related to you, must also sign your deed poll 
and give their name, occupations and addresses.

You can prepare it yourself using the legal phrases shown in Ministry of 
Justice form LoC020 
<http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForms.do?court_forms_category=deed_poll>
, or pay a solicitor or specialist agency to help you.

The biggest agencies charge about £35, although the UK Deed Poll Office and 
the Legal Deed Poll Service charge less than £15, and you can get a free 
template fromFree UK Deed Poll <http://freedeedpoll.org.uk/>, which is accepted 
by the DVLA, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest, the Co-operative Bank, 
First Direct, HSBC, CallCredit and Nationwide.

If you go for the DIY option, create the declaration then print off a few 
copies on good quality paper or parchment paper and get them witnessed and 
signed. Present this document to all relevant government authorities and 
financial institutions as you would a marriage certificate.

For extra security, you can get your deed poll witnessed in front of a 
solicitor for a set "oath fee" of £5.

If you are changing your child's name by deed poll it is more complex, so it 
may be worth going to a specialist agency or lawyer. If you want to do it 
yourself, everyone who has legal responsibility for the child should give their 
consent to the change in an accompanying letter, and if the child is aged 16 or 
17 he or she should also give consent. To change a child's forename before 
their first birthday you must apply to the General Register Office.

For more information, consult your local Citizens Advice bureau.

Changing your name after divorce


All you need to revert your ID and bank accounts back to your maiden name 
after you divorce is your decree absolute and your marriage certificate. 
Alternatively, you can change your name by deed poll and present this document 
instead.

Cut your costs


To change the name on your passport, you have to renew it, which costs £72.50. 
However, it is legal for you to use a passport in your previous name until it 
expires. Just remember the name on any airline tickets must match the name on 
your passport or you may not be allowed to travel.

By contrast, you must immediately change your name on your driving licence – 
which costs nothingusing form D1 
<http://www.dft.gov.uk/dvla/onlineservices/order_forms.aspx> – and you can be 
fined up to £100 if you fail to notify the DVLA of a name change.

It's also important to update your details (for free) on the electoral roll or 
you may be turned down for credit in your new name. Use thevoter registration 
form 
<https://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/electoral_registration_applica.aspx>
.

Be wary of any company which offers to change your name for a fee. For 
example, if you own a property, many solicitors will try to charge you to 
register a name change at the Land Registry, butyou can do it yourself for 
nothing 
<http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/faqs/i-have-changed-my-name,-what-do-i-need-to-do>
.

Similarly, it shouldn't cost you a penny to notify banks, doctors, dentists, 
employers, nurseries, schools, HMRC, insurance companies, TV licensing, local 
councils, PayPal, utility companies, loyalty card schemes and the police (if 
you have a criminal record).

When you send your original documents in the post, obtain a free certificate 
of posting from the post office, as then you are entitled to claim up to £46 
compensation in case it is mislaid in transit. It costs £9.25 toreplace a 
marriage or civil partnership certificate 
<https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate> (although 
extra copies usually cost less if you request them at the ceremony).

Cheques in your old name


If you receive a cheque made out to your previous name, most banks will let 
you cash it as long as you present it with documentation proving you used to 
hold that name.
