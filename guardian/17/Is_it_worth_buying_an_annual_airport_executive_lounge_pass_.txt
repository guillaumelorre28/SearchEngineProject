Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to 
help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next 
Saturday’s paper.

This week’s question:

I’m thinking of buying my partner an annual airport executive lounge pass for 
about £250. His family is in France and he flies about 10 times a year. Are 
exec lounges all they’re cracked up to be? Or can you recommend an alternative 
(cheaper) gift for a regular flyer?
