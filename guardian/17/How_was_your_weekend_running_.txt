Happy new year everyone! So how was your festive running? As always when ‘back 
to school’ mode hits, it’s now all a bit of a blur, but highlights for me 
included theannual Christmas day run 
<https://www.strava.com/activities/810863491> with my other half, and a parkrun 
double on New Year’s Day <https://www.strava.com/activities/817568457>. Well, I 
say that was a highlight ... more of a hideously extended attempt to sweat out 
a hangover, but at least it worked.

So, now it’s January. I’m not one for resolutions as such, but having stepped 
on the scales, it turns out that - who knew?! - eating non-stop panettone for a 
month has repercussions. It’s also 16 weeks to London marathon, and a lot less 
to Tokyo. So I’ve started a new nutrition plan, and have a couple of mini 
running resolutions. They are:

 * Push harder when you can, ease off more when you should (so, make the easy 
recovery runs easier, and therefore hopefully have more to give on the hard 
ones) 
 * Do more strength and conditioning 
 * Invent a palatable protein shake 
Ok, so the last one isn’t going to happen but god, I wish someone would. Why 
are they ALL SO VILE?

But over to you, runners. It’s been several weeks so I have no doubt you have 
lots of tales to tell ...
