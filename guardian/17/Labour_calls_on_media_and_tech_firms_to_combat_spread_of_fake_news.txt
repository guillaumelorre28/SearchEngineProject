Tech companies and the media must do more to combat the spread of fake news 
stories to avoid British politics being “infected by this contagion”, theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP leading an investigation into 
the phenomenon has warned.

Writing for the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/13/fake-news-expose-labour-party-inquiry-start>
, former shadow culture secretary Michael Dugher said the issue of demonstrably 
false stories being spread via social media was not just a problem for fringe 
websites, but also more mainstream news outlets.

The problem of fake news emanated from ostensibly leftwing sources as well as 
from the right, said Dugher, who has beenasked by Labour’s deputy leader, Tom 
Watson <http://www.tom-watson.com/fakenews>, to look into the issue. 

With the US president-elect, Donald Trump, using the term 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/jan/11/trump-dossier-russia-has-compromising-material-on-president-elect-live-updates>
 to describe the leaking of unverified allegations about his private life, “the 
global scale of the problem with fake news is clear”, the Barnsley East MP said.

“Even someone with views as grimly unpalatable as Trump deserves to be 
scrutinised on the basis of truth and reality – not on fake news,” he argued.


There was, he said, a duty for news organisations and journalists to verify 
information they used and “avoid the temptation to publish clickbait nonsense 
in a voracious quest for web traffic”.

The idea of fake news had taken off during the US presidential election 
campaign, Dugher said, adding: “In Britain too, our politics risks becoming 
infected by this contagion.”

The dominance of tech giants such as Google and Facebook in disseminating 
information posed a similar challenge to UK governments over plurality as they 
face with the concentration of newspaper ownership in a few hands, he wrote.

He said the need for tech firms to do more did not mean there was no need to 
tackle inaccurate reporting in the traditional press.

Dugher said: “No one has done more than Tom Watson when it came to 
highlighting the failings of the newspapers over phone-hacking and other 
corrupt practices or to challenge the influence of the Murdoch empire on 
politics. That is why we will continue to support change.

“But we in the Labour party, who have so often been on the wrong side of 
misrepresentations and unfair attacks from the rightwing media, also have a 
responsibility to be vigilant and reject fake news material on social media and 
elsewhere – even if it purports to come from the left.”

Dugher has been asked by Watson to look into “the changing way news is 
consumed and shared online, and at the practical, political and ethical issues 
raised by fake news”. He is due to report on the spring.
