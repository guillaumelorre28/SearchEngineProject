Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP who was a colleague of Boris Johnson’s on the 
Vote Leave campaign, has defended him over his world war two jibe about the 
French president. This is from the BBC’s Carole Walker.

Gisela Stuart tells me she's sure Boris did not mean to be offensive-- but 
urges politicians on all sides "just don’t mention the war "

Sajid Javid condemns those who make 'glib comparisons' about Nazis - only 
hours after Johnson makes WW2 jibe

In one of those “you couldn’t make it up” specials that come along from time 
to time to remind us that real life is often more extraordinary than fiction, 
the Holocaust Educational Trust has put out a press notice clearly prepared 
some time ago condemning people who make “glib comparisons” with the Nazis.

Just to make it even more awkward the key quote comes from Sajid Javid, the 
communities secretary. He is quoted in the press release as saying:

We have to call out bigotry and racism when we see it. We have to object when 
a line is crossed from legitimate debate to smears and abuse. We have to push 
back when people lazily reach for glib comparisons that belittle what happened 
… calling those we disagree with “Nazis” or claiming someone’s actions are 
“just like the Holocaust”.

The press release was prepared well before Boris Johnson, the foreign 
secretary, spoke at an event in India this morning making what might be 
described as a “glib comparison” to a Nazi prison camp guard. (See 11am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/18/theresa-may-brexit-speech-reaction-pmqs-david-davis-will-not-get-option-of-reversing-brexit-says-david-davis-politics-live?page=with:block-587f47d6e4b0f0efb00f52ca#block-587f47d6e4b0f0efb00f52ca>
 It refers to comments Javid is due to be making at a Holocaust Educational 
Trust reception this afternoon. But it was sent out in advance, with a 3.30pm 
embargo, quoting Javid in the past tense (a routine practice with press 
releases.)

Johnson did not use the word “Nazi”. He accused the French president, Francois 
Hollande, of administering “punishment” beatings “in the manner of some world 
war two movie”. But Johnson was not talking about British or American soldiers 
punishing a prison camp escapees. Whatever Number 10 says (see1.55pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/18/theresa-may-brexit-speech-reaction-pmqs-david-davis-will-not-get-option-of-reversing-brexit-says-david-davis-politics-live?page=with:block-587f7336e4b00b8fc2ae1db6#block-587f7336e4b00b8fc2ae1db6>
 it is obvious he was talking about the Nazis.

Hundreds of thousands of elderly Britons living in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> may be forced to return to the 
UK unless the government guarantees that their healthcare continues to be 
reimbursed by the NHS, campaigners for British people settled in Spain and 
France have warned.

The House of Commons Brexit select committee was told on Wednesday that an 
unintended consequence of Brexit could be a surge in immigration of British 
migrants both working and retired.

Groups campaigning for the rights of Britons settled in Europe told the 
committee that many pensioners in countries such as Spain and France would not 
be able to afford private health insurance if the current NHS overseas was 
jettisoned post-Brexit.

“They may have no alternative but to come back,” said Sue Wilson, one of the 
founders of the Remain in Spain group.

The committee was also told there could be exodus of professionals whose right 
to practice, law, medicine or other disciplines would no longer be recognised 
if a deal was not done.

European parliament's Brexit negotiator labels Johnson's WW2 jibe 'abhorrent'

Guy Verhofstadt, the head of the liberal ALDE group in the European parliament 
and the parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator, has described Boris Johnson’s 
world war two jibe about the French president as “abhorrent and deeply 
unhelpful” and urgedTheresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> to condemn it.
Guy Verhofstadt (@GuyVerhofstadt) 
Yet more abhorrent & deeply unhelpful comments from @BorisJohnson

Lunchtime summary

 * Boris Johnson has warned the French president, François Hollande, against 
trying to “administer punishment beatings” in the manner of “some world war two 
movie” to any country that tries to leave the EU. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/18/boris-johnson-world-war-two-punishment-beatings-brexit-francois-hollande>
The Lib Dem leaderTim Farron has condemned Johnson. He said: 
This is an utterly crass and clueless remark from the man who is supposed to 
be our chief diplomat.

I assume Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> says these 
things to deflect from the utter shambles this Brexit government is in over its 
plans to take Britain out of the Single Market.


But this kind of distasteful comment only serves to unite Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> further against Britain at a 
time we need friends more than ever.


And the Labour MP Wes Streeting has also criticised the foreign secretary. In 
a statement issued by Open Britain, which is campaigning for a “soft” Brexit, 
Streeting said:

It seems the foreign secretary has been leafing through his well-thumbed copy 
of How to Lose Friends and Alienate People.

Nobody who wants to see a good Brexit deal for Britain should welcome these 
crass comments. To get a deal that protects our economy and keeps Britain an 
open, tolerant country, we need to negotiate in good faith and with courtesy 
with our European partners.

 * The supreme court has announced that it will give its ruling on the article 
50 case on Tuesday. It is expected to reject the government’s appeal, meaning 
that the government will have to put a bill through parliament before it can 
trigger article 50, the process starting the two-year Brexit process. 
 * Jeremy Corbyn has condemned the government’s threat to turn the UK into a 
low-tax economy if it cannot get a satisfactory Brexit deal, telling Theresa 
May that it would damage the UK and demeaned her office. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/18/jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may-brexit-plans-damage-uk-labour-public-services>
 * Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, will warn on Wednesday that the Brexit 
plan outlined in Theresa May’s speech on Tuesday could “rip Britain apart”, 
striking a markedly different tone to the Labour frontbench. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/18/may-brexit-plan-britain-london-mayor-davos-sadiq-khan-eurozone>
 * Wage growth picked up and unemployment fell in the three months ending 
November, in the latest sign that the UK economy has so far avoided a 
Brexit-related shock. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/18/uk-unemployment-falls-economy-brexit-pay-growth>
 * The BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, inaccurately reported Jeremy 
Corbyn’s views about shoot-to-kill policies in the aftermath of the terror 
attacks in Paris, according to the BBC Trust. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/18/bbc-trust-says-laura-kuenssberg-report-on-jeremy-corbyn-was-inaccurate-labour>
 * Ukip has dismissed an ITV report saying Paul Nuttall will be the party’s 
candidate in the Stoke central byelection. No decision has been taken about who 
the candidate will be, sources say.

Supreme court to give article 50 judgment on Tuesday next week

The supreme court has announced it will give its judgement in the article 50 
case on Tuesday next week,at 9.30am. 
<https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/future-judgments.html>

It has issued this statement 
<https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/access-arrangements-for-24-january-article-50-brexit-judgment.html>
 about access arrangements. Here is an extract.

Members of the public wishing to visit the building on the morning of Tuesday 
24 January are advised that we are expecting a large number of visitors that 
morning, and those not specifically coming to observe the judgment in R (on the 
application of Miller & Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> are encouraged to choose 
other days to visit the building ...

The judgment hand down will last around five minutes and will take place in 
the largest courtroom, where a justice will deliver a summary of the court’s 
decision. The court has made arrangements for two ‘overflow’ courtrooms where a 
live video feed of the summary will be shown.

No 10 says Boris Johnson was using a 'theatrical comparison', but 'not 
suggesting anyone was a Nazi'

Heather Stewart

At the lobby briefing after PMQs Theresa May’s spokeswoman gave a spirited 
defence of the foreign secretary’s remarks in India (see11am) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/18/theresa-may-brexit-speech-reaction-pmqs-david-davis-will-not-get-option-of-reversing-brexit-says-david-davis-politics-live?page=with:block-587f47d6e4b0f0efb00f52ca#block-587f47d6e4b0f0efb00f52ca>
, comparing President Hollande’s stance on Brexit to a threat to administer, 
“punishment beatings”.

The spokeswoman insisted Johnson “was not suggesting anyone was a Nazi”. 

“He was making a theatrical comparison to some of those evocative WWII movies 
people will have seen,” she said, adding that she rejected media 
interpretations of the comments and comparing it to the “hyped up media 
reports” condemned by the prime minister in her Brexit speech.

Juncker says Brexit talks will be 'very, very, very difficult'

Jennifer Rankin

The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-claude-juncker>, welcomed Theresa May’s 
“clarity” that Britain will leave the single market, but warned that Brexit 
talks will be “very, very, very difficult”.

Speaking to journalists in Strasbourg, he played down suggestions that the 
prime minister’s speech was a threat toEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, and emphasised that the deal 
had to be fair for both sides.


The Luxemburger said he had spoken to May last night and told her the 
commission was not in a hostile mood. “We want a fair deal with Britain, and a 
fair deal for Britain – but a fair deal means a fair deal for theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.”


He added it would be “a very, very, very difficult negotiation” because 
Britain would be considered as a foreign country to the rest of the EU.


Sitting alongside him, Joseph Muscat, prime minister of Malta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/malta>, which has the EU’s six-month 
rotating presidency, said he had not seen May’s words as “a declaration of war”.


He declined to say whether the UK could work out a trade deal with the EU at 
the same time as it negotiated its EU exit under article 50. EU leaders will 
take that decision at a special summit, around a month after May starts the 
official withdrawal process. “I will not pre-empt my colleagues in deciding 
themselves during an extraordinary council, the sort of attitude that will be 
putting forward for the commission to negotiate.”


Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been clearer. Shortly after May’s 
speech he tweeted that his priority was “an agreement on orderly exit”, without 
mentioning trade talks.

Germany denies EU is split over pre-article 50 deal on citizens' rights

Philip Oltermann

The Guardian’s Berlin correspondent, Philip Oltermann, has the latest on 
reports in the UK press that EU states were split on whether to do a deal on 
citizens’ residency rights before article 50 is triggered.

A spokesperson for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, rejected the reports, 
stating there was “complete unanimity” that such negotiations could not take 
place until article 50 was triggered.


The 27 heads of states have already made clear in their joint statement on 29 
June 201, so immediately after the referendum, that participation in the single 
market goes hand in hand with all four freedoms of the single market, and on 
this question all member states are unanimous. There is also complete unanimity 
that there can be no pre-negotiations with Great Britain before notification.

Speaking at a joint press conference with the Italian prime minister, Paolo 
Gentiloni, Merkel said that May’s speech had “clarified” how the UK would 
conduct its negotiations.

We agreed we will coordinate our positions. In relation to our economies, Im 
not afraid. I think we’ll stick together.Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> must not be divided and we will 
make sure this doesn’t happen by keeping very close contacts with each other.

PMQs - Verdict

PMQs - Verdict: Brexit has never been a happy subject of Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> at PMQs. He tended to 
avoid the subject before the EU referendum, he has been wary of raising it 
since, and today’s exchanges help to illustrate why. Theresa May’s performance 
was not exactly a triumph but she got the better of Corbyn and appeared more 
confident at the end of their exchanges than at any time in recent weeks.

There are at least three reasons why the EU is a tricky subject for Corbyn: 
his views on the EU are different from mainstream Labour’s; mainstream Labour’s 
are at odds with the consensus in the country as a whole; and the party has not 
resolved where it stands on the issue of immigration. This was apparent 
yesterday when Sir Keir Starmer’s response to May’s speech was very hard to 
square with Corbyn’s. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e235ce4b00b8fc2ae167a#block-587e235ce4b00b8fc2ae167a>
(Corbyn seemed more interested in clobbering the government, while Starmer 
seemed more interested in positioning Labour in tune with public opinion.)

That said, May is still very vulnerable on this topic. Corbyn could have 
pressed her more persistently on her threat to turn the UK into a offshore, 
deregulated tax haven, perhaps by inquiring quitewhat Philip Hammond meant when 
he suggested the UK’s “social model” (or welfare state, as we normally call it) 
could be under threat. 
<https://www.welt.de/english-news/article161182946/Philip-Hammond-issues-threat-to-EU-partners.html>
 He could have asked if it is really conducive to good relations with the EU to 
have Boris Johnson comparing the French president to a Nazi prison guard. Or he 
could have asked May to confirm that her transitional deal announcement could 
mean free movement still applying and the ECJ still having jurisdiction at the 
time of the next general election (something that is usually anathema to Tory 
Eurosceptics).

But he didn’t. It was a lost opportunity.

As usual, I missed the questions from Angus Robertson, the SNP’s leader at 
Westminster, because I was writing up the snap verdict. So here they are.

Robertson asked about Scotland’s desire to stay in the EU single market.

The prime minister has said that Scotland is an equal partner in the UK. Does 
she still believe this is true, or is she just stringing the people of Scotland 
along?

May said that in her speech she reiterated her commitment to work with the 
devolved adminstrations.

Then Robertson cited figures about the potential cost to Scotland of leaving 
the the single market. As Tory MPs jeered, he went on:

Tories jeering and cheering when the forecast for people’s income is that it 
is likely to drop by £2,000, and that 80,000 people may lose their jobs in 
Scotland as a result of the hard Tory Brexit plan of the prime minister. Does 
the prime minister believe this is a price worth paying for her Little Britain 
Brexit?

May replied:

The right honourable gentleman once again talks about the possibility of a 
negative impact on Scotland if Scotland were not part of the single market - 
his party is dedicated to taking Scotland out of the single market by taking it 
out of the United Kingdom.

Juncker reiterates that the EU would be seeking as a fair a Brexit deal as 
Britain would and describes the imminent negotiations as “very, very, very, 
difficult”. That’s a lot of verys.


He welcomed The “clarifications” made by Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> in her speech yesterday, but 
says that in the trade negotiations, Britain will have to be considered a 
“third country”, which will be a very different situation.
Jennifer Rankin (@JenniferMerode) 
We are not in a hostile mood, says Juncker. We want a fair deal for the UK but 
also a fair deal for the EU.

Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP who was a colleague of Boris Johnson’s on the 
Vote Leave campaign, has defended him over his world war two jibe about the 
French president. This is from the BBC’s Carole Walker.

Gisela Stuart tells me she's sure Boris did not mean to be offensive-- but 
urges politicians on all sides "just don’t mention the war "

In one of those “you couldn’t make it up” specials that come along from time 
to time to remind us that real life is often more extraordinary than fiction, 
the Holocaust Educational Trust has put out a press notice clearly prepared 
some time ago condemning people who make “glib comparisons” with the Nazis.

Just to make it even more awkward the key quote comes from Sajid Javid, the 
communities secretary. He is quoted in the press release as saying:

We have to call out bigotry and racism when we see it. We have to object when 
a line is crossed from legitimate debate to smears and abuse. We have to push 
back when people lazily reach for glib comparisons that belittle what happened 
… calling those we disagree with “Nazis” or claiming someone’s actions are 
“just like the Holocaust”.

The press release was prepared well before Boris Johnson, the foreign 
secretary, spoke at an event in India this morning making what might be 
described as a “glib comparison” to a Nazi prison camp guard. (See 11am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/18/theresa-may-brexit-speech-reaction-pmqs-david-davis-will-not-get-option-of-reversing-brexit-says-david-davis-politics-live?page=with:block-587f47d6e4b0f0efb00f52ca#block-587f47d6e4b0f0efb00f52ca>
 It refers to comments Javid is due to be making at a Holocaust Educational 
Trust reception this afternoon. But it was sent out in advance, with a 3.30pm 
embargo, quoting Javid in the past tense (a routine practice with press 
releases.)

Johnson did not use the word “Nazi”. He accused the French president, Francois 
Hollande, of administering “punishment” beatings “in the manner of some world 
war two movie”. But Johnson was not talking about British or American soldiers 
punishing a prison camp escapees. Whatever Number 10 says (see1.55pm)

 it is obvious he was talking about the Nazis.

Hundreds of thousands of elderly Britons living in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> may be forced to return to the 
UK unless the government guarantees that their healthcare continues to be 
reimbursed by the NHS, campaigners for British people settled in Spain and 
France have warned.

The House of Commons Brexit select committee was told on Wednesday that an 
unintended consequence of Brexit could be a surge in immigration of British 
migrants both working and retired.

Groups campaigning for the rights of Britons settled in Europe told the 
committee that many pensioners in countries such as Spain and France would not 
be able to afford private health insurance if the current NHS overseas was 
jettisoned post-Brexit.

“They may have no alternative but to come back,” said Sue Wilson, one of the 
founders of the Remain in Spain group.

The committee was also told there could be exodus of professionals whose right 
to practice, law, medicine or other disciplines would no longer be recognised 
if a deal was not done.
 
Guy Verhofstadt, the head of the liberal ALDE group in the European parliament 
and the parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator, has described Boris Johnson’s 
world war two jibe about the French president as “abhorrent and deeply 
unhelpful” and urgedTheresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> to condemn it.

trying to “administer punishment beatings” in the manner of “some world war two

The Lib Dem leaderTim Farron has condemned Johnson. He said: 
This is an utterly crass and clueless remark from the man who is supposed to 
be our chief diplomat.

I assume Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> says these 
things to deflect from the utter shambles this Brexit government is in over its 
plans to take Britain out of the Single Market.


But this kind of distasteful comment only serves to unite Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> further against Britain at a 
time we need friends more than ever.


And the Labour MP Wes Streeting has also criticised the foreign secretary. In 
a statement issued by Open Britain, which is campaigning for a “soft” Brexit, 
Streeting said:

It seems the foreign secretary has been leafing through his well-thumbed copy 
of How to Lose Friends and Alienate People.

Nobody who wants to see a good Brexit deal for Britain should welcome these 
crass comments. To get a deal that protects our economy and keeps Britain an 
open, tolerant country, we need to negotiate in good faith and with courtesy 
with our European partners.

 * The supreme court has announced that it will give its ruling on the article 
50 case on Tuesday. It is expected to reject the government’s appeal, meaning 
that the government will have to put a bill through parliament before it can 
trigger article 50, the process starting the two-year Brexit process. 
 * Jeremy Corbyn has condemned the government’s threat to turn the UK into a 
low-tax economy if it cannot get a satisfactory Brexit deal, telling Theresa 
May that it would damage the UK and demeaned her office.

The supreme court has announced it will give its judgement in the article 50 
case on Tuesday next week,at 9.30am. 
<https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/future-judgments.html>

It has issued this statement

 about access arrangements. Here is an extract.

Members of the public wishing to visit the building on the morning of Tuesday 
24 January are advised that we are expecting a large number of visitors that 
morning, and those not specifically coming to observe the judgment in R (on the 
application of Miller & Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> are encouraged to choose 
other days to visit the building ...

The judgment hand down will last around five minutes and will take place in 
the largest courtroom, where a justice will deliver a summary of the court’s 
decision. The court has made arrangements for two ‘overflow’ courtrooms where a

Jeremy Corbyn labels Theresa May ‘the Irony Lady’ at PMQs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/jan/18/jeremy-corbyn-labels-theresa-may-the-irony-lady-at-pmqs-video-highlights> 
At the lobby briefing after PMQs Theresa May’s spokeswoman gave a spirited 
defence of the foreign secretary’s remarks in India (see11am) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/18/theresa-may-brexit-speech-reaction-pmqs-david-davis-will-not-get-option-of-reversing-brexit-says-david-davis-politics-live?page=with:block-587f47d6e4b0f0efb00f52ca#block-587f47d6e4b0f0efb00f52ca>
, comparing President Hollande’s stance on Brexit to a threat to administer, 
“punishment beatings”.

The spokeswoman insisted Johnson “was not suggesting anyone was a Nazi”. 

“He was making a theatrical comparison to some of those evocative WWII movies 
people will have seen,” she said, adding that she rejected media 
interpretations of the comments and comparing it to the “hyped up media 
reports” condemned by the prime minister in her Brexit speech.
 
And here is what journalists and political commentators are saying about PMQs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs> on Twitter. Mostly people think May 
did best.

My colleague Anushka Asthana has been discussing PMQs on the Guardian’s 
Facebook live <https://www.facebook.com/theguardian/videos/10154973071576323/>. 
<https://www.facebook.com/theguardian>
 
The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-claude-juncker>, welcomed Theresa May’s 
“clarity” that Britain will leave the single market, but warned that Brexit 
talks will be “very, very, very difficult”.

Speaking to journalists in Strasbourg, he played down suggestions that the 
prime minister’s speech was a threat toEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, and emphasised that the deal 
had to be fair for both sides.


The Luxemburger said he had spoken to May last night and told her the 
commission was not in a hostile mood. “We want a fair deal with Britain, and a 
fair deal for Britain – but a fair deal means a fair deal for theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.”


He added it would be “a very, very, very difficult negotiation” because 
Britain would be considered as a foreign country to the rest of the EU.


Sitting alongside him, Joseph Muscat, prime minister of Malta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/malta>, which has the EU’s six-month 
rotating presidency, said he had not seen May’s words as “a declaration of war”.


He declined to say whether the UK could work out a trade deal with the EU at 
the same time as it negotiated its EU exit under article 50. EU leaders will 
take that decision at a special summit, around a month after May starts the 
official withdrawal process. “I will not pre-empt my colleagues in deciding 
themselves during an extraordinary council, the sort of attitude that will be 
putting forward for the commission to negotiate.”


Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been clearer. Shortly after May’s 
speech he tweeted that his priority was “an agreement on orderly exit”, without 
mentioning trade talks.

 
The Guardian’s Berlin correspondent, Philip Oltermann, has the latest on 
reports in the UK press that EU states were split on whether to do a deal on 
citizens’ residency rights before article 50 is triggered.

A spokesperson for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, rejected the reports, 
stating there was “complete unanimity” that such negotiations could not take 
place until article 50 was triggered.


The 27 heads of states have already made clear in their joint statement on 29 
June 201, so immediately after the referendum, that participation in the single 
market goes hand in hand with all four freedoms of the single market, and on 
this question all member states are unanimous. There is also complete unanimity 
that there can be no pre-negotiations with Great Britain before notification.

Speaking at a joint press conference with the Italian prime minister, Paolo 
Gentiloni, Merkel said that May’s speech had “clarified” how the UK would 
conduct its negotiations.

We agreed we will coordinate our positions. In relation to our economies, Im 
not afraid. I think we’ll stick together.Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> must not be divided and we will 
make sure this doesn’t happen by keeping very close contacts with each other.
 
PMQs - Verdict: Brexit has never been a happy subject of Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> at PMQs. He tended to 
avoid the subject before the EU referendum, he has been wary of raising it 
since, and today’s exchanges help to illustrate why. Theresa May’s performance 
was not exactly a triumph but she got the better of Corbyn and appeared more 
confident at the end of their exchanges than at any time in recent weeks.

There are at least three reasons why the EU is a tricky subject for Corbyn: 
his views on the EU are different from mainstream Labour’s; mainstream Labour’s 
are at odds with the consensus in the country as a whole; and the party has not 
resolved where it stands on the issue of immigration. This was apparent 
yesterday when Sir Keir Starmer’s response to May’s speech was very hard to 
square with Corbyn’s. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-587e235ce4b00b8fc2ae167a#block-587e235ce4b00b8fc2ae167a>
(Corbyn seemed more interested in clobbering the government, while Starmer 
seemed more interested in positioning Labour in tune with public opinion.)

That said, May is still very vulnerable on this topic. Corbyn could have 
pressed her more persistently on her threat to turn the UK into a offshore, 
deregulated tax haven, perhaps by inquiring quitewhat Philip Hammond meant when 
he suggested the UK’s “social model” (or welfare state, as we normally call it) 
could be under threat. 
<https://www.welt.de/english-news/article161182946/Philip-Hammond-issues-threat-to-EU-partners.html>
 He could have asked if it is really conducive to good relations with the EU to 
have Boris Johnson comparing the French president to a Nazi prison guard. Or he 
could have asked May to confirm that her transitional deal announcement could 
mean free movement still applying and the ECJ still having jurisdiction at the 
time of the next general election (something that is usually anathema to Tory 
Eurosceptics).

But he didn’t. It was a lost opportunity.
 
The Juncker/Muscat/Tajani press conference in Brussels is over.
 
As usual, I missed the questions from Angus Robertson, the SNP’s leader at 
Westminster, because I was writing up the snap verdict. So here they are.

Robertson asked about Scotland’s desire to stay in the EU single market.

The prime minister has said that Scotland is an equal partner in the UK. Does 
she still believe this is true, or is she just stringing the people of Scotland 
along?

May said that in her speech she reiterated her commitment to work with the 
devolved adminstrations.

Then Robertson cited figures about the potential cost to Scotland of leaving 
the the single market. As Tory MPs jeered, he went on:

Tories jeering and cheering when the forecast for people’s income is that it 
is likely to drop by £2,000, and that 80,000 people may lose their jobs in 
Scotland as a result of the hard Tory Brexit plan of the prime minister. Does 
the prime minister believe this is a price worth paying for her Little Britain 
Brexit?

May replied:

The right honourable gentleman once again talks about the possibility of a 
negative impact on Scotland if Scotland were not part of the single market - 
his party is dedicated to taking Scotland out of the single market by taking it 
out of the United Kingdom.

I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. <https://www.politicshome.com>
 
Juncker reiterates that the EU would be seeking as a fair a Brexit deal as 
Britain would and describes the imminent negotiations as “very, very, very, 
difficult”. That’s a lot of verys.


He welcomed The “clarifications” made by Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> in her speech yesterday, but 
says that in the trade negotiations, Britain will have to be considered a 
“third country”, which will be a very different situation.

We are not in a hostile mood, says Juncker. We want a fair deal for the UK but 
also a fair deal for the EU.
