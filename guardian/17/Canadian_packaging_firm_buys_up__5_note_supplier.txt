 has been sold in a deal worth C$1.13bn (£680m).

Canadian labelling and packaging firm CCL will buy UK-based Innovia, which 
supplies theBank of England

notes. The £5 note triggered outrage among vegetarians and vegans after the 
Bank admitted it contains tallow.

The CCL chief executive, Geoffrey Martin, said the takeover, agreed with 
Innovia’s UK private equity owners, would propel the company into top spot in 
the fast-growing market for polymer banknotes.

The Canadian firm will take on the task of trying to eliminate the use of 
animal fat in production of UK £5 notes, after Innovia promised it would do so.

More than 130,000 people signed a petition 
<https://www.change.org/p/bank-of-england-remove-tallow-from-bank-notes?recruiter=12006801&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink>
 calling for animal fat, in the form of tallow, to be eliminated from Innovia’s 
production process. Their protests weredescribed as “stupid”

 by the Australian pioneer of polymer notes, Dr David Solomon, who said they 
contained “trivial” amounts of tallow.

Innovia is based in Wigton, Cumbria, north-west England, and employs 1,200 
people worldwide. The company’s chief executive, Mark Robertshaw, said CCL 
would be “an excellent long-term owner” for its staff and customers.

CCL said it expected Innovia to generate net revenue of about £343m in 2017, 
taking its own sales to £3bn by the time the acquisition is scheduled to 
complete in the first quarter of the year.
