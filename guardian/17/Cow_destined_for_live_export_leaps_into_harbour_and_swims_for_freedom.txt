, jumping into the water at Fremantle harbour in Western Australia and swimming 
away.

It then outsmarted its pursuers, running off along the beach where it was 
still missing 24 hours later.

Fremantle Sea Rescue member Josh Gammon-Carson filmed the cow swimming in the 
water while he drove towards it on a jetski and tried to herd it back to shore 
on Sunday afternoon.

The cow eventually swam to shore where veterinarians and Fremantle port staff 
were waiting but it ran off south along the beach.

It was spotted more than 7km away at North Coogee later in the night.

The animal was one of 10 cattle being unloaded from a truck at Fremantle wharf 
by live export shipping company Wellard.

All 10 briefly escaped when they were incorrectly unloaded, owing to 
miscommunication that caused the truck driver not to follow procedures, a 
Wellard spokesman said.

Eight were quickly rounded up, one heifer injured its legs and was immediately 
euthanised, and the escapee jumped into the water.

Rangers and Wellard stockmen spent Sunday night and Monday looking for the cow 
after it was spotted by a member of the public at North Coogee, a City of 
Cockburn spokeswoman said.

“It’s a hot day. We’re quite worried about this poor guy,” she said, with 
temperatures rising to about 37C on Monday.
