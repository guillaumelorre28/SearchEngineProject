The couple, who live in Gloucestershire, have a £120,000 loan with Stroud & 
Swindon building society. The mortgage is at a 1.6 per cent discount off the 
building society's standard variable rate, but the deal comes to an end on 30 
April. If Andrew and Louise were to stay with Stroud & Swindon on its standard 
rate, they would have to pay 6.95 per cent, assuming no further reduction 
before then.

 Instead, the Masseys are moving to a fix with Principality building society, 
paying 4.99 per cent, fixed for five years. Repayments will be £486 a month on 
their interest-only loan; capital is covered by an endowment and a pension. 
Payments on the Stroud & Swindon deal have been falling, but from next month 
will be £585. The £100-a-month saving may be used to boost Louise's pension, 
but Andrew, a construction project manager says: 'We may just blow it on a 
holiday.'

 Andrew and Louise who have two daughters, Lottie and Katherine, are a new 
breed, swapping mortgage deals every few years as they expire. Andrew asked 
Stroud & Swindon what it could offer at the end of the discount deal. Stroud & 
Swindon was unable to match the Principality deal recommended by the broker, 
says Andrew.

 For the Masseys, a crucial factor was that they face no redemption penalties 
at the expiry of their discount with Stroud & Swindon. 'There were arrangement 
fees, but in terms of the savings, they were pretty negligible,' says Andrew.
