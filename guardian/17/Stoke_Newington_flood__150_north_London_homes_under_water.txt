northLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>.

About 350 people from 150 properties had to flee after a 30-inch pipe burst in 
Northwold Road, Stoke Newington, on Sunday, leaving nearby streets under 3ft (1 
metre) of water.

Thames Water <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water> said it had begun 
a full investigation into the incident, which followed similar instances of 
mains bursting in Blackheath in south-east London, on Saturday, and in 
Islington, north London, last Monday.

Bob Collington, director of Thames Water, said it had been an “extremely 
difficult week”.

He added: “I am personally devastated for those customers who have suffered 
flooding so close to Christmas. We are doing everything we can to help them and 
will make sure they are not left out of pocket for what has happened.

“The bursts are a clear reminder that we need to keep investing in our ageing 
and sometimes fragile network, with many pipes in London well over 100 years 
old.”

London fire brigade station manager Nicol McCallum, who was at the scene, 
said: “Crews used specialist inflatable boats to evacuate the most vulnerable 
residents and help others recover valuables. Firefighters laid down sandbags to 
try and minimise the water damage.”

Six fire engines and two fire and rescue units from stations including Stoke 
Newington, Homerton, Tottenham and Bethnal Green. The brigade said several 
basements were left under water by the flooding.

Hackney council said Stoke Newington town hall had been made available for 
emergency accommodation for anyone forced out of their homes.

Some residents expressed their anger about the situation on Twitter.

Thanks to @thameswater <https://twitter.com/thameswater> I have nowhere to 
work now. My place of work is flooded and I don't know how I'm going to pay my 
rent in January.

Thames Water said it was sending as many loss adjustors as possible to help 
customers.

The burst main should not affect water supplies in the area, the firm added.

The average UK household paid £396 for water and sewerage in 2014-15, 
according to the regulator Ofwat. This represents a 40% increase in real terms 
since privatisation, though most of this rise took place in the first five-year 
period between 1990 and 1995. The regulator has beencriticised by MPs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/13/uk-households-overpaying-water-regulator-miscalculation>
 on the public accounts committee for allowing bills to rise too much.

In September Ofwat said consumers would be able to choose their water supplier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/19/uk-water-regulator-backs-plan-to-open-up-market>
 for the first time under proposals that it claimed would cut bills and improve 
services by introducing competition. However, the proposed overhaul would only 
save households about £8 a year on their water bill, the industry watchdog said.
