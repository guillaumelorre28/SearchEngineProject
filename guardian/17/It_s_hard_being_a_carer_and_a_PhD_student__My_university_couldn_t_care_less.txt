I am a parent of a disabled teenager. My son is in and out of hospital and 
school. His learning disabilities and behaviour issues are a barrier for him, 
and he is teased because he limps. At home, he swears and punches me.

Sexual harassment is rife in universities, but complaining means risking your 
career

He has a referral for his anxiety, which the neurologist thinks could stem 
from an autistic spectrum disorder. He is on a waiting list somewhere for that. 
Meanwhile, there are hospital appointments to manage, at least four consultants 
on the go, and an imminent transfer to adult services. The bureaucracy of 
caring keeps me busy.


I used to work in the theatre industry but had to quit when my son kept 
getting excluded from school. I never expected that my life would turn out like 
this. But now, amazingly, I am doing a PhD at a Russell Group university, 
looking at non-white protagonists in historical drama. It is fascinating: 
under-represented characters! Hidden histories! Diversity!


I am starting to win awards for my research and I feel like a success story. 
Almost. There’s just one problem: I can’t get funding. I keep missing out on 
studentships and scholarships. These awards – which are mainly funded by 
research councils or universities directly – are worth about £14,000–£16,000 a 
year and usually include a fee waiver (saving a further £5,000). That’s a lot 
of money.


But the funding tends to go to students half my age with straight-A academic 
results – not to people like me, who have taken an unusual path to academia. 
When I was turned down for the last studentship I applied for, I asked why. The 
decision maker – a professor in my department and the head of a research 
institute – told me “it all comes down to stellar academic results”.


They don’t say this on the application forms; it’s all about the originality 
of your project, your research statement, your supervisor’s supporting 
statement, the panel that considers you, the level of competition. But when it 
comes down to it, this is clearly what they want. Someone with my background is 
never going to get a studentship if the decisive criteria are undergraduate and 
master’s results.


I'm afraid my crippling shyness will ruin my career

A poor excuse

People like me, in the diversity and inclusion basket, are told to search 
through theAlternative Funding Guide <https://www.postgraduate-funding.com/>. 
This is where my university’s funding office directed me. My graduate school 
offered an Alternative Funding Guide training session, and my second supervisor 
simply said: “I’m told that writing lots of letters does the trick.” The 
Alternative Funding Guide is the university’s excuse for not serving vulnerable 
groups of research students.


I would need to be a professional full-time fundraiser to raise the equivalent 
of a £14,000 studentship. I worked out that even if I was successful at all the 
funds I applied to, the maximum I could raise would be £6,000 – far short of a 
studentship.


And these studentships come with all sorts of other benefits: they have 
welcome drinks and canapés, there are extra funding streams to support 
conferences and research trips, there are the retreats, the conferences, the 
Christmas parties.


When I started my PhD and realised that I would need financial help, I went to 
the student advice office and told them that I am a carer. They asked what that 
meant and then offered me advice on benefits, but not funding. I went to the 
student union advice service – they referred me back to student advice. I went 
to the graduate school. Same response. I spoke to a vice dean and a chaplain. I 
had to tell them what a carer is. You get the picture. I was invisible. So I 
gave up, decided to apply annually for the studentships and kept my part-time 
job.


This is discrimination and it is self-perpetuating. We only fund those who 
have already achieved, and we fund them to continue to achieve. The rest of us 
trying to climb the ladder can source our own drinks and canapés, we’re not 
invited to the party. Yet, as fee-paying students, our universities still want 
to take the credit for our determination and brilliance.


I will always be a carer of a disabled child. This is going to impact my 
career in academia now and forever, and I know this. Will I be able to juggle 
research and lecturing in a university with my son’s hospital appointments? 
Will I have to explain what it means to be a carer each time I start a new job 
and in every department – HR, faculty, department office, and so on?


Only the rich can afford to work at Oxford and Cambridge

Ucas announced this year that young carers will now be able to identify 
themselves in their applications 
<https://carers.org/news-item/ucas-form-identify-student-carers>, so that 
universities will be able to support them. But how is this going to happen if 
staff at these institutions don’t even know what a carer is?


The student welfare vice-president at the union has finally agreed with me 
that carers are an under-supported and under-represented group on campus. We 
are going to ask student records to add an option to the equality and diversity 
monitoring section, so that we can identify as carers and hopefully raise 
awareness. Wish us luck.
