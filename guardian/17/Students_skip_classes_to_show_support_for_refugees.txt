Students <https://www.theguardian.com/education/students> across the country 
have been walking out of their lectures and classes in solidarity with what 
they see as the government’s poor treatment of refugees, migrants and 
international students.

The National Union of Students’ international campaign, which organised the 
“day of solidarity”, has received backing from the University and College 
Union, the academic workers’ union and the National Campaign Against Fees and 
Cuts (NCAFC). The protesters are using the hashtag #students4migrants on social 
media.

Students at the London School of Economics (LSE) staged a mock border control 
point to show support for a world without borders. The LSE student union 
encouraged members to spend the day performing charitable work for refugee 
organisations.

Damien Kemfack, international students officer at LSE’s student union, said: 
“With the highest percentage of international students in the country, the 
impact of a large number of participating LSE students should be tangibly felt.”

Students at the Royal College of Arts demonstrated outside the Daily Mail’s 
headquarters in Kensington, west London, to protest against its stance on 
immigration.

Miloslav Vorlíček, co-president of the RCA’s student union, said: “The Daily 
Mail is noted for a long history of anti-immigration headlines. We hope to 
shine a spotlight on this paper’s activities. Who knows, we might even convince 
one or two of its employees to walk away from the dark side!”

Students at Goldsmiths, University of London, are showing their support for 
refugees throughout November. Daniel Nasr, education officer at its student 
union, said: “[Today’s protest] falls in line with November’s refugee awareness 
month where there are tens of other events surrounding the struggle of migrants 
worldwide.”

The union will host an exhibition on asylum seeking in the UK, a performance 
by the Middle Eastern group47Soul

Syria and other war-hit areas.

Students in Essex, Sussex, Reading, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, 
Liverpool, Plymouth, Cardiff, Glasgow, Edinburgh and elsewhere are also taking 
part in the day of protest.

Mostafa Rajaai, international students’ officer at the NUS, said: “We want to 
send a clear message to the government that students in this country 
overwhelmingly reject the attitude and direction that the UK has adopted 
regarding immigration.

“The failure to respond adequately to the refugee crisis, the mistreatment of 
international students and the constant attacks on migrants’ rights are all 
part of the wider anti-migrant sentiment which is on the rise in the UK 
political establishment.”


Alex Norman, international student rep at the NCAFC, said: “The demand for 
free education is empty if it is not inclusive of migrants. We cannot solve the 
migrant crisis and anti-immigration rhetoric by making small changes, we can 
only put it off. We have to have clear demands for the destruction of borders, 
free movement and full support for migrants.”
