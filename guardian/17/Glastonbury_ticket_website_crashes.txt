The website selling Glastonbury festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury> tickets crashed on Sunday 
morning before they were due to go on sale.

Music lovers hoping to snap up tickets from See Tickets were left to stare at 
a message saying the site was unavailable as the 9am start time passed.

The official Glastonbury festival website was also down. This year there are 
no telephone ticket sales available, with all customers being directed to 
glastonbury.seetickets.com.

Fans vented their frustration on Twitter. One ticket hopeful called Ciara 
tweeted: “Fourth year trying for Glastonbury tickets and once again the page 
won’t even load. Every year this happens.”

Another called Mikey said: “Will they ever make the servers big enough that 
they don’t crash five minutes before the start lmao Glastonbury.”

A £10 price increase on last year means festivalgoers will have to cough up 
£238 plus a £5 booking fee for access to the 900-acre site, although fans are 
not asked to pay the full balance until spring 2017.

On Thursday the coach package batch of tickets sold out in just 23 minutes 
with a number of fans experiencing website difficulties, and last year 120,000 
passes were snapped up in just over half an hour.

The historic festival will take its traditional fallow year after 2017, 
meaning those who miss out on tickets will have to wait until at least 2019 for 
the next event.

See Tickets tweeted: “Huge demand for GlastoFest tickets this morning. Tickets 
selling so do keep trying.

“If you’re trying to book GlastoFest tickets please stick to one tab/device 
only.”

Festival organiser Emily Eavis, daughter of its founder, Michael Eavis, 
tweeted: “Thank you for your patience. Tickets are selling (over half way now), 
do keep trying but stick to one screen please.”
