Columbian singer Shakira, who collected a WEF Crystal Award last night, has 
been discussing her work building schools in the most downtrodden parts of the 
country:

“Sometimes we encounter a tremendous lack of infrastructure. No portable water 
in many cases, no electricity, no paved roads, so it definitely means that we 
have to work twice as hard in order to offer a quality education.”

Not only that, but many of the children concerned are affected by violence or 
have lost family members.

John Kerry also urged Europe to “believe in itself”, and remember that 
European integration was driven by the need to stop European’s killing each 
other.

“It’s worked, folks!, said Kerry, adding:

 “On the face of the planet, no assembly of countries has grown as 
significantly and powerfully as Europe.

FTSE 100 in biggest daily fall since Brexit vote, pound jumps nearly 3%

Nick Fletcher

Away from Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> again, and 
European markets have closed for the day, with the UK the focus of attention.

A positive reaction to UK prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit speech, notably 
the promise that parliament would be able to vote on any deal with the U, 
helped push the pound almost 3% higher, its biggest daily rise since 1998.

Sterling was already edging higher before the speech, recovering some ground 
after the government’s hard Brexit suggestions at the weekend. A weak US dollar 
as Donald Trump said the American currency was overvalued helped here, as did 
stronger than expected UK inflation figures which suggested the next move in UK 
interest rates would be upwards.

The jump in the pound, conversely, knocked back the FTSE 100, which recorded 
its biggest daily fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote last 
June. The FTSE 100 has been boosted for several months by the fall in the 
pound, which helps the overseas earners and exporters which dominate the 
leading index.

So the rise in sterling - which is currently 2.8% higher against the dollar at 
$1.2382 and up 1.87% against the euro at €1.1577 - has had the opposite effect, 
and the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.46% to 7220.38.

European markets have edged lower, with Germany’s Dax down 0.13% and France’s 
Cac closing 0.46% lower.

In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 29 points or 0.15%.

Kerry: Iran deal will last

John Kerry, the outgoing US secretary of state, has cited the Iran nuclear 
deal as proof that engaging with other nations to deliver peace can pay off.

On his final trip to Europe before leaving office, Kerry told Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> that the Iran deal was one of the 
successes of the Obama presidency, and proof that diplomacy works.

Kerry says:

There are now no longer 19,000 centrifuges spinning and enriching, there are 
5,000, which is the agreement.

There is no longer a 12,000 kg stockpile that could produce 10 to 12 bombs. 
There’s 300kg, measurable every day. And you can’t build a bomb with 300kg.

This is an agreement that can endure, he adds.

Donald Trump has criticised the Iran deal, raising concerns that it could 
unravel.

Kerry, though, insists it can last.

Take Iran. If the United States were to decide suddenly that we’re not going 
to pursue this, I bet you that our friends and allies who negotiated this with 
us will get together, and Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain will say 
‘this is a good deal, we’re going to keep it.

And we’ll have done a great injury to ourselves. And it will hurt for a year, 
two years, while the administration is there <cue laughter>.

Kerry also cites the Paris climate change agreement, progress towards ending 
the war in Yemen, as reasons to be optimistic about the future.

And he say he won’t guess whether Trump really believes some of the things 
he’s said in the race for the White House.

Hollywood Matt Damon is talking to the press about his Water.org charity, and 
the challenges in raising money.

Water.org wants to guarantee clean water for everyone in the world; a great 
goal, but one which hasn’t been easy to attract funding.

Damon says:

We’ve tried humour -- a few years ago I went on a toilet strike for an entire 
year.

One of the first hurdles we’ve had to clear in the West is that it’s very hard 
for people to relate to this issue. If you grew up in Europe, if you grew up in 
America, you’ve never been thirsty in your entire life and you’ve never been 
five metres away from a clean drink water.

The water in our toilet is cleaner than the water that 663m people have access 
to.

Damon adds that he has very high hopes for a partnership with Stella Artois, 
the brewer.This will mean extra funding for Water.org, which provides 
affortable micro-loans to help communities install clean water equipment.

You can go into a pub in the UK or America and buy a pint of Stella, and for 
that one pint of Stella, they will guarantee bringing someone in the developing 
world clean water for a month.

S&P’s Paul Sheard also believes President Xi genuinely wants to avoid a trade 
war (one of the key points of his pro-gobalisation speech this morning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/17/davos-2017-wef-chinese-president-xi-trump-scaramucci-brexit-hsbc-live?page=with:block-587df588e4b0f0efb00f4b98#block-587df588e4b0f0efb00f4b98>
).

Sheard explains that China would come off worse than America if globalisation 
and free trade falters.


If you did go into a trade ice age, who would be better placed to survive it, 
economically? I think the answer is the US, because the US is a very large 
economy, resource rich, with a very large population.

Smaller export-driven countries such as Mexico would obviously suffer more, 
while China (although a huge economy) is still in the development phase.

China has got more to lose in terms of making sure that process of economic 
development continues than the US would. That doesn’t make it a good thing to 
go that way, but just in terms of the relative economic costs, it would be 
higher.

But.... a one-party state like China is in a better state to survive the 
political consequences of a trade war, while President Trump could suffer an 
electoral backlash.

Sheard says:

It’s not clear that Trump has the upper hand. You’ve got the mid-terms in two 
years. If it’s like ‘oh my god this guy screwed up’, he’s on a short fuse.

S&P's Sheard: Trump wants fair trade

Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&P, says Anthony Scaramucci is on a 
one-man mission to explain Donald Trump’s economic policies toDavos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> this week.

Speaking to me at Davos, Sheard explains:


Scaramucci went a long way at this meeting to clarifying, probably for many 
people, what the basic intent of the Trump administration is likely to be.

Trump’s been talking about free - he’s a big supporter of free trade - but he 
also wants to be fair trade.

That means “We’ll open to you, but you’ve got to open to us.

As we covered earlier, Scaramucci insisted that the US is committed to free 
trade - but wants more “symmetry” (rather than letting the other country get 
the best of the deal).

The FT’s Gillian Tett has a good write-up here:

trade & NATO.https://t.co/HfzD78e0vV <https://t.co/HfzD78e0vV>

Wall Street and FTSE 100 fall, pound soars

Nick Fletcher

Away from Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> for a moment, and 
Wall Street has opened lower after president-elect Donald Trump’s comments that 
the dollar was overvalued knocked the US currency lower.

In turn, a falling greenback plus higher than expected UK inflation and a 
positive response to prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit speech - notably the 
line that parliament will be able to vote on any deal - has boosted the pound 
and pushed the FTSE 100 lower. The index is full of dollar earners who have 
benefited from the weak pound in recent months but are now heading lower as 
sterling strengthens.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has returned after the Martin Luther King day 
break with a 62 point or 0.33% decline. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is down 1% at 
7247, on track for its biggest one day fall since November, while European 
markets have also edged lower.

As for the pound, it is currently 2.6% higher and on track for its best daily 
performance since December 2008.

IHS's Behravesh: Now Xi must deliver

IHS Markit chief economist Dr Nariman Behravesh 
<https://twitter.com/N_Behravesh> agrees that president Xi’s speech on 
globalisation and free trade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/17/davos-2017-wef-chinese-president-xi-trump-scaramucci-brexit-hsbc-live?page=with:block-587deee4e4b01065cf5974a8#block-587deee4e4b01065cf5974a8>
 was “very encouraging”; but the real test is whether he delivers on it.


President Xi gave a very rigorous and articulate defence of globalisation. 
Essentially, he said that we should not blame all the world’s problems on 
globalisation and that the benefits outweigh the costs.

Very importantly, he made commitments about opening China up to more imports 
and foreign direct investment and making sure that China’s exchange rate policy 
didn’t destabilize the global economy. All this is very encouraging.

However, actions speak louder than words. A lot will depend on what China 
does. This is a good start. This is a good set of commitments on his part. It 
is encouraging, but we will see what the follow through is.

Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci is speaking again – and 
insisting that the next US government doesn’t want a trade war either.

Scaramucci says the president-elect wants a very strong relationship with 
China:

war.”

Scaramucci — “President Trump could be one of the last great hopes for 
globalism.”

Scaramucci also talking in desperately glowing terms about how Donald Trump 
won the US election, and why he joined the Trump campaign.

Scaramucci says he realised that Trump was on to something after he met with 
visitors to a rally. The common thread was that they were on government 
assistance because factories had been closed.


Scaramucci says:

And I started going through the crowd, and I thought ‘oh my god, these are the 
people I grew up with’.

The “great irony of this story” is that it was a billionaire real estate 
developer who picked up on these concerns and offered solutions, Scaramucci 
adds.

Scaramucci claims there’s only one (!) negative with Trump – he’s always on 
the go.

I don’t know when he sleeps.... We need to outwork him, and it’s not possible.

He criticises the media for assuming that Trump’s huge rallies wouldn’t 
actually translate into votes on election day.

If someone is willing to wait in the rain for eight hours outside an arena, do 
you think they’re not going to show up and vote?

On other politicians, Scaramucci says the president-elect has “a tremendous 
amount of respect for chancellor Merkel, and president Putin”.


Scaramucci insist that Trump isn’t at all racist (despite his comments about 
Mexicans, muslims and immigrants during the campaign - andthat barney with the 
respected civil rights leader John Lewis last week 
<http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/why-trump-s-attack-john-lewis-came-particularly-bad-time-n707371>
).

But what about the big issue of Nato? Does Trump really think it’s obsolete?

Scaramucci says the alliance needs radical reforms to adjust to today’s 
political climate;comments that may not reassure the Baltic states.

Environmental campaigners have welcomed President Xi’s call for leaders to 
stick with the Paris Climate Change deal.

Here’s Li Shuo, <https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/li-shuo> Senior Global 
Policy Advisor atGreenpeace East Asia:

“Given the current volatility of global politics, President Xi Jinping’s 
address today inDavos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> helped calm 
nerves. His reference to climate change highlights a growing sense of China’s 
international responsibility, and the country’s evolving calculus towards 
taking action on the issue.

 “As Mr. Trump drops President Obama’s climate legacy, Mr. Xi might well 
establish one of his own. 2017 presents a real opportunity for China to rise to 
the challenge of responsible climate leadership. Having moved from climate 
villain to a reluctant leader in five short years over the first half of this 
decade, it’s reasonable to expect China to become a true leader by its end.”

Xi addresses WEF: Instant reaction

The global elite who gather at Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> each January have waited more than 
40 years for a Chinese president to address them.

And Xi Jinping was worth the wait, delivering a rollicking defence of 
globalisation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/17/davos-2017-wef-chinese-president-xi-trump-scaramucci-brexit-hsbc-live?page=with:block-587deee4e4b01065cf5974a8#block-587deee4e4b01065cf5974a8>
 that would have been unthinkable from a Chinese leader in the past.

While the hall was packed out with business leaders and politicians, many of 
Xi’s remarks were aimed at one person who certainly isn’t at Davos - Donald 
Trump.

The key moment was probably when Xi insisted that a trade war would be in 
no-one’s interests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/17/davos-2017-wef-chinese-president-xi-trump-scaramucci-brexit-hsbc-live?page=with:block-587df588e4b0f0efb00f4b98#block-587df588e4b0f0efb00f4b98>
, and dismissed protectionism as simply locking oneself in a dark room.

His pointed reminders about the strength of the Chinese economy - all those 
tourists, all that trade - were another jibe at those who think world trade has 
gone too far.

And by stoutly defending globalisation, Xi is hoping that other world leaders 
might be on his side if relations with Washington deteriorate.

The speech definitely went down well in Davos, and beyond:

<https://twitter.com/endacurran/status/821304876487454720> 
Of course; these speeches are often notable for what’s missing; Xi didn’t talk 
about Chinese dumping of steel on European markets, the Great Firewall 
preventing citizens getting full access to the Internet.

And his talk about staying resolute in stormy seas won’t comfort those in the 
west losing their jobs, either to automation or free trade.

Experienced China-watched George Magnus, former chief economist of UBS, isn’t 
convinced that the president will live up to the vision he laid out today.

C'mon Twitter, you think Xi JinPing is the new champion of free trade and a

China’s president Xi may have played to a packed house at Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos>, but there was another key player 
on delegates’ minds - and apparently Xi’s too - while not even being there. 
That person of course is Donald Trump. Larry Elliott writes:

Hamlet without the prince. That, bluntly, is how Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> feels this year.

The usual caravan of business leaders, academics, clerics, journalists and 
celebs has trekked up into the high Alps for their annual January get-together 
but the man everyone is talking about is 3,000 miles away awaiting his 
inauguration in Washington later this week.

Donald Trump  <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>is dominating 
proceedings. Thesurvey of business executives conducted by PwC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/16/top-bosses-globalisation-pwc-survey-free-trade>
 showed that companies are worried by Trump’s protectionist rhetoric. 
Predictably, the concerns are strongest in the US and Mexico given what the 
president-elect has said about building a wall along the Rio Grande.

But Trump’s influence can be felt in other ways. The manner in which he won 
the US election, tapping in to deep-seated anger about the unfair distribution 
of the spoils of economic growth, has been noted.There is talk in Davos of the 
need to ensure that globalisation works for everyone.

The first day of the World Economic Forum is nearly over, so we’re going to 
take a break. I’ll be back if there are any major developments - in the 
meantime, here’s our news story on president Xi’s visit:

Xi Jinping signals China will champion free trade if Trump builds barriers

Columbian singer Shakira, who collected a WEF Crystal Award last night, has 
been discussing her work building schools in the most downtrodden parts of the 
country:

“Sometimes we encounter a tremendous lack of infrastructure. No portable water 
in many cases, no electricity, no paved roads, so it definitely means that we 
have to work twice as hard in order to offer a quality education.”

Not only that, but many of the children concerned are affected by violence or 
have lost family members.
 
John Kerry also urged Europe to “believe in itself”, and remember that 
European integration was driven by the need to stop European’s killing each 
other.

“It’s worked, folks!, said Kerry, adding:

 “On the face of the planet, no assembly of countries has grown as 
significantly and powerfully as Europe.
 
Away from Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> again, and 
European markets have closed for the day, with the UK the focus of attention.

A positive reaction to UK prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit speech, notably 
the promise that parliament would be able to vote on any deal with the U, 
helped push the pound almost 3% higher, its biggest daily rise since 1998.

Sterling was already edging higher before the speech, recovering some ground 
after the government’s hard Brexit suggestions at the weekend. A weak US dollar 
as Donald Trump said the American currency was overvalued helped here, as did 
stronger than expected UK inflation figures which suggested the next move in UK 
interest rates would be upwards.

The jump in the pound, conversely, knocked back the FTSE 100, which recorded 
its biggest daily fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote last 
June. The FTSE 100 has been boosted for several months by the fall in the 
pound, which helps the overseas earners and exporters which dominate the 
leading index.

So the rise in sterling - which is currently 2.8% higher against the dollar at 
$1.2382 and up 1.87% against the euro at €1.1577 - has had the opposite effect, 
and the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.46% to 7220.38.

European markets have edged lower, with Germany’s Dax down 0.13% and France’s 
Cac closing 0.46% lower.

In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 29 points or 0.15%.
 
President Xi’s trip to Switzerland is already making headlines:

John Kerry, the outgoing US secretary of state, has cited the Iran nuclear 
deal as proof that engaging with other nations to deliver peace can pay off.

On his final trip to Europe before leaving office, Kerry told Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> that the Iran deal was one of the 
successes of the Obama presidency, and proof that diplomacy works.

Kerry says:

There are now no longer 19,000 centrifuges spinning and enriching, there are 
5,000, which is the agreement.

There is no longer a 12,000 kg stockpile that could produce 10 to 12 bombs. 
There’s 300kg, measurable every day. And you can’t build a bomb with 300kg.

This is an agreement that can endure, he adds.

Donald Trump has criticised the Iran deal, raising concerns that it could 
unravel.

Kerry, though, insists it can last.

Take Iran. If the United States were to decide suddenly that we’re not going 
to pursue this, I bet you that our friends and allies who negotiated this with 
us will get together, and Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain will say 
‘this is a good deal, we’re going to keep it.

And we’ll have done a great injury to ourselves. And it will hurt for a year, 
two years, while the administration is there <cue laughter>.

Kerry also cites the Paris climate change agreement, progress towards ending 
the war in Yemen, as reasons to be optimistic about the future.

And he say he won’t guess whether Trump really believes some of the things 
he’s said in the race for the White House.

Hollywood Matt Damon is talking to the press about his Water.org charity, and 
the challenges in raising money.

Water.org wants to guarantee clean water for everyone in the world; a great 
goal, but one which hasn’t been easy to attract funding.

Damon says:

We’ve tried humour -- a few years ago I went on a toilet strike for an entire 
year.

One of the first hurdles we’ve had to clear in the West is that it’s very hard 
for people to relate to this issue. If you grew up in Europe, if you grew up in 
America, you’ve never been thirsty in your entire life and you’ve never been 
five metres away from a clean drink water.

The water in our toilet is cleaner than the water that 663m people have access 
to.

Damon adds that he has very high hopes for a partnership with Stella Artois, 
the brewer.This will mean extra funding for Water.org, which provides 
affortable micro-loans to help communities install clean water equipment.

You can go into a pub in the UK or America and buy a pint of Stella, and for 
that one pint of Stella, they will guarantee bringing someone in the developing 
world clean water for a month.
 
S&P’s Paul Sheard also believes President Xi genuinely wants to avoid a trade 
war (one of the key points of his pro-gobalisation speech this morning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/17/davos-2017-wef-chinese-president-xi-trump-scaramucci-brexit-hsbc-live?page=with:block-587df588e4b0f0efb00f4b98#block-587df588e4b0f0efb00f4b98>
).

Sheard explains that China would come off worse than America if globalisation 
and free trade falters.


If you did go into a trade ice age, who would be better placed to survive it, 
economically? I think the answer is the US, because the US is a very large 
economy, resource rich, with a very large population.

Smaller export-driven countries such as Mexico would obviously suffer more, 
while China (although a huge economy) is still in the development phase.

China has got more to lose in terms of making sure that process of economic 
development continues than the US would. That doesn’t make it a good thing to 
go that way, but just in terms of the relative economic costs, it would be 
higher.

But.... a one-party state like China is in a better state to survive the 
political consequences of a trade war, while President Trump could suffer an 
electoral backlash.

Sheard says:

It’s not clear that Trump has the upper hand. You’ve got the mid-terms in two 
years. If it’s like ‘oh my god this guy screwed up’, he’s on a short fuse.
 
Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&P, says Anthony Scaramucci is on a 
one-man mission to explain Donald Trump’s economic policies toDavos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> this week.

Speaking to me at Davos, Sheard explains:


Scaramucci went a long way at this meeting to clarifying, probably for many 
people, what the basic intent of the Trump administration is likely to be.

Trump’s been talking about free - he’s a big supporter of free trade - but he 
also wants to be fair trade.

That means “We’ll open to you, but you’ve got to open to us.

As we covered earlier, Scaramucci insisted that the US is committed to free 
trade - but wants more “symmetry” (rather than letting the other country get 
the best of the deal).

The FT’s Gillian Tett has a good write-up here:
Brooke Fox (@brookefox91) 
Scaramucci gives insight in Davos: Trump committed to globalisation, open 
trade & NATO.https://t.co/HfzD78e0vV <https://t.co/HfzD78e0vV>

Away from Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> for a moment, and 
Wall Street has opened lower after president-elect Donald Trump’s comments that 
the dollar was overvalued knocked the US currency lower.

In turn, a falling greenback plus higher than expected UK inflation and a 
positive response to prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit speech - notably the 
line that parliament will be able to vote on any deal - has boosted the pound 
and pushed the FTSE 100 lower. The index is full of dollar earners who have 
benefited from the weak pound in recent months but are now heading lower as 
sterling strengthens.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has returned after the Martin Luther King day 
break with a 62 point or 0.33% decline. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is down 1% at 
7247, on track for its biggest one day fall since November, while European 
markets have also edged lower.

As for the pound, it is currently 2.6% higher and on track for its best daily 
performance since December 2008.

IHS Markit chief economist Dr Nariman Behravesh 
<https://twitter.com/N_Behravesh> agrees that president Xi’s speech on 
globalisation and free trade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/17/davos-2017-wef-chinese-president-xi-trump-scaramucci-brexit-hsbc-live?page=with:block-587deee4e4b01065cf5974a8#block-587deee4e4b01065cf5974a8>
 was “very encouraging”; but the real test is whether he delivers on it.


President Xi gave a very rigorous and articulate defence of globalisation. 
Essentially, he said that we should not blame all the world’s problems on 
globalisation and that the benefits outweigh the costs.

Very importantly, he made commitments about opening China up to more imports 
and foreign direct investment and making sure that China’s exchange rate policy 
didn’t destabilize the global economy. All this is very encouraging.

However, actions speak louder than words. A lot will depend on what China 
does. This is a good start. This is a good set of commitments on his part. It 
is encouraging, but we will see what the follow through is.
 
Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci is speaking again – and 
insisting that the next US government doesn’t want a trade war either.

Scaramucci says the president-elect wants a very strong relationship with 
China:

Scaramucci also talking in desperately glowing terms about how Donald Trump 
won the US election, and why he joined the Trump campaign.

Scaramucci says he realised that Trump was on to something after he met with 
visitors to a rally. The common thread was that they were on government 
assistance because factories had been closed.


Scaramucci says:

And I started going through the crowd, and I thought ‘oh my god, these are the 
people I grew up with’.

The “great irony of this story” is that it was a billionaire real estate 
developer who picked up on these concerns and offered solutions, Scaramucci 
adds.

Scaramucci claims there’s only one (!) negative with Trump – he’s always on 
the go.

I don’t know when he sleeps.... We need to outwork him, and it’s not possible.

He criticises the media for assuming that Trump’s huge rallies wouldn’t 
actually translate into votes on election day.

If someone is willing to wait in the rain for eight hours outside an arena, do 
you think they’re not going to show up and vote?

On other politicians, Scaramucci says the president-elect has “a tremendous 
amount of respect for chancellor Merkel, and president Putin”.


Scaramucci insist that Trump isn’t at all racist (despite his comments about 
Mexicans, muslims and immigrants during the campaign - andthat barney with the 
respected civil rights leader John Lewis last week

But what about the big issue of Nato? Does Trump really think it’s obsolete?

Scaramucci says the alliance needs radical reforms to adjust to today’s 
political climate;comments that may not reassure the Baltic states.

Environmental campaigners have welcomed President Xi’s call for leaders to 
stick with the Paris Climate Change deal.

Here’s Li Shuo, <https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/li-shuo> Senior Global 
Policy Advisor atGreenpeace East Asia:

“Given the current volatility of global politics, President Xi Jinping’s 
address today inDavos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> helped calm 
nerves. His reference to climate change highlights a growing sense of China’s 
international responsibility, and the country’s evolving calculus towards 
taking action on the issue.

 “As Mr. Trump drops President Obama’s climate legacy, Mr. Xi might well 
establish one of his own. 2017 presents a real opportunity for China to rise to 
the challenge of responsible climate leadership. Having moved from climate 
villain to a reluctant leader in five short years over the first half of this 
decade, it’s reasonable to expect China to become a true leader by its end.”
 
The global elite who gather at Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> each January have waited more than 
40 years for a Chinese president to address them.

And Xi Jinping was worth the wait, delivering a rollicking defence of 
globalisation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/17/davos-2017-wef-chinese-president-xi-trump-scaramucci-brexit-hsbc-live?page=with:block-587deee4e4b01065cf5974a8#block-587deee4e4b01065cf5974a8>
 that would have been unthinkable from a Chinese leader in the past.

While the hall was packed out with business leaders and politicians, many of 
Xi’s remarks were aimed at one person who certainly isn’t at Davos - Donald 
Trump.

The key moment was probably when Xi insisted that a trade war would be in 
no-one’s interests 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/17/davos-2017-wef-chinese-president-xi-trump-scaramucci-brexit-hsbc-live?page=with:block-587df588e4b0f0efb00f4b98#block-587df588e4b0f0efb00f4b98>
, and dismissed protectionism as simply locking oneself in a dark room.

His pointed reminders about the strength of the Chinese economy - all those 
tourists, all that trade - were another jibe at those who think world trade has 
gone too far.

And by stoutly defending globalisation, Xi is hoping that other world leaders 
might be on his side if relations with Washington deteriorate.

The speech definitely went down well in Davos, and beyond:

@louisabojesen <https://twitter.com/louisabojesen> nice to hear something 
inspiring as opposed to enraging

Xi's speech is a serious rebuttal of the 
anti-globalization/Trumponomics/Brexit narrative. Striking contrast

Of course; these speeches are often notable for what’s missing; Xi didn’t talk 
about Chinese dumping of steel on European markets, the Great Firewall 
preventing citizens getting full access to the Internet.

And his talk about staying resolute in stormy seas won’t comfort those in the 
west losing their jobs, either to automation or free trade.

Experienced China-watched George Magnus, former chief economist of UBS, isn’t 
convinced that the president will live up to the vision he laid out today.

C'mon Twitter, you think Xi JinPing is the new champion of free trade and a 
liberal trading order? Big show at Davos, I know, now calm down

But still -- a speech to remember, not least because who gave it; 2017 is 
going to be another year to remember.

It's surreal. A Chinese president giving a speech one might have expected from 
a US president.#Davos <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Davos?src=hash>

China’s president Xi may have played to a packed house at Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos>, but there was another key player 
on delegates’ minds - and apparently Xi’s too - while not even being there. 
That person of course is Donald Trump. Larry Elliott writes:

Hamlet without the prince. That, bluntly, is how Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> feels this year.

The usual caravan of business leaders, academics, clerics, journalists and 
celebs has trekked up into the high Alps for their annual January get-together 
but the man everyone is talking about is 3,000 miles away awaiting his 
inauguration in Washington later this week.

Donald Trump  <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>is dominating 
proceedings. Thesurvey of business executives conducted by PwC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/16/top-bosses-globalisation-pwc-survey-free-trade>
 showed that companies are worried by Trump’s protectionist rhetoric. 
Predictably, the concerns are strongest in the US and Mexico given what the 
president-elect has said about building a wall along the Rio Grande.

But Trump’s influence can be felt in other ways. The manner in which he won 
the US election, tapping in to deep-seated anger about the unfair distribution 
of the spoils of economic growth, has been noted.There is talk in Davos of the 
need to ensure that globalisation works for everyone.

Davos without Trump is like Hamlet without the prince
