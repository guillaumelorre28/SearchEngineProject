Michael Gove, the former justice secretary and prominent leave campaigner, has 
held a personal meeting withDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, and written about it for the 
Times.

Gove, who has a regular column with the newspaper he worked for before being 
elected as MP for Surrey Heath, was co-chair of campaign groupVote Leave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week>
, and his decision tostand for the Conservative leadership 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/07/michael-gove-admits-disappointment-over-tory-leadership-loss>
 scuppered the hopes of Boris Johnson.

News that Gove and the US president-elect have met for an interview that will 
appear in the Times on Monday is likely to irritate No 10, which has carefully 
been laying the groundwork for theprime minister to travel to Washington DC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/05/theresa-mays-aides-visit-donald-trump-team-before-leaders-meeting>
 to visit Trump, perhaps as soon as next month.

The interview was conducted along with a journalist from German newspaper 
Bild. Trailing the contents before its 10pm online publication, the newspaper’s 
publisher, Kai Diekmann, suggested that BMW formed at least one part of the 
discussion.

May sacked Gove, along with longtime allies including George Osborne, in the 
reshuffle she carried out

.

Britain’s relationship with the US is likely to be crucial as May’s government 
prepares for life outside the EU. Trump has suggested he would be keen to 
strike a trade deal with the UK, in striking contrast to Barack Obama, who said 
during the referendum campaign that Britain would be at“the back of the queue” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/22/barack-obama-brexit-uk-back-of-queue-for-trade-talks>
 for trade talks if it voted for Brexit.

Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has held meetings with key members 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/09/boris-johnson-holds-warm-and-frank-talks-with-trump-aides>
 of Trump’s transition team in Washington, and May’s two closest advisers,Fiona 
Hill and Nick Timothy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/may-appoints-former-advisers-as-joint-chiefs-of-staff>
, have also visited. The publication of Gove’s interview with Trump comes as 
the prime minister prepares toset out her aims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/15/theresa-may-uk-is-prepared-to-accept-hard-brexit>
 in Brexit negotiations in a major speech on Tuesday.

Gove is known to be close to Rupert Murdoch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/04/rupert-murdoch-jerry-hall-wedding-guestlist-gove-brooks>
 and news that he has secured an interview will prompt speculation that it was 
brokered by the media magnate, whose Fox News network gave favourable coverage 
to Trump’s campaign.

Asked about the interview, a No 10 insider said it “sounds like a good read”.
