The winner

Declining just 15% from the previous weekend, Gone Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl> easily holds on to the top spot 
for a second week, and has now grossed a robust £9.83m after just 11 days. The 
David Fincher thriller is one of only eight 2014 releases to achieve two 
weekends at £3m-plus at the UK box-office, the others being The Wolf of Wall 
Street, The Lego Movie, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, X-Men: Days of Future Past, 
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Guardians of the Galaxy and The Inbetweeners 2. 
Major hits that failed to manage £3m in their second week this year include 
Transformers: Age of Extinction, Maleficent, Godzilla and Captain America: The 
Winter Soldier.

Gone Girl is doing particularly well considering its 18 certificate makes it 
unavailable to a significant slice of regular cinemagoers. The Wolf of Wall 
Street is the biggest-grossing 18-certificate film of all time, with £22.7m, 
ahead of Hannibal (£21.6m) and American Beauty (£21.3m). It’s too early to 
predict just how farGone Girl <https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl> will 
climb up the all-time rankings for 18-certificate films, but the competition 
gets sparse above £15m box-office takings.

Since Gone Girl is based on popular source material (Gillian Flynn’s 
bestselling novel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/03/gone-girl-phenomenon-gillian-flynn>
), you might expect a more frontloaded revenue curve: a big opening as fans 
flock, followed by big drops. The fact that the opposite has occurred is very 
good news for the film, suggesting it is reaching far beyond fans of the book. 
The Wolf of Wall Street saw successive drops of 22%, 34%, 33% and 30% in the 
weekends following its release. It stood at £10.9m at the same stage of its 
run, about 11% ahead of Gone Girl.

 The Maze Runner: slightly short of expected UK box office. Photograph: 
Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar/20th Century Fox 
Smiles all round at the Soho Square offices of Fox UK as the company lands 
both the number one and two films in the market.The Maze Runner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-maze-runner> nabs the runner-up spot with 
an opening gross of £2.04m including previews of £112,000. Among the second 
tier of young adult novel adaptations fighting for bragging rights in the 
shadow of The Hunger Games, this figure is marginally ahead of the debut for
Divergent <https://www.theguardian.com/film/divergent>, which kicked off with 
£1.77m back in April.

The Maze Runner debuted in the US with $32.5m, so an equivalent UK result 
would be around £3.2m, a fair bit ahead of the achieved outcome. It’s fair to 
assume thatJames Dashner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/oct/10/the-maze-runner-james-dashner-interview>
’s novel series hasn’t penetrated the UK market as thoroughly as it has in the 
US. Young adult movies in general have done less well in the UK than the US, 
even making necessary adjustments for population size. For example, in 2013, 
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was the biggest-grossing hit of the year in the 
US, but in the UK it was beaten by the likes of Despicable Me 2, The Hobbit: 
The Desolation of Smaug and Frozen.

 Annabelle: box office reaping is child’s play. Photograph: AP/Courtesy Warner 
Bros Pictures 
Critics were hardly impressed with horror flick Annabelle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/annabelle>, awarding it a Metascore 
<http://www.metacritic.com/about-metascores> of just 37/100, but audiences 
flocked to this spinoff of The Conjuring. The haunted-doll movie delivered a 
healthy debut of £1.94m, landing in third place. That’s not so very far behind 
the opening of The Conjuring (£2.16m) back in August 2013.

So far, 2014 has been a relatively poor year for the horror genre, 
commercially, with no fresh offerings in the Paranormal Activity and Insidious 
franchises. Prior toAnnabelle <https://www.theguardian.com/film/annabelle>, the 
biggest horror opening this year had come from The Purge: Anarchy, with £1.17m. 
Many titles, including Oculus, The Quiet Ones and Deliver Us from Evil, 
delivered lacklustre box office.

Partners New Line and Warners will be particularly encouraged that Annabelle 
didn’t need much creative connection to the earlier Conjuring to deliver an 
audience. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, who play paranormal investigators Ed 
and Lorraine Warren in the latter, do not appear in Annabelle, and the writing 
and directing credits are different for the two films. Peter Safran is the lead 
producer on both titles. The box-office runes look propitious for further 
spinoffs linked to the Warrens, and especially forThe Conjuring 2 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3065204/>, due next Halloween.

 One Direction: playing to a DVD sales strategy. Photograph: Powers 
Imagery/Invision/AP 
Despite not in fact being a live event, One Direction: Where We Are – The 
Concert Film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/12/one-direction-where-we-are-the-concert-film-review-harry-styles>
 was presented to audiences as a piece of event cinema, playing on Saturday and 
Sunday only. It was a different strategy to the one used for last year’s One 
Direction: This Is Us, which enjoyed a full cinema release, staying in the top 
10 for four weeks.

Where We Are grossed £1.02m across the two days, which compares with £3.47m 
for the opening of This Is Us. However, that figure represented grosses from 
four days, including Thursday previews. Where We Are was filmed earlier this 
year at Milan’s San Siro stadium, and also included 15 minutes of interviews 
and backstage footage. By presenting as a live event rather than a film, Where 
We Are can play in multiplexes and still hit DVD shelves within thestandard 
16-week theatrical window 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_distribution#Standard_release>, for 
inclusion in Christmas stockings. The DVD release date is 1 December.

Landing just outside the top 10, the New York Met Opera’s presentation of 
Verdi’s Macbeth grossed a solid £206,000 from 174 UK venues, virtually all of 
it on Saturday.

 Hugh Grant: ‘I can barely get to the end of a tweet without getting bored now’

Arriving in ninth place, Hugh Grant’s latest comedy The Rewrite opened 
disappointingly with £257,000 plus £68,000 in previews. This compares with a 
debut of £1.16m for Did You Hear About the Morgans?, his last team-up with 
writer-director Marc Lawrence. Before that, the pair’s Music and Lyrics began 
with £2.36m. Grant has been a leading romcom star for 20 years, since 1994’s

to take a more enticing vehicle than The Rewrite to renew his pact with

During the London Film Festival (LFF), early October becomes potentially a 
quiet time for arthouse fare: participating titles must wait until after their 
festival bow before their full UK release. In the case of’71 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/71>, starring Jack O’Connell, a premiere on 
day two of the festival last Thursday permitted a cinema release the next day, 
effectively exploiting the LFF buzz. The Belfast-set army thriller debuted with 
a soft £205,000 from 123 screens, which compares with an opening salvo of 
£495,000 (including £17,000 previews) from 316 screens for O’Connell’s last 
film Starred Up. Screen averages are in a similar ballpark (£1,668 for ’71, 
£1,567 for Starred Up), but you would expect a higher average for the title 
benefiting from the more focused release. In fact, distributor StudioCanal 
would have been able to target those cinemas where Starred Up worked best.

Period drama Effie Gray <https://www.theguardian.com/film/effie-gray>, from a 
script by Emma Thompson, landed weakly in 17th place. The film grossed £67,000 
from 97 screens, yielding a £694 average. Effie Gray is not playing at the
London film festival <https://www.theguardian.com/film/londonfilmfestival>.

 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: expectations of hero box office. Photograph: 
Paramount/Courtesy Everett /RE 
Thanks to a strong hold for Gone Girl and the arrival of The Maze Runner and 
Annabelle, box-office overall is 4% up on the previous frame, and a whopping 
103% up on the equivalent weekend from a year ago, when holdover titles 
Prisoners and Sunshine on Leith led the weakest week for UK box-office of the 
whole year, and the Julian Assange biopic The Fifth Estate was the top new 
release. So far, October box-office is running far ahead of 2013 levels, which 
is welcome news for cinemas, since the pace has lagged for the year overall. 
Arriving on Friday,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles> should add some 
fresh zip, especially since the film already performed nicely in previews over 
the weekend. The Best of Me is the latest Nicholas Sparks adaptation, whileThe 
Judge <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-judge> (which opened the Toronto 
film festival) stars Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duvall.Northern Soul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/northern-soul>, set against the titular 
Northern English 70s soul scene, has achieved significant bookings for a film 
that, for reasons of DVD release strategy, isn’t eligible to play in Odeon, 
Cineworld or Vue cinemas.
