Elizabeth Banks, also for Mockingjay, and David Oyelowo’s powerful performance

The night was hosted by comedian Amy Schumer, who will be making her big 
screen debut this summer in Judd Apatow’s new comedy Trainwreck. Her routine 
included risqué skits centred around Selma and Fifty Shades of Grey. “Half of

said to the audience at one point.
