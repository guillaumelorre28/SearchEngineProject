Best greengrocer I love Andreas Michli's. He gets seasonal vegetables and 
fruit imported from Cyprus or from his own organic farm in Hertfordshire. This 
shop is a must for any food lover.
· Michli and Sons, 33 Salisbury Road [off Green Lanes], London N4 1JY (020 
8802 0188)

 Best butcher Lidgate, because every animal is from a quality breed with a 
traceable provenance.
· C. Lidgate, 110 Holland Park Avenue, London W11 4UA (020 7727 8243) 

 Best fishmonger For its fresh fish (and game) and velvet-tongued staff, it 
has to be Steve Hatt.
· Steve Hatt, 88-90 Essex Road, Islington N1 8LU (020 7226 3963) 

 Best deli I've never seen so many good Spanish ingredients in one place as 
Brindisa - wonderful cheeses, nuts, turron, peppers and charcuteria including 
the amazing acorn-fed black foot cured ham. Heaven for any hispanophile.
· The Brindisa Shop, 32 Exmouth Market, London EC1R 4QE (020 7 713 1666) 

 Best cheese Jones' Dairy is great for aged Goudas. Go on a Sunday when the 
flower market is on.
· Jones' Dairy, Ezra St, London E2 (020 7739 5372) 8am-1pm, Fri-Sat, 9am-2pm, 
Sun

 Best patisserie I love the Portuguese custard tarts at Lisboa Patisserie; on 
the other hand you can't get better than Konditor's chocolate and carrot cakes.
· Lisboa Patisserie, 57 Golborne Road, London W10 5NR (020 8968 5242) 
· Konditor & Cook, 22 Cornwall Road, London SE1 8TW (020 7261 0456) 

 Best chocolate Green & Black's organic chocolate and Duchy Originals Ginger 
thins.

 Best ethnic I love to cook Asian at home and in this Bengali shop you can 
choose between Alfonso mangoes, Bengali potatoes and yard-long beans as well as 
a large range of spices.
· Supersave, 228 Bethnal Green Road, London E2 0AA (020 7739 2314) 

 Best herbs and spices Generous bunches of herbs as well as any spice; from 
the usual suspects to the more exotic anise, mastic, salep, dried limes and 
rose petals.
· Turkish Food Centre, 89 Ridley Road, London E8 2NP (020 7254 6754) 

 Best cookware A good independent shop. 
· Richard Dare Cookshop, 93 Regents Park Road, London NW1 8UR (020 7722 9428) 

 Best local restaurant Kingsland Road is home to great Vietnamese cafés. This 
one is my favourite for broths with rice noodles.
· Loong Kee Café,134G Kingsland Road, London E2 8DY (0207 729 8344) 

 Best cheap eats Delicious vegetable curries and mango lassis. 
· New Tayyab, 89 Fieldgate Street, London E1 1JU (020 7247 9543) 

 Best greasy spoon Art deco interior, buzzy atmosphere and good Italian café 
cooking.
· E. Pellici, 332 Bethnal Green Road, London E2 OAG (020 7739 4873) 

 Melanie C 
 Pop singer

 Best local restaurant I spend Sundays with my friends in Lemonia in North 
London. When I'm back in Liverpool, I go to Simply Heathcotes for a special 
family occasion.
· Lemonia 89 Regent's Park Road, London NW1 (020 7586 7454) 
· Simply Heathcotes, Beetham Plaza, 25 The Strand, Liverpool L2 0XL (0151 236 
3536)

 Best organic I love Fresh and Wild. I remember when I was on the dole and 
having to pick the almost-out-of-date food in the supermarkets. So to me, 
buying organic food at Fresh and Wild is a really wonderful indulgence.
· Fresh and Wild, 69-75 Brewer Street, London W1R 3FL (020 7434 3179) 

 Terence Conran 
 Restaurateur

 Best bakery Konditor & Cook sells great cakes. For my 70th birthday, my 
sister got me a spectacul-ar cake surrounded by small-er ones, each 
representing one of my favourite things a lobster, a cigar, a rose...
· Konditor & Cook, 22 Cornwall Road, London SE1 (020 7261 0456) 

Best restaurant abroad On the old Paris to Marseille autoroute, between Lyon 
and Mcon, is the village of Fleurie where you will find a restaurant of such 
excellence that I salivate at the mere thought of it.
· L'Auberge du Cep, Place de l'Eglise, Fleurie-en-Beaujolais, France (00 33 4 
74 041 077)

Alain De Botton 
 Writer

 Best restaurant for writers The Havelock in is my local but it serves the 
kind of food that I'd be prepared to drive two hours in order to eat. Not only 
is the food good, the people look interesting - beautiful girls and 
depressed-looking writer types.
· The Havelock Tavern, 57 Masbro Road, London W14 0LS (020 7603 5374) 

 Sally Clarke 
 Chef and owner, Clarke's

 Best coffee I hate all the coffee chains - the coffee is disgusting. At 
Monmouth Coffee, in London's Borough Market, it's the real thing and they give 
you samples to taste.
· Borough Market, 8 Southwark Street, London SE1 1TL (020 7403 6932) 
· Monmouth Coffee House, 27 Monmouth Street, London WC2 (020 7379 3516) 

 Best abroad There are two great shops in Megève. One has fantastic cheeses 
that you cannot get here, and the other sells the most amazing cakes.
· Laiterie Gaiddon, 79, rue Ambroise Martin, Quartier des 5 rues, Megève 
France (0033 450212231)
· Refuge du Boulanger, Remy Coste, 22, rue de la Petite Taverne, Megève, 
France (0033 450913051)

Anthony Bourdain 
 Writer and chef

 Best knives I like the Vanadium steel Global knives. They're hard enough to 
keep an edge and soft enough to sharpen easily - and they look really sexy.
· Global knives at Selfridges, Oxford Street, London W1 (0870 8377377) 

 Best UK restaurant My favourite is St John. But the best? Come on - you have 
to ask? Gordon Ramsay, of course!
· St John, 26, St John Street, London EC1M 4AY, (020 7251 0848) 
· Gordon Ramsay, 68-69 Royal Hospital Road, London SW3 4HP (020 7352 4441)
