A last word on love

benist <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15213914> asks

Is there such a thing as selfless love, where one does something entirely for 
the benefit of someone else?

A lot of parental love is like this: we don't expect our kids to ask how our 
days are, or to worry that we might be needing a nap. As a parent, we give love 
rather than expect it, it is the most selfless of all daily kinds of love. In 
my view, we should learn some lessons from the way we love children and apply 
them to the love of adults too; ie. a focus on giving love, and on interpreting 
the troubles that others give us in benevolent ways (ie. they haven't slept 
very well rather than 'they are evil...')

Do you see any positive signs of change in the UK housing market since you 
made your Perfect Home series?
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16160742> Guardian contributor 
ADeBotton  <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16160742> 27 April 2016 
2:00pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/73179932> 
Not focusing on the price of houses directly, there are some real signs that 
architectural quality has improved a lot. Much has to do with the moves of the 
last Labour government, that put the quality of housing delivery at the heart 
of its agenda (some of this has been scrapped, but not all of it, fortunately). 
But an ordinary housing block going up now in London or Inverness has a better 
chance of following best practice than it did 10 years ago. As with food, we in 
Britain are very slowly catching up with ideas that have been common in Holland 
or Germany for a while.

How did your father’s work ethic inform the writing of this book? (I was 
privileged to work closely for him for 18 months – he had astonishing focus and 
discipline.)

Small world! I've grown up with a very strong work ethic, which in me is 
really animated by a sense of just how short our time on this spinning planet 
really is. So I'm constantly guided by a guilty sense that there is a lot to do 
and very little time left to do it. At best, I can put out another 8 books or 
so. That's a scary prospect in terms of choosing what might be the best topics 
and how not to mess them up too badly.

I would say that we are a mixture of Greek and Judeo-Christian ideas. The 
latter have just as much of an influence of the former. Our idea of human 
rights, of equality, of democracy are as much Christian as they are Greek.

Lately you have been very down on love: in the otherwise excellent TSOL videos 
for example. I loved your Essays in Love and I can’t wait for the sequel, but 
do tell me, are you still in love with your wife, or is all that doom and gloom 
stuff because you fell out of love but are clinging on for the sake of 
remembrance of temps perdu In which case, are you free for dinner next week?

I should say that the films on Youtube are not the ongoing story of my life 
and my marriage. They are heartfelt perspectives, but arise from a number of 
sources. There is a very understandable temptation to connect up what a writer 
discusses - say - in a novel with the events in their life, but the awkward 
truth is that it's immensely fun and liberating to invent perspectives on 
problems one hasn't necessarily directly experienced. All this to say - thank 
you so much for dinner, but not this time around.

Hi Alain, what is your view about ethics and education for young people? If 
young people were introduced to ethics as part of the national curriculum and 
how different moral choices/problems that we might end up growing a population 
of more moral, responsible adults who would be more likely to take 
custodianship over issues such as the environment, poverty and inequality?

The tricky thing is HOW such an education would work. I recently was reading 
David Hume who was very against delivering lectures on ethics to young people. 
He cheerfully explained why: they won't listen, they'll find it boring. So for 
Hume - and he was right I think - what those with ethical ambitions need to do 
is find ways to make 'the good' not just true but convincing and - to use a 
doubtful word - charming. Hume believed that popular history and plays could 
help to reform character far more than dry lectures in philosophy. In short, 
any ambition to reform the young always has to start with the true enemy one is 
facing: boredom, disengagement, and the unbelievable charms of twitter. These 
are the things that any educator has to overcome in a quest to reform the world.

Is a sense of purpose necessary for a fulfilled life? If so, how should you 
navigate the consequent feelings of failure and shame if you can’t find out 
what yours is? The overwhelming pressure to find one makes all options seem 
inauthentic.

It is immensely hard to find a sense of purpose, but if you are feeling very 
actively that you haven't found it, that you are on the wrong track, these are 
signals that imply - like a negative implies a positive - that somewhere within 
you you do have a sense of what might be meaningful for you. A feeling that 
things are inauthentic wouldn't be possible without an underlying (even if 
still veiled) belief in authentic possibilities. It's important not to panic or 
despair because the answer hasn't manifested itself yet. It may well take a 
decade or two till one can start to know oneself well enough to realise what 
might bring purpose to life. In the meantime, sympathy for the scale of the 
challenge one's facing is important - that and an accurate sense that one is 
far from alone (even though society constantly presents us with examples of 
people who seem to know exactly what is what; people who in fact constitute a 
painfully small majority, who nevertheless make it to the front pages of 
websites too often for our mental well-being.

The refugee crisis

hvadaltsaa <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12514915> asks

How do think we will look back on the current refugee crisis? With pride, 
guilt or shame? Do you think that we as a species will ever learn from our 
history and stop fighting wars?
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16160742> Guardian contributor

The origins of the refugee crises will, I think, be what particularly concerns 
historians. The roots have to do in the catastrophic approach of the Western 
powers to the politics of the Middle East. Don't forget that Syria was a client 
state of France for many years, it's ancient tribal structures were destroyed 
and the current regime - responsible for the war in key ways - is the fruit of 
an entirely dysfunctional state, which took years to get into the shape it was 
in when the conflict broke out. In short, we are still - as a species - 
learning some basic principles of good statecraft: that intervention in the 
affairs of other nations causes problems that can last centuries, that human 
rights have to be respected, that economic liberty needs to go hand in hand 
with political liberty, that women's rights must be respected etc... The 
refugees we are seeing in the stations of Germany and the camps of France are 
the last link in an appalling sequence of mistakes that goes back to the mid 
19th century. None of this is an argument for passivity. Simply that good 
governance is at the heart of the crisis and something humanity is still only 
just learning about.

Alain, I have two questions: 
1. how long did it take you to write The Course of Love?
2. in what ways did The School of Life / The Book of Life affect your novel?

1. It took 3 years.
2. The School of Life provided a forum in which I could test some of the 
ideas, by presenting them to small audiences - and also, learn from the many 
people who come through our doors. We run a psychotherapy service and our 
resident therapist was extremely helpful to me in discussing some of the 
problems of couples. So all in all, it's very good to go into an office rather 
than spend all day alone in a room...

Given that, with a long enough timeline, all life is ultimately futile, and 
sooner or later humanity will cease to exist, am I justified in calling in sick 
for the week and instead just watching movies in bed and drinking cheap wine?

The lack of 'meaning' as humans can conceive it when we look at our lives on a 
cosmic perspective should not be an invitation to do nothing. However nice beds 
and cheap wine are, knowing that our lives are short and our efforts fragile 
could as well be a goad to action - especially around helping others - as to 
indolence. That shouldn't sound hectoring or ungenerous. Most of all, I wish 
you a nice break.

Do you think we’ll ever live in a post-religious age – where the majority of 
the people on the planet are educated atheists and church and state are 
completely separated from each other? Do you find it desirable?

Do you think the UK is as suspicious of intellectuals as the US, and is this a 
trend that will increase in this internet age of information overload and 
knowledge deficit?

Should philosophy be taught from the age of 11 in state schools and what role 
if any does/could philosophy play in averting teenage depression?

Yes, we will - I think - eventually reach a post-religious age. In many ways, 
in Western Europe, we are already here. This would be very desirable in my 
view; of course, there are better and worse ways of secularising. For me, the 
best way is to remember all the emotional needs that we once turned to religion 
with - and to try to find alternatives in the secular world. No longer 
believing generally isn't the end of some of the feelings that took people to 
belief.

Suspicion of intellects has many sources, not least, that many intellectuals 
have made enormous mistakes, especially around politics (think of the very 
misguided ideas of Sartre, or of Heidegger or other big mid 20th century 
names). That said, allowing a variety of voices onto the airwaves seems a way 
to achieve genuine plurality.

As for teaching philosophy, a lot depends on how it is done. There are ways of 
teaching it - historically, unimaginatively - that are far worse than not 
teaching it at all (at least then it retains an aura). My recommendation would 
be that we'd teach young people about relationships via the ideas of 
psychotherapy; this seems to offer a more direct route to solving some of the 
big issues that crop up in teenage years.

I’m writing this from my office, where I feel under extreme pressure to get 
things done. I’m also working a freelance job simultaneously, and so am 
currently all about making money. Basically, I’m making good tracks 
career-wise. I’m ‘doing OK’, I’m saving money to one day have a house and am 
doing a good job. But I don’t know if this is what I want to be doing. I try 
and imbue it with as much meaning as pos, but it doesn’t really work. Surely 
it’s too late to start again and spend all my hard-earned money on re-studying. 
Three more years of poverty just to start from scratch again.

What should I do? How can I be happy and find meaning in my work? ... Are the 
School of Life looking for a good communications person?

I'm sorry about the challenges of day to day life: yes, we do need a good 
communication person... But I would just ask what it is about further study 
that you're hoping will move you out of the current situation. In general, when 
people consider a job move, the risk is a faulty analysis of the current 
dissatisfaction, a flawed analysis of what one's true talents and interests are 
- and a misreading of the job market. All these are hugely tricky issues - 
which is why i'm a firm believer that one should spend a h ugely long time 
unpicking the dilemma, possibly with the help of a mentor - and only very 
slowly judge whether a big move is necessary. The tragedy of most job searches 
is that they proceed under the pressure of immediate feelings of instincts, 
which turn out not accurately to reflect the aptitudes of the people involved. 
In short, take it slowly and think a lot...

PS: I would add that there are many ways in which a greater deal of meaning 
can be found in existing jobs, without the need to throw everything in. At the 
School of Life, we're keen on what we call 'branching' moves, which involve a 
little shift to the right or to the left. These undramatic moves - which may 
involve a conversation with a colleague or boss about slightly changing how 
things are done - may hold a remarkably important part of the solution to a 
situation of dissatisfaction. We're often fatefully in love with the dramatic 
move.

A lot of parental love is like this: we don't expect our kids to ask how our 
days are, or to worry that we might be needing a nap. As a parent, we give love 
rather than expect it, it is the most selfless of all daily kinds of love. In 
my view, we should learn some lessons from the way we love children and apply 
them to the love of adults too; ie. a focus on giving love, and on interpreting 
the troubles that others give us in benevolent ways (ie. they haven't slept 
very well rather than 'they are evil...')

Not focusing on the price of houses directly, there are some real signs that 
architectural quality has improved a lot. Much has to do with the moves of the 
last Labour government, that put the quality of housing delivery at the heart 
of its agenda (some of this has been scrapped, but not all of it, fortunately). 
But an ordinary housing block going up now in London or Inverness has a better 
chance of following best practice than it did 10 years ago. As with food, we in 
Britain are very slowly catching up with ideas that have been common in Holland 
or Germany for a while.

Small world! I've grown up with a very strong work ethic, which in me is 
really animated by a sense of just how short our time on this spinning planet 
really is. So I'm constantly guided by a guilty sense that there is a lot to do 
and very little time left to do it. At best, I can put out another 8 books or 
so. That's a scary prospect in terms of choosing what might be the best topics 
and how not to mess them up too badly.

I would say that we are a mixture of Greek and Judeo-Christian ideas. The 
latter have just as much of an influence of the former. Our idea of human 
rights, of equality, of democracy are as much Christian as they are Greek.

I should say that the films on Youtube are not the ongoing story of my life 
and my marriage. They are heartfelt perspectives, but arise from a number of 
sources. There is a very understandable temptation to connect up what a writer 
discusses - say - in a novel with the events in their life, but the awkward 
truth is that it's immensely fun and liberating to invent perspectives on 
problems one hasn't necessarily directly experienced. All this to say - thank 
you so much for dinner, but not this time around.

Hi Alain, what is your view about ethics and education for young people? If 
young people were introduced to ethics as part of the national curriculum and 
how different moral choices/problems that we might end up growing a population 
of more moral, responsible adults who would be more likely to take 
custodianship over issues such as the environment, poverty and inequality?

The tricky thing is HOW such an education would work. I recently was reading 
David Hume who was very against delivering lectures on ethics to young people. 
He cheerfully explained why: they won't listen, they'll find it boring. So for 
Hume - and he was right I think - what those with ethical ambitions need to do 
is find ways to make 'the good' not just true but convincing and - to use a 
doubtful word - charming. Hume believed that popular history and plays could 
help to reform character far more than dry lectures in philosophy. In short, 
any ambition to reform the young always has to start with the true enemy one is 
facing: boredom, disengagement, and the unbelievable charms of twitter. These 
are the things that any educator has to overcome in a quest to reform the world.

Is a sense of purpose necessary for a fulfilled life? If so, how should you 
navigate the consequent feelings of failure and shame if you can’t find out

It is immensely hard to find a sense of purpose, but if you are feeling very 
actively that you haven't found it, that you are on the wrong track, these are 
signals that imply - like a negative implies a positive - that somewhere within 
you you do have a sense of what might be meaningful for you. A feeling that 
things are inauthentic wouldn't be possible without an underlying (even if 
still veiled) belief in authentic possibilities. It's important not to panic or 
despair because the answer hasn't manifested itself yet. It may well take a 
decade or two till one can start to know oneself well enough to realise what 
might bring purpose to life. In the meantime, sympathy for the scale of the 
challenge one's facing is important - that and an accurate sense that one is 
far from alone (even though society constantly presents us with examples of 
people who seem to know exactly what is what; people who in fact constitute a 
painfully small majority, who nevertheless make it to the front pages of 
websites too often for our mental well-being.

How do think we will look back on the current refugee crisis? With pride, 
guilt or shame? Do you think that we as a species will ever learn from our 
history and stop fighting wars?

1:49pm <https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/73179011> 
The origins of the refugee crises will, I think, be what particularly concerns 
historians. The roots have to do in the catastrophic approach of the Western 
powers to the politics of the Middle East. Don't forget that Syria was a client 
state of France for many years, it's ancient tribal structures were destroyed 
and the current regime - responsible for the war in key ways - is the fruit of 
an entirely dysfunctional state, which took years to get into the shape it was 
in when the conflict broke out. In short, we are still - as a species - 
learning some basic principles of good statecraft: that intervention in the 
affairs of other nations causes problems that can last centuries, that human 
rights have to be respected, that economic liberty needs to go hand in hand 
with political liberty, that women's rights must be respected etc... The 
refugees we are seeing in the stations of Germany and the camps of France are 
the last link in an appalling sequence of mistakes that goes back to the mid 
19th century. None of this is an argument for passivity. Simply that good 
governance is at the heart of the crisis and something humanity is still only 
just learning about.

1. It took 3 years.
2. The School of Life provided a forum in which I could test some of the 
ideas, by presenting them to small audiences - and also, learn from the many 
people who come through our doors. We run a psychotherapy service and our 
resident therapist was extremely helpful to me in discussing some of the

The lack of 'meaning' as humans can conceive it when we look at our lives on a 
cosmic perspective should not be an invitation to do nothing. However nice beds 
and cheap wine are, knowing that our lives are short and our efforts fragile 
could as well be a goad to action - especially around helping others - as to 
indolence. That shouldn't sound hectoring or ungenerous. Most of all, I wish

I’m writing this from my office, where I feel under extreme pressure to get 
things done. I’m also working a freelance job simultaneously, and so am 
currently all about making money. Basically, I’m making good tracks 
career-wise. I’m ‘doing OK’, I’m saving money to one day have a house and am 
doing a good job. But I don’t know if this is what I want to be doing. I try 
and imbue it with as much meaning as pos, but it doesn’t really work. Surely 
it’s too late to start again and spend all my hard-earned money on re-studying. 
Three more years of poverty just to start from scratch again.

What should I do? How can I be happy and find meaning in my work? ... Are the 
School of Life looking for a good communications person?

I'm sorry about the challenges of day to day life: yes, we do need a good 
communication person... But I would just ask what it is about further study 
that you're hoping will move you out of the current situation. In general, when 
people consider a job move, the risk is a faulty analysis of the current 
dissatisfaction, a flawed analysis of what one's true talents and interests are 
- and a misreading of the job market. All these are hugely tricky issues - 
which is why i'm a firm believer that one should spend a h ugely long time 
unpicking the dilemma, possibly with the help of a mentor - and only very 
slowly judge whether a big move is necessary. The tragedy of most job searches 
is that they proceed under the pressure of immediate feelings of instincts, 
which turn out not accurately to reflect the aptitudes of the people involved. 
In short, take it slowly and think a lot...

PS: I would add that there are many ways in which a greater deal of meaning 
can be found in existing jobs, without the need to throw everything in. At the 
School of Life, we're keen on what we call 'branching' moves, which involve a 
little shift to the right or to the left. These undramatic moves - which may 
involve a conversation with a colleague or boss about slightly changing how 
things are done - may hold a remarkably important part of the solution to a 
situation of dissatisfaction. We're often fatefully in love with the dramatic 
move.
