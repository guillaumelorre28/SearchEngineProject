Christopher Samba is on the verge of rejoining Anzhi Makhachkala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anzhi-makhachkala> for £12m.

The 29-year-old was signed by Queens Park Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/31/qpr-christopher-samba-peter-odemwingie>
 from the Russian club for a similar fee in January as they looked to beat the 
drop from the Premier League.

It is a surprise about-turn by the defender, who said he was happy with his 
family in London.

"All the money in the world cannot make you happy if you don't have your 
family with you," Samba said.

"I came back to be with my family. Life needs to have both sides – enjoy your 
football and have your loved ones close to you. I have no plans to go back to 
Russia."

The former Blackburn centre-back was one of the west London club's key targets 
in January asHarry Redknapp 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/harry-redknapp> looked to shore up his 
defence.

Samba failed to live up to his billing and was unimpressive for the Rs, 
notably in a woeful performance against their rivals Fulham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/01/fulham-qpr-premier-league-match-report>
 in April.

The Congolese defender handed the Cottagers the opening two goals in what 
ended up as a 3–2 defeat, all but ending their hopes of staving off relegation.

Samba did himself few favours afterwards by hitting out at those questioning 
his value and not many fans in W12 will be sad to see the back of him.

Other high earners such as Djibril Cissé, Jay Bothroyd and DJ Campbell have 
all left this summer as the Rs begin to cut their cloth ahead of life in the 
Championship.
