So let the post-mortems begin! We’ve learned four-fifths of nothing at all 
from today’s subdued affair. I think it’s been a bit of a trial for the England 
players really – glum faces all round despite the win.

England win by nine wickets

Bell skips down the track and dinks away a single to confirm the win. He ends 
52 not out. That’s that then. The victors depart the tournament wondering 
exactly where they go from here. The losers depart the tournament wondering if 
they’ll ever be back.

17th over: England 97-1 (Taylor 6, Bell 50) Shapoor Zadran comes in for one 
last blast and Ian Bell goes to within a single of his half century with a late 
cut that zips yards over the head of the man at slip and down to third man 
boundary. A dab off the next brings the 50 off 53 balls and you won’t see many 
more underwhelmed ‘celebrations’ than the one he puts in. A quick lift of the 
bat and a scowl is all you’re getting, and fair enough really.

16th over: England 91-1 (Taylor 5, Bell 46) A couple of singles are squeezed 
off Hassan, who then sends down a leg-side wide when in search of a yorker. 
Figures of 5-0-18-1 are nothing to be ashamed of, though. England need just 10 
more.

15th over: England 87-1 (Taylor 3, Bell 45) Nabi continues to tease and test 
the batsmen with what Nasser Hussain describes as “good old-fashioned 
off-spin”. He and Hassan have certainly been the pick of the bowlers – just 
three from the over.

14th over: England 84-1 (Taylor 1, Bell 44) So what has been, in cricket 
parlance, a Pretty Ordinary tournament for Alex Hales ends in frustrating 
fashion.

WICKET! Hales c Zazai b Hassan 37 (England 83-1)

Just 23 more runs needed for England. Hassan returns and again there’s 
fielding hesitancy on the midwicket boundary, with two fielders leaving the 
ball to each other and almost allowing it to trundle over the rope. So Hassan 
balls up his rage and sends down a cracker that does for Hales! It’s a beauty, 
just holding its line outside off and forcing a nervous poke from the England 
opener, who can only feather an edge through to the keeper.

13th over: England 78-0 (Hales 35, Bell 41) Nabi finds the Hales edge but 
there’s no slip and the ball whistles away for a couple to third man. The 
Afghanistan captain again finds some useful turn – four from the over.

12th over: England 74-0 (Hales 32, Bell 40) Bell punches a Shenwari full toss 
out to wide long on … and Hassan fumbles the ball pretty miserably over the 
rope. Ugly stuff. Hales requires not help a couple of balls later, though – a 
huge slog-sweep disappears into the stands at square leg.

10th over: England 59-0 (Hales 23, Bell 34) Sami Shenwari enters the fray. 
He’s too short and Bell pulls hard out to the boundary, where Shafiq fumbles 
the ball over the rope. From the next, he turns one onto Bell’s pads and 
there’s a big appeal but the umpire decides it’s just sliding down leg. Hawkeye 
shows the ball clipping leg, but it would’ve been umpire’s call on any review.

9th over: England 52-0 (Hales 23, Bell 27) Spin now from Mohammad Nabi. Bell 
works him to leg for a couple then they scurry through for a quick single that 
brings up the England 50. Nabi finds some decent turn, but nudging and nurdling 
adds to more singles to the tally.

8th over: England 47-0 (Hales 22, Bell 25) Hassan once more. A pretty hideous 
misfield at mid off turns a single into a double for Bell – Afghanistan’s 
fielding has been the weakest facet of their game in this tournament – but 
again the bowler keeps it very tight. Just three from the over.

7th over: England 44-0 (Hales 22, Bell 22) Dawlat Zadran returns but continues 
where he left off in the second over – too short and being slammed through the 
leg side by Hales. He bangs an angry ball in in response and finds the top 
edge, but the ball whistles away to the boundary once more, this time over the 
keeper’s head. There’s an lbw appeal from the last, but there was a fairly 
sizeable inside edge.

6th over: England 36-0 (Hales 14, Bell 22) If this is to be Ian Bell’s final 
ODI for England, he’s keen to go out in style. A couple of his shots so far 
have been vintage Sledgehammer of Eternal Justice. He’s quieter here, though, 
tied down by the impressive Hassan. Just four from the over.

“Can you explain why, when Afghanistan’s total came at a run rate of 3.08 runs 
an over, we’ve been given a total that requires a rate of 4.04 runs an over?” 
writes Peter Spink. “I’m an Englishman following this in Kabul and I have to 
confess, I want Afghanistan to win. They deserved to beat Sri Lanka, so they 
really should beat our shower. The only thing if Afghanistan wins though is the 
risk of celebratory gunfire - quite a number of people were injured after the 
victory against Scotland. I imagine there’d be rather more gunfire if they beat 
England.”

It’s your D/L method, innit

5th over: England 32-0 (Hales 13, Bell 19) A ferocious cut from Hales brings 
him four more off Shapoor Zadran. But next up he’s dropped again! And again 
it’s the man at backward point. Almost a carbon copy – this one was perhaps a 
touch easier – but Najib Zadran makes a mess of it once more.

4th over: England 25-0 (Hales 8, Bell 17) Hamid Hassan, who has arrived 
dressed as one of Arnie’s buddies in Predator, replaces Dawlat Zadaran. And, 
though he’s not hunting an invisible game-hunting alien, he still shows some 
hostility and firepower. Just one from a very useful over.

3rd over: England 24-0 (Hales 8, Bell 16) A third narrow escape for the 
opening pair, as Bell just gets enough on a drive to plonk it over extra cover. 
He’s got hold of this one, though – a glorious thunk over cover again, this 
time struck sweetly for four. Both batsmen are showing a bit of intent, at 
least.

for six. Fine shot, though not a great ball. He then skews awkwardly into the 
infield for a single and Bell follows it up with another boundary thwacked 
through the leg side.

Here’s a date for the diaries – 17 September at the Kia Oval sees Strauss Help 
for Heroes XI (coached by Botham) vs. a Rest of the World XI coached by Kirsten 
with a captain TBC. Preceded by a disability T20 between a Help for Heroes XI 
vs. a top flight disabled XI. Tickets go on sale today.More details here.

1st over: England 5-0 (Hales 1, Bell 4) So England set off in search of 101 
runs from 25 overs. Shapoor Zadran takes the new ball. Hales leaves alone 
outside off, then blocks off the back foot. And from the third ball he’s 
dropped! Hales thick-edges a straight drive to backward point, where the diving 
Najib Zadran can’t cling on. And he probably should’ve done really, though it 
wasn’t a dolly by any means. Bell crashes the last over the covers for four.

And here’s Neil Keenan: “In reply to Stu Cherry, as an Irishman enjoying our 
seat at the head of European cricket, I’ve already been laughing at England for 
some time. Some of that cricket has been farcical and by some, I mean all. But 
after three thrilling wins, it’d be just our luck to be rained off on Sunday 
morning. Am I right in saying that would give us the 1 point needed to qualify? 
How’s the forecast looking in Adelaide?”

Yep, a washout would take Ireland through to the quarter-finals. The weather 
forecast, though, is for sun, sun and more sun.

Here’s Robin Hazlehurst: “I was pondering the same thing as Stu Cherry, and 
while it would be much funnier for England to be eliminated by rain after 
beating Bangladesh, it would also be more tragic, as it would let the ECB 
simply say ‘well we would have qualified (and gone on to win the thing) if only 
it hadn’t been for the rain...’. At least the rain here is denying them the 
chance to say ‘but we still won two games’.”

The rain has stopped at the SCG. And there’ll be a pitch inspection it about 
2o minutes. Given the time lost it looks like it would be a 20-over (ish) run 
chase for England if they can get back out there.

“Good work on the drip-by-drip coverage,” writes Stu Cherry. “As our resident 
Aussie isn’t in the office yet, I have a question for non-England fans out 
there. Which would have been funnier: England losing to Bangladesh and not 
qualifying or England beating Bangladesh and then not qualifying because this 
game was rained off with England in a likely winning position?”

New Zealand win by three wickets! A couple of Tim Southee boundaries get the 
hosts home with seven balls to spare. So we have our first confirmed 
quarter-final tie lined up: it’ll be India v Bangladesh at the MCG next 
Thursday.

Corey Anderson swipes a huge, HUGE, six into the stands at cow corner, where a 
punter takes a nonchalant one-handed catch. Next ball, Anderson tries again but 
gets himself clean bowled. Three wickets left, 20 needed off 16.

In an alternate universe where England had beaten Bangladesh, this would be 
one of the tensest couple of hours of the tournament so far, with England 
desperate for the rain to stop and for New Zealand to finish the job against 
Bangladesh. Instead, well, the only thing up for grabs is third place in the 
table.

In Hamilton Ross Taylor has just unveiled a radical new DRS technique – he’s 
just reviewed an lbw decision but trudged off the field while waiting for the 
technology to do its work. The replay shows he’s plumb, but he knew that 
anyway. Strange. Anyway, New Zealand are 223-5 chasing 289. They’ve got 48 
balls remaining and 66 runs to gather.

The rain has eased in Sydney so the umpires are going to don their waders and 
have a look in about 20 minutes or so. But it’s still a bit dark over Bill’s

The rain has eased in Sydney but we're awaiting inspection from the umpires:

If you missed the team news earlier, England have brought in Ravi Bopara and 
James Tredwell for Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes. Both have been tidy: RavBop has 
figures of 8-1-31-2 and Tredwell 7-0-25-1.

The rain very briefly paused over in Sydney … but it’s coming down again now. 
This is certainly the end of the Afghanistan innings. Setting the England 
target will be a job for the calculators from this point.

With the likelihood that there will be no play for a while (no further updates 
on that front, but here’s a vaguely semi-helpful and only very mildly 
encouragingweather radar <http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR714.loop.shtml#skip>
), and the possibility that Afghanistan’s innings is at an end, I’m going to 
toss the baton to John Ashdown, who will lead you through what remains of 
England’s World Cup campaign. All emails tojohn.ashdown@theguardian.com 
<mailto:john.ashdown@theguardian.com> henceforth and from now on, and

That may be the last we see of Afghanistan’s batsmen at this World Cup. With 
10 runs already lost from the match, anything more than the briefest of showers 
will finish their innings.

More rain!

36.2 overs: Afghanistan 111-7 (Zadran 12, Hassan 0)

Jordan returns, and Zadran thrashes his first delivery back over his head for 
four, the ball landing six inches from the rope. The next delivery is banged in 
short, which Zadran fends off. And then the umpires think it’s a little too 
rainy, and head back to their changing room to towel themselves down.

36th over: Afghanistan 107-7 (Zadran 8, Hassan 0)

Before Broad starts his over the umpires have a little look at the sky (still 
grey), amid reports of further drizzle. But they decide to push on through, one 
run is scored, and then the (reduced to four overs for rainy reasons) powerplay 
is signalled.

35th over: Afghanistan 106-7 (Zadran 7, Hassan 0)

The batmen cross while the ball is in the air, and Zadran boffs the first 
post-dismissal delivery to the square leg boundary for four. Nice shot.

WICKET! Shafiqullah c Bopara b Tredwell 30 (Afghanistan 101-7)

Shafiqullah goes big in search of a six but gets a massive top edge and 
Bopara, running around to his left, takes a fine, low catch at deep square leg.

34th over: Afghanistan 101-6 (Shafiqullah 30, Zadran 2)

Broad’s back again, with his seventh over of the day, but even with his added 
pace, six wickets down and all sorts of encouragement for seam bowlers there 
are no slips in place for Shafiqullah and thus when he edges too wide for 
Buttler there’s nobody to collect it (it probably wouldn’t have carried) and 
they run a couple.

Afghanistan do lots of running. Once they might have been punished for it, but 
Bopara failed to hit the stumps from his position at short third man.

32nd over: Afghanistan 93-6 (Shafiqullah 21, Zadran 0)

Now I’ve been burned before when doing the first innings of England games at 
this tournament. At that midway stage I thought they’d done pretty well against 
Sri Lanka. I thought they’d probably beat Bangladesh. So I hesitate before 
making this premature assertion, but surely, weather depending, they’re romping 
to victory here? Surely?

Right, that’s it from me. Be sure to stick around on site for all the reports 
and reaction from Sydney <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/sport>. But for now, 
cheerio!
 
So let the post-mortems begin! We’ve learned four-fifths of nothing at all 
from today’s subdued affair. I think it’s been a bit of a trial for the England 
players really – glum faces all round despite the win.
 
Bell skips down the track and dinks away a single to confirm the win. He ends 
52 not out. That’s that then. The victors depart the tournament wondering 
exactly where they go from here. The losers depart the tournament wondering if 
they’ll ever be back.
 
18th over: England 100-1 (Taylor 8, Bell 51) Taylor skews a cut away off 
Dawlat for a couple to third man to take England to within one run of victory.

<https://twitter.com/tomdaviesE17/status/576337936519708673>  
17th over: England 97-1 (Taylor 6, Bell 50) Shapoor Zadran comes in for one 
last blast and Ian Bell goes to within a single of his half century with a late 
cut that zips yards over the head of the man at slip and down to third man 
boundary. A dab off the next brings the 50 off 53 balls and you won’t see many 
more underwhelmed ‘celebrations’ than the one he puts in. A quick lift of the 
bat and a scowl is all you’re getting, and fair enough really.
 
16th over: England 91-1 (Taylor 5, Bell 46) A couple of singles are squeezed 
off Hassan, who then sends down a leg-side wide when in search of a yorker. 
Figures of 5-0-18-1 are nothing to be ashamed of, though. England need just 10 
more.
 
15th over: England 87-1 (Taylor 3, Bell 45) Nabi continues to tease and test 
the batsmen with what Nasser Hussain describes as “good old-fashioned 
off-spin”. He and Hassan have certainly been the pick of the bowlers – just 
three from the over.
 
14th over: England 84-1 (Taylor 1, Bell 44) So what has been, in cricket 
parlance, a Pretty Ordinary tournament for Alex Hales ends in frustrating 
fashion.
 
Just 23 more runs needed for England. Hassan returns and again there’s 
fielding hesitancy on the midwicket boundary, with two fielders leaving the 
ball to each other and almost allowing it to trundle over the rope. So Hassan 
balls up his rage and sends down a cracker that does for Hales! It’s a beauty, 
just holding its line outside off and forcing a nervous poke from the England 
opener, who can only feather an edge through to the keeper.
 
13th over: England 78-0 (Hales 35, Bell 41) Nabi finds the Hales edge but 
there’s no slip and the ball whistles away for a couple to third man. The 
Afghanistan captain again finds some useful turn – four from the over.
 
12th over: England 74-0 (Hales 32, Bell 40) Bell punches a Shenwari full toss 
out to wide long on … and Hassan fumbles the ball pretty miserably over the 
rope. Ugly stuff. Hales requires not help a couple of balls later, though – a 
huge slog-sweep disappears into the stands at square leg.
 
11th over: England 62-0 (Hales 25, Bell 35) This is a bit of a procession for 
England. Nabi continues and keeps the batsmen honest. Three from the over.
 
10th over: England 59-0 (Hales 23, Bell 34) Sami Shenwari enters the fray. 
He’s too short and Bell pulls hard out to the boundary, where Shafiq fumbles 
the ball over the rope. From the next, he turns one onto Bell’s pads and 
there’s a big appeal but the umpire decides it’s just sliding down leg. Hawkeye 
shows the ball clipping leg, but it would’ve been umpire’s call on any review.
 
9th over: England 52-0 (Hales 23, Bell 27) Spin now from Mohammad Nabi. Bell 
works him to leg for a couple then they scurry through for a quick single that 
brings up the England 50. Nabi finds some decent turn, but nudging and nurdling 
adds to more singles to the tally.
 
8th over: England 47-0 (Hales 22, Bell 25) Hassan once more. A pretty hideous 
misfield at mid off turns a single into a double for Bell – Afghanistan’s 
fielding has been the weakest facet of their game in this tournament – but 
again the bowler keeps it very tight. Just three from the over.
 
7th over: England 44-0 (Hales 22, Bell 22) Dawlat Zadran returns but continues 
where he left off in the second over – too short and being slammed through the 
leg side by Hales. He bangs an angry ball in in response and finds the top 
edge, but the ball whistles away to the boundary once more, this time over the 
keeper’s head. There’s an lbw appeal from the last, but there was a fairly 
sizeable inside edge.
 
6th over: England 36-0 (Hales 14, Bell 22) If this is to be Ian Bell’s final 
ODI for England, he’s keen to go out in style. A couple of his shots so far 
have been vintage Sledgehammer of Eternal Justice. He’s quieter here, though, 
tied down by the impressive Hassan. Just four from the over.

“Can you explain why, when Afghanistan’s total came at a run rate of 3.08 runs 
an over, we’ve been given a total that requires a rate of 4.04 runs an over?” 
writes Peter Spink. “I’m an Englishman following this in Kabul and I have to 
confess, I want Afghanistan to win. They deserved to beat Sri Lanka, so they 
really should beat our shower. The only thing if Afghanistan wins though is the 
risk of celebratory gunfire - quite a number of people were injured after the 
victory against Scotland. I imagine there’d be rather more gunfire if they beat 
England.”

It’s your D/L method, innit 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/rules_and_equipment/4184006.stm>? 
 
5th over: England 32-0 (Hales 13, Bell 19) A ferocious cut from Hales brings 
him four more off Shapoor Zadran. But next up he’s dropped again! And again 
it’s the man at backward point. Almost a carbon copy – this one was perhaps a 
touch easier – but Najib Zadran makes a mess of it once more.
 
4th over: England 25-0 (Hales 8, Bell 17) Hamid Hassan, who has arrived 
dressed as one of Arnie’s buddies in Predator, replaces Dawlat Zadaran. And, 
though he’s not hunting an invisible game-hunting alien, he still shows some 
hostility and firepower. Just one from a very useful over.
 
3rd over: England 24-0 (Hales 8, Bell 16) A third narrow escape for the 
opening pair, as Bell just gets enough on a drive to plonk it over extra cover. 
He’s got hold of this one, though – a glorious thunk over cover again, this 
time struck sweetly for four. Both batsmen are showing a bit of intent, at 
least.
 
2nd over: England 17-0 (Hales 8, Bell 9) This is more like it from Alex Hales. 
He waits on Dawlat Zadran’s first delivery before carting him over midwicket 
for six. Fine shot, though not a great ball. He then skews awkwardly into the 
infield for a single and Bell follows it up with another boundary thwacked 
through the leg side.

Here’s a date for the diaries – 17 September at the Kia Oval sees Strauss Help 
for Heroes XI (coached by Botham) vs. a Rest of the World XI coached by Kirsten 
with a captain TBC. Preceded by a disability T20 between a Help for Heroes XI 
vs. a top flight disabled XI. Tickets go on sale today.More details here. 
<http://www.kiaoval.com/cricketforheroes/>
 
1st over: England 5-0 (Hales 1, Bell 4) So England set off in search of 101 
runs from 25 overs. Shapoor Zadran takes the new ball. Hales leaves alone 
outside off, then blocks off the back foot. And from the third ball he’s 
dropped! Hales thick-edges a straight drive to backward point, where the diving 
Najib Zadran can’t cling on. And he probably should’ve done really, though it 
wasn’t a dolly by any means. Bell crashes the last over the covers for four.
 
Out come the players. Ian Bell and Alex Hales stride out to the middle under 
the floodlights.
 
Very shortly, in fact. England will need 101 from 25 overs.
 
Let there be play …
mike selvey (@selvecricket) 
8.45 start, 25 overs.
 <https://twitter.com/selvecricket/status/576314211866836992> March 13, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/selvecricket/status/576314211866836992> 
So we’ll be under way in about 15 minutes time. England’s target “to be 
announced shortly”.
 
And here’s Neil Keenan: “In reply to Stu Cherry, as an Irishman enjoying our 
seat at the head of European cricket, I’ve already been laughing at England for 
some time. Some of that cricket has been farcical and by some, I mean all. But 
after three thrilling wins, it’d be just our luck to be rained off on Sunday 
morning. Am I right in saying that would give us the 1 point needed to qualify? 
How’s the forecast looking in Adelaide?”

Yep, a washout would take Ireland through to the quarter-finals. The weather 
forecast, though, is for sun, sun and more sun.
 
Here’s Robin Hazlehurst: “I was pondering the same thing as Stu Cherry, and 
while it would be much funnier for England to be eliminated by rain after 
beating Bangladesh, it would also be more tragic, as it would let the ECB 
simply say ‘well we would have qualified (and gone on to win the thing) if only 
it hadn’t been for the rain...’. At least the rain here is denying them the 
chance to say ‘but we still won two games’.”
 
The rain has stopped at the SCG. And there’ll be a pitch inspection it about 
2o minutes. Given the time lost it looks like it would be a 20-over (ish) run 
chase for England if they can get back out there.
 
“Good work on the drip-by-drip coverage,” writes Stu Cherry. “As our resident 
Aussie isn’t in the office yet, I have a question for non-England fans out 
there. Which would have been funnier: England losing to Bangladesh and not 
qualifying or England beating Bangladesh and then not qualifying because this 
game was rained off with England in a likely winning position?”
 
New Zealand win by three wickets! A couple of Tim Southee boundaries get the 
hosts home with seven balls to spare. So we have our first confirmed 
quarter-final tie lined up: it’ll be India v Bangladesh at the MCG next 
Thursday.
 
Meanwhile in Sydney, the clock is ticking …

80 minutes to get this game restarted or thats it. still raining.

Corey Anderson swipes a huge, HUGE, six into the stands at cow corner, where a 
punter takes a nonchalant one-handed catch. Next ball, Anderson tries again but 
gets himself clean bowled. Three wickets left, 20 needed off 16.
 
Four overs to go in Hamilton and New Zealand need 33 from 24 balls, with six 
wickets down. Anderson and Vettori at the crease.
 
In an alternate universe where England had beaten Bangladesh, this would be 
one of the tensest couple of hours of the tournament so far, with England 
desperate for the rain to stop and for New Zealand to finish the job against 
Bangladesh. Instead, well, the only thing up for grabs is third place in the 
table.
 
Pitch inspection cancelled! Well, postponed. The rain is coming down again at 
the SCG.
 
In Hamilton Ross Taylor has just unveiled a radical new DRS technique – he’s 
just reviewed an lbw decision but trudged off the field while waiting for the 
technology to do its work. The replay shows he’s plumb, but he knew that 
anyway. Strange. Anyway, New Zealand are 223-5 chasing 289. They’ve got 48 
balls remaining and 66 runs to gather.
 
The rain has eased in Sydney so the umpires are going to don their waders and 
have a look in about 20 minutes or so. But it’s still a bit dark over Bill’s 
mother’s:

The rain has eased in Sydney but we're awaiting inspection from the umpires:

If you missed the team news earlier, England have brought in Ravi Bopara and 
James Tredwell for Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes. Both have been tidy: RavBop has 
figures of 8-1-31-2 and Tredwell 7-0-25-1.
 
The rain very briefly paused over in Sydney … but it’s coming down again now. 
This is certainly the end of the Afghanistan innings. Setting the England 
target will be a job for the calculators from this point.
 
Over in Hamilton, meanwhile, New Zealand need a further 103 runs from 92 balls 
to beat Bangladesh. Ross Taylor has just gone to his half century off a very 
steady 83 balls.
 
Hello everyone. I’m afraid I bring bad tidings:

With the likelihood that there will be no play for a while (no further updates 
on that front, but here’s a vaguely semi-helpful and only very mildly 
encouragingweather radar <http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR714.loop.shtml#skip>
), and the possibility that Afghanistan’s innings is at an end, I’m going to 
toss the baton to John Ashdown, who will lead you through what remains of 
England’s World Cup campaign. All emails tojohn.ashdown@theguardian.com 
<mailto:john.ashdown@theguardian.com> henceforth and from now on, and 
@John_Ashdown <https://twitter.com/john_ashdown> is the address on ye Twitter. 
Bye!
 
That may be the last we see of Afghanistan’s batsmen at this World Cup. With 
10 runs already lost from the match, anything more than the briefest of showers 
will finish their innings.
 
Meanwhile in Hamilton, Martin Guptill has completed an 88-ball century against 
Bangladesh, where New Zealand are 156-2 in the 28th over.
 
36.2 overs: Afghanistan 111-7 (Zadran 12, Hassan 0)

Jordan returns, and Zadran thrashes his first delivery back over his head for 
four, the ball landing six inches from the rope. The next delivery is banged in 
short, which Zadran fends off. And then the umpires think it’s a little too 
rainy, and head back to their changing room to towel themselves down.
 
36th over: Afghanistan 107-7 (Zadran 8, Hassan 0)

Before Broad starts his over the umpires have a little look at the sky (still 
grey), amid reports of further drizzle. But they decide to push on through, one 
run is scored, and then the (reduced to four overs for rainy reasons) powerplay 
is signalled.
 
35th over: Afghanistan 106-7 (Zadran 7, Hassan 0)

The batmen cross while the ball is in the air, and Zadran boffs the first 
post-dismissal delivery to the square leg boundary for four. Nice shot.
 
Shafiqullah goes big in search of a six but gets a massive top edge and 
Bopara, running around to his left, takes a fine, low catch at deep square leg.
 
34th over: Afghanistan 101-6 (Shafiqullah 30, Zadran 2)

Broad’s back again, with his seventh over of the day, but even with his added 
pace, six wickets down and all sorts of encouragement for seam bowlers there 
are no slips in place for Shafiqullah and thus when he edges too wide for 
Buttler there’s nobody to collect it (it probably wouldn’t have carried) and 
they run a couple.
 
33rd over: Afghanistan 97-6 (Shafiqullah 27, Zadran 1)

Afghanistan do lots of running. Once they might have been punished for it, but 
Bopara failed to hit the stumps from his position at short third man.
 
32nd over: Afghanistan 93-6 (Shafiqullah 21, Zadran 0)

Now I’ve been burned before when doing the first innings of England games at 
this tournament. At that midway stage I thought they’d done pretty well against 
Sri Lanka. I thought they’d probably beat Bangladesh. So I hesitate before 
making this premature assertion, but surely, weather depending, they’re romping 
to victory here? Surely?
