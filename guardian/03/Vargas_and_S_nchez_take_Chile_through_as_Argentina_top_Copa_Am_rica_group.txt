 “This was important for me and for the team,” said Chile’s Vargas. “It has 
boosted our confidence for the games to come. We are Copa América champions but 
we haven’t played as well as we did in the last Copa América and this will give 
us confidence.“

Chile <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chile> went behind to an early 
goal but roared back thanks to outstanding performances from their front pair, 
who ran the Panamanian defence ragged.

 Panama took the lead in the fourth minute after a mistake by Chilean 
goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who let Miguel Camargo’s shot from almost 30 yards 
squirm through his hands and into the net.

 Chile fought back and were soon 2-1 up. Arturo Vidal and Sánchez worked a 
one-two in the box after 14 minutes and Sánchez’s shot was only parried by 
Jaime Penedo and Vargas followed up to smash it home.

 Three minutes before half time striker Vargas rose to glance home a header to 
put Chile ahead.

Arsenal’s Sánchez was in captivating form and scored one of the goals of the 
tournament after 49 minutes. Vargas was the provider this time, creating space 
for himself in the box before chipping to Sánchez, who volleyed home in 
spectacular fashion.

 Panama kept fighting and pulled one back after 74 minutes and again Bravo was 
at fault, failing to stop Abdiel Arroyo’s header from going in at his near post.

Sánchez had the last word, however, when he rose unmarked to head home a cross 
with two minutes left to make it 4-2.

In Seattle, few were expecting anything other than an Argentine win over 
already-eliminatedBolivia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bolivia> and 
most of the attention was focused on whether Lionel Messi would surpass Gabriel 
Batistuta’s record of 54 goals for his country.

 Needing one to tie the mark, Messi came on as a second-half substitute with 
his team already 3-0 up through Erik Lamela, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Victor 
Cuesta. The closest Messi came to scoring was from a free-kick in the 61st 
minute but his curled effort sailed just wide.

“People want to see him. People pay all over the world to see him and he has 
to deal with that,” Argentina manager Gerardo Martino said afterwards. 
“Sometimes he has to play and sometimes he has to be on the bench but he has 
that obligation to follow through for the fans who are paying to be there. He 
has to live with that.”

Argentina had 81% possession in the first half against a Bolivian side that 
was happy to sit back and defend. Argentina completed 357 passes in the first 
half; Bolivia completed 38.

“Regardless of the result, regardless after the first half he knew he was 
going to play for 45 minutes,” Martino said of Messi. “He is growing compared 
to the last game. The last game he played 30, today 45, and he is feeling more 
confident. That is what we were going to do regardless.”
