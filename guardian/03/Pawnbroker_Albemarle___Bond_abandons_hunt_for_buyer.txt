The pawnbroker Albemarle & Bond has scrapped an attempt to sell itself and 
declared that its shares could now hold little value.

Britain's second-biggest pawnbroker put itself up for sale in early December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/02/albemarle-and-bond-sale-mass-walkout>
 after it admitted it had resorted to melting down and selling gold items in 
its shops to shore up its finances.

Jon Moulton's Better Capital pulled out of takeover talks on Christmas Eve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/24/albemarle-bond-buyer-walks-away>
. The company said following Moulton's withdrawal it had talked to other 
potential buyers but without success.

In a statement to the stock exchange, Albemarle & Bond said: "Despite a number 
of proposals being received from interested parties through the course of the 
formal sale process … none of the proposals were deemed to represent a fair 
value for the company.

"Whilst alternative options continue to be explored, the board of Albemarle 
now believes that, depending on the final outcome, there may be limited value 
attributable to the ordinary shares."

Albemarle & Bond shares more than halved on the news, dropping 58% to 8p and 
valuing it at £4.4m. In mid-2011 the company was valued at £224m.

Albemarle & Bond was hit last year by the plunging price of gold. It had bet 
its future on the rising gold price and declared "the age of the pawnbroker" in 
2011 as cash-strapped households cashed in their items.

A recovery in the global economy – making gold less attractive against 
resurgent stock markets – sent the price of gold down by 28% last year, leaving 
Albemarle with big losses. Analysts predict a further fall in the gold price 
this year.

In October, Albemarle & Bond failed to secure the backing of its biggest 
shareholder, the US pawnbroker EZ Corp, and was forced to abandon a £35m rights 
issue to raise money from shareholders.

The company was left perilously close to overstepping lending limits imposed 
by its banks. Albemarle & Bond said the banks had agreed to give it until 31 
March to resolve its problems. Buyers, such as its bigger rival H&T, could be 
interested in buying parts of the business now that a sale of the whole company 
has been abandoned.

The company brought in Chris Gillespie from doorstep lender Provident 
Financial as chief executive in an attempt to turn the business round. But its 
woes were underscored when it suffered a board exodus in December as the 
attempted sale was announced.
