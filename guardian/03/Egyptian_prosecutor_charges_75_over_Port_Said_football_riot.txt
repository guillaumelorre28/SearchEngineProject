Egypt's top prosecutor has charged 75 people with murder and negligence in 
connection with a deadly football riot last month in the Mediterranean city of 
Port Said.

At least 74 people were killed in the riot, the world's worst football-related 
disaster in 15 years.

Those charged on Thursday include nine police officers and two minors. Among 
the police officers are Major General Issam Samak, who was Port Said's chief of 
security at the time of the riot. Samal had already been suspended.

The riot began minutes after the final whistle in a league game between Cairo 
club Al-Ahly and Al-Masry of Port Said. The home side won 3-1 but its fans set 
upon the rival supporters in a killing frenzy that witnesses said lasted 30 
minutes.

Many witnesses claimed that police at the venue did nothing to stop the 
bloodshed.

A statement by the Egyptian general prosecutor's office said the charges were 
based on video footage of the riot and the confessions of suspects. It said the 
killing of the protesters was planned in advance and that the culprits prepared 
for the massacre with knives, rocks and explosives. Fans from the two teams 
have a history of animosity.

The Port Said riot led to the cancellation of the football league and sparked 
days of clashes in Cairo between police and protesters accusing the interior 
ministry, which is in charge of police, of doing nothing to protect Al-Ahly 
fans.

The Egyptian football federation has yet to punish Al-Masry for the riot. It 
is widely expected to relegate the team to a lower league and ban any official 
games from being played on its ground.
