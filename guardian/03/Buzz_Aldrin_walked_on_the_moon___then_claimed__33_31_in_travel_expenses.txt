The former astronaut posted his “

The voucher itemizes each detail of Aldrin’s travel arrangements, with a 
“government spacecraft” noted among government aircraft and automobiles used on 
the trip. “Government meals and quarters furnished for all above dates,” the 
voucher states.


Another tweet from Aldrin showed that all the astronauts on Apollo 11 had to 
sign a customs form <https://twitter.com/TheRealBuzz/status/627895978796916736> 
upon their return to Earth from the moon.

Arriving in Honolulu, Hawaii, on 24 July 1969, Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and 
Michael Collins declared they had brought back “moon rock and moon dust 
samples”.

Yes the #Apollo11 <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apollo11?src=hash> crew also 
signed customs forms. We brought back moon rocks & moon dust samples. Moon 
disease TBD.pic.twitter.com/r9Sn57DeoW <http://t.co/r9Sn57DeoW>

<https://twitter.com/TheRealBuzz/status/627895978796916736> 
According to the form, none of the astronauts suffered from illnesses other 
than air sickness or the effects of accidents. It was “to be determined” 
whether they contracted any diseases while on the moon.


Aldrin also tweeted a photo of the Apollo 11 astronauts in biological 
isolation garments <https://twitter.com/TheRealBuzz/status/626807849331462144>, 
which they wore so that lunar dustwouldn’t infect 
<https://twitter.com/TheRealBuzz/status/626808243688353792> people on Earth. 
According to Aldrin, <https://twitter.com/TheRealBuzz/status/626808463113371648>
 the rags used to wipe the moon dust were dropped in the ocean “so the poor 
underwater creatures got our moon germs instead”.


“Maybe this is fodder for a Godzilla movie,” he tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/TheRealBuzz/status/626808931776466944>. “I claim the movie 
rights! (A fan said call it Buzzilla!).”


The 46th anniversary of the Apollo 11 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/apollo-11-moon-landing> moon landing fell 
on 20 July. Aldrin posted several photographs from the journey to his Facebook 
and Twitter pages throughout the past week.
