Two Police Federation officials will face gross misconduct hearings over the 
Plebgate scandal involving the Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell after a ruling 
by theIndependent Police Complaints Commission 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ipcc> (IPCC).

The watchdog overruled a decision by Warwickshire police that one of the 
officers, DS Stuart Hinton, should not face a disciplinary hearing and directed 
it to take action.

The other force involved, West Mercia police, accepted the recommendation that 
Insp Ken Mackaill had a case to answer.

Mackaill and Hinton were accused of misrepresenting their meeting with 
Mitchell, which took place after the row about whether the former chief whip 
called Downing Street police officers “fucking plebs” in September 2012.

Mitchell has always denied saying those words but he lost a libel case 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/27/pleb-andrew-mitchell-loses-libel-case>
 against News Group Newspapers (NGN), which was the first to report his alleged 
use of the politically toxic phrase.

After the meeting in Mitchell’s Sutton Coldfield constituency office, Mackaill 
wrongly told the media the MP would not provide an account of the incident.

Hinton had to apologise to MPs after after he initially denied referring to 
the home secretary, Theresa May, as “this woman that the Conservative party 
have”.

The IPCC initially made a recommendation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/20/ipcc-officers-should-face-disciplinary-hearings-over-plebgate-meeting>
 in July that both men should face hearings after conducting an independent 
investigation into the conduct of three officials. The watchdog has decided 
that the threshold for any possible criminal prosecutions was not met.
