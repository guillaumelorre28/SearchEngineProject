Rupert Murdoch <https://www.theguardian.com/media/rupert-murdoch> sought to 
backtrack on Wednesday from a Twitter storm stemming from comments about 
Muslims following the Paris attacks.

“Certainly did not mean all Muslims responsible for Paris attack. But Muslim 
community must debate and confront extremism,” Murdoch said in a tweet that 
followed a barrage of criticisms of a comment made last week.

The 83-year-old’s comments about the bloody assault on French magazine Charlie 
Hebdo stirred up taunts and angry replies, many using the hashtag RupertsFault.

The Australian-born head of News Corp and 21st Century Fox drew fire for his 9 
January tweet which said, “Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they 
recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held 
responsible.”

Criticism was led by Los Angeles-based comic Aziz Ansari 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/aziz-ansari>, who wrote, “Are you 
responsible for the evil shit all Christians do or just the insane amount of 
evil you yourself contribute to?”

Ansari also asked Murdoch, “can we get a step by step guide? How can my 60 
year old parents in NC help destroy terrorist groups?”

After Murdoch’s latest tweet, Ansari fired back, “Hahahah you got forced to do 
a fake apology tweet!!! AHAHAHAHA YOU LOSER.”

Over the past few days, dozens of Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> users mocked Murdoch for his 
comments using the hashtag.

“Adolf Hitler was catholic. Why didn’t Rupert stop him? RupertsFault,” Twitter 
user Graham Bowling wrote.

Another user tweeting under the name Shariah Bolshevik wrote, “The Crusades 
which he CONVENIENTLY never denounced or apologized for.”

Harry Potter author JK Rowling <https://www.theguardian.com/books/jkrowling> 
weighed in on the debate, tweeting, “I was born Christian. If that makes Rupert 
Murdoch my responsibility, I’ll auto-excommunicate.”
