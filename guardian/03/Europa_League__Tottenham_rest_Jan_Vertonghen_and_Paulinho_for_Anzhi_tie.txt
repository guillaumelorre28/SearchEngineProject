The pair started Saturday's 1-1 draw with Chelsea

 and have been rested. Etienne Capoue, Aaron Lennon and Emmanuel Adebayor are 
sidelined, as is Danny Rose, though he could feature against West Ham on Sunday.

Conflict in Dagestan means the match is being held 1,100 miles away in 
Ramenskoye, a town on the outskirts of Moscow. The 16,500-capacity Saturn 
Stadium is expected to be a third full.

Anzhi have slashed their budget this season and Spurs' manager, Andr√© 
Villas-Boas, said: "They are radically different from what Anzhi built in these 
past years."
