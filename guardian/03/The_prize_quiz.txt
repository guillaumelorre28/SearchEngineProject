 My questions reflect some of my obsessions. Like me, most chefs I know like 
rock'n'roll, have a movie-fuelled taste for melodrama and have - at some point 
in their careers - engaged in activity that might skirt the margins of 
criminality. At least I'd like to think so. There is one attribute of a good 
cook I had to leave out - as this is, after all, a family newspaper.
