Two men have been arrested in connection with the 2009 theft of a valuable 
work byEdvard Munch <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/edvard-munch> 
from an Oslo art dealer.

Police spokeswoman Unni Groendal said the men were suspected of handling 
stolen goods and face a pre-trial detention hearing on Wednesday. She said they 
were arrested on Monday and Tuesday in Oslo but were not suspected of carrying 
out the theft itself.

The men were not identified but Norwegian media said they were well known to 
police and had criminal records.

Groendal added that the hand-coloured Munch lithography Historien (History) 
was recovered on Monday.

Printed in 1914, the lithograph was stolen on 12 November 2009, from Nyborgs 
Kunst in Oslo after one of the dealership’s windows was smashed with a rock. 
Gallery owner Pascal Nyborg told the Norwegian news agency NTB the lithograph 
was worth an estimated 2m kroner (£170,500).

The Norwegian artist’s work has been a popular target for art thieves. The 
most notorious theft was in 2004 when gunmen stole masterpieces The Scream and 
Madonnain a brazen midday raid

Oslo’s Munch Museum.

Another version of The Scream – Munch painted several – was taken from 
Norway’s National Gallery in 1994

 by two thieves who left behind a postcard that read: “Thanks for the poor 
security”. One of the thieves had previously served a four-year sentence for 
the theft of Munch’s The Vampire in 1988.

All of the artworks have been recovered and museum security upgraded.
