Mentored by Dr Dre and hailed as "this era's Bob Dylan" by Pharrell Williams, 
Lamar's major-label debut good kid, m.A.A.d city catapulted the Compton rapper 
onto hip-hop's A-list. Street-level gritty, but an old head on young shoulders.

Philadelphia bass maven Harry Rodrigues hits the festival circuit to 
capitalise on the viral success of his trap-influenced breakout hit Harlem 
Shake. A new EP for LuckyMe should be out by the time the summer kicks in.

Winners of BBC's Sound Of 2013 poll, Haim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/haim> are three willowy Californian sisters 
fond of bike rides, hot-pants and crude stage banter, touting a gently anthemic 
FM-radio sound redolent of Fleetwood Mac and the poppier end of 90s R&B.

MERCHANDISE <http://www.merchandisetheband.co.uk/>

There's more than a touch of 80s indie and shoegaze to this Tampa, Florida 
noise trio. Vocalist Carson Cox boasts a bold, emotive croon that recalls 
Morrissey in all the right ways.

Lanky 25-year-old Dutchman Cole Williams recently revealed himself as the man 
behind the mysterious Child Of Lov moniker. Now, for his first ever gig, he 
plans to bring his Gnarls Barkley-esque "pineapple camel funk" (his words) to a 
Pilton field with full live band in tow.

TEMPLES

Extravagant barnets and unashamed 60s-worship from this Marr and 
Suede-endorsed Kettering quartet, purveyors of paisley-and-patchouli 
psychedelia a la Tame Impala. An old trick, but an effective one – particularly 
for punters favouring traditional forms of festival transcendence.

PEACE <http://www.peaceforeverever.co.uk>

Leading lights of Birmingham's B-Town scene, and fresh off the back of 
Vaccines and Tame Impala support slots, this gobby quartet use baggy beats and 
Afro-pop guitars to craft what they call "dark melodic indie-techno". Key 
single Wraith suggests a good portion of the hype thrown their way might 
actually be justified.

THE STRYPES <http://www.thestrypes.com>

Sharp-suited, frighteningly young (ages range from 15 to 17) Irish quartet 
playing hotwired R&B with more than a shred of feisty Arctic Monkeys tumble. "A 
breath of fresh air," says Sir Elton John, who signed them to his Rocket Music 
Management.

LAURA MVULA

There's more to this Birmingham neo-soul girl than meets the eye: a degree in 
classical composition means bucolic jazz-soul numbers like Green Garden boast 
an elegant complexity beneath their inviting, sing-along exteriors.

CHVRCHES <http://chvrch.es/>

Glaswegian trio from the "tears on the dancefloor" school of electro-pop. Much 
like Robyn, they know how to lace sparkling synths and fists-to-heart angst 
with big, gleaming hooks. See recent single Recover for plentiful evidence.

ANGEL HAZE

This Brooklyn rapper is fearless, whether she's claiming to "run New York", 
starting beefs with Azealia Banks, or reworking Eminem's Cleaning Out My Closet 
in harrowing fashion. A cut above your usual hip-hop live act, too.

This Virginian has penned one of the albums of the year so far in Big Inner, a 
big-hearted blend of soul, jazz and Tropicalia recorded in his own studios. 
Perfect for a hungover mid-afternoon lounge on the grass.
