Dating isn't the sole preserve of the young and the restless: many people find 
themselves back in the game later in life.Dating 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/dating> can be a fun, exhilarating 
and ultimately life-changing experience. But if you want it to change your life 
for the better, you need to know how to get the most from your dates. These 
tips will give you a good chance of success.

Online dating

There's no longer a stigma attached to e-dating, and these days there's a 
wealth of specialist sites aimed solely at the 50+ and 60+ age groups. Here's a 
round-up of some of the best:

UK Mature Dating 
ukmaturedating.com <http://www.ukmaturedating.com>
An easy-to-use, no-nonsense site that is perfect for beginners. 

Over 50s 
over50s.co.uk <http://www.over50s.co.uk>
Much more than just a dating site; it also offering a wealth of tips, 
suggestions and advice for would-be daters.

Fifty Already 
fiftyalready.com/dating <http://www.fiftyalready.com/dating.asp>
Charges for membership, which may not suit everybody, but fee-paying sites do 
tend to attract more serious candidates and discourage time-wasters.

My Single Friend
mysinglefriend.com <http://www.mysinglefriend.com>
Not strictly for older daters, but the beauty of this site is that your 
friends do all the hard work for you. Get them to create your profile and then 
pair you up with potential suitors they think would be your ideal match.

Non-specialist sites
There's no need to avoid the more mainstream dating sites 
<http://dating.theguardian.com/s/>, as many attract a diverse range of ages. 
Use recommendations from friends and family - someone you know is bound to be 
familiar with dating websites.

As with any company offering a popular service, it pays to do your research. 
Some sites may charge a fee; others may only be partially free. Bear in mind 
that with many sites it's not always immediately obvious which elements are 
completely without cost. It's worth finding this out before you create your 
profile, as the last thing you want is to be unable to respond to a message 
from the future love of your life.

Another point to remember is that safety first is not just a mantra for kids. 
Always make sure that someone knows when you're going on a date, be wary of 
online imposters, never respond to calls for money or financial details, and 
only hand over personal details, such as your phone number and email address, 
if you feel comfortable and ready.

Holiday clubs

Why should the 18-30s have all the fun? Whether it's camping in Cumbria or 
cruising the Caribbean, there's a singles holiday to suit you. Specialist 
holiday firms cater for almost every demographic, and solo trips for the older 
generation has become a very lucrative business. This is good news for the 
savvy consumer, as there's more choice than ever before.

Volunteering

After you retire it can be difficult to replace the camaraderie that you had 
with your work colleagues. Volunteering is a great way to forge new 
relationships with like-minded people, and has the added benefit of knowing 
you're contributing to a worthwhile cause.

Charity shops are often crying out for help and could be just the ticket if 
you're looking to meet people in a relaxed environment.

If you prefer the great outdoors, then why not get involved in a conservation 
project? There are plenty of options on the National Trust website 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-trust/w-volunteering.htm>.

personalised advice on what would suit you the best, try theVolunteering website

people can get involved in.
