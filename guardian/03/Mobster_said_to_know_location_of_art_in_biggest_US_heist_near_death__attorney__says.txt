 Robert Gentile, 80, had been scheduled to stand trial last month for selling 
a loaded firearm to a convicted killer, charges his attorney contends were the 
product of a federal sting operation intended to pressure Gentile into leading 
agents to paintings stolen in 1990.

The brazen theft was carried out by two men dressed in police uniforms who 
apparently overpowered a night security guard who buzzed them in a back 
entrance. None of the 13 artworks, which include Rembrandt’s Storm on the Sea 
of Galilee and The Concert, by Vermeer, have been recovered.

 Gentile’s trial was delayed by his failing health and a request by defense 
attorney Ryan McGuigan that he be evaluated to determine if he was mentally 
capable of standing trial.

McGuigan said he visited Gentile in South Carolina this week after being 
advised by federal officials to tell Gentile’s wife, also 80 and in ill health, 
and son, in his early 50s, to prepare for the possibility of the man’s death.

“I told him that if there ever was a time to give up some information that you 
haven’t yet, that I don’t know, this would be it,” McGuigan said in a phone 
interview.

He said he believed that if Gentile were to offer up new information about the 
paintings, federal officials would allow him to see his family in Connecticut.

“He said, ‘Yeah, but there’s no painting,’” McGuigan said. “His story has 
never changed in the six years that I have represented him.”

A spokesman for federal prosecutors in Connecticut declined to comment. 
McGuigan said he could not provide more detail on where Gentile was being held.

FBI says two suspects who stole $500m in art from Boston museum are dead

Gentile has repeatedly denied knowing the whereabouts of any of the art taken 
in one of Boston’s longest-unsolved high-profile crimes.


Due to a quirk in Gardner’s will, the empty frames that once held the 
paintings remain on the walls of the museum she built to house the collection 
she amassed with her husband.


 The art must be displayed in the way that it was during her lifetime, 
preventing curators from hanging new works and leaving a constant reminder of 
the theft.

At a court hearing last year, federal prosecutors said Gentile had been 
secretly recorded telling an undercoverFBI 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> agent that he had access to at least 
two of the stolen paintings and could sell them for $500,000 each.

 A 2012 FBI search of Gentile’s home turned up a handwritten list of the 
stolen art, its estimated value and police uniforms, according to court 
documents.
