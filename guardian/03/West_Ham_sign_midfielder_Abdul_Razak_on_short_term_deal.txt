West Ham have signed the former Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> midfielder Abdul Razak on 
a short-term deal.

The 21-year-old Ivory Coast international came through the ranks at City after 
originally starting out at Crystal Palace but found first-team opportunities 
limited at the Etihad Stadium.

Razak has spent time on loan at Portsmouth, Brighton, Charlton and most 
recently the Russian clubAnzhi Makhachkala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anzhi-makhachkala>, who signed him on a 
permanent deal in October.

But now the midfielder will be looking to make a more lasting impression on 
the Premier League as he links up with the Hammers, who face Swansea on 
Saturday as they look to move out of the relegation zone.

Razak is manager Sam Allardyce's fourth signing of the January transfer window 
after loan deals for the Wolves defender Roger Johnson and the Italy 
internationals Antonio Nocerino and Marco Borriello.
