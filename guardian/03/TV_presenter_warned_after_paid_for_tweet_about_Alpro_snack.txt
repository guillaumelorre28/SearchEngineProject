A TV presenter failed to make it clear she was being paid to send a tweet 
about a snack, the advertising watchdog has ruled.

AJ Odudu posted a picture of an Alpro Go On yoghurt-type pot in her hand 
alongside the caption “Fave summer snack vibes”.

The tweet should have been marked to show she was being paid to promote the 
company’s products, theAdvertising Standards Authority 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> said.

Odudu, a former presenter on Big Brother’s spin-off show Bit on the Side, 
should have included a “clear identifier” in the post to let people know it was 
marketing, rather than her own editorial content, the ASA said.

Odudu, who currently has more than 25,000 followers on Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter>, has been warned to mark 
future similar posts with #ad to clear up any doubt.

In its ruling, which was sparked by one complaint, the ASA said: “The ad was 
presented in a similar ‘voice’ to Ms Odudu’s other tweets and did not include 
any clear identifier, such as ‘#ad’, to demarcate it from her own content.

“While we noted that the tweet contained the advertiser Twitter handle and 
campaign hashtags, we did not consider that this would make clear to consumers 
the commercial intent of the content or the editorial control exercised by the 
advertiser.”

The company, which specialises in soya food products, has pledged to ensure 
any future marketing communications are marked up as ads.
