The late, cold spring had me longing to put a polytunnel over my entire 
allotment. At the beginning of May, I had basil and tomatoes shivering in cold 
frames wrapped up in fleece as tightly as I was wrapping a scarf around my 
neck, but the season catches up eventually.

There’s still time to sow crops direct, if the first lot shivered into 
submission or were slugged by this year’s epicsleepless slug 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36166774> population. The winter 
was so mild that they continued to breed, meaning we’re going into this season 
with hugely elevated population numbers.

 (a marvellous sprouting broccoli type, from Franchi Seeds), kales, salads and 
the outdoor sowings of marrows, pumpkins, courgettes and cucumbers can now be 
sown direct.

For french, borlotto and shelling beans I’d make a sowing now, one in three 
weeks and another at the beginning of July to cover for a final autumn bonus. I 
don’t sow a great deal each time; enough to be thinned out to five or six 
plants a row. I sow direct, two seeds per station. I love the dwarf bean variety
‘Faraday’ <http://www.seaspringseeds.co.uk/shop/french-bean-seed/faraday-detail>
, from Sea Spring seeds: it has delicious thin green beans that crop quickly. 
The cropping period in dwarf varieties is shorter than climbers, but by sowing 
in succession, there are always tender beans to pick.

If you make your first few sowings a dual variety, one that can be eaten young 
as french beans or allowed to mature for storage, you can save on space, too. 
The best variety for this is‘Lazy Housewife’ 
<http://www.seedsavers.org/lazy-wife-organic-bean>, originally from Andalusia, 
that makes flat green pods which are tender when young and fatten to creamy 
white beans by the end of the season.Brown Envelope Seeds 
<http://www.brownenvelopeseeds.com/product-p/lazy-housewife-bean.htm> and Real 
Seed Company <http://www.realseeds.co.uk/beans.html> both offer this variety as 
well as other good storage beans. ‘Lazy Housewife’ is a climber, but you can 
dwarf any bean by pinching out the growing tip continually, forcing it to bush 
out. You may need to offer a little support, though.

I start sowing carrots in earnest now, too. I have terrible carrot fly issues, 
because my allotment is surrounded by cow parsley. It’s maddening because I 
love wandering through this to get to my plot, but the carrot fly uses the cow 
parsley as a hotel in which to overwinter. The minute cow parsley fades, the 
fly hops on to carrots.

One trick is to give a beat before the last of the cow parsley and the first 
sowing of carrots, then cover them immediately after sowing. The carrot fly is 
wily when it comes to finding holes in fleecing or netting, so bury the edges. 
The female is a notoriously poor flyer: if you’re on a flat site, a barrier a 
couple of feet high may stop her, but if the cow parsley rises above your site 
she coasts in on a downward wind and will skim over your barrier. If she’s laid 
eggs, the foliage of the carrots will have a red tinge. ‘Resistafly’
