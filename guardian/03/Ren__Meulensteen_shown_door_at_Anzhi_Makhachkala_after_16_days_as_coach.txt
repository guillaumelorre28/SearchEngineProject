René Meulensteen is being replaced as coach of the Russian club Anzhi 
Makhachkala <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anzhi-makhachkala> just 16 
days after he was appointed, the club's chairman said on Wednesday.

Konstantin Remchukov also said that "many expensive players" will leave, and 
that the club's budget will shrink to between $50m (£32.3m) and $70m. According 
to the Russian sports website Sports.ru, Anzhi's budget reached $180m in 2012.

Gadzhi Gadzhiev will take over from the respected former Manchester United 
first-team coach Meulensteen, Remchukov wrote on Twitter. He did not elaborate 
on the circumstances and the reasons for the departure of Meulensteen, who 
succeeded Guus Hiddink in late July.

However, Remchukov also said that "many expensive players will leave" the club.

A club statement issued several hours later seemed to contradict Remchukov's 
words. "There is no discussion of any kind of mass selling-off of the football 
players or of any other measures discussed in the media," the club said. "The 
club will respect all of the contractual obligations of its players."

But the club did say the team will in future "be founded on long-term 
perspectives for the development of the club, which of course assumes certain 
changes in its team makeup".

The owner, Suleyman Kerimov, pumped money into the team from his native 
Dagestan after purchasing the club in 2011, attracting foreign players and 
coaching talent. The team's players include the former Barcelona and 
Internazionale forward Samuel Eto'o.

In his series of Twitter messages, Remchukov did not offer details on which 
and how many players might leave Anzhi.

The club's statement said that budget changes made necessary by Uefa's 
financial fair play regulations, which aim to stop clubs from spending more 
than they earn, "will not contribute to any essential degradation of the team".

The statement did not mention the status of the coach.
