Consumers’ group Which? has called on the advertising watchdog to ban 
companies such as Sky andBT <https://www.theguardian.com/business/btgroup> from 
advertising super-fast broadband promises when more than 15m households don’t 
get anywhere near the speeds they pay for.

Under the UK advertising code, which is administered by the Advertising 
Standards Authority <https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa>, companies are 
allowed to advertise their top speeds even if they are only actually available 
to just 10% of customers.


Which? wants companies, including Sky, BT, Virgin Media, TalkTalk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/talk-talk-telecom>, EE, Three and O2, to 
be banned from luring new users with attractive high-speed claims unless more 
than 50% of customers can actually achieve those speeds.


Which? says research it has undertaken shows that while 90% of people consider 
broadband speed an important factor in their decision to buy a package, 15.4m 
households are not getting the top speeds advertised.


Companies are able to make the claims by saying broadband packages are 
available “up to” a certain speed.


“Millions of customers are being taken in by broadband they simply cannot 
get,” said Alex Neill, Which? director of policy and campaigns. “It’s clear a 
shake-up is needed. The regulator needs to quickly introduce stricter rules 
that ensure providers advertise speeds that they can deliver for a majority.”


Culture minister Ed Vaizey has previously said the rules are “misleading” and a
“complete and utter joke” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/14/broadband-speed-ads-culture-minister-ed-vaizey>
.


“It’s not right for internet service providers to advertise speeds that are 
only available to a minority of their customers,” said Vaizey, commenting on 
Which?’s call for tighter rules.

Last week, the ASA announced that it is to research consumers’ understanding 
of broadband speed claims made in ads.

The outcome of the research, expected in early autumn, could lead to changes 
to the broadband advertising rules.


The ASA says that since it introduced the 10% rule and the “up to” qualifier 
into the advertising code in 2011 complaints about broadband speed advertising 
have dropped by 60%.


In January, the ASA announced it is to crack down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/21/ad-watchdog-cracks-down-misleading-broadband-ads>
 on the way companies including Sky, BT, Virgin Media, TalkTalk, EE, Three and 
O2 advertise the confusing prices of broadband packages.

This prompted Virgin Media, which is able to offer super-fast broadband 
through its cable network, to call for the scope to be increased to look at the
veracity of “up to” speed claims in ads 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/22/virgin-media-asks-asa-to-crack-down-on-false-broadband-speed-claims>
.

“As an evidence-based regulator we want to make sure our approach is 
underpinned by the experience of real people,” said Guy Parker, chief executive 
of the ASA. “While complaints to the ASA about broadband speed claims have 
reduced considerably over recent years, we’re taking action to respond to 
concerns by testing our approach through consumer research.”
