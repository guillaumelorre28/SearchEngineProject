agreeing a deal with the Egyptian club Al Ahly to sign the highly-rated 
teenager Ramadan Sobhi, with the forward expected to join for an initial fee of 
around £2.5m.

Sobhi, 19, was a regular in the Ahly side who won the Egyptian title last 
month under the former Tottenham and Fulham managerMartin Jol

Stoke have been in negotiations with his club for some time but Jol is thought 
to have attempted to intervene to stop the player leaving. However, despite 
interest from Italian clubs, Sobhi has expressed a desire to move to the 
Premier League and is now expected to join Mark Hughes’s side.

The likelihood is that he will be immediately loaned out to a club in Europe 
because he does not meet the requirements for a UK work permit having appeared 
only six times for his country since his debut last June. Home Office rules 
state that players from countries ranked between 31st and 50th by Fifa must 
have played at least 75% of competitive matches over the past 24 months, 
although there is a possibility that Sobhi could be granted special 
dispensation via the appeal process.

Meanwhile, Stoke appear to face competition to sign West Bromwich Albion’s 
Saido Berahino with Watford reportedly ready to offer £20m for the striker in 
the coming days.
