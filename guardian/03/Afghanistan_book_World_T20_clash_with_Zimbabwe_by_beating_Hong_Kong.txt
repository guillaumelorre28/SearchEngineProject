Asghar Stanikzai’s men chased down a victory target of 117 with 12 balls to 
spare to claim their second Group B triumph and condemn Hong Kong to an early 
exit.

Zimbabwe also have a 100

record in the group and this weekend’s clash determines who will grab the only 
qualifying spot for the second round, where Sri Lanka, South Africa, England 
and West Indies lie in wait.

Hong Kong were once again undone by the Afghanistan off-spinner Mohammad Nabi, 
who took a format-best four for 17 when the teams met last month in an Asia Cup 
qualifier.

He followed it up with another four-wicket haul as Hong Kong were restricted 
to 116 for six after deciding to bat first.

The opener Ryan Campbell made 27 off 24 balls before he was unfortunately 
bowled, via a deflection off his helmet, by Nabi, who made significant inroads 
into the batting lineup. Anshuman Rath accrued 28 not out but Hong Kong’s score 
seemed well below par.

Thanks to the efforts of Mohammad Shahzad (41) and Noor Ali Zadran (35), 
Afghanistan reached 68 without loss at the halfway point of their pursuit.

While neither batsman could see the job through, Afghanistan were never in 
danger of folding and Najibullah Zadran (17no) crunched three successive fours 
in the 18th over to see them over the line.
