Best known for playing Pawnee’s hippest entrepreneur Tom on Parks and 
Recreation <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation>, 
Aziz Ansari has written and directed Master of None, a new 10-part comedy for 
Netflix “loosely based on his own life experiences”.

As the official description suggests, it sounds like Master of None will mine 
what you might call the post-Seinfeld/Louie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/10/louie-louis-ck-season-five-premiere>
 school of modern sitcom trajectories, watching him working, dating and hanging 
out in coffee shops (fine by us).

All 10 episodes of the show follow the personal and professional lives of Dev, 
a 30-year-old actor in New York who has trouble deciding what he wants to eat, 
much less the pathway for the rest of his life. Dev’s story takes him through 
subjects as diverse as the plight of the elderly, the immigrant experience and 
how to find the most delicious pasta for dinner.
