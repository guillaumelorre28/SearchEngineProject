1 The late show 

The tape will go up for the Grand National 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational> on Saturday at 5.15pm, the 
latest it has ever started, in the hope of an even bigger TV audience than the 
8m or so of recent years, and allowing sports fans to follow the race on their 
way home from Saturday afternoon matches. Channel 4 is screening the great race 
for the last time before ITV takes over, and coverage will extend to nine and a 
half hours.

2 Cause Of Causes 

Irish raider would be all the rage if he gets in the race, since he was the 
easiest winner at the Cheltenham Festival last month. But he needs 16 
withdrawals if he’s to make the list of 40 runners and that seems unlikely.

3 Ruby’s choice 

Ruby Walsh <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ruby-walsh> has won two 
Nationals but has yet to make up his mind who he will ride this time. The most 
fancied runners aren’t available, even to him, so his best option might be 
Boston Bob, now a 33-1 shot.

4 Richard Johnson 

Finally on his way to being champion jockey after decades in the shadow of AP 
McCoy. The National is the last big race he has yet to win, his 19 losing rides 
being the most of any jockey that hasn’t won it. He is expected to be on 
Kruzhlinin at 25-1.

5 Willie Mullins 

Trying to be the first jumps trainer for 60 years to win the British title 
from Ireland. His many runners atAintree 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/aintree> this week will include three or 
four in the National, which he won in 2005. Despite all his success, he hasn’t 
won a British handicap chase since that day.
