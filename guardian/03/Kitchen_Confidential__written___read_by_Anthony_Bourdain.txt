 If it doesn't succeed in deterring anyone from a catering career, Bourdain's 
funny, raw depiction of restaurant kitchen hell will surely get the queasier 
diner barfing. His tips - don't eat fish on Mondays because it's been breeding 
bacteria in the fridge since Thursday, shun hollandaise sauce and mussels, and 
don't even think of cut-price sushi - are superfluous after his horrible 
descriptions of the psychos and deviants he has slaved with "on the line" in a 
27-year whirl of nosheries from triple-starred to guzzlehouse. Behind the baize 
doors, they all sound the same: sweatshops where mutilated junkies trade 
insults and can be fired at the drop of a carrot. Respect for his comrades and 
passion for his art surge from Bourdain's highly flavoured prose delivered at a 
rollicking boil, which gives a good idea of what a dynamo he must be at the 
chopping board. He didn't invent the laughing-and-barfing genre, but it's a 
dish he does exquisitely.
