Plans are afoot in Iran to produce a riposte to Ben Affleck's Oscar-nominated 
movie Argo, which depicts a CIA attempt to rescue six Americans from Tehran 
duing the 1979 hostage crisis,according to reports 
<http://tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/104722-iran-to-produce-movie-to-respond-argo>
.

Director Ataollah Salmanian told the Iranian news agency MNA that he was 
working on a film to be called The General Staff, and which "should be an 
appropriate response to the ahistoric film Argo". Ever since its premiere in 
the US in October 2012, Argo has been viewed with disfavour by the Iranian 
establishment, and Salmanian hopes to secure funding from the Art Bureau wing 
of the Islamic Ideology Dissemination Organisation.

Meanwhile, Affleck confirmed that his own follow-up to the otherwise 
well-received Argo will be an adaptation of Dennis Lehane's 20s-set crime novel
Live by Night <http://collider.com/ben-affleck-live-by-night-focus/223096/>, 
about mobsters during the Prohibition era.

Affleck has already adapted another Lehane novel, Gone Baby Gone, and, as with 
Argo, may take the lead role as well as direct. As a result of taking on the 
project, Affleck has had to drop out of acting opposite Kristen Stewart in the 
con-artist drama Focus.

Affleck was also surprisingly passed over for a best director nomination for 
the Academy Awards, which were announced on Thursday, but can comfort himself 
with Argo's double win at the Critic's Choice movie awards. Argo took best 
picture and Affleck best director. Silver Linings Playbook, however, won most, 
with four: best acting ensemble, best comedy, best actor and actress in comedy.
