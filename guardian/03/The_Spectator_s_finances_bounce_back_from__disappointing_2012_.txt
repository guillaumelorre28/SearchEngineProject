The Spectator <https://www.theguardian.com/media/the-spectator> appears to 
have bounced back from what its chairman, Andrew Neil, calls "a disappointing 
2012 financially."

According to his statement today, released to coincide with a filing to 
Companies House of accounts for the year up to 31 December 2012, the magazine 
suffered an operating loss of just over £500,000 before exceptionals.

He continued: "This reflected substantial digital developments costs, which do 
not need to be repeated, and some digital wrong turns, which were expensive to 
rectify, but have been."

He said a new management team was now in place "which has corrected past 
mistakes and is already producing strong results in print and digital…

"Operating profits for the first half of 2013 are already £400,000, which 
amounts to a substantial and encouraging turnaround."

The Spectator, owned by the Telegraph Media Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/telegraphmediagroup> proprietors, David and 
Frederick Barclay, has been edited since August 2009 by Fraser Nelson.

In the final six months of 2012, its audited print sale was 63,613 a week, of 
which 55,802 were paid-for copies.
