 Black Friday in Britain 
Mayhem and scuffles broke-out in supermarkets on Black Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/black-friday> – an American import where 
shops have promotional offers on the day after Thanksgiving – as it descended 
on the British high street. Sales were estimated at around £360,000 a minute on 
credit cards.


Perhaps the most quintessentially British comment was from Christine Ball, 62, 
who wasn’t impressed. “I got here at 10.15pm and I’m further back now than when 
I got here,” she said. “None of that lot know what a queue is.”

Eight out of 10 fresh chickens bought from UK supermarkets this summer were 
contaminated with the potentially lethal food-poisoning bug campylobacter, and 
leading food expertProfessor Tim Lang 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/27/chicken-contamination-public-should-stop-buying-poultry>
 has called for a boycott of supermarket chicken because of “scandalous” levels 
of contamination. Asda was the worst-performing retailer, with 78% of its 
chickens testing positive for campylobacter, followed by Co-op (73%), and then 
Morrison’s, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, all on 69%, with Marks & Spencer showing 
an incidence of 67% and Tesco the best at 64%.

messages

The Intelligence and Security Committee this week released a 200-page report 
into the murder of fusilier Lee Rigby in 2014. Here’s what the report found:

 * It accused internet companies of providing “a safe haven for terrorists” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-547460d2e4b012ac8415b192>
 and stated that an unnamed company –which the Guardian understands is Facebook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-5474b4f3e4b0bf2ade60cdb4>
 – should have done more to alert authorities to extremist messages posted by 
killer Michael Adebowale. 
 * Security agencies could not have prevented the murder, despite the two 
killers having appeared in seven separate investigations. 
 * The report identified “errors” by MI5 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-5474676de4b08fbd11e1acd1>
. 
Responding to the report, the prime minister, David Cameron, said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-547478d6e4b05735abcbf3bf>
 the government would commit an extra £130m over the next two years to monitor 
and disrupt so-called “lone wolf” terrorists.

case in London. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA 
Andrew Mitchell, the former Conservative cabinet minister, has lost his high 
court libel trial over whether he used the word pleb in an argument with a 
police officer at Downing Street. The long-running Plebgate saga, as it came to 
be known, which began in September 2012 whenMitchell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrew-mitchell>, the former chief whip, 
got into a row with police officers in Downing Street and was accused of 
calling the officer a pleb. Mr Justice Mitting ruled that Mitchell did use the 
“politically toxic” word during the row. The ruling leaves him facing an 
estimated legal bill of £1.5m and his political career in tatters.

Nigel Farage’s local Ukip branch rebuked the BBC for holding a straw poll on 
the party leader in front of a mosque in London – in fact, the building was 
actually Westminster Cathedral. A twitter trend, #ThingsThatAreNotMosques 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThingsThatAreNotMosques?src=hash> then ensued.

Mirrors could replace air conditioning
 When the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a specific wavelength of 
infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space. 
Photograph: Photograph: Fan Lab, Stanford Engineering 
Researchers have created a mirror that reflects 97% of light and also radiates 
heat into the cold depths of the universe, which can be used to replace 
air-conditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth. This is a lot of 
potential energy saving: around 15% of the energy used by buildings in the US 
goes on air conditioning.
