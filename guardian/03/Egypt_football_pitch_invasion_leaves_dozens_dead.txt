At least 73 people were killed and 1,000 injured on Wednesday after a football 
pitch invasion in the Egyptian city of Port Said in an incident that one player 
described as "a war, not football".

"It is the biggest disaster in Egypt's soccer history," the country's deputy 
health minister told state television.

Violence at football matches across north Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> has increased significantly since 
political unrest sweeping across the region began more than a year ago.

Wednesday's trouble flared at the end of a match when Port Said team Al-Masry 
beat Al-Ahly, one of Egypt's most successful clubs, 3-1.

Live television footage showed fans running onto the field and chasing 
Al-Ahly's players. A small group of riot police formed a corridor to try to 
protect the players, but they appeared overwhelmed and fans were still able to 
kick and punch the players as they fled.

"This is not football. This is a war and people are dying in front of us. 
There is no movement and no security and no ambulances," Al-Ahly player Mohamed 
Aboutrika told his club's television channel.

"I call for the league to be cancelled. This is a horrible situation and today 
can never be forgotten."

State television reported that Egypt's football federation had indefinitely 
delayed premier league matches.

Another match in Cairo was halted by the referee after receiving news of the 
violence in Port Said, prompting fans to set parts of the stadium on fire.
