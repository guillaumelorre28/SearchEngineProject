Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are poised to make 
a £30m bid for the Brazilian midfielder Willian as the club's pursuit of a 
high-profile summer signing goes on.

Willian moved to Anzhi Makhachkala from Shakhtar Donetsk during the last 
transfer window

, also for £30m, having played a key role in helping the Ukrainian club reach 
the last-16 stage of last season's Champions League. But having played only 17 
times for Anzhi in all competitions since, he has been put up for sale, along 
with the rest of his team-mates, as part of the Russian club's attempt to cut 
costs.

The 25-year-old, who has two caps, is predominately a left-sided player but 
can play on either flank or in a more advanced attacking position.

Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, is keen to sign a creative player and 
is believed to have targeted Willian having been frustrated earlier in the 
summer when the No1 target Henrikh Mkhitaryan turned down the chance to move 
from Shakhtar and instead opted to join Champions League runners-up Borussia 
Dortmund.

Willian would represent the type of big-statement signing Rodgers is keen to 
secure before the close of the transfer window having spent around £24m on Kolo 
Touré, Simon Mignolet, Iago Aspas and Luis Alberto.

The purchase could also help Rodgers in his attempts to persuade Luis Suárez 
to remain at Liverpool after the Uruguayanpublicly stating to the Guardian last 
week his desire to leave the club

. Liverpool's principal owner, John W Henry,reacted by stating the player would 
not be allowed to move on

 but such an outcome remains far from guaranteed.
