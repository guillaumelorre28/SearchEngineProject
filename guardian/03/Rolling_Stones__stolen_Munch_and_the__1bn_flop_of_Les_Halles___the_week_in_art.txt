of their ideas from the likes of Keith Arnatt and Bruce McLean.

 Apollo pursuing Daphne, 1617-1618, by Domenichino.
 Photograph: Getty/Heritage Images/National Gallery 
This wall painting, transferred to canvas to hang in the National Gallery, was 
originally frescoed by the baroque master Domenichino and his team in a grand 
chamber called the Room of Apollo in the Villa Aldobrandini near Rome. Most of 
the frescoes in the cycle depict myths about the Greek god Apollo and this 
tells the most moving of all – how he fell in love with Daphne who turned into 
a tree to avoid his advances. In the same years that Domenichino painted this 
delicate version of the story,Bernini sculpted it

 in sensual, shocking marble.
