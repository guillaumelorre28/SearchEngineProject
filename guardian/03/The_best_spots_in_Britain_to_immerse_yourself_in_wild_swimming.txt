Outdoor swimming can – and should – be a year-round pleasure. And now is the 
perfect time to make a start. January is a terrible month to try and muster 
willpower: too dark and cold. But start swimming now – when the sun has had a 
chance to warm our rivers and lakes – and the momentum can take you through to 
next summer.

Four years ago, I decided to swim right around the calendar. As the leaves 
fell and I stared suspiciously at the brown swimming pond in my local park, an 
older woman in rubber hat and neoprene gloves climbed casually down the ladder 
and into the water. Her strategy, she told me later, over a foot bowl of warm 
water, had been to simply keep swimming, at least once a week, for as long as 
she could bear it. Come rain, snow or wind, she walked down, stripped off, had 
a plunge and headed home again – just to see how long she would manage. Before 
she knew it, summer had arrived and she had done an entire year. As the Outdoor
Swimming <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/swimming> Society puts it, 
“It is easier to start your swimming career in spring or summer, at 16C and 
above, and then keep on swimming as the temperature drops.”

As long as you stay acclimatised, by swimming at least once a week all year 
round, your body will adapt to the drop in temperature. The stress reaction to 
cold water – the breathlessness, the shivering, the need to pee, the raised 
heart rate – all reduce in intensity the more often you swim outdoors. In 
March, the sea feels less cold to me than it would to someone who hadn’t been 
in since June.

Not many of us have the choice of river, lake, pond or sea in which to wild 
swim, but one of these, at least, is never far away. The sea will always be the 
warmest, while a high, fast-moving stream or deep dark lake, can be shockingly 
cold. I prefer rivers for the views. But once you’ve broken the taboo of wild 
swimming, you quickly find that you can get in anywhere. I have swum in the 
Thames by London’s Hammersmith Bridge, in the chip-scented sea off Barry Island 
in south Wales, in a river next to a light industrial unit on Wallasea Island, 
Essex, and in many city parks, watched by bemused tourists. The world’s your 
oyster, if you’re just prepared to get a bit wet.

Five ways to keep the habit going

1. Get the right kit

The feel of freezing water washing across your skin can be agony, but it is 
easily avoided. Among my best investments are a pair of neoprene swimming socks 
and wetsuit gloves. Not only will you be able to swim for twice as long but 
once you get out, you won’t freeze. I have strolled across pebbles in Dorset 
and through thick Essex mud without a care.

2. Take someone with you 

While it’s lovely to have someone there to pass you a towel and some socks, 
the priority is safety. Someone should be there checking that you haven’t got 
into trouble. Although we are free of sharks and crocodiles, there are still 
the dangers of strong currents, tides, temperature and visibility – so always 
swim in company. Get out the moment you feel sleepy or too cold, and know how 
to get out before you get in.

3. Appreciate the view

It’s easy to get distracted by the strong physical sensations of cold-water 
swimming, especially in the early days. But it’s worth trying to take in your 
surroundings from a whole different perspective. Look up at the sky, listen to 
the birds and enjoy the view. Those are the memories that will stay with you 
far longer than the shivers.

4. Layer up

Once you get out, make sure you warm up as quickly as possible. If possible, 
take a warm shower or stand in a tub of warm water – but don’t heat your body 
up too quickly. Always try to put on at least one more layer than you were 
wearing before you went into the water, pack an extra jumper, and don’t forget 
a hat to keep your head warm.

5. Don’t overdo it

There have been days in the last few years when all I could manage was to jump 
in, swim a couple of strokes, then get out and start eating flapjacks. This 
isn’t a competition. You don’t need to go any further or stay in any longer 
than you want to. A couple of seconds of liberated splashing is better than 
nothing at all.

 Sharrah Pool. Photograph: underwaterpics.co.uk 
Trek upstream into ancient oak woodland following the course of the river 
Dart, plunging in a series of natural jacuzzis along the way. Pass Horseshoe 
Falls, Wellsfoot Island and Bell Pool to arrive at the legendary Sharrah pool. 
Do the “Sharrah Chute”, which involves climbing on to Elephant Rock,and then 
jumping out into the current and getting swept away in the churning rapids. 
Just down from the cascade, you zoom through a rectangular channel, with walls 
of granite, before the pool opens out into a vast oval.

Island swims: Loch an Eilein, Rothiemurchus, Scotland 

Rising from the waters of Loch an Eilein is an island with a ruined, ivy-clad 
castle. It is incredibly picturesque, and the perfect swimming destination if 
you’re looking for splendid isolation and romantic settings – so long as you 
pack your wetsuit (it’s freezing). The 600-year-old castle fell into disuse 
several hundred years ago. Although the castle is only 100m from the shore, the 
backdrop of the Cairngorms rises thousands of metres high. Where the castle 
wall meets the water there is a small doorway, which you can go through. 
Inside, the old hall is complete with a tumbledown fireplace and trees growing 
through the roof.

The river Waveney is the southernmost and most beautiful of the Norfolk 
Broads, and was the local river of the late Roger Deakin, father of wild 
swimming. Outney common is one of the best places to explore, with excellent 
access for more than a mile. You can also hire canoes.

This dramatic gorge is surrounded by thick woodland and has a secret waterfall 
with large plunge pool, once admired by Victorian travellers but now well off 
the tourist track. The adventurous might like to find the ruined medieval 
bridge with more amazing pools upstream by 500m.

Swimming from Cellar beach up the Yealm estuary to the Ship Inn in Noss Mayo 
is enormous fun. It’s about 1½ miles, but an incoming tide helps swoosh you 
upstream. It’s a bit like flying as you whizz over the seabed below. You may 
see shoals of sand eel, as well as bass and mullet. Wear a bright swimming cap 
so you can be seen by the many boats in the estuary.
