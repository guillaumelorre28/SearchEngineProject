You'd think it natural that writers would be good at Twitter – after all, 
words are their bread and butter. However, some authors have found themselves 
host to extremely boring feeds, or have misread the medium altogether, never 
quite understanding what a "mention" is, or abit.ly <https://bitly.com/> link. 
It's a sad state of affairs when politicians are better at Twitter than 
literature's experts.


There are, however, a bunch of authors who have perfected their Twitter 
presence, in some cases earning millions of followers to go with that prized 
blue tick.Margaret Atwood <https://twitter.com/MargaretAtwood> and Neil Gaiman 
<https://twitter.com/neilhimself> are the leading examples, but here we offer 
10 alternatives whose tweets make our hearts sing.

Gary Shteyngart <https://twitter.com/Shteyngart> 

The American-Russian author of brilliant comic novels such as The Russian 
Debutante's Handbook 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Russian_Debutante's_Handbook> is just as much 
fun on Twitter. Fond of selfies documenting his travels, Shteyngart's current 
timeline features aphotograph of him kissing a koala bear 
<https://twitter.com/marykarrlit/status/469875134179057664> (he's in Australia 
right now). There is alsoa Tumblr collection of his famous blurbs 
<http://shteyngartblurbs.tumblr.com/>. Occasionally guilty of retweeting his 
own praise, but hey, nobody's perfect.

Teju Cole <https://twitter.com/tejucole>

Cole is a master of Twitter – he mixes brilliant bon mots, vignettes of 
poetry, art, pop culture references, photography (like this series on 
celebrities watching themselves on television 
<https://twitter.com/tejucole/status/470602720445886465>) and quotes to make 
his timeline an always entertaining read. TheOpen City 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teju_Cole#Open_City> writer has the form nailed. 
Follow.

Joyce Carol Oates <https://twitter.com/JoyceCarolOates>

JCO is one of literature's leading voices who has managed to bring her wit and 
wisdom to the internet. I've picked her over Margaret Atwood asAtwood's feed 
<https://twitter.com/MargaretAtwood>, though great, veers slightly too much 
towards local interest – if you're not living in either Toronto, Ottawa or 
Vancouver, a lot of it will be irrelevant.


JCO, on the other hand, is superb at a timely one-liner on whichever news 
story is currently doing the rounds. She's also good at selecting quotes and 
distilling political opinion. Plus she's very funny, and retweetsstuff like this

Paulo Coelho <https://twitter.com/paulocoelho>

Racking up a formidable 9.22 million followers, Coelho is a Twitter behemoth. 
Fond of a vintage-filtered photograph (see below), his tweets range from 
football (his picture with Ronaldo 
<https://twitter.com/paulocoelho/status/470001643938140161>), to quotes from 
philosophers, to retweets of news from the literary world. He also tweets in 
Portuguese and has just joined VK.com, the Russian version of Facebook.

Joe Dunthorne <https://twitter.com/joedunthorne>

The critically acclaimed Submarine 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_(novel)> author excels at tweeting. Not 
only is he a wonderful purveyor of the one-liner, he also retweets stuff as 
good as his own hilariously on-point observations. He's basically very good at 
seeking out the best shareable humour on the internet,like this average 
guitarist classified advert 
<https://twitter.com/joedunthorne/status/425220499812016128>. He doesn't tend 
to tweet articles or news sources, preferring to keep it pop.

Jackie Collins <https://twitter.com/jackiejcollins>

Jackie Collins's Twitter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> 
stream is exactly as you'd expect it to be. She spells pics "pix" and poses at 
events with a smile buried in lipstick. She never uses just the one exclamation 
mark!!! 99% of her tweets are just links to her Facebook page!!!

Like Cher <https://twitter.com/cher>, WHO TWEETS IN ALL CAPS, Jackie is worth 
following for the LOLZ. Oh, and she likes R'n'B crooner Usher.

Sloane Crosley <https://twitter.com/askanyone>

Sloane Crosley is the author of two brilliant essay collections, I Was Told 
There'd Be Cake <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Was_Told_There%27d_Be_Cake> and 
How Did You Get This Number. (She also wrotethis piece on insomnia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/19/sloane-crosley-struggles-insomnia?CMP=twt_gu>
 for the Guardian last week). Tweeting from NYC, her feed is a witty stream of 
perfectly expressed thoughts on creativity and productivity, friends and her 
mum. Even the notes in her iPhone are worth reading.

Alain de Botton <https://twitter.com/alaindebotton>

The writer, philosopher and TV presenter is sometimes serious, sometimes 
light-hearted: either way, his feed is always interesting. He alsotweets a lot 
of art <https://twitter.com/alaindebotton/status/462697590203494400> and 
photography, and links to many articles. Crap profile picture though.

Irvine Welsh <https://twitter.com/WelshIrvine>

From tweets about his beloved Hibernian FC 
<http://www.hibernianfc.co.uk/page/Welcome> to music, travel and the state of 
journalism: Welsh's feed is bound to throw up something of interest. He also 
owns the best T-shirt in the world, a mash-up of Joy Division's Unknown 
Pleasures sleeve artwork and cats. He tweeted ithere 
<https://twitter.com/WelshIrvine/status/468508796470325248>. Too many retweets, 
though, and not enough original Welsh.

Augusten Burroughs <https://twitter.com/augusten>


Aside from the fact his profile picture shows him covering half his face with 
his hand (yo, Augusten, that's not how a portrait works), Burroughs is very 
good at Twitter. He mixes retweets of other people's funnies (especiallythe 
brilliant Julieanne Smolinski <https://twitter.com/BoobsRadley>) with his own 
one-liners. Then he just adds a load of weird stuff in,like this, for example 
<https://twitter.com/CrapTaxidermy/status/468484206050697216>.
