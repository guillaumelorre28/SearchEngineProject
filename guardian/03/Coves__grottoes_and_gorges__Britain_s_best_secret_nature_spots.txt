Giant caves/grottoes

Cathedral cavern, Langdale, Lake District

It can take a while to find the entrance among the mossy boulders and steep 
woodland, but underneath, at 12m (40ft) high, there’s a space large enough to 
swallow a church. This was a thriving Langdale slate mine in the 19th century, 
but it fell into disuse during the first world war when men left for the front, 
and did not return. Now, a substantial network of tunnels remains. Nothing 
really prepares you for the sense of space when you first see the cavern, yet 
it is one of many extraordinary mine caverns in Cumbria, cut by hand hundreds 
of years ago.

Best approached from the Three Shires Inn <http://www.threeshiresinn.co.uk/>, 
Little Langdale (LA22 9NZ, threeshiresinn.co.uk, 015394 37215), and the 
footpath via Slater’s Bridge, a 25-minute walk. If you get hooked by the cavern 
bug, you could check out nearby Parrock and Hodge Close quarries, and 
Tilberthwaite area.

 Spot the cove ... Photograph: Picasa 
The best secret coves are reached by rope or hidden tunnels. Between Woody Bay 
and Lee Sands is one of the best discoveries on this wild Exmoor cliff 
coastline. Route through a hedge tunnel for 20m, then descend a path with the 
help of rope and cables, to find an amazing sand beach completely invisible 
from above.

From Lee Bay (EX35 6JN), follow the coast path to the west side of Crock 
Point, for 10 minutes. About 100m beyond the apex, there is a gap in the hedge.

 Tolkien land ... The ruins of Fussell iron works, which closed in 1894. 
Photograph: Picasa 
Discover a world that time forgot. This complex of overgrown chambers, mill 
buildings, workers’ cottages, pumping stations and rusting hydraulics west of 
Frome was one of the country’s most successful ironworks, producing scythes, 
sickles and other agricultural implements. Now, the great works lie derelict 
and wreathed in ivy.


Leave Mells (BA11 3PE) on the Great Elm road and find an iron gate and 
footpath after 300m on the right. Follow the stream for 15 minutes.

 Named after the Norse word for dragon: Worm’s Head 
Cross to a tidal island (connected by a natural or man-made causeway) for a 
true sense of escape. This serpent-shaped promontory is the most westerly tip 
of Gower. Reach the Devil’s Bridge and find the hidden cave at the very far 
end, but return before the tide rises. This was a favourite retreat of writer 
Dylan Thomas, though on one occasion he fell asleep, became stranded by the 
tides and spent a night alone and terrified, surrounded by the rising waters.


Head off from the Worm’s Head café (SA3 1PP, thewormshead.co.uk, 01792 390512) 
or walk round via the little-known beaches of Mewslade and Fall.

 Home to some of the most ancient trees in Britain. Photograph: Daniel Start 
Venture into primeval woodland at the Thicks, Staverton, home to contorted 
oaks and giant hollies. This remote forest contains some of the most ancient 
trees in Britain, several more than 1,000 year old: gnarled, twisted, 
contorted, many are hollow, others draped with ivy. If the wood sprites exist, 
you will find them here.


Half a mile south-west of Butley (IP12 3PU) on the B1084.

 Like descending into Jonah’s whale … Hell Gill. Photograph: Picasa 
The natural limestone landscape of the Yorkshire Dales creates a world of 
mysterious gills and gorges, deep within the rock. Near Garsdale Head station 
on the moors, you can descend through Hell Gill – a 400m-long slot canyon. Only 
a few yards wide, it’s like a faultline opened up by an earthquake. The water 
gushes in narrow chasms, and the pools below are heard rather than seen.


From the Moorcock Inn, LA10 5PU, 01969 667488, follow B6259 north. After 2.5 
miles, at the Cumbria border sign, turn right on to the track and the gill is 
above the farm and woodland.
