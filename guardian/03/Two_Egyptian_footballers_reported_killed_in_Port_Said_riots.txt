Two Egyptian footballers are reported to be among 27 people killed in riots in 
Port Said, the director of hospitals in Egypt's Mediterranean city has said.

Violence erupted in Port Said after a judge sentenced 21 people to death in 
connection with disturbances last February in which 74 fans of the Cairo-based 
Al-Ahly club died.

Dr Abdel-Raham Farah said Mahmoud Abdel-Halim al-Dizawi, who played for Port 
Said's Al-Marikh club, died after being shot three times.

He added that Tamer al-Fahla, a former player for the city's main Al-Masry 
team, was also shot dead on his way to the Al-Marikh club.

The club is based near a prison that residents tried to storm on Saturday to 
free defendants in the trial. The military has been deployed to try to restore 
security.
