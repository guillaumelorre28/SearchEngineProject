A Police Federation official accused of giving a misleading account of a 
meeting with Plebgate row MPAndrew Mitchell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrew-mitchell> has been found guilty of 
breaching standards of professional behaviour.

But a West Mercia police misconduct panel decided not to impose a sanction on 
Insp Ken Mackaill after clearing him of acting dishonestly during the furore in 
2012.

A panel chaired by an assistant chief constable from Lincolnshire police ruled 
that Mackaill’s breach of professional standards amounted to misconduct rather 
than gross misconduct.

The hearing centred around comments made by the officer – the then chairman of 
the West Mercia police federation – shortly before Mitchell’s resignation as a 
government chief whip three years ago.

Addressing the media outside the Sutton Coldfield MP’s constituency office on 
12 October 2012, Mackaill called for Mitchell to resign and claimed the 
politician had “refused to elaborate” on what happened during a verbal exchange 
with police officers in Downing Street.

Commenting after the disciplinary hearing, DS Gary Watson, the head of 
professional standards for Warwickshire police and West Mercia police, said: 
“This matter has been the subject of the most intense scrutiny and the due 
process has been concluded.

“The force accepts the decision of the panel.” 

The Independent Police Complaints Commission 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ipcc> (IPCC) ruled in July that Mackaill 
and a Warwickshire police federation official should face disciplinary action 
after a recording of their meeting with Mitchell was broadcast by Channel 4’s 
Dispatches programme.
