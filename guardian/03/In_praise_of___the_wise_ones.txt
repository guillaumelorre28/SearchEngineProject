Coincidence from time to time reminds us that we are but Lilliputian, and that 
a race of giants went before.This Friday 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_22> is the 50th anniversary of the 
deaths ofJohn F Kennedy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy>, Aldous 
Huxley <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley> and CS Lewis 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis>, as well as the centenary of 
Benjamin Britten <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Britten>. Reputations 
may fluctuate, but the great composer, the near great president, and the two 
English intellectuals in search of spiritual enlightenment had some things in 
common. They all confronted what is evil in mankind and they all offered a 
message of hope. The deaths of John the Savage in Huxley's Brave New World, of 
Billy Budd in Britten's opera, and of Aslan in Lewis's Narnia parable for 
children were all sacrifices that implied the possibility of redemption. In the 
real world, Kennedy faced the spectre of nuclear war and played his part in 
saving us from evil on a scale we cannot even now wholly fathom. In their 
different ways they were wise â€“ and we still need their wisdom.
