Alaska's moon rocks from the 1969 Apollo 11 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/apollo-11-moon-landing> mission are back 
in the 49th state after going missing for nearly 40 years. They had been 
displayed at an Anchorage transportation museum in 1973 when an arsonist 
torched theÂ building.

The tiny rocks, originally presented to state officials by then president 
Richard Nixon, had disappeared until late 2010 when the foster son of the 
museum director, Coleman Anderson, claimed he had rescued them from rubble 
destined for a landfill. He subsequently sued to claim ownership.

State officials were sceptical of the story and countersued. Assistant 
Attorney General Stephen Slotnick says evidence collected in the case persuaded 
Anderson to relinquish his claim. The stones are encased in acrylic glass and 
mounted in a walnut plaque.

The rocks will be shown at the state museum in Juneau this month before being 
displayed elsewhere around the state. Apollo 11 landed the first humans, Neil 
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, on the moon on 20 July 1969. Armstrong was the first 
to walk on the lunar surface.
