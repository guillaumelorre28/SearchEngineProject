Gasan Magomedov, a 20-year-old midfielder for the Russian club Anzhi 
Makhachkala <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anzhi-makhachkala>, has been 
shot and killed near his home in the volatile North Caucasus.

In a statement, Anzhi said Magomedov had been driving near his home on 
Saturday night when his car was hit by machine-gun fire. He died while being 
taken to hospital. No arrests have been made and the motive for the attack is 
unclear.

Magomedov was a regular for Anzhi’s youth and reserve teams.

The Russian region of Dagestan, where the attack took place, has a 
long-running Islamist insurgency.

Anzhi challenged for the Russian title in recent years but were relegated to 
the second tier last season. For several years,it had a policy of basing star 
players – such as Samuel Eto’o, now with Everton – in Moscow

 to avoid Dagestan’s security risks.
