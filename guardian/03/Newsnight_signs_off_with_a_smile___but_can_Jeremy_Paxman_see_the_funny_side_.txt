Ex newspaperman Ian Katz's first significant contribution to his newly adopted 
medium as Newsnight editor appears to be ... resurrecting the And Finally 
tradition. FollowingEmily Maitlis's encounter with Cookie Monster on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/08/bbc2-bbc>, on Wednesday 
Newsnight signed off with a BBC1+1 gag (bear with us ... ). So viewers were 
shown what was supposedly going on in the studio an hour earlier –Andrew Neil 
cleaning the camera andJeremy Paxman sweeping the floor 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTPwyITNfr0&feature=youtu.be>. Paxo, bless 'im, 
couldn't help but introduce the item with his usual languid disdain – "always 
looking to please the boss ... " (a reference to his new editor? Or BBC DG Tony 
Hall? You decide ... ). Monkey looks forward to Newsnight's 21st century take on
the Skateboarding Duck <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding_duck>.
