Chelsea have completed the signing of Samuel Eto'o from Anzhi Makhachkala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anzhi-makhachkala> on a one-year contract 
worth £4m a year.

The 32-year-old striker, who played under José Mourinho at Internazionale, 
told theChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> website: "I am 
very happy to be here but also anxious because I want to get playing as soon as 
possible.

"It wasn't a hard decision. I saw the qualities Chelsea have and I was very 
happy with José Mourinho before, so when the opportunity came, I was very happy 
to take it."

Eto'o became Chelsea's preferred target after their pursuit of Manchester 
United's Wayne Rooney foundered
