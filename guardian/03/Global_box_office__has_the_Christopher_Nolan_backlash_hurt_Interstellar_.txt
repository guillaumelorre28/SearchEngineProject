The winner

Hype and hubris have damaged Interstellar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/interstellar>. If it had been the true event 
movie its press and marketing set it up as, it would have beaten animationBig 
Hero 6 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/big-hero-6> to the US top spot. 
Instead, $46.7m makes it director Christopher Nolan’s weakest opening since 
2006’sThe Prestige <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-prestige>. The 
reasons: a November release that preps the film for awards season, but remote 
from the big-money summer slots; the 169-minute run time; and a fortnight of 
intensive press coverage designed to butter up Nolan’s reputation as the 
mainstream king of our times, but which has sown the seeds of a backlash.


 Overseas box-office takings of $82.9m (£52.3m) looks like an ample 
makeweight, containing the expected array of No 1 openings, including a beefy 
$14.1m in South Korea that puts it in the country’s top 10 highest ever. But 
considering the scale of the rollout – 63 territories – $83m is middling for a 
film that thinks it belongs in the A-league. The two films in the year’s 
current top five that opened lower overseas – Guardians of the Galaxy ($66.4m 
from 32 markets) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($75.2m from 27 
markets) – would have easily beaten Interstellar if they’d set up shop in an 
equivalent number of territories. In terms of November openings, Interstellar 
is short of something likeThe Matrix Revolutions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/95856/matrix.revolutions>, whose 
initial overseas take was $117.6m in 2003 – though franchise branding surely 
played a part there.

 The film-show team review Interstellar 
Bluntly put, Interstellar opted to play high stakes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/10/big-hero-6-interstellar-us-box-office>
, leveraging a massive opening at an off-peak time of year on the back of 
Nolan’s august reputation. The danger is that the film hasn’t lived up to it, 
and that drop-off could now be steep, with China (12 Nov) and Japan (22 Nov) 
the only major markets in reserve.Gravity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gravity>, Interstellar’s main autumn-release 
comparison point, opened fairly quietly abroad ($28.4m), but a gradually 
widening rollout saw word-of-mouth about its groundbreaking visuals build that 
figure week by week. In its favour, Interstellar has been tracking strongly 
among the over-25s who might watch the film at their leisure in the coming 
weeks. But it seems unlikely to kindle Gravity’s repeat-business spark, which 
took it to $716.4m worldwide, or to match Nolan’s $825.5m forInception 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/inception> in 2010. $500m-ish looks like a 
better bet. Fun historical fact: Interstellar’s mothership film2001: A Space 
Odyssey <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001-a-space-odyssey> managed close 
to that just in US domestic on its original release, if you correct for 
inflation ($56.9m/$389.2m adjusted).


The runner-up
 Cute challenger Big Hero 6. Photograph: Disney/LFI/Photoshot 
Disney can be proud of more than just keeping Interstellar in its rear-view 
mirror. Its new animation, Big Hero 6, is its second-best non-Pixar opening 
($56.2m), behind the all-conquering Frozen, which built on a 
good-but-not-spectacular $67.4m start to become the most successful animated 
film ever. Big Hero 6,the 23rd best debut for a CGI animation 
<http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=computeranimation.htm&sort=opengross&order=DESC&p=.htm>
, draws on the back catalogue of Marvel characters the studio now has at its 
disposal for its tale of prodigy Hiro Hamada, his inflatable robot sidekick, 
and the superhero squad they assemble. Looking at Big Hero 6’s wider prospects,
Frozen <https://www.theguardian.com/film/frozen>’s $1.27bn worldwide gross is 
probably setting the bar too high. But if the film can connect even half as 
much in Japan – to whom its anime stylings are surely beckoning – then 
$500m-plus and a place in the yearly top 10 is eminently achievable. No 1 
openings this past weekend in the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia bode well 
for its Asian prospects, with Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore coming next 
frame, in advance of a long rollout stretching into 2015.

 Ben Affleck talks about Gone Girl 
David Fincher’s Gone Girl <https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl> has 
passed $300m globally, a testimony to undeniable staying power in the key 
developed-world territories most in tune with its modern-marriage autopsy, like 
the UK ($33.4m and counting), Australia ($20.7m), France and South Korea (where 
it rose by 6.5% on its second weekend).Fincher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/david-fincher> broke his own US domestic 
record some time ago, and is now within touching distance of a worldwide 
personal best, tantalisingly at hand with Japanese (12 Dec) and Italian (18 
Dec) bows to come. Not bad at all, considering Gone Girl doesn’t quite boast
Se7en 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,558621,00.html>
’s ($327.3m) shock factor (nor an emerging Brad Pitt) and, unlike the 
family-friendlyThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-curious-case-of-benjamin-button> 
($333.9m), is an 18 certificate. Pass those two, and Fincher will be nesting 
behind the far-more-expensive End of Tomorrow and Noah in the end-of-year list 
– perhaps the only non-youth/young adult title in the top 25.Life of Pi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/life-of-pi> ($609m, 11th place) and Wolf of 
Wall Street <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wolf-of-wall-street>($392m, 
17th place) managed a similar feat in 2012 and 2013.


The rest of the world

Three Chinese releases propped up the lower reaches of this week’s chart. 
K-pop idol Rain, previously seen in the Wachowski siblings’ Speed Racer and 
Ninja Assassin, made his Chinese film debut opposite Liu Yifei in rich-kids 
romanceFor Love or Money <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1sv-Iu6-Zg>. That 
brought in $4.8m, well behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, still lodged in 
that country’s top spot. Donnie Yen’sKung Fu Jungle 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0HP6S9vHr8> – also playing in Malaysia, 
Singapore, New Zealand and elsewhere – added another $4m (16th globally) to 
bring it to $14m; it seems destined to be minor Yen, unless it gets a US 
release, wheremartial arts reliably brings in the African-American crowd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/18/bruce-lee-films-black-audiences>
. Suspense thrillerThe Boundary Line 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWkLhQLdo88> crept in 17th globally, with 
$2.7m at the weekend; it follows a pair of men – one played byVincent Zhao 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Zhao>, who replaced Jet Li in the Once 
Upon a Time in China series – stumbling on a dark secret while tracking down 
missing loved ones.


The future

Interstellar pops out of the wormhole midweek in China, not only eager to 
reinforce Christopher Nolan’s international push, but also – as one of the 
country’s annual quota of 14 Imax/3D releases – top up this week’s $20.9m Imax 
takings (a November record). But cute things could plague it there, too: 
Madagascar spin-offPenguins of Madagascar 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjfID263ViI> opens early on the 14th to avoid 
the December local-film deluge, and the last Madagascar did a decent $31m in 
China. Johnnie To’s romantic comedy sequelDon’t Go Breaking My Heart 2 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT9diSL92ME> – a change from the director’s 
usual gangster fare – also enters the fray. The sole big international opening 
is the return of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as knuckle-dragging duo Lloyd 
Christmas and Harry Dunne inDumb and Dumber To 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/dumb-and-dumber-to>, unspooling in about 30 
markets, including the US. It’s been an unbelievable 20 years since the 
original: a test for the new franchise and for Carrey, who hasn’t fronted a 
major hit since 2003’s Bruce Almighty.
