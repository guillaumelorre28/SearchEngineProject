Welcome to day two of the Edinburgh international book festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/edinburgh-book-festival>. Before a big day 
that will include Alex Salmond and George RR Martin in the space of a few 
hours, Sunday delighted all with literary events that went from Alain de Botton 
to a fascinating Iranian-turned-Dutch writer. The weather turned all Scottish 
today, which was fair enough.

 The Guardian’s lovely deckchairs suffered the consequences:

... as did the bookshop, in that it was even fuller than usual, which is 
saying a lot:

But on to the real highlights.


Children had a blast

The Gruffalo made an appearance today, which excited the small ones and 
allowed us to deconstruct him:

My colleague Laura Kemp reports after attending the event:

A Scottish thread ran through children’s events too with the inclusion of 
Julia Donaldson <https://www.theguardian.com/books/julia-donaldson>’s Room on 
the Broom, translated into Scots by James Robertson, read alongside Julia’s new 
story ofThe Sacrecrow’s Wedding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/julia-donaldson-cigar-smoking-scarecrows-wedding>
 and the much-loved tale of theGruffalo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/jan/31/how-gruffalo-made>
.

Donaldson, with help from James, husband Malcolm, Axel Scheffler and an array 
of animal friends, entertained a packed theatre with stories, songs and 
illustrations.

Mark Brown reports:

Karl Ove Knausgaard – the buzz writer of the moment  
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/07/karl-ove-knausgaard-my-struggle-hari-kunzru>
– talked about Boyhood Island, the third book in his My Struggle series before 
a packed audience.

The six book project is clearly about himself but Knausgaard stressed that 
they were novels, not autobiographies. “This isn’t me telling stories from my 
life ... it is much more an exploration of a life, a much more existential 
thing for me – what is a life? How is it to be? What is it to be? I’m just 
using myself as an example.”

Clearly Knausgaard’s remote Norwegian childhood – with his ultra-strict 
alcoholic father and a mother who was there, but not really there – was not 
joy-filled. For anyone else who had a grim childhood he had crumbs of comfort. 
“I’m not sure that it is a good thing, having a happy childhood. It depends 
what you expect from life. If you expect harmony, balance, happiness then it’s 
good. But if you want something wild or something powerful....”

Iran meets the Netherlands meets India

Claire Armitstead hosted an event with Kader Abdollah, who turned out to 
deliver of the most delightful talks of the day. We will publish our Books 
Podcast with an interview with him very soon. Here is Claire:

One of the more select events of the day brought the Dutch Iranian writer 
Kader Abdollah together with the Indian poet, activist and first-time novelist 
Meena Kandasamy in a discussion of “Massacre and Modernity”. Kandasamy talked 
eloquently of the limitations the realist novel in the face of the slaughter of 
agricultural workers by landlords in rural India in the 1960s. Abdollah, whose 
novel The King was barely reviewed on publication in the UK, brought with him a 
fanclub from Italy, Austria and the Netherlands who were rewarded with a 
bravura rhetorical display that covered the evils of British colonialism, the 
arrival of electricity in 19th century Persia and his own hat-trick of failed 
attempts to escape Europe’s flattest country for the epic landcapes of the US. 
We’ll be bringing you a distillation of the conversation in Tuesday’s book 
festival podcast.

The Jesus and Mary Chain should be up there with the Sex Pistols

Such was the conclusion of the event by Zoë Howe, biographer of the cult 
Scottish band, in which she talked about the relationship between the Reid 
brothers, their rivalries and their relationship with alcohol. As promised, 
here isMark Brown’s report

Alain de Botton on why celebrity role models are OK, smartphones are not, and 
we should aspire to be more biased than the BBC

Philosopher and writer Alain de Botton’s latest work, The News: a User’s Manual
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/29/news-users-manual-alain-de-botton-review>
, is an exploration of contemporary media and the impact of the 24-hour news 
bombardment. Whether he offers much newis up for discussion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/09/the-news-alain-de-botton-digested-read>
, he is nothing if not quotable. Werounded up the highlights of his 
crowdpleasing event here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/10/alain-de-botton-in-quotes-the-news-promotes-a-toxic-society-of-envy>
.


Judith Kerr on whether creativity is inherited

Speaking of crowdpleasers, here is Laura again on Judith Kerr 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/judith-kerr> and Matthew Kneale’s event:

In the adults’ programme, happy childhood memories of stories resurfaced 
amongst both audience and speakers when acclaimed author and illustrator Judith 
Kerr was joined by her son Matthew Kneale to explore creative heritage.

Matthew, also a writer, explained how having writer parents meant he knew a 
career in writing was possible. He also confessed a childhood preference for 
stories told by his father, the screenwriter Nigel Kneale, who he described as 
a great teller of stories because he could do silly voices. However, both 
Matthew and the cross-generational audience evidently had huge affection for 
Judith and her work.

Judith revealed that, at 91, she is aiming to make a new picture book. 
Undoubtedly future generations will continue to fall in love with her stories 
and pictures.
