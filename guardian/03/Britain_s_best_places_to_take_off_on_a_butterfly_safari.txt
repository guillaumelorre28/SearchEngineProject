The purple emperor butterfly, a rather eccentric 1950s schoolmaster called Ian 
Heslop once declared, is the ultimate “big game”. A renowned collector, he 
boasted of catching as many emperors as he had shot elephants (four) but said 
that no exotic African beast gave him “so much joy as the seeing of my first 
emperor safely in the net”.

It is no longer acceptable to shoot elephants or catch purple emperors 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/05/purple-emperor-butterfly-patrick-barkham>
 but Heslop was on to something – the overlooked adrenal pleasure of a 
butterfly safari. Chasing butterflies, to photograph or simply to enjoy, may 
seem like a whimsical pastime but can be surprisingly thrilling.

Searching for something as small and elusive as a butterfly brings you alive 
to every possibility in the landscape, every movement around you.

Butterflying forces you to loiter. When you do, unexpected things happen: I’ve 
turned from admiringa black hairstreak

experiences.

Appearance


Males flash iridescent purple and are often spotted soaring above the largest 
oak trees in English woods on a hot summer’s morning. To spot them requires 
patience and fieldcraft because this butterfly is easily spooked by movement. 
It is often elusive, refusing to descend from its treetop home to feed on 
flowers like most butterflies do, but is occasionally tempted by muddy puddles, 
fox scat and even shrimp paste.

Spotting tips


To maximise your chances, get to a wood by 8.30am, spread shrimp paste 
(really) on a sunny track below some large oak trees, and sit still and wait. 
I’ve seen them like this at Fermyn Woods in Northamptonshire but Matthew Oates, 
the country’sleading emperor obsessive <http://apaturairis.blogspot.co.uk/>, 
says the best site in the country is now the rewilded Knepp Castle in Sussex. 
Knepp offers “butterfly safaris” with the incomparable Oates as your guide – 
it’s a brilliant day out.

Appearance


A spectacular yellow-and-black insect with fancy tails, looks more like an 
escapee from a tropical butterfly house than Britain’s biggest native 
butterfly. Vladimir Nabokov and Winston Churchill were both huge fans, and 
Churchill tried (unsuccessfully) to breed it in Chartwell, Kent.

Spotting tips

When you are searching for butterflies, think like a butterfly: most like the 
sunniest, sheltered spots, so seek these out. The swallowtail is also unusual 
in that it’s probably best seen from the water – electric boat trips are 
available the reserves listed below.Theswallowtail is now confined to the 
Norfolk Broads 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/11/continental-swallowtail-breeding-in-uk-for-first-time>
, where its caterpillars feed on a marshland plant called milk parsley. My 
favourite place to see it is feeding on pink flowers (for some reason, this 
butterfly is attracted to pink/purple blooms) in the water meadows of How Hill, 
a beautifully-sited arts and crafts house and nature reserve.

Appearance

When it’s sunny, these creatures whizz about in aerial combat so quickly, they 
can be hard to spot. The Chequered Skipper is a decent pub not far from Fermyn 
Woods and the pub’s name is a clue that this butterfly flew in central England. 
It vanished in 1976 and is now only found in the Highlands, around Fort 
William. It was only discovered here in the 1940s because it is not always easy 
to find a small, sun-loving insect in Scotland in May. This makes it an 
enjoyable challenge.


Spotting tips


I’ve made a successful safari to Glasdrum, a beautiful nature reserve with 
boggy, sheltered ancient woodland – perfect habitat. One year, I feared the 
worst: it was grey and cool (12C) but by standing patiently in the sheltered 
rough grassland beneath some telegraph wires on the reserve, I eventually saw 
one, equally motionless, on a blade of grass.

Spotting tips

The peak season is at the end of July, when both these species are flying 
alongside rare silver-spotted skippers and large, golden-coloured dark-green 
fritillaries. The North Downs, South Downs, Chilterns, Cotswolds and Poldens 
offer some superb butterflying. Choose a sunny day, take a picnic, and enjoy.

Scotland, but other burgeoning colonies include the Norfolk coast. May is a 
great time to see them – take aboat trip and spot seals on Blakeney Point

Puffin cruise


Visit the Amble puffin festival in Northumberland and take a boat to Coquet

thousand pairs of puffins mate and breed. 28 May-14 June.

Mayfly mayhem


Their adult life is over within a day, but the best time to spot them is in 
May. See them in the reed-grasses on the low banks of the river Ovington in 
Hampshire: it’s also a great place to see brown trout and salmon.

Bat safari


Go for a dusk visit to the National Trust’s Stackpole Court 
<http://nationaltrust.org.uk/stackpole> in Pembrokeshire to spot bats from 
Wales’s largest colony, hunting for maybugs at night.

Orchid hunting


The Victorians were keen on orchid hunting, and wealthy collectors would go on 
expeditions to find the rarest type. Closer to home, you can spot orchids in
Homefield wood <http://bbowt.org.uk/reserves/homefield-wood>, a grassland 
reserve in Buckinghamshire – look out for military, fly and greater butterfly 
orchids in particular.
