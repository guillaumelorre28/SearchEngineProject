Britain's largest pawnbroker has confirmed its interest in buying parts of 
rival Albemarle & Bond, as the battle for the failed gold dealer heats up.

In a statement noting "press speculation" H&T Group said it had made a 
proposal to Albemarle & Bond's administrators, PwC, to purchase some of the 
assets.

H&T will face competition from a consortium of private equity buyers led by 
former Bank of Scotland boss Sir Peter Burt, according toa report in the Sunday 
Times

(subscription). The City grandee has tabled an offer through his firm 
Promethean Investments, which is backed with cash by Rockbridge Growth Equity. 
The paper reported that Burt wished to keep the majority of the pawnbroker's 
183 stores and 900 employees.

No one at Promethean, or Apollo – another private equity group that is said to 
be considering backing the bid – was immediately available to comment.

Mike Jervis of PwC told the Sunday Times: "There has been a lot of interest in 
the company and we are optimistic of concluding a sale in April. Customers can 
be assured that every pledged item will be protected during this time." The 
administrator has said it would try to protect as many jobs, as it seeks to 
sell all or part of the business.

Albemarle & Bond called in the administrators late last month

, after lenders pulled the plug on a turnaround plan, leaving investors little 
chance of getting their money back.

The pawnbroker, which also offers payday loans, had extended rapidly during 
the economic downturn, but was caught out with too many stores when gold prices 
went into reverse last year. Since a profits warning last September it has 
parted company with five of its six directors, seen its share price crash and 
been forced to melt down its gold reserves to raise emergency cash.
