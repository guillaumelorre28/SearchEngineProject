Every week a Guardian Money <https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/money> 
reader submits a question, and it's up to you to help him or her out – a 
selection of the best answers will appear in Saturday's paper.

This week's question

Last year my father passed away and my mother, now 84, is healthy but lonely. 
I'd like her to live with us – she'll pay her own way – but my husband and 
daughter are worried. We could (just) afford to build a "granny annexe". Should 
we do it? Or is a residential home the answer?

What are your thoughts?
