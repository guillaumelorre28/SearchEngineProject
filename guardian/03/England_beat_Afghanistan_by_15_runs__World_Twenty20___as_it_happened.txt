In summary, then

So, if we’re going to be particulary reductive, we could say that the two 
pivotal events of that match were the 19th over of England’s innings, when 
Moeen and Willey properly cut loose, and the first over of Afghanistan’s, when 
the dangerous Shahzad was dismissed. They were always on the back foot – 
sometimes literally - from then on, and couldn’t build any threatening 
partnerships against seam bowling with which they were never particularly 
comfortable. They’ll be disappointed after their thrilling feats with the ball 
early in England’s innings.

Anyway, I’m off for some kind of lunch before returning to talk you through 
India v Bangladesh. Why not join me then? Thanks for your company and emails. 
Bye

England recover to avoid shock against Afghanistan at World Twenty20

England win by 15 runs!

20th over: Afghanistan 127-9 (Shafiqullah 35, Shahpur 0), target 143

An edge for four off Stokes gets the over off to a promising start for 
Afghanistan, before another fiendish kite-invasion halts play. Tremendous 
mind-games from the kite there. Shafiquallah then mistimes a hook off a short 
ball and dobs up and lands safely but brings no run. Buttler then dives well to 
stop what would have been an inside-edged four, and the game is done. Stokes 
emphasises the point with a perfect-in-the-circumstances yorker. The batsman 
just can’t work him away now, knocking himself over with an attempted scoop 
that fails, before the final ball is hit nicely through the covers for four. A 
comfortable win in the end.

19th over: Afghanistan 119-9 (Shafiqullah 27, Shahpur 0), target 143

England’s penultimate over brought 25 runs. What can Afghanistan’s do? Not so 
much – it starts with a run out. Shafiqullah wants the strike and sends back 
Hamza, who’s run out. He cracks a four past Jordan down the ground to keep 
things ticking over though, making a wee dent in England’s NRR. The next one 
dents it further – a really magnificent six, Shafiqullah getting right 
underneath an attempted yorker and crisply hammering it straight over the sight 
screen. Shot of the innings, possibly. He keeps the strike with a single off 
the last ball – 24 needed from the last over. Just the six fours.

18th over: Afghanistan 108-8 (Shafiqullah 16, Hamza 1), target 143

Willey, looking for reverse swing in the dewey evening light, finds some with 
a low full-toss that is pushed away for one before a clever scoop shot from 
Shafiqullah, at a weird full stretch, races down to the fine leg boundary for 
four. Afghanistan are actually ahead at this stage after that, which kind of 
shows how misleading “at this stage-ery” is. The rest of the over is pretty 
tight - two more singles is all.

17th over: Afghanistan 102-8 (Shafiqullah 11, Hamza 0), target 143

Samiullah carves Stokes past mid-on for four to start the over but the 
bowler’s response is smart, an in-slanting yorker that can only be dug out for 
one run. Then – another review! – after a sharp accurate throw from backward 
point clatters the stumps but Shafaq is comfortably in this time. The reprieves 
don’t last long though as Samiullah miscues and is caught. Shafaq then gets 
away with another mistimed slog that lands between fielders in the deep and 
brings two runs. And the over ends with an Afghan flourish, Shafiqullah pulling 
over midwicket for SIX.

Wicket! Samiullah c Root b Stokes 22, Afghanistan 94-8

Ouch. Samiullah really doesn’t get hold of this, swiping wildly at a wide one 
outside off stump and only toe-ending it up in the air to Root at cover.

16th over: Afghanistan 88-7 (Samiullah 17, Shafaq 2), target 143

Jordan returns to the attack after a decent first stint, and cramps up 
Samiullah nicely, restricting him to a chopped single down to deep backward 
point. Najib digs out a yorker to mid-off for another one, which all suits 
England fine. What suits England even finer is the run-out that follows, after 
Jordan throws down the stumps at the non-striker’s end as Najib’s bat looks to 
have bounced back in the air after he’s dived to ground it. A lengthy review 
concludes that bat is in the air as ball strikes stumps. Samiullah adds a 
single and Shafaq gets off the mark with two but this game is done now, and 
it’s all very quiet in the ground.

15th over: Afghanistan 83-6 (Samiullah 15, Najib 13), target 143

A first bowl for Stokes, and he starts with a single followed by a soft wide. 
Another single is dabbed down to third man before a crisp Samiullah drive the 
deserves to bring more than one. Then – review! – Najib has to dive as Morgan 
direct-hits. A review confirms that the batsman made his ground though. Six 
from the over, which was a tad on the loose side but goes relatively 
unpunished. Afghanistan need exactly two per ball now.

“I think we’ve gone quiet because, well, we don’t really want England to win 
this one,” pipes up Bc Cvav through the eerie silence. “Especially not like 
this, not after that bowling.”

John Starbuck meanwhile is stat-quirk hunting: “Before this match began, the 
possibility existed of Rashid taking Rashid’s wicket, with the reverse 
happening in the next innings. It must be quite common at the village cricket 
level, but has it been done in first class/international games?”

14th over: Afghanistan 77-6 (Samiullah 12, Najib 11), target 143

Moeen returns to the attack, replacing Plunkett who finished with superb 
figures of 4-1-12-0. Samiullah takes a single before Najib – the first 
left-hander in the lineup – adds a rare four to the total, pulling a short 
delivery to the square leg boundary for four. A couple more singles ensue 
before Najib thinks big, and hits big, thumping Moeen against the spin for a 
massive six over long-on.

13th over: Afghanistan 64-6 (Samiullah 10, Najib 0), target 143

Samiullah shapes to cut a wide ball from Rashid on the offside before 
realising that it’s set to be called wide, and then leaves it. A wide is duly 
signalled. Samiullah then does cut on the offside, taking two comfortably, 
before adding a hurried single. Nabi wants more though, but his attempt to go 
over the topfails, as he holes out to Jordan.

12th over: Afghanistan 60-5 (Nabi 12, Samiullah 7), target 143

Samiullah takes a single with a nervous flick off his hips from Plunkett 
before Nabi plays a similar short ball rather better, steering it down to third 
man for one. Plunkett concedes a wide with a stray delivery down legside before 
three more singles follow. They’ve played pace better in this over than in any 
of the previous ones – unfortunately for them, they now need to start hitting 
out a bit.

11th over: Afghanistan 54-5 (Nabi 10, Samiullah 4), target 143

Samiullah cuts Rashid for a single before Nabi opens up nicely to cut in front 
of square on the offside for two. The next ball – a beautiful top-spinner – is 
spilled by Buttler but Nabi looks more comfortable next ball, which he meets on 
the full and absolutely leathers it straight over the bowler’s head into the 
stands for six.

10th over: Afghanistan 45-5 (Nabi 2, Samiullah 3), target 143

Plunkett switches ends to rejoin the attack. Samiullah dabs a single, Nabi 
clips on the legside for another before Plunkett slightly strays on the legside 
and concedes two leg-byes down to fine leg. One more single completes a low-key 
over. Afghanistan’s run rate required is now almost 10 an over. They won’t get 
near.

9th over: Afghanistan 40-5 (Nabi 1, Samiullah 1), target 143

Adil Rashid comes into the attack and concedes his first runs with a 
forcefully-driven two from Noor. A nudged single follows before Rashidgets in 
on the act, taking a simple return catch. It’s funny how the emails dry up when 
England get on top - England cricket fans there, in a nutshell, the only 
supporters to whom “It’s all gone quiet over there” is most appropriately 
chanted when their team are actually on top.

8th over: Afghanistan 35-4 (Noor 14, Nabi 0), target 143

“Early spin for England,” chirps David Lloyd in the commentary box, though I’m 
not sure the eighth over of a T20 international in India counts as “early”. 
Anyway, Moeen’s on and Rashid is gagging to come down the pitch at him: he 
drives a single before Noor picks up two with a squirt towards third man, 
benefiting from an Adil Rashid misfield. Another couple of singles follow before
Moeen strikes, Rashid paying the penalty for trying to cut loose and mistiming 
his drive.

7th over: Afghanistan 31-3 (Noor 11, Rashid 14), target 143

Plunkett comes on at the other end, and concedes his first run from a dabbed 
Noor single. Rashid adds two more ones and his partner another in a tight over. 
Plunkett’s bowling really well here and Afghanistan must be longing for some 
spin-bowlers they can attempt to tuck into.

6th over: Afghanistan 28-3 (Noor 10, Rashid 12), target 143

Rotate, rotate, rotate. Jordan returns to the attack, and Noor dabs down to 
third man for a single. Rashid then takes advantage of the width Jordan had 
hitherto not offered by flat-cutting forsix, but there’s proper seam movement 
here and it bamboozles Rashid in the follow-up ball, a fine awayswinger. A cut 
down to third man for a single completes the over.

5th over: Afghanistan 20-3 (Noor 9, Rashid 5), target 143

These bowlers are finding some pace and bounce here, and Noor has to awkwardly 
fend one off his hips from Willey, but manages a single out of it. A rather 
easier single in the same legside area follows for Rashid. Afghanistan coach 
Inzamam, interviewed mid-over, rues his side’s struggles in pressure situations 
against big teams but stresses the importance of actually playing them in the 
first place. Two overs of parsimony are brought to a halt when Rashid plays a 
clever upper cut off a short ball and it’s lofted down to the third man 
boundary for four.

4th over: Afghanistan 13-3 (Noor 7, Rashid 0), target 143

With Afghanistan discomforted by pace bowlers, Morgan swaps one for another, 
bringing on Plunkett, who induces some horribly uncertain playing and missing 
outside off stump from Rashid with some fine testing seam bowling. A maiden. 
Afghanistan are all over the place now.

3rd over: Afghanistan 13-3 (Noor 7), target 143

Noor gets a single as Willey continues. A kite on the field delays play but 
doesn’t upset Willey’s rhythm, which is probing and tight for four dot balls, 
and prompts Gulbadin to lash out at a shorter ball and it’s hacked up to cover 
whereStokes takes a simple catch. So far the story seems to be that England 
couldn’t really cope with Afghanistan’s preferred style of bowling, and vice 
versa.

2nd over: Afghanistan 13-2 (Noor 6, Gulbadin 1), target 143

Chris Jordan needs a good performance here after Mumbai, and he’s let down 
first ball by the poor fielding of others, a rash throw from Jason Roy to the 
non-striker’s end with no one backing up behind the stumps brings two 
overthrows. Noor slashes and misses at a wide one before fending off a better 
shorter ball down behind square on the offside for a single. Jordan stays 
generally just back of a length, forcing Stanikzai to be defensive, and that 
line works, asStanikzai timidly edges the next one to Root at slip. England 
have two big scalps.

1st over: Afghanistan 9-1 (Noor 3, Stanikzai 1), target 143

So England, with their much more seam-heavy attack, open unsurprisingly with 
Willey, their second-best batsman earlier. He finds an edge with a good probing 
delivery … which is squirted down to the third man boundary for four. Shahzad 
wants to have a go, as per, though Willey hems him in nicely, andit pays off. A 
fine piece of swing bowling traps Shahzad leg-before. He’s not happy but it 
looks plum enough, as replays confirm. Asghar Stanikzai tucks his first ball 
away towards midwicket for one, and Noor then plays an elegant textbook cricket 
shot away on the offside for two. Willey slightly spoils a fine over of 
new-ball seam bowling with a wide down the legside. Noor clips the final ball 
of the over away for one. Plenty of runs from that over, but the wicket that 
fell in it feels more significant.

Sam Hedges chips in with a particularly English take on the late-innings 
fightback: “That’s just perfect isn’t it ... show them it is possible to 
clump/slog/smash the ball on this wicket. Could we not have ended the innings 
painfully slowly and brought on the fear about the track / conditions? 
Afghanistan to win by 4 wickets in 14 overs.”

The players are about to take the field again.

So, who says you need 180+ scores to make T20 cricket compelling? That was 
fascinating stuff in what looks to be a finely-balanced match now, England’s 
much-vaunted batting depth digging them if not completely out of a hole, then 
at least giving them a decent sight of daylight. I’ll be back in a bit for 
Afghanistan’s chase.

Innings complete: England 142-7, 20 overs

20th over: England 142-7 (Moeen 41, Willey 20)

Shahpur loses his radar at the start of the final over, sending a wide 
hurtling down to legside. Moeen toe-ends a single before the keeper Shahzad 
does well to prevent four leg byes, diving smartly to his right to cut it off. 
Another one follows before Moeen opens his shoulders and cracks a four over 
mid-off. A pull to the fielder at square leg brings another single before 
Willey flicks down to fine leg for one more that puts Moeen on strike for the 
final ball of the innings. He tries to thump it past mid-off but only finds the 
fielder, and takes only one. So a fine, perhaps tournament-saving partnership, 
reaches 57 unbeaten. This may yet prove a competitive total.

19th over: England 132-7 (Moeen 34, Willey 19)

Now has this changed things? England go on the charge at last. A rare thing – 
a proper slog – from Ali off Hamza, a hearty clump on the onside but it still 
doesn’t reach the ropes, yielding only two. An even rarer thing follows – asix! 
– from a similar hoik on the legside. He then belts Hamza over his head for 
four before making a hash of a reverse-sweep that brings only a hurried 
leg-bye. Willey then enters the spirit of things, hitting one right in the slot 
straight down the ground forsix more. Emboldened, he thumps another one, this 
one sailing into the “crowd” on the midwicket boundary. This partnership is now 
47.

So, if we’re going to be particulary reductive, we could say that the two 
pivotal events of that match were the 19th over of England’s innings, when 
Moeen and Willey properly cut loose, and the first over of Afghanistan’s, when 
the dangerous Shahzad was dismissed. They were always on the back foot – 
sometimes literally - from then on, and couldn’t build any threatening 
partnerships against seam bowling with which they were never particularly 
comfortable. They’ll be disappointed after their thrilling feats with the ball 
early in England’s innings.

Anyway, I’m off for some kind of lunch before returning to talk you through 
India v Bangladesh. Why not join me then? Thanks for your company and emails.

20th over: Afghanistan 127-9 (Shafiqullah 35, Shahpur 0), target 143

An edge for four off Stokes gets the over off to a promising start for 
Afghanistan, before another fiendish kite-invasion halts play. Tremendous 
mind-games from the kite there. Shafiquallah then mistimes a hook off a short 
ball and dobs up and lands safely but brings no run. Buttler then dives well to 
stop what would have been an inside-edged four, and the game is done. Stokes 
emphasises the point with a perfect-in-the-circumstances yorker. The batsman 
just can’t work him away now, knocking himself over with an attempted scoop 
that fails, before the final ball is hit nicely through the covers for four. A 
comfortable win in the end.
 
19th over: Afghanistan 119-9 (Shafiqullah 27, Shahpur 0), target 143

England’s penultimate over brought 25 runs. What can Afghanistan’s do? Not so 
much – it starts with a run out. Shafiqullah wants the strike and sends back 
Hamza, who’s run out. He cracks a four past Jordan down the ground to keep 
things ticking over though, making a wee dent in England’s NRR. The next one 
dents it further – a really magnificent six, Shafiqullah getting right 
underneath an attempted yorker and crisply hammering it straight over the sight 
screen. Shot of the innings, possibly. He keeps the strike with a single off 
the last ball – 24 needed from the last over. Just the six fours.

18th over: Afghanistan 108-8 (Shafiqullah 16, Hamza 1), target 143

Willey, looking for reverse swing in the dewey evening light, finds some with 
a low full-toss that is pushed away for one before a clever scoop shot from 
Shafiqullah, at a weird full stretch, races down to the fine leg boundary for 
four. Afghanistan are actually ahead at this stage after that, which kind of 
shows how misleading “at this stage-ery” is. The rest of the over is pretty 
tight - two more singles is all.
 
17th over: Afghanistan 102-8 (Shafiqullah 11, Hamza 0), target 143

Samiullah carves Stokes past mid-on for four to start the over but the 
bowler’s response is smart, an in-slanting yorker that can only be dug out for 
one run. Then – another review! – after a sharp accurate throw from backward 
point clatters the stumps but Shafaq is comfortably in this time. The reprieves 
don’t last long though as Samiullah miscues and is caught. Shafaq then gets 
away with another mistimed slog that lands between fielders in the deep and 
brings two runs. And the over ends with an Afghan flourish, Shafiqullah pulling 
over midwicket for SIX.
 
Ouch. Samiullah really doesn’t get hold of this, swiping wildly at a wide one 
outside off stump and only toe-ending it up in the air to Root at cover.

16th over: Afghanistan 88-7 (Samiullah 17, Shafaq 2), target 143

Jordan returns to the attack after a decent first stint, and cramps up 
Samiullah nicely, restricting him to a chopped single down to deep backward 
point. Najib digs out a yorker to mid-off for another one, which all suits 
England fine. What suits England even finer is the run-out that follows, after 
Jordan throws down the stumps at the non-striker’s end as Najib’s bat looks to 
have bounced back in the air after he’s dived to ground it. A lengthy review 
concludes that bat is in the air as ball strikes stumps. Samiullah adds a 
single and Shafaq gets off the mark with two but this game is done now, and 
it’s all very quiet in the ground.
 
After a lengthy review, Najib’s bat is deemed to have been in the air when 
Jordan’s throw hit the stumps.
 
15th over: Afghanistan 83-6 (Samiullah 15, Najib 13), target 143

A first bowl for Stokes, and he starts with a single followed by a soft wide. 
Another single is dabbed down to third man before a crisp Samiullah drive the 
deserves to bring more than one. Then – review! – Najib has to dive as Morgan 
direct-hits. A review confirms that the batsman made his ground though. Six 
from the over, which was a tad on the loose side but goes relatively 
unpunished. Afghanistan need exactly two per ball now.

“I think we’ve gone quiet because, well, we don’t really want England to win 
this one,” pipes up Bc Cvav through the eerie silence. “Especially not like 
this, not after that bowling.”

John Starbuck meanwhile is stat-quirk hunting: “Before this match began, the 
possibility existed of Rashid taking Rashid’s wicket, with the reverse 
happening in the next innings. It must be quite common at the village cricket 
level, but has it been done in first class/international games?”
 
14th over: Afghanistan 77-6 (Samiullah 12, Najib 11), target 143

Moeen returns to the attack, replacing Plunkett who finished with superb 
figures of 4-1-12-0. Samiullah takes a single before Najib – the first 
left-hander in the lineup – adds a rare four to the total, pulling a short 
delivery to the square leg boundary for four. A couple more singles ensue 
before Najib thinks big, and hits big, thumping Moeen against the spin for a 
massive six over long-on.
 
13th over: Afghanistan 64-6 (Samiullah 10, Najib 0), target 143

Samiullah shapes to cut a wide ball from Rashid on the offside before 
realising that it’s set to be called wide, and then leaves it. A wide is duly 
signalled. Samiullah then does cut on the offside, taking two comfortably, 
before adding a hurried single. Nabi wants more though, but his attempt to go 
over the topfails, as he holes out to Jordan. 
 
Just as these two had started looking comfortable, Nabi holes out to Jordan at 
long-on.
 
12th over: Afghanistan 60-5 (Nabi 12, Samiullah 7), target 143

Samiullah takes a single with a nervous flick off his hips from Plunkett 
before Nabi plays a similar short ball rather better, steering it down to third 
man for one. Plunkett concedes a wide with a stray delivery down legside before 
three more singles follow. They’ve played pace better in this over than in any 
of the previous ones – unfortunately for them, they now need to start hitting 
out a bit.
 
11th over: Afghanistan 54-5 (Nabi 10, Samiullah 4), target 143

Samiullah cuts Rashid for a single before Nabi opens up nicely to cut in front 
of square on the offside for two. The next ball – a beautiful top-spinner – is 
spilled by Buttler but Nabi looks more comfortable next ball, which he meets on 
the full and absolutely leathers it straight over the bowler’s head into the 
stands for six.

Prakash Singh/AFP/Getty Images  
10th over: Afghanistan 45-5 (Nabi 2, Samiullah 3), target 143

Plunkett switches ends to rejoin the attack. Samiullah dabs a single, Nabi 
clips on the legside for another before Plunkett slightly strays on the legside 
and concedes two leg-byes down to fine leg. One more single completes a low-key 
over. Afghanistan’s run rate required is now almost 10 an over. They won’t get 
near.
 
9th over: Afghanistan 40-5 (Nabi 1, Samiullah 1), target 143

Adil Rashid comes into the attack and concedes his first runs with a 
forcefully-driven two from Noor. A nudged single follows before Rashidgets in 
on the act, taking a simple return catch. It’s funny how the emails dry up when 
England get on top - England cricket fans there, in a nutshell, the only 
supporters to whom “It’s all gone quiet over there” is most appropriately 
chanted when their team are actually on top.
 
And another one. This is becoming a procession, Noor miscueing a simple return 
catch to Rashid.

8th over: Afghanistan 35-4 (Noor 14, Nabi 0), target 143

“Early spin for England,” chirps David Lloyd in the commentary box, though I’m 
not sure the eighth over of a T20 international in India counts as “early”. 
Anyway, Moeen’s on and Rashid is gagging to come down the pitch at him: he 
drives a single before Noor picks up two with a squirt towards third man, 
benefiting from an Adil Rashid misfield. Another couple of singles follow before
Moeen strikes, Rashid paying the penalty for trying to cut loose and mistiming 
his drive.
 
Moeen strikes, Rashid – who had been looking settled – tries to cut loose and 
cracks it straight to Morgan at extra cover.

7th over: Afghanistan 31-3 (Noor 11, Rashid 14), target 143

Plunkett comes on at the other end, and concedes his first run from a dabbed 
Noor single. Rashid adds two more ones and his partner another in a tight over. 
Plunkett’s bowling really well here and Afghanistan must be longing for some 
spin-bowlers they can attempt to tuck into.
 
6th over: Afghanistan 28-3 (Noor 10, Rashid 12), target 143

Rotate, rotate, rotate. Jordan returns to the attack, and Noor dabs down to 
third man for a single. Rashid then takes advantage of the width Jordan had 
hitherto not offered by flat-cutting forsix, but there’s proper seam movement 
here and it bamboozles Rashid in the follow-up ball, a fine awayswinger. A cut 
down to third man for a single completes the over.
 
5th over: Afghanistan 20-3 (Noor 9, Rashid 5), target 143

These bowlers are finding some pace and bounce here, and Noor has to awkwardly 
fend one off his hips from Willey, but manages a single out of it. A rather 
easier single in the same legside area follows for Rashid. Afghanistan coach 
Inzamam, interviewed mid-over, rues his side’s struggles in pressure situations 
against big teams but stresses the importance of actually playing them in the 
first place. Two overs of parsimony are brought to a halt when Rashid plays a 
clever upper cut off a short ball and it’s lofted down to the third man 
boundary for four.

With Afghanistan discomforted by pace bowlers, Morgan swaps one for another, 
bringing on Plunkett, who induces some horribly uncertain playing and missing 
outside off stump from Rashid with some fine testing seam bowling. A maiden. 
Afghanistan are all over the place now.
 
3rd over: Afghanistan 13-3 (Noor 7), target 143

Noor gets a single as Willey continues. A kite on the field delays play but 
doesn’t upset Willey’s rhythm, which is probing and tight for four dot balls, 
and prompts Gulbadin to lash out at a shorter ball and it’s hacked up to cover 
whereStokes takes a simple catch. So far the story seems to be that England 
couldn’t really cope with Afghanistan’s preferred style of bowling, and vice 
versa.

England are turning this round emphatically. Gulbadin dollies up an easy catch 
to Stokes on the offside.

Chris Jordan needs a good performance here after Mumbai, and he’s let down 
first ball by the poor fielding of others, a rash throw from Jason Roy to the 
non-striker’s end with no one backing up behind the stumps brings two 
overthrows. Noor slashes and misses at a wide one before fending off a better 
shorter ball down behind square on the offside for a single. Jordan stays 
generally just back of a length, forcing Stanikzai to be defensive, and that 
line works, asStanikzai timidly edges the next one to Root at slip. England 
have two big scalps.
 
And now the captain goes, a standard-issue edge to slip from a decent back of 
a length ball.

So England, with their much more seam-heavy attack, open unsurprisingly with 
Willey, their second-best batsman earlier. He finds an edge with a good probing 
delivery … which is squirted down to the third man boundary for four. Shahzad 
wants to have a go, as per, though Willey hems him in nicely, andit pays off. A 
fine piece of swing bowling traps Shahzad leg-before. He’s not happy but it 
looks plum enough, as replays confirm. Asghar Stanikzai tucks his first ball 
away towards midwicket for one, and Noor then plays an elegant textbook cricket 
shot away on the offside for two. Willey slightly spoils a fine over of 
new-ball seam bowling with a wide down the legside. Noor clips the final ball 
of the over away for one. Plenty of runs from that over, but the wicket that 
fell in it feels more significant.

Willey strikes in the first over, and picking up the dangerman with an 
inswinger that thumps into Shahzad’s pad. Perfect start.

Sam Hedges chips in with a particularly English take on the late-innings 
fightback: “That’s just perfect isn’t it ... show them it is possible to 
clump/slog/smash the ball on this wicket. Could we not have ended the innings 
painfully slowly and brought on the fear about the track / conditions? 
Afghanistan to win by 4 wickets in 14 overs.”

The players are about to take the field again.
 
So, who says you need 180+ scores to make T20 cricket compelling? That was 
fascinating stuff in what looks to be a finely-balanced match now, England’s 
much-vaunted batting depth digging them if not completely out of a hole, then 
at least giving them a decent sight of daylight. I’ll be back in a bit for 
Afghanistan’s chase.
 
20th over: England 142-7 (Moeen 41, Willey 20)

Shahpur loses his radar at the start of the final over, sending a wide 
hurtling down to legside. Moeen toe-ends a single before the keeper Shahzad 
does well to prevent four leg byes, diving smartly to his right to cut it off. 
Another one follows before Moeen opens his shoulders and cracks a four over 
mid-off. A pull to the fielder at square leg brings another single before 
Willey flicks down to fine leg for one more that puts Moeen on strike for the 
final ball of the innings. He tries to thump it past mid-off but only finds the 
fielder, and takes only one. So a fine, perhaps tournament-saving partnership, 
reaches 57 unbeaten. This may yet prove a competitive total.

19th over: England 132-7 (Moeen 34, Willey 19)

Now has this changed things? England go on the charge at last. A rare thing – 
a proper slog – from Ali off Hamza, a hearty clump on the onside but it still 
doesn’t reach the ropes, yielding only two. An even rarer thing follows – asix! 
– from a similar hoik on the legside. He then belts Hamza over his head for 
four before making a hash of a reverse-sweep that brings only a hurried 
leg-bye. Willey then enters the spirit of things, hitting one right in the slot 
straight down the ground forsix more. Emboldened, he thumps another one, this 
one sailing into the “crowd” on the midwicket boundary. This partnership is now 
47.
