Food giant Kellogg’s has been banned from telling consumers that its Special K 
cereal is “full of goodness” and “nutritious” in UK ad campaigns.

Kellogg’s ran a TV ad for Special K cereal promoting it as a “five grain super 
porridge full of goodness”.


The company’s website also says the Nutri K flakes used in Special K cereal 
help make “a nutritious start to your day”.

The Advertising Standards Authority <https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> 
received a complaint about the health claims.


Under ASA rules companies cannot make general health claims unless backed up 
by a specific health benefit for the consumer.


For example, while the Kellogg’s ad said Special K contains vitamin B2, which 
is good for skin, the ASA said that it wasn’t clearly linked to the general 
claim that it is “full of goodness”.


“We therefore considered the specific health claim did not appear with or 
immediately following the general health claim ‘full of goodness’,” said the 
ASA. “As such, we considered it did not accompany the general health claim and 
in that regard, the ad breached the [advertising] code.”


Similarly, the ASA said Kellogg’s failed to back up the “nutricious” claim on 
the website with a specific benefit from eating the cereal.


The ASA said that consumers had to click through two web pages to find a 
dedicated page with information on the Nutri K flakes and their specific health 
benefits.


“We therefore concluded the presentation of the claim, as it appeared on the 
home page, breached the [advertising] code,” the ASA said.


“[The ads] must not appear again in their current form. We told Kellogg 
Marketing and Sales UK to ensure that relevant authorised health claims 
accompanied any general health claims that featured in their advertising.”
