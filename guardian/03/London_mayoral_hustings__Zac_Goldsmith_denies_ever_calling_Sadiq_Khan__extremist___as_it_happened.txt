BBC mayoral debate - Verdict

These five candidates have already debated each on numerous occasions and, for 
the journalists watching the pre-record with me in the press room who have 
followed this contest closely, it was all very familiar. They found it hard to 
pick up much that was new.

But it was the first mayoral hustings I’ve watched in this contest, and what 
struck me was me most was the absence of any obvious front runner. Reading the 
polls and the press coverage and you come away with the impression that Sadiq 
Khan is clearly ahead, and thatZac Goldsmith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith> is going negative to 
compensate for a campaign that lacks definition. But watching Khan and 
Goldsmith debate, it didn’t seem so clear cut. Khan seemed to have the better 
grasp of detail but Goldsmith had more confidence than you might expect from 
someone who’s campaign is widely thought to be in trouble. Sian Berry and 
Caroline Pidgeon were fine, although at time they found it hard to 
differentiate themselves. Being Ukip, that wasn’t a problem for Peter Whittle. 
But this is clearly a contest between Khan and Goldsmith.

And the winner? Well, tonight it was probably Andrew Neil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/andrew-neil>. If there was one person who 
stamped his authority on the proceedings most, it was him.

He also asked what may have been the most revealing question of the evening. 
And it was not addressed to any of the candidates. It was when Neil asked the 
audience if any of them believed that the candidates would be able to honour 
their promise to build 50,000 homes a year. (See11.13pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/18/goldsmith-khan-london-mayor-debate-calling-khan-extremist-live-coverage-of-bbc-london-mayoral-debate?page=with:block-57155bafe4b09e8921914936#block-57155bafe4b09e8921914936>
 Only about one hand went up, revealing a deep distrust in the ability of any 
of the candidates to make a difference on the issue that matters to youngish 
Londoners.

That is something that should worry them all.

That’s all from me.

Thanks for the comments.

Peter Whittle says there is shocking waste at TfL. He would scrap HS2. And we 
don’t need a garden bridge.

Caroline Pidgeon says some cleaners go into work and spend half the morning 
earning enough to fund their tickets. She would offer half prices fares for 
people travelling before 7.30am.


Neil says that would suit him. He gets up at 6am every morning.

And that’s it. 

I will post a short verdict in a moment.

Sian Berry says neither of these plans are satisfactory.


She wants to flatten fares, she says.


Q: How much will that cost?


Around 10%


Q: So more than £600m. How would you fund it?


Berry says the congestion charge could contribute.

Goldsmith says Khan’s plan would take £1.9bn. He says that money can either go 
into investment, or into Khan’s plan.

Khan interrupts. We cannot afford that, he says. Fares are going up. Is that 
fair? Goldsmith does not engage, but just asks Khan: Have you finished?


Q: Would fares still rise under your mayoralty?

Goldsmith says he would “bear down” on costs.


Berry that is what Boris Johnson said. And fares went up. Neil says the same.


Neil asks repeatedly if fares will rise under Goldsmith. They could go up 3% a 
year, Neil says.

Goldsmith dodges the question, and says if you take £1.9bn out of the TfL 
budget,London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> will grind to a 
standstill.

Transport

Q: [From a student] How would candidates invest in transport and stop fares 
rising?

Sadiq Khan says TfL has a budget of about £12bn. But its budget is a bit 
flabby. There is scope for saving.


He says last year TfL spent £383m on consutlants nd agency staff. That figure 
has doubled in the last eight years.


There are separate engineering departments doing underground and overground, 
he says. Why not merge them?


There are 450 staff earning more than £100,000.

Q: So are you going to fire them?


Khan says he will make savings.


Q: So how many will you fire?

Khan says he will not spend money getting rid of them. The point is, he will 
tackle inefficiencies, he says.

He says the bill for agency staff has doubled.

He has a fully funded plan to freeze fares.

Goldsmith says London is the most important city in the world. He says it has

close  
These five candidates have already debated each on numerous occasions and, for 
the journalists watching the pre-record with me in the press room who have 
followed this contest closely, it was all very familiar. They found it hard to 
pick up much that was new.

But it was the first mayoral hustings I’ve watched in this contest, and what 
struck me was me most was the absence of any obvious front runner. Reading the 
polls and the press coverage and you come away with the impression that Sadiq 
Khan is clearly ahead, and thatZac Goldsmith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith> is going negative to 
compensate for a campaign that lacks definition. But watching Khan and 
Goldsmith debate, it didn’t seem so clear cut. Khan seemed to have the better 
grasp of detail but Goldsmith had more confidence than you might expect from 
someone who’s campaign is widely thought to be in trouble. Sian Berry and 
Caroline Pidgeon were fine, although at time they found it hard to 
differentiate themselves. Being Ukip, that wasn’t a problem for Peter Whittle. 
But this is clearly a contest between Khan and Goldsmith.

And the winner? Well, tonight it was probably Andrew Neil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/andrew-neil>. If there was one person who 
stamped his authority on the proceedings most, it was him.

He also asked what may have been the most revealing question of the evening. 
And it was not addressed to any of the candidates. It was when Neil asked the 
audience if any of them believed that the candidates would be able to honour 
their promise to build 50,000 homes a year. (See11.13pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/18/goldsmith-khan-london-mayor-debate-calling-khan-extremist-live-coverage-of-bbc-london-mayoral-debate?page=with:block-57155bafe4b09e8921914936#block-57155bafe4b09e8921914936>
 Only about one hand went up, revealing a deep distrust in the ability of any 
of the candidates to make a difference on the issue that matters to youngish 
Londoners.

That is something that should worry them all.

That’s all from me.

Thanks for the comments.
 
I see that BTL Andrew Neil <https://www.theguardian.com/media/andrew-neil> is 
getting some criticism for his aggressive questioning. Rachel Holdsworth from 
the Londonist website has an alternative point of view.

Goldsmith’s refusal to rule out fare increases could lead to fares going up 
17%, or the equivalent of £1,000.

Peter Whittle says there is shocking waste at TfL. He would scrap HS2. And we 
don’t need a garden bridge.

Caroline Pidgeon says some cleaners go into work and spend half the morning 
earning enough to fund their tickets. She would offer half prices fares for 
people travelling before 7.30am.


Neil says that would suit him. He gets up at 6am every morning.

And that’s it. 

I will post a short verdict in a moment.
 
Sian Berry says neither of these plans are satisfactory.


She wants to flatten fares, she says.


Q: How much will that cost?


Around 10%


Q: So more than £600m. How would you fund it?


Berry says the congestion charge could contribute.

 
Goldsmith says Khan’s plan would take £1.9bn. He says that money can either go 
into investment, or into Khan’s plan.

Khan interrupts. We cannot afford that, he says. Fares are going up. Is that 
fair? Goldsmith does not engage, but just asks Khan: Have you finished?


Q: Would fares still rise under your mayoralty?

Goldsmith says he would “bear down” on costs.


Berry that is what Boris Johnson said. And fares went up. Neil says the same.


Neil asks repeatedly if fares will rise under Goldsmith. They could go up 3% a 
year, Neil says.

Goldsmith dodges the question, and says if you take £1.9bn out of the TfL 
budget,London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> will grind to a 
standstill.
 
Q: [From a student] How would candidates invest in transport and stop fares 
rising?

Sadiq Khan says TfL has a budget of about £12bn. But its budget is a bit 
flabby. There is scope for saving.


He says last year TfL spent £383m on consutlants nd agency staff. That figure 
has doubled in the last eight years.


There are separate engineering departments doing underground and overground, 
he says. Why not merge them?


There are 450 staff earning more than £100,000.

Q: So are you going to fire them?


Khan says he will make savings.


Q: So how many will you fire?

Khan says he will not spend money getting rid of them. The point is, he will 
tackle inefficiencies, he says.

He says the bill for agency staff has doubled.

He has a fully funded plan to freeze fares.

 
The BBC is now playing short video clips of the other seven candidates, 
including Respect’sGeorge Galloway, who says London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> should not just be a city for those 
“dripping in gold”.
 
Q: London <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> is not just the financial 
capital of Europe. It is the capital of Europe, the most important city. Can it 
stay like this if the UK is out of the EU?

Goldsmith says London is the most important city in the world. He says it has 
a great future whatever. But he thinks it will have a slightly better future if 
it is out of the EU.

 
Boris Johnson, the Conservative mayor of London, has been tweeting support for 
Zac Goldsmith <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith> during the 
debate.
