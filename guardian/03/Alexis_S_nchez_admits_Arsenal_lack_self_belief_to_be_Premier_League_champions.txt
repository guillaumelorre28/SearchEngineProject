“If we go out on to the pitch with hunger to become champions, to win the 
Premier League or the Champions League, we can achieve it,” he told Directv 
Sports.

“There are great players here, I train with them daily and they have got the 
mentality and the desire to win but sometimes, we lack the hunger, the 
mentality that we are winning 1-0 when we go out on to the pitch. Sometimes, we 
lack this hunger to believe that we can be champions ... to go out on to the 
pitch feeling that we are already winning 1-0.”

Joel Campbell had opened the scoring for Arsenal

three occasions, but goals from Wayne Routledge and Ashley Williams enabled 
Swansea to leave the Emirates Stadium with all three points for the third time 
in four years.

It was a much-changed Swans lineup, showing six alterations from the weekend 
defeat to Tottenham

 and with more than an eye on a crucial match at home to their fellow 
strugglers Norwich on Saturday.
