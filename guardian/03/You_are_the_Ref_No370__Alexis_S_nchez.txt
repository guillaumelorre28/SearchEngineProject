Keith Hackett’s verdict

1) Assuming the throw wasn’t unduly hard or intended to cause injury, the 
attacker hasn’t committed any offence here, so award the goal. As for the 
defender: he didn’t actually delay the restart, so he avoids a booking this 
time. But have a word: warn him that if he does this again he’ll be cautioned. 
The laws require him to be at least two metres away from the point at which the 
ball is thrown, and he must know that.Thanks to Andy McEwan. 
2) You and your assistants are considered part of the field of play – so any 
collision like this is considered a “play on” situation, especially when it is 
accidental. As for the offside call – as always, you can only base your 
decisions on what you and your colleagues have seen. You cannot disallow a goal 
based on a hunch and your assistant was in no position to contribute. So award 
the goal and check your colleague is OK.Thanks to Ryszard Kaleta. 
3) It’s too late for that. This is poor officiating – you should always delay 
a decision in cases like this. But having blown the whistle you now have to 
follow through and award the penalty, then decide whether or not to send the 
keeper off. Technically, he did not deny a goalscoring opportunity because the 
ball rolled into the net, and only your poor refereeing stopped it being 
awarded. But, having awarded the penalty – meaning the game stopped when the 
foul was committed – I would say you do now need to dismiss him. It’s a 
self-inflicted mess.Kumail Jaffer wins the shirt.
