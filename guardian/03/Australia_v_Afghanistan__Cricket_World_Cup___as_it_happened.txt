Australia wins by 275 runs after a spirited display from Afghanistan

Well, that took a little longer than Australia probably would have liked, but 
they’ve blown their rivals away tonight. The eye-popping 275-run winning margin 
was set up with the bat, where David Warner’s brutal 178, Steve Smith’s 
industrious 95 and a helter-skelter 88 from Glenn Maxwell helped them to an 
imposing 417-6.

Never overawaed or panicked, there was an admirable calmness to the 
Afghanistan reply - Asghar Stanikzai apart - even if they knew deep down that 
there was no hope of getting close. Nawroz Mangal did well with 33 and 
Najibullah Zadran’s 24 included a towering 98-metre six off Glenn Maxwell, but 
the Aussie bowlers were too quick and too good in the end.

Mitch Starc ended up with 2-18 from 6 (both of his wickets pure yorker porn), 
Josh Hazlewood was steady with 2-25 off 8 and Mitch Johnson explosive and 
hostile in equal measure with 4-22 off 7.3 overs.

This was a routine game for the Aussies as they fine-tune their campaign, but 
for Afghanistan it was a very clear reminder of the gulf they need to bridge in 
the big-time. Their performances at this World Cup sit right up there among the 
highlights so today should not linger as a negative, just a stepping stone on 
the way to better things.

Thank you all for joining us for all the action today and make sure you stop

WICKET! Hassan c Warner b Johnson - Australia win by 275 runs

Afghanistan bowled out for 142 in 37.3 overs

Hassan is the last man to go, appropriately attempting a flamboyant stroke 
that was a little beyond him. Looking to crack one over mid on he barely gets a 
hold of it and just helps it into the hands of Warner at mid wicket. That’s it 
for the Afghanis. They made Australia earn that but the home side has ended up 
with the heftiest of all World Cup wins.

@rustyjacko <https://twitter.com/rustyjacko> Starc's yorker is getting to be 
the best around. Almost Akramish and almost in poor taste to whip it out today, 
I feel.

37th over: Afghanistan 140-9 (Hassan 5, Shapoor 0)

Maybe the Australian fieldsmen are also fans of Shapoor. The cult hero paceman 
edges through to the cordon but he’s put down when Smith fails to reel in a 
catch low and to his left. It was a very tough chance but he might have held it.

WICKET! Zazai c Haddin b Hazlewood 10 (Afghanistan 140-9)

Hazlewood gets his second wicket for the night, coaxing a loose waft from 
Zazai, a shot from which a faint inside edge flies through to Haddin behind the 
wicket. There’s only stifled appeals because they feel it’s beyond asking for, 
but Kumar Dharamasena raises a finger to confirm the inevitable.
 Josh Hazlewood appeals successfully for the wicket of Afsar Zazai.

36th over: Afghanistan 140-8 (Zazai 9, Hassan 4)

3-18 was a welcome return to form from Mitchell Johnson in his first six overs 
tonight and now he’s back in search of a 5-fer. Hassan faces up with an absurd 
number of slip fielders in place, but an edge late in the over fails to carry.

35th over: Afghanistan 138-8 (Zazai 9, Hassan 4)

Hazlewood gets a searching yorker on target to Zazai but the latter does well 
to jam it out and preserve his timber. The Aussies are a happy lot tonight; 
between balls Clarke and Finch are horsing around like schoolboys with beaming 
smiles on their faces. All the back-stabbing and angst will happen when they’re 
back in the sheds, I guess.

34th over: Afghanistan 135-8 (Zazai 8, Hassan 3)

Starc’s next over is basically one long, tantric build-up towards a climactic 
yorker that never comes. That’s where he’s at as a bowler in ODIs now; you 
expect a wicket nearly every over.

33rd over: Afghanistan 135-8 (Zazai 8, Hassan 3)

Hazlewood reappears now but doesn’t quite nail his yorkers in the same manner 
of his bowling partner. For fans of Rambo headbands and face paint in 
professional sports, you’ll be pleased to know that Hamid Hassan is now at the 
crease. I hope he tries to punch a six. You wouldn’t put it past him.

WICKET! Dawlat Zadran b Starc 0 (Afghanistan 131-8)

Dawlat Zadran disappears almost as quickly as he arrives. This one comes down 
at 150.6 kmph and takes the base of off stump - another screaming yorker. Starc 
almost looks dowwnbeat as he raises an arm in celebration. Why the long face, 
Mitch?

WICKET! Najibullah b Starc 24 (Afghanistan 131-7)

Mitch Starc sure knows how to crash a party. Just as we basked in the 
magnificence of Najibullah’s hitting an over earlier, Starc rips in a fast, 
in-swinging yorker that crashes into the base of middle stump and lights up the 
zing bails. Is there a better sight in fast bowling at the moment than Starc’s 
yorkers? Probably not.

31st over: Afghanistan 131-6 (Najibullah 24, Zazai 7)

Najibullah you genius! With Maxwell still wheeling away with his off-spin, the 
left-hander skips down the track and thumps a stupendous six over cow - all 98 
metres of it according to an on-screen graphic. It’s up on a roof! That is 
prodigious hitting.

30th over: Afghanistan 122-6 (Najibullah 15, Zazai 7)

Mitchell Starc is back now with his swerving pace and Shane Warne-approved 
body language. He can’t quite body language his way to a wicket but by the end 
of the over he’s built up a decent head of steam.

29th over: Afghanistan 121-6 (Najibullah 14, Zazai 7)

“It’s great to see them smiling,” says Shane Warne of the Afghani players. To 
be honest, what’s been notable from them in this tournament is the way that they
haven’t smiled. They’re genuine competitors. Najibullah and Zazai know they 
have no hope hear and it looks like they’re annoyed by that, not resigned to it.

28th over: Afghanistan 120-6 (Najibullah 13, Zazai 7)

In a rare slip-up, James Faulkner is a little too overzealous to deliver to 
Zazai and oversteps the mark to cough up a fre hit. He folows that with a wide 
but Zazai can’t get hold of a slower ball next up so the bowlers’ transgression 
goes unpunished. The batsman ends the over with a rueful shake of the head.

27th over: Afghanistan 116-6 (Najibullah 13, Zazai 5)

Maxwell crashes back to earth, belted by Najibullah as the latter grows in 
confidence and starts expanding his strokes. From the final delivery he canes a 
quite stunning straight drive down the ground and it’s slamming into the fence 
before the bowler can even look around to see where it’s gone.

26th over: Afghanistan 105-6 (Najibullah 6, Zazai 1)

As Zazai gets off the mark, Mark Taylor goes completely off script about the 
length of this tournament, making the kind of observations that will probably 
see his microphone cord yanked sometime in the next five minutes. His heart is 
in the right place, but you have to wonder how familiar he is with the schedule 
for the next one.

25th over: Afghanistan 103-6 (Najibullah 5, Zazai 0)

Maxwell probably fancies himself to rip through a few tail-end wickets here 
but Afsar Zaazai keeps out the remaining four balls of the over to make it a 
wicket-maiden. Zazai can actually handle the bat, to be honest. He’s got an ODI 
half-century to his name.

WICKET! Nabi c Clarke b Maxwell 2 (Afghanistan 103-6)

Glenn Maxwell is thrown the ball and comes up with immediate gold, tempting 
Nabi forward into a sweep he doesn’t quite nail, flicking the ball into his own 
helmet and presenting Clarke with the simplest of catches running behind keeper 
Brad Haddin. Nabi reviews, thinking it had merely deflected off his arm, but 
replays indicate otherwise - the edge came first.
 Michael Clarke celebrates with Brad Haddin after dismissing Mohammad Nabi.

23rd over: Afghanistan 102-5 (Nabi 1, Najibullah 5)

Johnson’s bowling with a scrambled seam tonight, as ever, but some odd things 
are happening when he slants one in to the left-hander Najibullah and it moves 
away off the pitch. The Afghanis move past 100 with a Johnson wide and the 
hairy, mean left-arm quick finishes by firing down another testing bouncer. 
Najibullah is up to the challenge.

22nd over: Afghanistan 97-5 (Nabi 0, Najibullah 2)

A keenly felt absence in the first few games of the tournament - particularly 
against New Zealand - James Faulkner appears now for his first bowl of the 
night and indeed his first since returning from injury. Najibullah gets him 
away for a single but it’s typical Faulkner fare; variations of pace and canny 
change-ups out the back of the hand.

Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi has been joined at the crease by Najibullah 
Zadran now. Both have a decent old shift ahead of them with the Aussie quicks

Mangal c Finch b Johnson 33 (Afghanistan 94-5)

What a catch! One brings two as Mangal departs. Johnson grabs the ball and 
fires down a short one and rather than yielding to discretion, Mangal flicks it 
dangerously in the direction of the cordon and watches Finch fling himself in 
the air like a salmon and take a wonderful two-handed catch in mid-air. He’s 
from Geelong, Finch - Aussie Rules football territory. You can’t half tell.

WICKET! Shenwari c Johnson b Clarke 17 (Afghanistan 94-4)

Shenwari has thrown away all of his hard work and he’s furious with himself. 
I’m furious with him. Michael Clarke is happy, he just floated one up on leg 
stump and watched as the batsman swept it around the corner to Johnson at short 
fine leg. It’s a disappointingly soft dismissal after Shenwari’s gritty display 
of an over earlier.

19th over: Afghanistan 93-3 (Mangal 32, Shenwari 17)

We get one Mitch back - Johnson this time. 2-6 off 3 was a terrific first 
spell and he’s straight back on a probing if slightly full length before 
jamming one in short and getting a jumpy Shenwari straight in the grill of the 
helmet. It’s not condescending to call Shenwari a streetfighter because he 
genuinely does look like he wants to punch someone but instead he reacts to the 
Johnson bouncer by clobbering him for a boundary past mid off. Superb stuff.

Clarke loves a bowl, doesn’t he? It’s not like anyone can argue with him but

Mitches, please.

17th over: Afghanistan 85-3 (Mangal 31, Shenwari 10)

Marsh’s concern seems to be a leg or groin complaint but somewhat 
disconcertingly, he’s thrown the ball and asked to keep bowling. Surely it’s 
worth a visit to the physios room first, no? Apparently not. He struggles away 
manfully in the final over before the drinks break but finishes by engaging in 
animated conversation with Clarke, the gist of which seems to be, ‘err, can I 
go off now or what?’
Pavilion Opinions (@pavilionopinion) 
If Warner were a dog, he'd happily chase his ball over a cliff. Hard to think 
of a more committed fielder in the world.#AUSvAFG

16th over: Afghanistan 82-3 (Mangal 31, Shenwari 8)

As Clarke hurries his way through another over, Marsh continues to look very 
proppy and uncomfortable in the outfield. Mangal finishes the over by lapping 
two down to fine leg and the Afghanistan pair is making steady progress now.

15th over: Afghanistan 78-3 (Mangal 28, Shenwari 7)

If you were to judge it by the rabid intensity of David Warner’s fielding, 
you’d have no idea that this match is a one-sided one. He’d be excused for 
resting on his laurels after his batting heroics but he’s haring around and 
throwing himself into dives at the boundary when Marsh continues to get tonked 
about. His first two overs have gone for 22, Marsh. To make matters worse he’s 
pulled up lame after the over. Watch this space.

Clarke’s aim is pretty clear at the moment; sprint through as many overs as he 
can and give his quicks some time to gather themseleves for another onslaught.

13th over: Afghanistan 67-3 (Mangal 24, Shenwari 1)

Where Stanikzai failed, Mangal has succeeded. Mitchell Marsh appears to 
relieve Johnson and is welcomed to the fold with two towering sixes over cow 
and then a more classical cover drive for three. He really laid into the first 
of those sixes, Mangal. Just blasted it. Haddin has a forgettable moment to 
finish the over when he lets through four byes. This match is many things but 
dull is not one of them.

12th over: Afghanistan 48-3 (Mangal 9, Shenwari 1)

He copped a bit of grief earlier for not having a bat, but Michael Clarke has 
exercised his discretion here and given himself a trundle. His first over is 
pretty innocuous stuff so Shenwari is off the mark with ease.

Shenwari is at the crease now. He made 96 against Scotland, what can he pull 
off tonight?

WICKET! Stanikzai c Smith b Johnson 2 (Afghanistan 46-3)

There’s nothing surprising about this one. Stanikzai had shown his hand in all 
nine previous balls he’d faced when he stepped towards leg and carved Johnson 
high in the air in the direction of third man. There’s a moment of panic when 
it looks like the Australian fielders will collide in Waugh-Gillespie style but 
Steve Smith both snares the catch and avoids any unscheduled dental work. That 
was an insane innings from Stanikzai, idiocy of a type rarely seen in the 
somewhat dreary world of professional sport. There should be far more of it.

10th over: Afghanistan 44-2 (Mangal 8, Stanikzai 2)

Hazlewood feels a counter-punch in this over in the shape of two contrasting 
shots from Mangal, the first a classical cover drive to the boundary and the 
next a straighter effort that bounces over the bowlers’ head and also reaches 
the rope. Hazlewood grins like a loon, but I don’t think he’s very happy.

Paul Ewart is also taking the positives from his situation. “Hello Russell, 
long-suffering England supporter here with an urgent question: What was David 
Warner thinking? Does he not know that 243 is a par score at this ground in 
this year at this time, with a cricket bat? Is this amateur hour?”

9th over: Afghanistan 36-2 (Mangal 0, Stanikzai 2)

Asghar Stanikzai appears at the crease know and cracks a wonderful cut shot 
off Johnson, one that would have gone close to the boundary had David Warner 
not dived and stopped it in acrobatic style. Warner’s dismount is so effective 
that a run-out looks a possibility, but the batsmen stand their ground.

Stanikzai is not backward in coming forward, it must be said. He’s trying to 
belt the cover off everything Johnson sends down. It’s all manic hand-speed and 
swiveling shoulders, which scares Glenn Maxwell away from the short leg 
position and also puts that poor young kid from earlier on notice too. If 
Stanikzai makes contact with any of these heaves it’ll be up in Row Z.

WICKET! Ahmadi c Clarke b Hazlewood 13 (Afghanistan 32-2)

Ahmadi departs in most unfortunate circumnstances when after hammering 
Hazlewood straight he’s denied any runs, let alone a boundary, when the ball 
thumps into his partners’ body. Two balls later he fishes outside off stump and 
sends a thick edge through to Clarke in the cordon.


“That’s something Ahmadi will have to learn for the next time he plays here in 
Perth,” saysCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Australia board 
member Mark Taylor. Anything to share there, Tubby?

7th over: Afghanistan 30-1 (Ahmadi 11, Mangal 0)

Nawroz Mangal is the new batsman for Afghanistan and he’s lucky not to catch 
an absolute snorter from Johnson first up because he struggles with the pace to 
start with. No shame there because it’s coming down at sizzling pace.

WICKET! Ghani c Faulkner b Johnson 12 (Afghanistan 30-1)

Mitch Johnson was nearly belted all the way back across the Tasman against New 
Zealand and he doesn’t exactly set the world alight early in his first over 
here. He’s turned for four byes and fires down a wide but then Ghani middles 
one straight into the hands of James Faulkner at a straight, short mid-on. The 
ball had angled in a little and although it was struck well, Faulkner barely 
had to move.

 Mitchell Johnson celebrates taking the wicket of Afghanistan’s Usman Ghani.

6th over: Afghainstan 25-0 (Javed Ahmadi 11 Usman Ghani 12)

Hazlewood catches a severe case of the wides in this over, firing down two and 
just never quite looking like he’s going to fire. Might it be time for an early 
bowling change? He’ll probably bowl in bursts anyway.

5th over: Afghainstan 22-0 (Javed Ahmadi 11 Usman Ghani 11)

Ghani looks solid again here. He’s compact and economical in his movements to 
Starc and even clips a two around the corner from a ball that rose awkwardly 
into his ribs. Starc’s hardly hit his straps here, mind you. He’s muttering 
away at the end of the over, probably a sign that he’s off his game a little.

Brendon Julian finishes the over by calling Afghanistan “minnows”. Shame on 
you, Brendan, shame on you. They’re magnificos.

4th over: Afghainstan 16-0 (Javed Ahmadi 10, Usman Ghani 6)

There’s been some unconvincing defensive work happening so far but given 
width, Ahmadi belts Hazlewood for three and his expansiveness is contagious; 
Ghani clatters two more through the same region. That prompts a somewhat 
predictable response from Hazlewood; a steepling bouncer past Ghani’s left 
nostril.

This is positive stuff from Afghanistan though - not perturbed by the 
conditions or threatened by Australia’s tall timber - they’re on the offensive.

3rd over: Afghainstan 9-0 (Javed Ahmadi 7, Usman Ghani 2)

Is Starc getting a little carried away here? Shouldn’t he just bowl 
breathtaking yorkers, ball after ball? Do I place too much stock in the ability 
of cricketers to live a perfect manifestation of my dreams for them?

In this over it’s not until the fifth ball that he produces a 150kmph 
sandshoe-crusher. What was he doing the rest of the time? Being human, I guess. 
Usman Ghani might be considered super-human to have kept that jaffa out, now 
that I consider it. As you were.

2nd over: Afghainstan 8-0 (Javed Ahmadi 6, Usman Ghani 2)

Josh Hazlewood is back in the Aussie line-up today and he’s immediately 
swinging the ball in a gorgeous, exaggerated curve away from Ahmadi. The latter 
clips one around the corner for a single to fine leg but he might cause some 
problems here, the big New South Welshman. Afghanistan? They don’t look as 
flustered as they might be by this searing pace and sideways movement.

1st over: Afghainstan 7-0 (Javed Ahmadi 5, Usman Ghani 2)

Fresh from his devastating spell against New Zealand, Mitchell Marsh takes the 
new ball for Australia with Javed Omani facing the music. Starc’s first two 
deliveries both swing in sharply outside the off stump of the right hander and 
Glenn Maxwell hovers close by at short leg.

It’s a little streaky, but Ahmadi under-edges four between Brad Haddin and 
first slip to pick up the first four runs of the innigs. Next up Starc thinks 
he’s pinned him in front but Kumar Dharmasena is not interested in the 
slightest. It would have clipped leg, in actual fact. Unlucky. Luckier still 
for Afghanistan is the narrow avoidance of a bowler’s-end run-out when Ghani 
gets off the mark with two. So far, so frenetic.

Australia wins by 275 runs after a spirited display from Afghanistan

Well, that took a little longer than Australia probably would have liked, but 
they’ve blown their rivals away tonight. The eye-popping 275-run winning margin 
was set up with the bat, where David Warner’s brutal 178, Steve Smith’s 
industrious 95 and a helter-skelter 88 from Glenn Maxwell helped them to an 
imposing 417-6.

Never overawaed or panicked, there was an admirable calmness to the 
Afghanistan reply - Asghar Stanikzai apart - even if they knew deep down that 
there was no hope of getting close. Nawroz Mangal did well with 33 and 
Najibullah Zadran’s 24 included a towering 98-metre six off Glenn Maxwell, but 
the Aussie bowlers were too quick and too good in the end.

Mitch Starc ended up with 2-18 from 6 (both of his wickets pure yorker porn), 
Josh Hazlewood was steady with 2-25 off 8 and Mitch Johnson explosive and 
hostile in equal measure with 4-22 off 7.3 overs.

This was a routine game for the Aussies as they fine-tune their campaign, but 
for Afghanistan it was a very clear reminder of the gulf they need to bridge in 
the big-time. Their performances at this World Cup sit right up there among the 
highlights so today should not linger as a negative, just a stepping stone on 
the way to better things.

Thank you all for joining us for all the action today and make sure you stop 
by for more live coverage from this 2015Cricket

Afghanistan bowled out for 142 in 37.3 overs

Hassan is the last man to go, appropriately attempting a flamboyant stroke 
that was a little beyond him. Looking to crack one over mid on he barely gets a 
hold of it and just helps it into the hands of Warner at mid wicket. That’s it 
for the Afghanis. They made Australia earn that but the home side has ended up 
with the heftiest of all World Cup wins.

@rustyjacko <https://twitter.com/rustyjacko> Starc's yorker is getting to be 
the best around. Almost Akramish and almost in poor taste to whip it out today, 
I feel.

37th over: Afghanistan 140-9 (Hassan 5, Shapoor 0)

Maybe the Australian fieldsmen are also fans of Shapoor. The cult hero paceman 
edges through to the cordon but he’s put down when Smith fails to reel in a 
catch low and to his left. It was a very tough chance but he might have held it.
 
Hazlewood gets his second wicket for the night, coaxing a loose waft from 
Zazai, a shot from which a faint inside edge flies through to Haddin behind the 
wicket. There’s only stifled appeals because they feel it’s beyond asking for, 
but Kumar Dharamasena raises a finger to confirm the inevitable.

36th over: Afghanistan 140-8 (Zazai 9, Hassan 4)

3-18 was a welcome return to form from Mitchell Johnson in his first six overs 
tonight and now he’s back in search of a 5-fer. Hassan faces up with an absurd 
number of slip fielders in place, but an edge late in the over fails to carry.
 
35th over: Afghanistan 138-8 (Zazai 9, Hassan 4)

Hazlewood gets a searching yorker on target to Zazai but the latter does well 
to jam it out and preserve his timber. The Aussies are a happy lot tonight; 
between balls Clarke and Finch are horsing around like schoolboys with beaming 
smiles on their faces. All the back-stabbing and angst will happen when they’re 
back in the sheds, I guess.
 
34th over: Afghanistan 135-8 (Zazai 8, Hassan 3)

Starc’s next over is basically one long, tantric build-up towards a climactic 
yorker that never comes. That’s where he’s at as a bowler in ODIs now; you 
expect a wicket nearly every over.

33rd over: Afghanistan 135-8 (Zazai 8, Hassan 3)

Hazlewood reappears now but doesn’t quite nail his yorkers in the same manner 
of his bowling partner. For fans of Rambo headbands and face paint in 
professional sports, you’ll be pleased to know that Hamid Hassan is now at the 
crease. I hope he tries to punch a six. You wouldn’t put it past him.
 
Dawlat Zadran disappears almost as quickly as he arrives. This one comes down 
at 150.6 kmph and takes the base of off stump - another screaming yorker. Starc 
almost looks dowwnbeat as he raises an arm in celebration. Why the long face, 
Mitch?

Gray/Reuters  
Mitch Starc sure knows how to crash a party. Just as we basked in the 
magnificence of Najibullah’s hitting an over earlier, Starc rips in a fast, 
in-swinging yorker that crashes into the base of middle stump and lights up the 
zing bails. Is there a better sight in fast bowling at the moment than Starc’s 
yorkers? Probably not.
 
31st over: Afghanistan 131-6 (Najibullah 24, Zazai 7)

Najibullah you genius! With Maxwell still wheeling away with his off-spin, the 
left-hander skips down the track and thumps a stupendous six over cow - all 98 
metres of it according to an on-screen graphic. It’s up on a roof! That is 
prodigious hitting.

Wood/AFP/Getty Images  
30th over: Afghanistan 122-6 (Najibullah 15, Zazai 7)

Mitchell Starc is back now with his swerving pace and Shane Warne-approved 
body language. He can’t quite body language his way to a wicket but by the end 
of the over he’s built up a decent head of steam.
 
29th over: Afghanistan 121-6 (Najibullah 14, Zazai 7)

“It’s great to see them smiling,” says Shane Warne of the Afghani players. To 
be honest, what’s been notable from them in this tournament is the way that they
haven’t smiled. They’re genuine competitors. Najibullah and Zazai know they 
have no hope hear and it looks like they’re annoyed by that, not resigned to it.

 
28th over: Afghanistan 120-6 (Najibullah 13, Zazai 7)

In a rare slip-up, James Faulkner is a little too overzealous to deliver to 
Zazai and oversteps the mark to cough up a fre hit. He folows that with a wide 
but Zazai can’t get hold of a slower ball next up so the bowlers’ transgression 
goes unpunished. The batsman ends the over with a rueful shake of the head.
 
27th over: Afghanistan 116-6 (Najibullah 13, Zazai 5)

Maxwell crashes back to earth, belted by Najibullah as the latter grows in 
confidence and starts expanding his strokes. From the final delivery he canes a 
quite stunning straight drive down the ground and it’s slamming into the fence 
before the bowler can even look around to see where it’s gone.
 
26th over: Afghanistan 105-6 (Najibullah 6, Zazai 1)

As Zazai gets off the mark, Mark Taylor goes completely off script about the 
length of this tournament, making the kind of observations that will probably 
see his microphone cord yanked sometime in the next five minutes. His heart is 
in the right place, but you have to wonder how familiar he is with the schedule 
for the next one.

25th over: Afghanistan 103-6 (Najibullah 5, Zazai 0)

Maxwell probably fancies himself to rip through a few tail-end wickets here 
but Afsar Zaazai keeps out the remaining four balls of the over to make it a 
wicket-maiden. Zazai can actually handle the bat, to be honest. He’s got an ODI 
half-century to his name.
 
Glenn Maxwell is thrown the ball and comes up with immediate gold, tempting 
Nabi forward into a sweep he doesn’t quite nail, flicking the ball into his own 
helmet and presenting Clarke with the simplest of catches running behind keeper 
Brad Haddin. Nabi reviews, thinking it had merely deflected off his arm, but 
replays indicate otherwise - the edge came first.

24th over: Afghanistan 103-5 (Nabi 2, Najibullah 5)

With Marsh off receiving some medical treatment, Xavier Doherty has made an 
appearance as a sub-fielder in another constricting over from Faulkner. A 
single to Nabi is the only score.
 
23rd over: Afghanistan 102-5 (Nabi 1, Najibullah 5)

Johnson’s bowling with a scrambled seam tonight, as ever, but some odd things 
are happening when he slants one in to the left-hander Najibullah and it moves 
away off the pitch. The Afghanis move past 100 with a Johnson wide and the 
hairy, mean left-arm quick finishes by firing down another testing bouncer. 
Najibullah is up to the challenge.
 
22nd over: Afghanistan 97-5 (Nabi 0, Najibullah 2)

A keenly felt absence in the first few games of the tournament - particularly 
against New Zealand - James Faulkner appears now for his first bowl of the 
night and indeed his first since returning from injury. Najibullah gets him 
away for a single but it’s typical Faulkner fare; variations of pace and canny 
change-ups out the back of the hand.

21st over: Afghanistan 96-5 (Nabi 0, Najibullah 1)

Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi has been joined at the crease by Najibullah 
Zadran now. Both have a decent old shift ahead of them with the Aussie quicks 
raring to go.
 
What a catch! One brings two as Mangal departs. Johnson grabs the ball and 
fires down a short one and rather than yielding to discretion, Mangal flicks it 
dangerously in the direction of the cordon and watches Finch fling himself in 
the air like a salmon and take a wonderful two-handed catch in mid-air. He’s 
from Geelong, Finch - Aussie Rules football territory. You can’t half tell.
 
Shenwari has thrown away all of his hard work and he’s furious with himself. 
I’m furious with him. Michael Clarke is happy, he just floated one up on leg 
stump and watched as the batsman swept it around the corner to Johnson at short 
fine leg. It’s a disappointingly soft dismissal after Shenwari’s gritty display 
of an over earlier.

19th over: Afghanistan 93-3 (Mangal 32, Shenwari 17)

We get one Mitch back - Johnson this time. 2-6 off 3 was a terrific first 
spell and he’s straight back on a probing if slightly full length before 
jamming one in short and getting a jumpy Shenwari straight in the grill of the 
helmet. It’s not condescending to call Shenwari a streetfighter because he 
genuinely does look like he wants to punch someone but instead he reacts to the 
Johnson bouncer by clobbering him for a boundary past mid off. Superb stuff.

17th over: Afghanistan 85-3 (Mangal 31, Shenwari 10)

Marsh’s concern seems to be a leg or groin complaint but somewhat 
disconcertingly, he’s thrown the ball and asked to keep bowling. Surely it’s 
worth a visit to the physios room first, no? Apparently not. He struggles away 
manfully in the final over before the drinks break but finishes by engaging in 
animated conversation with Clarke, the gist of which seems to be, ‘err, can I 
go off now or what?’

16th over: Afghanistan 82-3 (Mangal 31, Shenwari 8)

As Clarke hurries his way through another over, Marsh continues to look very 
proppy and uncomfortable in the outfield. Mangal finishes the over by lapping 
two down to fine leg and the Afghanistan pair is making steady progress now.
 
15th over: Afghanistan 78-3 (Mangal 28, Shenwari 7)

If you were to judge it by the rabid intensity of David Warner’s fielding, 
you’d have no idea that this match is a one-sided one. He’d be excused for 
resting on his laurels after his batting heroics but he’s haring around and 
throwing himself into dives at the boundary when Marsh continues to get tonked 
about. His first two overs have gone for 22, Marsh. To make matters worse he’s 
pulled up lame after the over. Watch this space.

14th over: Afghanistan 71-3 (Mangal 27, Shenwari 2)

Clarke’s aim is pretty clear at the moment; sprint through as many overs as he 
can and give his quicks some time to gather themseleves for another onslaught.

Gray/Reuters  
13th over: Afghanistan 67-3 (Mangal 24, Shenwari 1)

Where Stanikzai failed, Mangal has succeeded. Mitchell Marsh appears to 
relieve Johnson and is welcomed to the fold with two towering sixes over cow 
and then a more classical cover drive for three. He really laid into the first 
of those sixes, Mangal. Just blasted it. Haddin has a forgettable moment to 
finish the over when he lets through four byes. This match is many things but 
dull is not one of them.
 
12th over: Afghanistan 48-3 (Mangal 9, Shenwari 1)

He copped a bit of grief earlier for not having a bat, but Michael Clarke has 
exercised his discretion here and given himself a trundle. His first over is 
pretty innocuous stuff so Shenwari is off the mark with ease.
 
11th over: Afghanistan 46-3 (Mangal 8, Shenwari 0)

Shenwari is at the crease now. He made 96 against Scotland, what can he pull 
off tonight?
 
There’s nothing surprising about this one. Stanikzai had shown his hand in all 
nine previous balls he’d faced when he stepped towards leg and carved Johnson 
high in the air in the direction of third man. There’s a moment of panic when 
it looks like the Australian fielders will collide in Waugh-Gillespie style but 
Steve Smith both snares the catch and avoids any unscheduled dental work. That 
was an insane innings from Stanikzai, idiocy of a type rarely seen in the 
somewhat dreary world of professional sport. There should be far more of it.

10th over: Afghanistan 44-2 (Mangal 8, Stanikzai 2)

Hazlewood feels a counter-punch in this over in the shape of two contrasting 
shots from Mangal, the first a classical cover drive to the boundary and the 
next a straighter effort that bounces over the bowlers’ head and also reaches 
the rope. Hazlewood grins like a loon, but I don’t think he’s very happy.

Paul Ewart is also taking the positives from his situation. “Hello Russell, 
long-suffering England supporter here with an urgent question: What was David 
Warner thinking? Does he not know that 243 is a par score at this ground in 
this year at this time, with a cricket bat? Is this amateur hour?”
 
9th over: Afghanistan 36-2 (Mangal 0, Stanikzai 2)

Asghar Stanikzai appears at the crease know and cracks a wonderful cut shot 
off Johnson, one that would have gone close to the boundary had David Warner 
not dived and stopped it in acrobatic style. Warner’s dismount is so effective 
that a run-out looks a possibility, but the batsmen stand their ground.

Stanikzai is not backward in coming forward, it must be said. He’s trying to 
belt the cover off everything Johnson sends down. It’s all manic hand-speed and 
swiveling shoulders, which scares Glenn Maxwell away from the short leg 
position and also puts that poor young kid from earlier on notice too. If 
Stanikzai makes contact with any of these heaves it’ll be up in Row Z.
 
Ahmadi departs in most unfortunate circumnstances when after hammering 
Hazlewood straight he’s denied any runs, let alone a boundary, when the ball 
thumps into his partners’ body. Two balls later he fishes outside off stump and 
sends a thick edge through to Clarke in the cordon.


“That’s something Ahmadi will have to learn for the next time he plays here in 
Perth,” saysCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> Australia board 
member Mark Taylor. Anything to share there, Tubby?

7th over: Afghanistan 30-1 (Ahmadi 11, Mangal 0)

Nawroz Mangal is the new batsman for Afghanistan and he’s lucky not to catch 
an absolute snorter from Johnson first up because he struggles with the pace to 
start with. No shame there because it’s coming down at sizzling pace.
 
Mitch Johnson was nearly belted all the way back across the Tasman against New 
Zealand and he doesn’t exactly set the world alight early in his first over 
here. He’s turned for four byes and fires down a wide but then Ghani middles 
one straight into the hands of James Faulkner at a straight, short mid-on. The 
ball had angled in a little and although it was struck well, Faulkner barely 
had to move.

6th over: Afghainstan 25-0 (Javed Ahmadi 11 Usman Ghani 12)

Hazlewood catches a severe case of the wides in this over, firing down two and 
just never quite looking like he’s going to fire. Might it be time for an early 
bowling change? He’ll probably bowl in bursts anyway.
 
5th over: Afghainstan 22-0 (Javed Ahmadi 11 Usman Ghani 11)

Ghani looks solid again here. He’s compact and economical in his movements to 
Starc and even clips a two around the corner from a ball that rose awkwardly 
into his ribs. Starc’s hardly hit his straps here, mind you. He’s muttering 
away at the end of the over, probably a sign that he’s off his game a little.

Brendon Julian finishes the over by calling Afghanistan “minnows”. Shame on 
you, Brendan, shame on you. They’re magnificos.
 
4th over: Afghainstan 16-0 (Javed Ahmadi 10, Usman Ghani 6)

There’s been some unconvincing defensive work happening so far but given 
width, Ahmadi belts Hazlewood for three and his expansiveness is contagious; 
Ghani clatters two more through the same region. That prompts a somewhat 
predictable response from Hazlewood; a steepling bouncer past Ghani’s left 
nostril.

This is positive stuff from Afghanistan though - not perturbed by the 
conditions or threatened by Australia’s tall timber - they’re on the offensive.
 
3rd over: Afghainstan 9-0 (Javed Ahmadi 7, Usman Ghani 2)

Is Starc getting a little carried away here? Shouldn’t he just bowl 
breathtaking yorkers, ball after ball? Do I place too much stock in the ability 
of cricketers to live a perfect manifestation of my dreams for them?

In this over it’s not until the fifth ball that he produces a 150kmph 
sandshoe-crusher. What was he doing the rest of the time? Being human, I guess. 
Usman Ghani might be considered super-human to have kept that jaffa out, now 
that I consider it. As you were.
 
2nd over: Afghainstan 8-0 (Javed Ahmadi 6, Usman Ghani 2)

Josh Hazlewood is back in the Aussie line-up today and he’s immediately 
swinging the ball in a gorgeous, exaggerated curve away from Ahmadi. The latter 
clips one around the corner for a single to fine leg but he might cause some 
problems here, the big New South Welshman. Afghanistan? They don’t look as 
flustered as they might be by this searing pace and sideways movement.
 
1st over: Afghainstan 7-0 (Javed Ahmadi 5, Usman Ghani 2)

Fresh from his devastating spell against New Zealand, Mitchell Marsh takes the 
new ball for Australia with Javed Omani facing the music. Starc’s first two 
deliveries both swing in sharply outside the off stump of the right hander and 
Glenn Maxwell hovers close by at short leg.

It’s a little streaky, but Ahmadi under-edges four between Brad Haddin and 
first slip to pick up the first four runs of the innigs. Next up Starc thinks 
he’s pinned him in front but Kumar Dharmasena is not interested in the 
slightest. It would have clipped leg, in actual fact. Unlucky. Luckier still 
for Afghanistan is the narrow avoidance of a bowler’s-end run-out when Ghani 
gets off the mark with two. So far, so frenetic.
 
Some reading material before the Afghanistan innings gets started

Virat Kohli has gone off on one, ranting at a journalist in Perth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/04/india-vice-captain-virat-kohli-rant>
. A week back everyone was having a whinge that the Indians wouldn’t talk to 
any media. They’re certainly making up for lost time.

Meanwhile, this kid has to be in the running for the ‘man of the match’ award 
for his brave front after being clocked by a David Warner six. His Dad? Not so 
much...
