Sánchez scored 16 goals during his debut season for Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> in 2014-15 but the Chile 
international has struggled this campaign.

“When I don’t score goals I feel like I’ve failed the team and I feel guilty. 
I go home, can’t sleep and I just think I have to play better,” he told the 
club’s website.

“I think that I’ve adapted really well in terms of fitting into the club and 
it’s been very good but at the same time I’m not the kind of person to become 
complacent or think: ‘That’s it.’”

Arsenal continue their bid for a first FA Cup hat-trick since Blackburn Rovers 
in the 1880s when they play Watford at the Emirates Stadium in the 
quarter-finals on Sunday, havingdefeated Hull City 4-0

 in Monday’s fifth-round replay.
