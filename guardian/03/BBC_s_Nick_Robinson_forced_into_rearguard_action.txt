BBC political editor Nick Robinson was forced to act quickly on BBC2's Daily 
Politics 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03q4pgm/Daily_Politics_15_01_2014/> when 
the Queen song Fat Bottomed Girls started blasting out of his iPad. MPs 
Caroline Flint and Shailesh Vara looked bemused as the track interrupted their 
argument about bankers' bonuses, while host Andrew Neil coolly asked Robinson 
"Is that you or me?" Robinson joked: "I'm going to turn it off before the 
really embarrassing lyrics start." Flint and Vara sadly declined his request to 
name the lyrics, which are: "Are you gonna take me home tonight?/Oh, down 
beside that red firelight/Are you gonna let it all hang out?/Fat bottomed 
girls/You make the rockin' world go round." An interesting glimpse into 
Robinson's taste in music â€“ afterhis Twitter critisms of the content of her 
Radio 4 Today show

, Monkey doubted that the BBC political editor was a PJ Harvey fan.
