American Psycho <http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0144084> author Bret Easton 
Ellis has criticised a planned sequel to the film of his famous book.Peoplenews 
<http://www.peoplenews.com/news/0,3430,5313,00.html> reports that Ellis has had 
nothing to do with the proposed film and has said that: "I have problems with 
it."

The feature, directed by Morgan J Freeman, will focus on a female student who 
becomes a serial killer after surviving an attack by Patrick Bateman, the lead 
character from the first film, who was played byChristian Bale 
<http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Bale,+Christian>. 

But Ellis said the idea of a female serial killer is bizarre. During his 
research he found only one recorded case and said most women described as such 
were just the partners of men who committed the murders. "Serial killers are 
driven by testosterone. It seems totally untenable to have a woman as a serial 
killer," he said.

Ellis added that he did not see how a sequel would work anyway. "I don't see 
how there can be a follow-up to the movie when they had Christian Bale 
ultimately just drawing pictures of his horrible killings. He never touched 
anyone," he said. "I have nothing to do with the movie."
