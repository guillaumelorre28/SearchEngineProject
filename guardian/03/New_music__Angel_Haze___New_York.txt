Twenty-year-old rapper Angel Haze is an internet phenomenon. Most of the 
videos she posts on herYouTube channel 
<http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUjHM2lYtKm41QrIorWewGuw&feature=plcp> 
get at least 60,000 views and she claims to have had a number of different 
channels under different aliases that she has closed once they reached a 
million views.

Filmed in her living room, these videos usually take the form of half-rapped, 
half-spoken poems, with recent entries entitled Side Chicks, Fuck Who Likes 
YOU! and If You're Contemplating Suicide, This Is for You, a poem of support 
for those affected by bullying, problem parents and unrequited love.

"I know how it feels to swallow some pills and hope that you die," she spits 
at one point, an allusion to her painful childhood growing up as part of the 
Greater Apostolic Faith, a church Haze has since referred to as a cult. After 
her parents were ostracised from the church, Haze became the family therapist.

It was after she quit school following years of bullying that Haze started 
posting videos from her Washington DC living room, refining an audacious flow 
that spews out complex rhyme after complex rhyme. On New York, the first single 
to be taken from her forthcoming Reservation EP and produced by New York's the 
83rd, Haze delivers menacing proclamations of her own greatness, at one point 
referring to herself as Satan, before hissing: "I love it when these bitches 
know that I'm better than them."

The production is dry as a bone, all finger-click beats, big lazy bass drops 
and strange vocal samples that fade in and out.

â€¢ The Reservation EP is out on 17 July.
