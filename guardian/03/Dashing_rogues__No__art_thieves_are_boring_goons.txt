Art theft <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art-theft> is ugly. People 
love to picture art thieves as dashing cat burglars who look like George 
Clooney and have a raffish charm that makes their crimes forgivable. In 
reality, they are mostly gangsters and professional criminals who have no 
feelings at all about the masterpieces they steal to use as collateral in 
underworld deals or with hopes of secret sales to billionaires. They are boring 
idiots. It is the art they prey on that is interesting and bohemian.

The recovery of yet another stolen picture by the great Norwegian 
expressionist Edvard Munch is a reminder of just how seedy and unromantic art 
theft is in the 21st century.Munch’s art is frequently stolen

.Historien <http://www.xn--munchikrager-6jb.no/historien>, a lithograph that he 
made of one of his murals in the University of Oslo, was probably taken for the 
value of the artist’s name alone, which is said to give it a value of €250,000.

Far more revered works by Munch have been stolen and recovered in recent 
years, including two versions of his most famously desperate image of all, The 
Scream. Is the Oslo crime world full of existentialists so haunted by the 
blood-red skies and isolated wraiths of Munch’s anguished imagination that they 
are driven to break into museums? The answer is no.

After The Scream was stolen from Oslo’s Munch Museum in 2004, and seriously 
damaged while being stored in a van painted like the Batmobile, I reported on 
the crime anddiscovered a sad story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/feb/17/art.arttheft> of brutal, 
cynical and heartless theft. The men who raided the museum at gunpoint had to 
be told where The Scream and Madonna were; they could not recognise these 
iconic artworks. The painting was done for money alone by criminals involved in 
drug dealing.

At least The Scream could be restored, and it is now as terrifying as ever 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/23/munch-van-gogh-review-amsterdam-edvard-munch-vincent-van-gogh-scream-birth-of-expressionism>
. The theft ofCaravaggio’s Nativity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/dec/22/caravaggio-art-mafia-italy>
 in Palermo in 1969 is more tragic. The mafia stole this great painting and 
destroyed it. End of story – although that won’t stop conspiracy theorists and 
fabulists trying to pretend it is still hidden somewhere.

Was there ever a time when stylish art thieves stole for love, not greed? The 
most famous art crime in Victorian Britain was the theft of Gainsborough’s 
portrait of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, from Thomas Agnew & Sons gallery 
in 1876. The thief turned out to be Adam Worth, nicknamedthe “Napoleon of crime”
 <http://www.artrobberies.com/32-art-theft-stories/category/thomas-gainsborough>
 and reputed to be Arthur Conan Doyle’s model for Moriarty. Worth made a tidy 
profit by selling the picture back to Agnew’s and today it can be seen as 
Chatsworth House.

What does Gainsborough have in common with Munch and Caravaggio? In the 19th 
century he was an iconic, high-price artist and his portrait of Georgiana was 
considered especially valuable. Agnew’s had bought it for a high price. Worth 
was attracted by a famous name and big money. Similarly the mafia took the 
Nativity just as Caravaggio’s fame and marketability reached new heights. As 
for Munch, his art has hitstaggering auction values 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17926519> in the same era that he 
has become the favourite of art thieves.

The brutality of art theft is the ugly reflection of the legitimate art 
market: it follows the money. The more absurdly art is priced, the more it is 
seen as a commodity, the more it attracts the attention of the crime world. 
Keep your romantic ideas about art theft for pulp fiction. The reality is a 
dark mirror of the insane liaison of art and money.
