A peaceful Sunday in Ambridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/03/ambridge-a-bit-too-eastenders>
. Helen, whose judgment is never likely to give Solomon sleepless nights, 
thought it a good idea to give her abusive husband, Rob, a simple Sunday supper 
– tuna bake with apple pie and custard – before announcing that she was leaving 
him. Wiser wives would prefer to break these glad tidings on a postcard from 
Ayers Rock.

 It all led to what politicians call a full and frank exchange of views and 
Rob pinned to the floor of Blossom Cottage with a knife. (This worried me for a 
while as it would have worriedMiss Marple.

 Neither a fish knife nor a pie slice seemed quite cut out for the job.)Rob and 
Helen

 made it safely past the tuna bake but when the apple pie caught fire she spoke 
up. “I don’t care! I’m leaving and taking Henry with me.” Henry, for late 
arrivals at the scene of the crime, is her small son. They say everyone’s for 
mother love, apple pie and tax relief and here we have the first two in one 
explosive bundle.

The Archers murder: a bit too EastEnders?

 Two and a half years of slow thumbscrew torture came to a helter-skelter, 
hugger-mugger confusing conclusion. Did Rob taunt Helen to kill herself? Or 
dare her to kill him? Is he, indeed, dead at all?

 It was, unusually, a two-hander. One of those head-to-head encounters that 
are used sparingly but to great effect in EastEnders whereSean O’Connor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/18/bbc-seeks-an-archers-editor-who-can-plough-on-without-upsetting-listeners>
, The Archers’ exciting editor, comes from and where he is shortly returning. 
Ambridge, which allows no occasion to go uncelebrated, is even now planning a 
pageant.

 Helen and Rob were alone as they have always been alone. A village where 
every second person is related to Helen and no one minds their own business has 
been blindingly oblivious to something very nasty going on in the woodshed. 
Coercive control is not an easy crime to spot or even spell. It’s quite hard to 
put your finger on it. As Helen told a helpline, helplessly: “I can’t explain 
exactly what he does.” It is probably not unlike being married to Dr Jekyll. 
Everyone pities him for having such a twitchy wife.

 Helen’s pregnancy has lent a particular poignancy to her slavery. Now there 
is the question of the baby, Rob’s unborn son. Just when you thought it was all 
over, it has barely begun.

If one good thing has come out of this shocking affair, it has at least 
provided a cracking case for PC Harrison Burns, Ambridge’s ineffective sleuth, 
who conspicuously failed to find who stole the bunting or who burned down the 
henhouse. Harrison kept his head while all about him, particularly Helen, were 
having hysterics. When her friend, Kirsty, shouted “Helen, shut up!” we heard 
in the silence Rob’s shallow breathing despite deep knife wounds to his stomach 
and chest. “He’s lucky to be alive,” said the the ambulance doctor sternly. 
“Someone wasn’t messing around.” Someone was duly cuffed, cautioned and driven 
off to a police cell. In the circumstances Pat’s assurance to young Henry that 
“Mummy will be coming home soon” seems, on the face of it, optimistic.
