Following news that rapper Angel Haze self-leaked her debut 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/19/angel-haze-leaks-album-island-soundcloud>
, her label have announced that they will be releasing a digital version of 
Dirty Gold this month.

Just days after Island revealed that her album was confirmed for March 2014, 
the New Yorker, also known as Raykeea Wilson, posted 12 of the LP's songs to
Soundcloud in a bid 
<https://soundcloud.com/angelhazeym/sets/angel-haze-dirty-gold/> to harness 
control of her music. Despite the label allegedly removing the tracks from the 
website, her songs had already been shared by more than 150,000 Twitter 
followers.

"It's so annoying that my label could tell me that if I fucking finished my 
album before the summer it would be out this year," she wrote ina series of 
Tweets <https://twitter.com/AngelHaze/>yesterday. "I turned down so much shit 
to be sure that I could finish this album ... I sat my ass down and came up 
with this music WHEN I HAD NOTHING."

Dirty Gold will now be available on 30 December 2013 and features production 
from Greg Kurstin, Markus Dravs and a song written by Grammy-nominated 
singer-songwriterSia <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/dec/03/2>. The 
album includes tracks such as Sing About Me Echelon (It's My Way), A Tribe 
Called Red, Deep Sea Diver, Black Dahlia and Planes Fly.
