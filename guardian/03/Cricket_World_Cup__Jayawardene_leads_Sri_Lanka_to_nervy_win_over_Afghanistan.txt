There were many moments when it was impossible to distinguish 
which team were the associates. When Asghar Stanikzai or 
Mohammad Nabi were batting for Afghanistan there was a power 
and a presence that one or two of the “big” sides in this 
tournament would welcome in their middle order. Later when the two new balls 
were in the hands of the Zadrans, Dawlat and the giant Shapoor, there was 
sufficient menace to dismiss both the Sri Lankan openers for golden ducks.

So far for entertainment and drama in this tournament do not 
follow the money; follow the associates. In the end the Sri 
Lankans, lacklustre at the start of both innings, prevailed by 
four wickets with 10 balls to spare – but it was a far from 
straightforward victory. Without the imperious Mahela Jayawardene, who hit a 
century, and a frenetic late flurry from Thisara Perera – 47 from 26 balls – 
they would surely have lost.

Cloud hung over the delightful University Oval at the start 
and for a moment one was pining for the roof that permanently covers the rugby 
stadium across the road to be transported over the square. Angelo Mathews was 
delighted to win the toss and bowl but his smile did not last for long.

There was not much venom from his opening bowlers; a catch was 
spilt at second slip and the Afghans’ progress, although never 
entirely serene, was steady enough all the way to the second 
powerplay. By then Stanikzai had hit a run-a-ball half- 
century punctuated with strokes of startling power. Early on a 
pull drive off Mathews flew high into a distant temporary 
stand, where Jamie Gough, a physiotherapist clad in the 
requisite orange T-shirt, nonchalantly held one of those 
lucrative one-handed catches. 

The captain, Nabi, clearly a class act, also oozed 
authority. However, from the second powerplay, which began after 35 
overs with the score at 169 for four, the innings lost its impetus. 
With his first indiscretion Nabi heaved and missed against 
Lasith Malinga and thereafter Afghanistan could only stutter 
to 232. 

After half an hour of the Sri Lankan innings that seemed more 
than enough. Lahiru Thirimanne was lbw to the first ball 
bowled by Dawlat Zadran. Then Tillakaratne Dilshan nicked his 
first delivery from Shapoor Zadran. Kumar Sangakkara tried to 
suggest imperial indifference to Sri Lanka’s plight but this 
was unconvincing since he almost managed to run himself out 
twice in 10 minutes. On both occasions a direct hit would 
have left him out of the picture. 

Now Hamid Hassan entered the fray with his coloured headband 
and painted face. He charged in from around the wicket at 
Sangakkara and soon clattered his middle stump. Not long after 
he persuaded Dimuth Karunaratne to edge to slip, confirming 
that this trio of Afghan pace bowlers looked the equal of 
several long-established pacemen in the competition. This 
impression was briefly threatened when Hassan had problems 
with his left boot. What did he do? He beckoned his fast 
bowling colleague, Shapoor, and they swopped left boots until 
the end of the over. Gnarled old pros would have halted 
proceedings for 10 minutes while a 12th man delivered a 
selection of replacement footwear. 

Now Sri Lanka were indebted to Jayawardene, who apart from a 
few dodgy calls, played a wonderful, princely, non-violent 
innings. This is his last tournament and he does not want to 
depart before the quarter-finals. Mathews was far less fluent 
but he clung on as harassed captains tend to do. After 
adding 126 with Jayawardene, Mathews was run out trying to 
steal a single. In the next over Jayawardene glided the ball 
straight to third man. Then Sri Lanka were indebted to Perera 
alongside a passive Jeevan Mendis. They conjured the requisite 
55 runs in seven overs. 

Jayawardene acknowledged afterwards that Sri Lanka had “dodged 
a bullet”; Mathews admitted that his side needed to improve 
very quickly. Meanwhile, Afghanistan, despite losing the game, 
had won a host of new friends.
