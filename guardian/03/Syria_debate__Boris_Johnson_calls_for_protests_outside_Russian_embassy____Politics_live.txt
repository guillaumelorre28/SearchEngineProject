Boris Johnson's speech on Syria - Summary and analysis

This was Boris Johnson’s first speech in a debate in the Commons in his role 
as foreign secretary, and also an opportunity to get some flavour of what the 
May government’s (non-Brexit) foreign policy is going to be like. Johnson 
famously wrote a biography of Winston Churchill and at one point this afternoon 
the the ultra-hawkish Labour MPJohn Woodock urged Johnson to adopt a 
Churchillian approach to Russian aggression in Syria. (See2.56pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98#block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98>
 As mayor of London and a Telegraph columnist Johnson generally tended to be on 
the more interventionist end of the scale, and so perhaps MPs were expecting 
him to adopt a rather more muscular approach to Syria policy than was adopted 
by his predecessor, Philip Hammond.

If so, they will have been disappointed. Johnson’s language was probably a bit 
more condemnatory than Hammond’s would have been in a debate like this. But if 
you listened carefully to what he said, he was actually adopting a rather 
cautious, dovish stance. This may be more a reflection of May’s views than 
Johnson’s.(Nick Timothy, her co-chief of staff and philosophical alter ego, is 
on record as saying foreign policy should “value stability, “respect 
sovereignty” and avoid ideological crusades.) 
<http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/05/nick-timothy-the-chilcot-report-is-finally-coming-but-we-already-know-we-havent-learned-the-lessons-of-iraq.html>
 But it meant that if any MPs were hoping for Churchill, what they got instead 
was more Stanley Baldwin.

Here are the key points from his speech.

 * Johnson tentatively backed the call for Syria and Russia to be investigated 
for war crimes by the international criminal court. But he played down 
prospects of anything happening quickly, saying some ICC prosecutions only take 
place decades after the offences are committed. He told MPs that the targeting 
of hospitals in Aleppo amounted to a war crime. 
Every hospital in eastern Aleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> is 
believed to have been bombed, some of them more than once, and several have 
been put out of action. Hospitals have been targeted with such frequency and 
precision that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this must be 
deliberate policy. The House will know that intentionally attacking a hospital 
amounts to a war crime. It is time, I think, for all these incidents to be 
fully and properly investigated with a view to assembling the necessary 
evidence to ensure that justice is done. And yes, to answer the question that 
has been raised by several honourable and right honourable members, we do think 
there could be advantages in the [international criminal court] procedures. And 
I would remind this House that in recent history war criminals have been 
successfully prosecuted decades after their offences.

He also expressed some support for the French bid to get the ICC to launch an 
investigation into Syria and Russia, 
<http://news.trust.org/item/20161010084755-l2s3l/> saying he was “personally 
very attracted to the idea of holding these people to account before the 
international criminal court”. But later, at the Number 10 lobby briefing, 
Downing Street sounded a bit less keen.
Paul Waugh (@paulwaugh) 
Boris 'personally attracted' to pursuing Syria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> war crimes through ICC. No,10 asked 
if that's Govt policy, unaware of details of Boris words

<https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/785863360227250176> 
 * He played down the prospect of backing no-fly zones over Syria. Andrew 
Mitchell,the Conservative former international development secretary who called 
the debate, demanded the creation of no-fly zones and other MPs backed the idea 
too. Johnson said he had “every sympathy” for what they were proposing and that 
he would consult allies on the idea. But he also signalled strongly that he 
would eventually say no. Pointing out that the Commons was opposed to sending 
troops to Syria, he added: 
But we cannot commit to a no-fly zone unless we are prepared to ... shoot down 
planes or helicopters that violate that zone. We need to think very carefully 
about the consequences.

The Labour MP John Woodcock read his comments as a move towards no-fly zones.
John Woodcock (@JWoodcockMP) 
Foreign sec says all options being considered in Syria bar UK boots on ground 
- including no-fly zone or no bombing zone. *some* progress
 <https://twitter.com/JWoodcockMP/status/785854359829700609> October 11, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/JWoodcockMP/status/785854359829700609> 
But the Independent’s John Rentoul probably has a more realistic 
interpretation of Johnson’s words.
John Rentoul (@JohnRentoul) 
Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> didn't use these 
precise words, but his message on Syria was: I am not going to start WW3 by 
shooting down Russian planes.
 <https://twitter.com/JohnRentoul/status/785857246085414912> October 11, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/JohnRentoul/status/785857246085414912> 
 * Johnson said he would like to see people protest about Syria outside the 
Russian embassy. The Labour MP Ann Clywd proposed this earlier (see 2.27pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fce82de4b03b22b4fb2444#block-57fce82de4b03b22b4fb2444>
 and Johnson said he agreed with her. 
I agree with [Ann Clywd]. I would certainly like to see demonstrations outside 
the Russian embassy. Where is the Stop the War Coalition at the moment? Where 
are they?

 * He said he was worried that “the wells of outrage [about events in Syria] 
are growing exhausted”. 
 * He said Russia was in danger of becoming an “international pariah” because 
of what was happening in Syria. 
If Russia continues in it current path, then I believe that great county is in 
danger of becoming a pariah nation. If President Putin’s strategy is to restore 
the greatness and the glory of Russia, then I believe he risks seeing his 
ambition turn to ashes in the face of international contempt for what is 
happening in Syria.

 * But he said the “best hope” was to persuade Russia to “do the right thing”. 
Johnson said the UK had urged the EU to adopt a tough line on sanctions against 
Russia, but he pointedly refused to commit the UK to pushing for tougher 
sanctions. He also declined to back a call from Labour’sToby Perkins for the 
international community to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia because of what 
is happening in Syria. Summing up his position Johnson said: 
In the long term the only realistic solution is to persuade both sides to have 
a ceasefire and then to work through to a political solution ...

Our best hope is to persuade the Russians that it is profoundly in the 
interests of Russia to take the initiative, to win the acclaim of the 
international community, do the right thing in Syria, call off their puppets in 
the Assad regime, stop the bombing and bring peace to Aleppo and have a genuine 
ceasefire. That is the way.

 * He said the Aleppo siege was the worst in the civil war. 
At this moment the 275,000 inhabitants of eastern Aleppo are under siege. They 
are isolated from the outside world, subjected to constant bombardment and 
prevented from receiving humanitarian aid. Their power and water supplies have 
been cut off in what has become a signature tactic of the Assad killing 
machine, to besiege civilian populations. And what we are now seeing in eastern 
Aleppo is the biggest and potentially the deadliest siege since the outbreak of 
Syria’s civil war over five years ago.

Emily Thornberry intervenes to ask what can be done to get rid of the jihadi 
fighters from easterAleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo>.

Johnson says this cannot happen while the city is still being bombed.

He says the best hope is to persuade Russia to do the right thing.

He says he will look at Staffan de Mistura’s plan to lead out the jihadist 
fighters. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/aleppo-could-be-destroyed-by-christmas-warns-un-envoy-for-syria>
 That sounds emminently sensible, he says.

And that’s it. Johnson’s speech, and the debate, is over.

I will post a summary soon.

Johnson plays down prospect of imposing no-fly zones over Syria

Johnson says many MPs urged Britain to go further.

Some people called for no-fly zones.

He says he has “every sympathy” for these proposals.

But the government does not support putting boots on the ground. And you 
cannot have no-fly zones unless you are willing to shoot down planes and 
helicopters.

Johnson says he will consult people about this, including those involved in 
imposing no-fly zones over Iraq in the 1990s.

Johnson says he would like to see protests outside Russian embassy over Syria

Johnson says “all the available evidence” points to Russia being responsible 
for the recent attack on an aid convoy. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/un-aid-convoy-attack-syria-us-russia>

He says he is worried that “the wells of outrage are growing exhausted”.

He says there is no commensurate horror about Russia. Where are the Stop the 
War protests outside the Russian embassy, he asks.

 * Johnson says he would like to see protests outside the Russian embassy over

It is up to us in government to show a lead.

He says he thinks the government is having an effect. Russia has had to use 
its veto five times in the UN security council to protect its position.

Johnson says there is a case for taking Syrian war crimes to international 
criminal court

Johnson says the citizens of eastern Aleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> are under seige. Their power and 
water supplies have been cut off. This is a signature tactic of the Assad 
killing machine. It is the biggest and potentially deadliest siege since the 
civil war started.

He says every hospital in eastern Aleppo has been bombed, some more once, and 
several have been put out of action.

This must be deliberate policy, he says. He says intentionally attacking a 
hospital is a war crime.

He says these attacks must be investigated with a view to taking a case to the 
international criminal court.

 * Johnson says there is a case for taking Syrian war crimes to international 
criminal court. 
He says some cases get taken to the ICC years after they have been committed.

He says he hopes the Commons will take a different view from the one it took 
in 2013, when it decided not to intervene.

Burnham says May misreading referendum because most Britons oppose a hard 
Brexit

Andy Burnham, the Labour candidate for mayor of Greater Manchester and the 
former shadow home secretary, is speaking at the New Economics Foundation 
conference this afternoon. (See 3.05pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fcf0bfe4b03b22b4fb246c#block-57fcf0bfe4b03b22b4fb246c>
He will urge Theresa May to set up a Brexit committee of the nations and 
regions to ensure Brexit policy is not just decided by London. He will say:


Theresa May has got the Brexit negotiations off on entirely the wrong foot and 
needs to change direction. She is working on the assumption that the country 
voted for a hard, confrontational Brexit when there is no evidence to support 
this. In fact, it would seem that the opposite is true – a majority of people 
were against a hard Brexit.

There is a big risk that her handling of these crucial talks could widen the 
divides in our country, not heal them. We need to open our eyes to these risks 
and ensure that all voices and perspectives are fully involved in shaping the 
Brexit negotiations.

Devolution in England was never conceived as part of the answer to Brexit but 
now it must be fully embraced as such. Brexit will have a differential impact 
on different parts of the country and a hard Brexit would hit the poorest areas 
hardest of all. Great effort will be expended to protect the financial sector 
and the City of London, which, while understandable, could lead to trade-offs 
that will damage other sectors.

These issues need to be openly debated and that is why I am asking the prime 
minister to establish a Brexit committee of the nations and regions, with 
places for the devolved governments and the elected mayoralties. The aim of 
that committee should be to seek a fair Brexit that balances the needs of all 
parts of the country. It is essential that Greater Manchester has a place at 
this table.

Heather Stewart

I’m down at the rather nerdy relaunch of the New Economics foundation 
thinktank, 
<http://neweconomics.org/building-a-new-economy-where-people-really-take-control/?_sft_latest=press-releases>
 at a community centre in Waterloo, where among othersEd Miliband and Vince 
Cableare groping for a progressive interpretation of the vote-winning Brexit 
slogan “take back control”.

At the post-lunch session, Miliband, who’s been energised by the battle to 
secure a parliamentary vote on article 50, told the audience the left should 
seize the opportunity of Brexit, which he said was a vote for radical change, 
and warned against focusing only on the detail of the deal with the rest of the 
EU.

If Brexit just becomes about the negotiations, we’re going to be stuffed, 
because all of the weight of the mandate will be borne by the rules on free 
movement and so on. We have got to have a bigger vision for where the country’s 
going.

Of course, Theresa May’s already fleshed out what kind of mandate she thinks 
the Brexit vote gives her, including legitimising a much tougher immigration 
regime - and Cable was much blunter. He said:

The electorate has moved to the right, which was reflected in a rather brutal 
way in the referendum.

He said voters he spoke to during the last general election combined fear of a 
left-wing government, with identity politics - patriotism/nationalism. “We have 
to try and find a way of breaking through the tribal divisions on the centre 
left,” he said, adding that many of the 48% of voters who rejected Brexit feel 
“horribly dispossessed”.

Miliband tellingly said the left must find a way to “surmount” identity 
politics; Cable said Harold Wilson and Tony Blair managed to articulate a 
left-of-centre version of patriotism.

This was Boris Johnson’s first speech in a debate in the Commons in his role 
as foreign secretary, and also an opportunity to get some flavour of what the 
May government’s (non-Brexit) foreign policy is going to be like. Johnson 
famously wrote a biography of Winston Churchill and at one point this afternoon 
the the ultra-hawkish Labour MPJohn Woodock urged Johnson to adopt a 
Churchillian approach to Russian aggression in Syria. (See2.56pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98#block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98>
 As mayor of London and a Telegraph columnist Johnson generally tended to be on 
the more interventionist end of the scale, and so perhaps MPs were expecting 
him to adopt a rather more muscular approach to Syria policy than was adopted 
by his predecessor, Philip Hammond.

If so, they will have been disappointed. Johnson’s language was probably a bit 
more condemnatory than Hammond’s would have been in a debate like this. But if 
you listened carefully to what he said, he was actually adopting a rather 
cautious, dovish stance. This may be more a reflection of May’s views than 
Johnson’s.(Nick Timothy, her co-chief of staff and philosophical alter ego, is 
on record as saying foreign policy should “value stability, “respect 
sovereignty” and avoid ideological crusades.) 
<http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/05/nick-timothy-the-chilcot-report-is-finally-coming-but-we-already-know-we-havent-learned-the-lessons-of-iraq.html>
 But it meant that if any MPs were hoping for Churchill, what they got instead 
was more Stanley Baldwin.

Here are the key points from his speech.

 * Johnson tentatively backed the call for Syria and Russia to be investigated 
for war crimes by the international criminal court. But he played down 
prospects of anything happening quickly, saying some ICC prosecutions only take 
place decades after the offences are committed. He told MPs that the targeting 
of hospitals in Aleppo amounted to a war crime. 
Every hospital in eastern Aleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> is 
believed to have been bombed, some of them more than once, and several have 
been put out of action. Hospitals have been targeted with such frequency and 
precision that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this must be 
deliberate policy. The House will know that intentionally attacking a hospital 
amounts to a war crime. It is time, I think, for all these incidents to be 
fully and properly investigated with a view to assembling the necessary 
evidence to ensure that justice is done. And yes, to answer the question that 
has been raised by several honourable and right honourable members, we do think 
there could be advantages in the [international criminal court] procedures. And 
I would remind this House that in recent history war criminals have been 
successfully prosecuted decades after their offences.

He also expressed some support for the French bid to get the ICC to launch an 
investigation into Syria and Russia, 
<http://news.trust.org/item/20161010084755-l2s3l/> saying he was “personally 
very attracted to the idea of holding these people to account before the 
international criminal court”. But later, at the Number 10 lobby briefing, 
Downing Street sounded a bit less keen.
Paul Waugh (@paulwaugh) 
Boris 'personally attracted' to pursuing Syria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> war crimes through ICC. No,10 asked

<https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/785863360227250176> 
 * He played down the prospect of backing no-fly zones over Syria. Andrew 
Mitchell,the Conservative former international development secretary who called 
the debate, demanded the creation of no-fly zones and other MPs backed the idea 
too. Johnson said he had “every sympathy” for what they were proposing and that 
he would consult allies on the idea. But he also signalled strongly that he 
would eventually say no. Pointing out that the Commons was opposed to sending 
troops to Syria, he added: 
But we cannot commit to a no-fly zone unless we are prepared to ... shoot down 
planes or helicopters that violate that zone. We need to think very carefully 
about the consequences.

The Labour MP John Woodcock read his comments as a move towards no-fly zones.

Foreign sec says all options being considered in Syria bar UK boots on ground 
- including no-fly zone or no bombing zone. *some* progress

<https://twitter.com/JWoodcockMP/status/785854359829700609> 
But the Independent’s John Rentoul probably has a more realistic 
interpretation of Johnson’s words.
John Rentoul (@JohnRentoul) 
Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> didn't use these 
precise words, but his message on Syria was: I am not going to start WW3 by 
shooting down Russian planes.
 <https://twitter.com/JohnRentoul/status/785857246085414912> October 11, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/JohnRentoul/status/785857246085414912> 
 * Johnson said he would like to see people protest about Syria outside the 
Russian embassy. The Labour MP Ann Clywd proposed this earlier (see 2.27pm) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fce82de4b03b22b4fb2444#block-57fce82de4b03b22b4fb2444>
 and Johnson said he agreed with her. 
I agree with [Ann Clywd]. I would certainly like to see demonstrations outside 
the Russian embassy. Where is the Stop the War Coalition at the moment? Where 
are they?

 * He said he was worried that “the wells of outrage [about events in Syria] 
are growing exhausted”. 
 * He said Russia was in danger of becoming an “international pariah” because 
of what was happening in Syria. 
If Russia continues in it current path, then I believe that great county is in 
danger of becoming a pariah nation. If President Putin’s strategy is to restore 
the greatness and the glory of Russia, then I believe he risks seeing his 
ambition turn to ashes in the face of international contempt for what is 
happening in Syria.

 * But he said the “best hope” was to persuade Russia to “do the right thing”. 
Johnson said the UK had urged the EU to adopt a tough line on sanctions against 
Russia, but he pointedly refused to commit the UK to pushing for tougher 
sanctions. He also declined to back a call from Labour’sToby Perkins for the 
international community to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia because of what 
is happening in Syria. Summing up his position Johnson said: 
In the long term the only realistic solution is to persuade both sides to have 
a ceasefire and then to work through to a political solution ...

Our best hope is to persuade the Russians that it is profoundly in the 
interests of Russia to take the initiative, to win the acclaim of the 
international community, do the right thing in Syria, call off their puppets in 
the Assad regime, stop the bombing and bring peace to Aleppo and have a genuine 
ceasefire. That is the way.

 * He said the Aleppo siege was the worst in the civil war. 
At this moment the 275,000 inhabitants of eastern Aleppo are under siege. They 
are isolated from the outside world, subjected to constant bombardment and 
prevented from receiving humanitarian aid. Their power and water supplies have 
been cut off in what has become a signature tactic of the Assad killing 
machine, to besiege civilian populations. And what we are now seeing in eastern 
Aleppo is the biggest and potentially the deadliest siege since the outbreak of 
Syria’s civil war over five years ago.

Emily Thornberry intervenes to ask what can be done to get rid of the jihadi 
fighters from easterAleppo <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo>.

Johnson says this cannot happen while the city is still being bombed.

He says the best hope is to persuade Russia to do the right thing.

He says he will look at Staffan de Mistura’s plan to lead out the jihadist 
fighters. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/aleppo-could-be-destroyed-by-christmas-warns-un-envoy-for-syria>
 That sounds emminently sensible, he says.

And that’s it. Johnson’s speech, and the debate, is over.

I will post a summary soon. 
 
Johnson says the only possible solution is to have a negotiation.

The government has not give up hopes of this happening, he says.
 
Johnson says many MPs urged Britain to go further.

Some people called for no-fly zones.

He says he has “every sympathy” for these proposals.

But the government does not support putting boots on the ground. And you 
cannot have no-fly zones unless you are willing to shoot down planes and 
helicopters.

Johnson says he will consult people about this, including those involved in 
imposing no-fly zones over Iraq in the 1990s.

 * Johnson plays down prospect of imposing no-fly zones over Syria.  
Johnson says, if Russia continues on its path, it risk becoming a pariah 
nation.
 
Johnson says “all the available evidence” points to Russia being responsible 
for the recent attack on an aid convoy. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/un-aid-convoy-attack-syria-us-russia>

He says he is worried that “the wells of outrage are growing exhausted”.

He says there is no commensurate horror about Russia. Where are the Stop the 
War protests outside the Russian embassy, he asks.

 * Johnson says he would like to see protests outside the Russian embassy over 
Syria. 
It is up to us in government to show a lead.

He says he thinks the government is having an effect. Russia has had to use 
its veto five times in the UN security council to protect its position.
 
Johnson says the citizens of eastern Aleppo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aleppo> are under seige. Their power and 
water supplies have been cut off. This is a signature tactic of the Assad 
killing machine. It is the biggest and potentially deadliest siege since the 
civil war started.

He says every hospital in eastern Aleppo has been bombed, some more once, and 
several have been put out of action.

This must be deliberate policy, he says. He says intentionally attacking a 
hospital is a war crime.

He says these attacks must be investigated with a view to taking a case to the 
international criminal court.

 * Johnson says there is a case for taking Syrian war crimes to international 
criminal court. 
He says some cases get taken to the ICC years after they have been committed.

He says he hopes the Commons will take a different view from the one it took 
in 2013, when it decided not to intervene.
 
Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is responding to the debate now.

It it is his first speech in a Commons debate as foreign secretary.
 
Andy Burnham, the Labour candidate for mayor of Greater Manchester and the 
former shadow home secretary, is speaking at the New Economics Foundation 
conference this afternoon. (See 3.05pm.)  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fcf0bfe4b03b22b4fb246c#block-57fcf0bfe4b03b22b4fb246c>
He will urge Theresa May to set up a Brexit committee of the nations and 
regions to ensure Brexit policy is not just decided by London. He will say:


Theresa May has got the Brexit negotiations off on entirely the wrong foot and 
needs to change direction. She is working on the assumption that the country 
voted for a hard, confrontational Brexit when there is no evidence to support 
this. In fact, it would seem that the opposite is true – a majority of people 
were against a hard Brexit.

There is a big risk that her handling of these crucial talks could widen the 
divides in our country, not heal them. We need to open our eyes to these risks 
and ensure that all voices and perspectives are fully involved in shaping the 
Brexit negotiations.

Devolution in England was never conceived as part of the answer to Brexit but 
now it must be fully embraced as such. Brexit will have a differential impact 
on different parts of the country and a hard Brexit would hit the poorest areas 
hardest of all. Great effort will be expended to protect the financial sector 
and the City of London, which, while understandable, could lead to trade-offs 
that will damage other sectors.

These issues need to be openly debated and that is why I am asking the prime 
minister to establish a Brexit committee of the nations and regions, with 
places for the devolved governments and the elected mayoralties. The aim of 
that committee should be to seek a fair Brexit that balances the needs of all 
parts of the country. It is essential that Greater Manchester has a place at 
this table.

There has been a controversy about British politicians like Nigel Farage 
intervening in the US presidential election, but intervention is not all 
one-way.Bernie Sanders, the runner-up to Hillary Clinton in the contest to be 
the Democratic presidential candidate, has recorded a YouTube video backing the 
Green party candidate in the Witney byelection. It’s the least he could do.The 
Green candidate, Larry Sanders, is his brother.

I’m down at the rather nerdy relaunch of the New Economics foundation 
thinktank, 
<http://neweconomics.org/building-a-new-economy-where-people-really-take-control/?_sft_latest=press-releases>
 at a community centre in Waterloo, where among othersEd Miliband and Vince 
Cableare groping for a progressive interpretation of the vote-winning Brexit 
slogan “take back control”.

At the post-lunch session, Miliband, who’s been energised by the battle to 
secure a parliamentary vote on article 50, told the audience the left should 
seize the opportunity of Brexit, which he said was a vote for radical change, 
and warned against focusing only on the detail of the deal with the rest of the 
EU.

If Brexit just becomes about the negotiations, we’re going to be stuffed, 
because all of the weight of the mandate will be borne by the rules on free 
movement and so on. We have got to have a bigger vision for where the country’s 
going.

Of course, Theresa May’s already fleshed out what kind of mandate she thinks 
the Brexit vote gives her, including legitimising a much tougher immigration 
regime - and Cable was much blunter. He said:

The electorate has moved to the right, which was reflected in a rather brutal 
way in the referendum.

He said voters he spoke to during the last general election combined fear of a 
left-wing government, with identity politics - patriotism/nationalism. “We have 
to try and find a way of breaking through the tribal divisions on the centre 
left,” he said, adding that many of the 48% of voters who rejected Brexit feel 
“horribly dispossessed”.

Miliband tellingly said the left must find a way to “surmount” identity 
politics; Cable said Harold Wilson and Tony Blair managed to articulate a 
left-of-centre version of patriotism.
