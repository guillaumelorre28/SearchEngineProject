The winner


Turned down by countless UK distributors and presented to cinema audiences 
without benefit of a UK film festival platform, British indieNorthern Soul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/northern-soul> has astounded the film 
industry with a sensational result at the weekend. Landing inside the top 10, 
despite a release on just 83 screens, and limited showings at many of those 
venues, Northern Soul grossed a mighty impressive £279,000, according to 
official data gatherer Rentrak.

The film is the feature debut of acclaimed photographer Elaine Constantine, 
who has long been connected to theNorthern Soul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/northern-soul> scene. UK distributors were 
perhaps cautious as the film seemed late to the party: Shimmy Marcus’s SoulBoy, 
which benefited from more-recognisable lead actors Martin Compston, Felicity 
Jones and Nichola Burley, premiered in 2010, going on to gross £101,000 at UK 
cinemas over its lifetime.

Northern Soul was acquired for the UK by Universal Pictures, and it’s 
reasonable to assume the company was looking at it more for home-entertainment 
value, since it sub-distributed theatrically through Munro Film Services, and 
the DVD is already in shops. It may have been taken by surprise at the 
impressive number of theatrical bookings achieved by Munro, and by the weekend 
gross.

 Watch a review of Northern Soul 
Constantine said: “No one knew what to expect from this film. We had no star 
leads and a low budget.” She added that the appeal of the scene in the UK is 
perhaps underestimated, with more than 1 million people tuning in to watch a 
recent BBC2 TV documentary. And despite the very short window before DVD 
release, she always saw her film as a theatrical proposition, best enjoyed 
communally. “Northern Soul is not a passive audience. People travel across the 
whole country to experience an all-nighter. Going to the cinema does not 
present a challenge.”

With the film playing one-off shows at many venues and split screens (ie 
sharing with another film) at others, Northern Soul has achieved its impressive 
number from relatively limited play. Munro estimates the film had around 235 
showings in total – from a maximum possible 996 slots (a potential four per day 
per venue, on Friday, Saturday and Sunday). Nottingham Broadway managed seven 
showings across the weekend, achieving about 97/98% seat occupancy. The Hull 
Reel achieved a similar result. The film scored particularly well in the 
Midlands, north-west, Yorkshire and London. Munro’s own weekend figure is in 
fact a slightly higher £286,000, so this will include some unconventional 
venues not tracked by Rentrak.


Despite being now available on DVD, more than 30 cinemas are holding Northern 
Soul this coming weekend, with 40 fresh sites also booking the title.

 Why you might like to watch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles this week - video 
review 
Knocking Gone Girl <https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl> off the top 
spot,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles> debuted with an 
impressive £3.22m plus £1.56m in previews. If you include the previews, that’s 
the biggest opening for a film since The Inbetweeners 2 in early August. Back 
in 2007, the last iteration of the much-revived film franchise, TMNT, debuted 
with £949,000, including £284,000 previews. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had a 
relatively clear run at the family audience, sinceThe Maze Runner  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-maze-runner>aims more at the teen market, 
andThe Boxtrolls <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-boxtrolls> and What We 
Did on Our Holiday <https://www.theguardian.com/film/what-we-did-on-our-holiday>
 are in their sixth and fourth week of play respectively.

The alternatives

Photograph: Allstar/Relativity Media 
The Best of Me <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-best-of-me>, the ninth 
film to be adapted from a Nicholas Sparks book, achieved mid-table 
respectability with a so-so £488,000 debut, plus £149,000 in previews. That’s 
down on the last Sparks film, Safe Haven, which began in March last year with 
£812,000, including negligible previews of less than £5,000. Before that, The 
Lucky One, starring Zac Efron, started its run with £830,000 plus £329,000 in 
previews.


Family drama The Judge <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-judge>, starring 
Robert Downey Jr, was fairly weak, with £421,000 from 317 cinemas. The actor 
has achieved box-office success in the Avengers/Iron Man and Sherlock Holmes 
franchises, and his last drama was commercial disappointment The Soloist. 
Absent awards buzz for the film, and a lot of three-star reviews, it was always 
hard to envisage a big audience for The Judge, which opened the Toronto film 
festival last month.

 ‘71: watch Jack O’Connell in the world exclusive trailer for the Belfast-set 
thriller – video 
Although yet to grace the top 10, Jack O’Connell starrer ’71 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/71> is quietly holding up, with a very 
impressive week-two performance. Dropping just 7% from its opening number, the 
film added another £192,000 at the weekend, and now stands at £576,000. 
StudioCanal was highly visible with print and online advertising last week, 
trumpeting strong critical endorsement. The distributor deserves credit for not 
giving up after a somewhat disappointing opening.

Holds were in fact pretty strong across the market, with top five titles Gone 
Girl,Annabelle <https://www.theguardian.com/film/annabelle> and The Maze Runner 
down respectively by 23%, 24% and 24%. Gone Girl now stands at £14.15m, and is 
speeding up the all-time rankings for 18-certificate films. Top 18-certificate 
title, The Wolf of Wall Street, stood at £14.96m at this stage of its run, but 
enjoyed a relatively long tail thanks to the sustaining effect of awards 
nominations. Gone Girl is only 6% off the Wolf pace, but may struggle to 
sustain momentum in the coming weeks.

Thanks to those strong holds plus the arrival of the turtles, overall the 
market is 16% up on the previous frame, and 19% up on the equivalent weekend 
from 2013, when Turbo and Captain Phillips arrived in the top two spots. This 
now extends to four weeks the run where box-office is up on the year-ago 
equivalents, giving encouragement to the whole sector after a disappointing 
first three quarters of the year.


The good news may continue, since there’s certainly a diverse range of major 
films arriving in cinemas this week. Fox has animation The Book of Life, from 
producer Guillermo del Toro. Sony has Brad Pitt in a WWII tank inFury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/fury>, which just closed the London film 
festival and is the current top cinema hit in the US. Then there is romantic 
drama Love, Rosie, adapted from a Cecelia Ahern novel; well-regarded horror The 
Babadook; a UK expansion of Disney’sAlexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No 
Good, Very Bad Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alexander-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day>
; a starry ensemble cast in comedy-dramaThis Is Where I Leave You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/this-is-where-i-leave-you>, adapted from the 
Jonathan Tropper novel; Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence together once more 
in period romantic melodrama Serena; and Andre Benjamin as Jimi Hendrix inJimi: 
All Is By My Side <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jimi-all-is-by-my-side>. 
The audience should segment nicely, but it’s hard to imagine that so many films 
will all find a capacious welcome from cinemagoers.
