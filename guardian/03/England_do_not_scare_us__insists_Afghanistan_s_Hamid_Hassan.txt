Afghanistan bowler Hamid Hassan insists England hold no fear for his team 
ahead of their first ever one-day international meeting in Sydney on Friday.

The seamer believes the England batsmen can be targeted after watching them 
fall short against Bangladesh on Monday,a defeat that dumped Peter Moores’s 
team out of the World Cup

 with one pool match still to play.

“We have a very good bowling attack and hopefully we’ll do a good performance 
[on Friday] against England,” said Hassan. “We have learnt a lot from our 
mistakes in the past matches, and [on Friday] we don’t want to do any 
mistakes,” he said. Hopefully we’ll be better, 100% on correct line and length 
so we can put some pressure early on the England batsmen.”

The 27-year-old’s confidence is somewhat surprising given Afghanistan lost to 
Australia by 275 runs in their last match

. “My friend, he asked the question, ‘the game against Australia, you were 
scared’. There is no scared. Afghan never scared,” he insisted. “We haven’t 
played many games and that is why there is a little bit of inexperience. If we 
play some more matches against a big team with big names and in front of the 
media then people can watch and maybe we can improve more and more.”
