A gambling ad featuring a hand nailed to a piece of wood that ran over Easter 
has been banned for mocking the crucifixion of Jesus and the Christian religion.

Gambling company Boylesports emailed a promotion to punters that showed a hand 
nailed to a piece of wood against a desert scene with the strapline “nailed on 
bonus”.


Its text read: “In memory of the dearly departed JC, we are offering you a 
sacrilecious [sic] bonus this Easter weekend ... So don’t just sit there 
gorging your own body weight in chocolate, that’s disrespectful. Get on 
Boylesports Gaming and get your nailed on bonus.”

The promotional offer ran for most of the Easter period from Good Friday to 27 
March.


One recipient of the email lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards 
Authority <https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> that the ad was offensive and 
mocked the Christian religion.


Boylesports tried to play the link with Jesus Christ down, saying that there 
was no religious symbolism in the ad and that crucifixion per se was a “common 
practice” in Christ’s time.


The ASA rejected Boylesports’ argument, saying the ad was clearly not a 
reference to a “generic” crucifixion, but directly to that of Jesus Christ.


It said that the timing of the ad at Easter, the “jokey” language and making 
light of the subject of the crucifixion was likely to cause serious offence to 
some readers.

“We considered the offence was likely to be particularly strongly felt by 
those of the Christian faith at Easter, when the imagery would have a 
particularly strong resonance,” said the ASA. “We considered that the ad was 
likely to cause serious offence and concluded that it was therefore in breach 
of the [advertising] code.”
