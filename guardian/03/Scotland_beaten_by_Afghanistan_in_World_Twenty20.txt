Scotland’s long wait for a first victory in a global tournament goes on after 
a 14-run defeat in their openingWorld Twenty20 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldtwenty20> fixture against Afghanistan.

Hopes rose during an opening stand of 84 in pursuit of 170 for five in Nagpur 
that Preston Mommsen’s team might pull off a revenge success following their
one-wicket loss to Afghanistan in Dunedin at last year’s World Cup

.

But it was not to be, as George Munsey and Kyle Coetzer each fell short of 
their 50s – and then the boundaries dried up on the way to 156 for five.

Mohammad Shahzad (61) and Ashgar Stanikzai (55) underpinned Afghanistan’s 
total after they chose to bat first under lights. The second-wicket pair put on 
82 in 10 overs, the opener the aggressor and his captain more studied 
throughout.

Shahzad hit three sixes and three fours in his half-century from just 32 
balls, and it was only after he holed out to long-on off slow left-armer Mark 
Watt that Stanikzai needed to up his tempo too.

He survived a half-chance in the deep on 23 when Richie Berrington could not 
hold on off Alasdair Evans and went on to complete his 50 in the final over, 
having hit just a six and a four from 46 deliveries.

Munsey and Coetzer soon put the chase in fine shape.

But, after Coetzer mis-pulled into the deep, just two balls later at the other 
end Munsey missed a sweep and was lbw.

Matt Machan and Mommsen himself kept the result in doubt, but, with 21 needed 
off the last over, Scotland could not quite break their long-standing duck.

They therefore face an improbable route to qualification from Group B, in 
which Afghanistan and Tuesday’s other winners Zimbabwe are the front-runners.
