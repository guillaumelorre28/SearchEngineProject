Luca Giordano – Perseus Turning Phineas and His Followers to Stone (early 
1680s)
Flesh turns grey and bodies freeze in this eerie painting. Perseus, having 
slain and beheaded the gorgon Medusa, holds up her gory head as a weapon that 
can turn his enemies to stone. Giordano plays on energy and stillness, life and 
death, in this spectacular masterpiece of the baroque age.
