Italian and Swiss police have recovered priceless archaeological artefacts 
stolen fromItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> and stored by a 
notorious British antiquities dealer, Italy’s culture ministry has said.

The haul, worth €9m (£7.1m), was discovered in 2014 in a storage unit at the 
Geneva Freeport warehouse complex in Switzerland rented by the disgraced art 
dealerRobin Symes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/13/antiques-art-business-robin-symes>
, a giant in the illegal antiquities trade with ties to Italian tomb raiders.

“Forty-five crates containing tens of thousands of archaeological relics of 
extraordinary quality” were returned to Rome in January, said the Italian 
culture minister, Dario Franceschini, as they were unveiled to the press for 
the first time.

The haul included Etruscan painted sarcophaguses representing human figures, a 
Roman sarcophagus, marble statues of animals and pieces of the floor and walls 
of a temple, all dating to between the seventh century BC and second century AD.

“They were stolen from digs in Sicily, Puglia, Campania and Calabria in the 
1970s and 1980s,” said the prosecutor Giancarlo Capaldo, adding that the loot 
had been smuggled into Geneva Freeport decades ago, where it lay hidden.

Italian investigators tracked the artefacts after seizing incriminating papers 
from an art smuggler, and they were discovered during a joint sting with Swiss 
police on Symes’s storage unit.

Capaldo said the intention had been to restore the statues, tiles and 
sarcophaguses and sell them on to clients in Japan, Germany and other countries 
under false papers.

“This is one of the most important recoveries of the last few decades,” 
Franceschini said, adding that the antiquities would be restored and returned 
to the regions across southern Italy from which they were stolen.
