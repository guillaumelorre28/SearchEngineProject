The Earth could be scattering the seeds of life throughout our galaxy. 
Microbes could ride on specks of dust, powered by the sun's rays, says William 
Napier, an astronomer atArmagh Observatory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/armagh-observatory> in Northern Ireland, 
in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Some scientists think that a collision between a life-bearing planet and 
another body could scatter stones and boulders into space carrying organisms. 
These frozen spores could then make their way to other worlds - an idea called 
panspermia.

The chances are stacked against this. Spores would have to survive the meteor 
impact and be thrown into space. The boulder would then have to leave the solar 
system and land on another life-supporting planet.

But microbes might survive if they can escape the Sun's gravity more quickly. 
And that might happen, says Napier, if the rocks they sit on are first ground 
to dust.

The Earth and her sister planets travel through a cloud of grains called 
zodiacal dust. This is the debris from collisions in the asteroid belt and from 
the passage of comets.

This dust should sand-blast anything passing through it, says Napier. This 
process could grind a one-metre boulder down in 20,000 to 200,000 years, he 
estimates.

A grain less than a 10th of a millimetre across would be capable of carrying 
microscopic life, says Napier.
