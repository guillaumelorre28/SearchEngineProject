Rupert Murdoch <https://www.theguardian.com/media/rupert-murdoch> has hit out 
at allegations by former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil that he had 
successfully lobbied Tony Blair for changes in media laws ending the ban on 
foreign ownership of TV licences.

In a tweet on Wednesday afternoon 
<https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/223095630082473986>, he said: "Anyone 
taking any notice of Andrew Neil on me is an idiot. Neil treated bestof [sic] 
all ex-employes [sic] now shows true colors."

Murdoch and Neil have rarely seen eye-to-eye since the former News 
International editor wrote Full Disclosure, the inside story of his time at the 
paper – something that Murdoch evidently considered an act of betrayal.

His tweet on Wednesday was in response to a tweet by journalist Martin 
Hickman, who had recommended his followers read Neil's written statement to the
Leveson inquiry <https://www.theguardian.com/media/leveson-inquiry>.
 Murdoch tweet 
Neil's statement was published on Wednesday and contradicts evidence give by 
Murdoch when he testified that he never asked a prime minister for a favour.

Neil claimed that the Labour party's 2003 Communications Act ended the ban on 
foreign ownership of TV licences, paving the way, in the years to come, forNews 
Corporation <https://www.theguardian.com/media/news-corporation> to attempt to 
buy the 60% of BskyB it did not own.

"This was something Mr Murdoch's people lobbied hard for, with his support, 
and they had unique and extensive access to the levers of power at the heart of 
the Blair government to make this lobbying effective," wrote Neil

"When Mr Murdoch testified before this Inquiry that he had never asked 
government for anything it gave me cause to wonder if he had forgotten this – 
or forgotten he was testifying under oath."

The former editor also said that he believed that Blair and Murdoch had come 
to an understanding in the run up to the 1997 election which saw Labour swept 
to power.

"'How we treat Rupert Murdoch's media interest when in power,' Mr Blair told 
me in 1996, a year before he became Prime Minister 'will depend on how his 
newspapers treat the Labour party in the run up to the election.' That is 
exactly how it panned out.

"The Sun and the News of the World fell in line behind New Labour in the run 
up to the 1997 election, The Times stayed broadly neutral and theSunday Times 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/sundaytimes> unenthusiastically Tory.

"After the election, The Times quickly fell in line as the New Labour house 
journal ... in return New Labour in power did nothing to undermine or threaten 
Mr Murdoch's British media interests."
