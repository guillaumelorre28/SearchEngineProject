Chinese police say they have caught 175 looters who broke into a Neolithic 
archaeological site in what officials are calling the country’s biggest 
recovery of stolen artefacts.

The public security ministry announced on Tuesday that the operation rescued 
1,168 cultural relics worth more than 500m yuan (£51m/US$80m).

The looters were suspected of illegally excavating in Niuheliang, a site in 
north-eastern Liaoning province that includes tombs and other facilities, the 
ministry said.

Authorities found artefacts such as a coiled jade dragon that is one of the 
earliest known representations of the mythological creature.

The ministry said the looters were split into 10 gangs that handled everything 
from site excavation to sales. More than 1,000 police from six provinces took 
part in the recovery operation.

The statement did not say when the recovery operation took place.
