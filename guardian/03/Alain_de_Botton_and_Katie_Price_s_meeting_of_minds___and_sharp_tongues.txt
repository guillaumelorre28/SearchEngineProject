“The more dignity is widely and freely available in a society,” philosophy’s 
Alain de Botton <https://www.theguardian.com/books/alain-de-botton> once 
declared, “the less people want to be famous.”

Oddly, this isn’t the trailer line he has gone with for his latest symposium, 
a conversation with Katie Price, for which tickets cost £30. Alain is to 
interview Katie on stage at his School of Life, for an event he describes asan 
unconventional “meeting of minds” 
<http://www.theschooloflife.com/london/shop/katie-price-on-success>.

On that we can certainly agree. Unless that was supposed to be a 
subconsciously self-regarding little joke at Katie’s expense, in which case, I 
think we can agree even more vigorously.

However the event passes off, Katie must not fall into her usual trap of 
denigrating the experience afterwards, given Alain’s hard-won reputation for 
the defensive. As heonce responded to a book review 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2009/07/caleb_crain_v_alain_de_botton.html>: “I 
will hate you till the day I die and wish you nothing but ill will in every 
career move you make. I will be watching with interest and schadenfreude.”

Indeed, why not give the audience an ice-breaking game to play, in which they 
are shown various statements and asked… “Who said it?Katie Price 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/katieprice> to an ex-husband, or Alain de 
Botton to a critic?”
