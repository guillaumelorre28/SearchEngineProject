This World Cup is hotting up something fierce. Whatever they do, however they 
do it, it’s impossible to override the basic truism of life: sport is 
incredible.

There have been some amazing performances today. Haq and Evans for Scotland, 
then Ahamdi and Shenwari - he’s man of the match. But don’t forget Hamid, 12 
not out and one wicket, and Shapoor, 12 not out and four wickets. Timed to 
perfection.

going nuts! Ahmadi is relieved! Dawlat is relieved! I worry for Shenwari!

49.2 Afghanistan 207-9 (Hassan 15, Shapoor 8) 4 needed

Shapoor goes for a single into the off-side, thinks better of it, Machan’s shy 
misses, he gets back, Shapoor dives and hurts his wrist!

49.1 Afghanistan 207-9 (Hassan 15, Shapoor 8) 4 needed

Yorker from Wardlaw and Hassan winkles it out, squirted away for one on the 
off-side. Can he bopwl it to the lefty? Eight men up, one hit through them, and 
it’s over.

48.7 Afghanistan 206-9 (Hassan 14, Shapoor 8) 5 needed

Berrington is short and legside, Shapoor turns it to fine-leg for four! 
Afghanistan are favourites now! Poor Berrington - four wickets, but has that 
over cost the game, and Scotland’s first World Cup win?

If Afghanistan can get a run a ball here, they’d be favourites going into the

48th over: Afghanistan 197-9 (Hassan 13, Shapoor 2) Which of these two will 
win their first World Cup game? Evans returns, and Hassan dabs him away to 
third man for one. Shapoor looks a lot less confident than his pal, plays and 
misses, then one slanting across him is deflected behind - not out! Review! 
Thigh pad! Not out! Next ball is turned away to midwicket for one, then a 
bouncer that’s way high - it’s given wide - and the one after, the batsmen 
decline a single, Berrington hits direct, and they take a run for the Rick 
O’Shea. Final ball, Shapoor dabs into the off-side, and Afghanistan need 14 to 
win.

47th over: Afghanistan 192-9 (Hassan 11, Shapoor 0) Shenwari is still 
displeased, but this is still doable. Shapoor defends, Afghanistan need 19 to 
win, Haq has figures of 1/45 off his ten - he’s bowled well, and caught well 
too, apart from that one.

Drama! The umpire wants to check that the fielders were all where they were 
meant to be! Shenwari returns to the middle!

They were.

WICKET! Shenwari c Davey b Haq 96 (Afghanistan 192-9)

Surely that’s that! Shenwari slogs, but this time doesn’t get the elevation or 
the direction that he needs, and picks out Davey on the midwicket fence; he 
catches on the crouch. Scotland go mad, but what an innings that was, but!

47th over: Afghanistan 192-8 (Shenwari 96, Hassan 11) Majid Haq beings his 
final over, and this is it, you think. Haq comes around the wicket, Shenwari is 
eyeing up the field, but it really doesn’t matter- he smites the first ball 
with the spin and over midwicket for six. The second is wide, but he pastes the 
third flatter top a similar area, the fourth is fuller, straighter and a dot, 
and oh! Another six, murdered over square-leg! Last ball, he goes again...

46th over: Afghanistan 173-8 (Shenwari 78, Hassan 11) Shenwari plays a big 
drive, edges to fine leg, and they run one. This is a very good over from 
Wardlaw - after two dots, Hassan blocks one that nearly rolls back onto the 
stumps, fends a short ball for a single, then they take another from the final 
ball, and it really is time for Shenwari to go.

45th over: Afghanistan 170-8 (Shenwari 76, Hassan 10) Hassan runs Haq’s first 
ball to the man at short third man, and is immediately hollered back by 
Shenwari. Then, next ball, they do go, Scotland could go either end, they go 
non-striker’s but the throw gives Haq plenty to do, he does it slowly, catching 
and bringing the ball towards the stumps, and Hassan is well in, with a single 
added to the total. Haq knows that Shenwari wants width, so he’s keeping it 
straight and Shenwari can’t manufacture it, until the last ball, of which he 
doesn’t get enough - it’s fielded on that same square-leg fence, and what an 
over that is, just two from it. 41 needed from 5 overs.

44th over: Afghanistan 168-8 (Shenwari 75, Hassan 9) Hassan attempts a single 
after dropping Wardlaw into the off-side, but is forced to hurry back. But they 
get a single next ball - where will Shenwari go? The ball’s in the blockhole, 
so he digs it out dead straight for one morel, and with two slips for Hassan, 
there’s a gap on leg-side - which he finds, pulling an ill-advised bouncer to 
the square-leg fence. Then a single next ball, followed by a yorker that means 
Hassan’s on strike for the next over.

43rd over: Afghanistan 161-8 (Shenwari 74, Hassan 3) Haq back, and Shenwari 
goes, humping him down to long-on - MacLeod’s diving stop cuts off the 
boundary, and the batsmen don’t run. Then as Shenwari advances, Haq goes fuller 
- well bowled - but then what a strike! One knee,zetz, onto the roof and six! 
91 metres! But they’re the only runs from the over, and still beneath the 
required rate.

42nd over: Afghanistan 155-8 (Shenwari 68, Hassan 3) Two jazzers in two days 
involving associate nations - must be a coincidence, eh, Dave. Shenwari knucks 
Evans’ first ball, not right out of the middle, but with the speed of the 
outfield, with enough - but Machan’s diving stop cuts it off, and they run one. 
Then, with three balls left, the batsmen turn down a single - surely Shenwari 
would back himself to find another - and Hassan turns down a short wide one, 
before the final ball flicks a pad and looks like four, but a tumbling save 
from Cross makes it none. This is running away from Afghanistan.

41st over: Afghanistan 154-8 (Shenwari 67, Hassan 3) 58 off 60 needed as Davey 
comes in for his final over. Shenwari clips him to mid-on, sends Hassan back, 
then pulls and finds the fielder again. There are so many singles to be had, he 
might just be better taking everything available, rather than hoping to take a 
boundary an over - but then he does, and Hassan pulls away from a short wide 
one.

40th over: Afghanistan 153-8 (Shenwari 66, Hassan 3) Two dots, and Shenwari 
goes, pulling Haq, but he miscues - he doesn’t get the intended height, and 
hits straight to the fielder at square-leg. Then run one, and then Hassan 
glances a delectable three to third man - Afghanistan are fighting here, and 
Shenwari flips a single to long-on, giving Hassan one more ball to negotiate, 
which he does easily.

39th over: Afghanistan 148-8 (Shenwari 64, Hassan 0) Here we go! Shenwari gets 
down on one knee and creams Davey’s second ball hard and flat, over the fence 
at midwicket for six. Then, he stands tall and long, directing four to point - 
that should improve his mood slightly - and backs it up with a single. Two 
deliveries for Hassan to defend, as we see that where Afghanistan are 148-8, 
Scotland were 149-8.

38th over: Afghanistan 137-8 (Shenwari 53, Hassan 0) Evans returns, and 
Shenwari has an airy drive - Afghanistan need 75 of 77. And he connects well 
with a pull next ball, but picks out the man on the fence and decides to stay 
put, before clipping a single. Hassan blocks out the rest of the over, and for 
the first time, more than a run a ball is required.

37th over: Afghanistan 136-8 (Shenwari 52, Hassan 0) Shenwari drives 
Berrington, who dives to cut off the prospect of a run, and then he crossbats 
hard to cover, and again, a diving fielder means he stays where he is. But next 
ball, he smacks to midwicket, they run two and that’s his fifty, only there’s 
no celebration - he’s still sulking, as well he might. A single off the next 
ball, the a walk down to order Hassan not to act like a silly-billy. He doesn’t.

WICKET! Dawlat c Mommsen b Dawlat 9 (Afghanistan 132-8)

Oh no he isn’t! Dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. For no reason whatsoever, 
Dawlat attempts to smelt the final ball before the powerplay over the top, and 
Mommsen retreats from mid-on, diving and falling to hold onto a superb catch as 
he backward somersaults. Shenwari is not giggling and chortling at the hilarity 
of it all, rather hammering his bat into the turf.

Right! Thanks all for your company - it was worth it, eh? Well done 
Afghanistan, hard lines Scotland.
 
This World Cup is hotting up something fierce. Whatever they do, however they 
do it, it’s impossible to override the basic truism of life: sport is 
incredible.
 
There have been some amazing performances today. Haq and Evans for Scotland, 
then Ahamdi and Shenwari - he’s man of the match. But don’t forget Hamid, 12 
not out and one wicket, and Shapoor, 12 not out and four wickets. Timed to 
perfection.
 
What a game. What a game! 
 
Shapoor races away and throws body to floor, face first, and the crowd are 
going nuts! Ahmadi is relieved! Dawlat is relieved! I worry for Shenwari!
 
It’s on the pads, Shapoor flicks it away to square-leg, AND AFGHANISTAN WIN 
THEIR FIRST WORLD CUP GAME BY ONE WICKET WITH THREE BALL TO SPARE! WHAT A GAME!
 
49.2 Afghanistan 207-9 (Hassan 15, Shapoor 8) 4 needed

Shapoor goes for a single into the off-side, thinks better of it, Machan’s shy 
misses, he gets back, Shapoor dives and hurts his wrist!
 
49.1 Afghanistan 207-9 (Hassan 15, Shapoor 8) 4 needed

Yorker from Wardlaw and Hassan winkles it out, squirted away for one on the 
off-side. Can he bopwl it to the lefty? Eight men up, one hit through them, and 
it’s over.
 
48.7 Afghanistan 206-9 (Hassan 14, Shapoor 8) 5 needed

Berrington is short and legside, Shapoor turns it to fine-leg for four! 
Afghanistan are favourites now! Poor Berrington - four wickets, but has that 
over cost the game, and Scotland’s first World Cup win?
 
48.6 Afghanistan 202-9 (Hassan 14, Shapoor 4) 9 needed

Berrington goes around the wicket to the left-handed Shapoor, and it’s wide! 
 
48.5 Afghanistan 201-9 (Hassan 14, Shapoor 4) 10 needed

Into the body, hits Hassan on the thigh, they run a leg-bye.
 
48.4 Afghanistan 200-9 (Hassan 14, Shapoor 4) 11 needed

Hassan eases to cover, no run. 
 
48.3 Afghanistan 200-9 (Hassan 14, Shapoor 4) 11 needed

Lovely from Shapoor, who knows what he’s doing - this is eased away into the 
off-side for one more.
 
48.2 Afghanistan 199-9 (Hassan 14, Shapoor 3) 12 needed

If Afghanistan can get a run a ball here, they’d be favourites going into the 
final over, and Hassan glances down to third man.
 
48.1 Afghanistan 198-9 (Hassan 13, Shapoor 3) 13 needed

Berrington back, turned away on the leg side by Shapoor, they run one. 
 
48th over: Afghanistan 197-9 (Hassan 13, Shapoor 2) Which of these two will 
win their first World Cup game? Evans returns, and Hassan dabs him away to 
third man for one. Shapoor looks a lot less confident than his pal, plays and 
misses, then one slanting across him is deflected behind - not out! Review! 
Thigh pad! Not out! Next ball is turned away to midwicket for one, then a 
bouncer that’s way high - it’s given wide - and the one after, the batsmen 
decline a single, Berrington hits direct, and they take a run for the Rick 
O’Shea. Final ball, Shapoor dabs into the off-side, and Afghanistan need 14 to 
win.
 
47th over: Afghanistan 192-9 (Hassan 11, Shapoor 0) Shenwari is still 
displeased, but this is still doable. Shapoor defends, Afghanistan need 19 to 
win, Haq has figures of 1/45 off his ten - he’s bowled well, and caught well 
too, apart from that one.
 
They were. 
 
Surely that’s that! Shenwari slogs, but this time doesn’t get the elevation or 
the direction that he needs, and picks out Davey on the midwicket fence; he 
catches on the crouch. Scotland go mad, but what an innings that was, but!
 
47th over: Afghanistan 192-8 (Shenwari 96, Hassan 11) Majid Haq beings his 
final over, and this is it, you think. Haq comes around the wicket, Shenwari is 
eyeing up the field, but it really doesn’t matter- he smites the first ball 
with the spin and over midwicket for six. The second is wide, but he pastes the 
third flatter top a similar area, the fourth is fuller, straighter and a dot, 
and oh! Another six, murdered over square-leg! Last ball, he goes again...
 
46th over: Afghanistan 173-8 (Shenwari 78, Hassan 11) Shenwari plays a big 
drive, edges to fine leg, and they run one. This is a very good over from 
Wardlaw - after two dots, Hassan blocks one that nearly rolls back onto the 
stumps, fends a short ball for a single, then they take another from the final 
ball, and it really is time for Shenwari to go.
 
45th over: Afghanistan 170-8 (Shenwari 76, Hassan 10) Hassan runs Haq’s first 
ball to the man at short third man, and is immediately hollered back by 
Shenwari. Then, next ball, they do go, Scotland could go either end, they go 
non-striker’s but the throw gives Haq plenty to do, he does it slowly, catching 
and bringing the ball towards the stumps, and Hassan is well in, with a single 
added to the total. Haq knows that Shenwari wants width, so he’s keeping it 
straight and Shenwari can’t manufacture it, until the last ball, of which he 
doesn’t get enough - it’s fielded on that same square-leg fence, and what an 
over that is, just two from it. 41 needed from 5 overs.
 
44th over: Afghanistan 168-8 (Shenwari 75, Hassan 9) Hassan attempts a single 
after dropping Wardlaw into the off-side, but is forced to hurry back. But they 
get a single next ball - where will Shenwari go? The ball’s in the blockhole, 
so he digs it out dead straight for one morel, and with two slips for Hassan, 
there’s a gap on leg-side - which he finds, pulling an ill-advised bouncer to 
the square-leg fence. Then a single next ball, followed by a yorker that means 
Hassan’s on strike for the next over.
 
43rd over: Afghanistan 161-8 (Shenwari 74, Hassan 3) Haq back, and Shenwari 
goes, humping him down to long-on - MacLeod’s diving stop cuts off the 
boundary, and the batsmen don’t run. Then as Shenwari advances, Haq goes fuller 
- well bowled - but then what a strike! One knee,zetz, onto the roof and six! 
91 metres! But they’re the only runs from the over, and still beneath the 
required rate.
 
42nd over: Afghanistan 155-8 (Shenwari 68, Hassan 3) Two jazzers in two days 
involving associate nations - must be a coincidence, eh, Dave. Shenwari knucks 
Evans’ first ball, not right out of the middle, but with the speed of the 
outfield, with enough - but Machan’s diving stop cuts it off, and they run one. 
Then, with three balls left, the batsmen turn down a single - surely Shenwari 
would back himself to find another - and Hassan turns down a short wide one, 
before the final ball flicks a pad and looks like four, but a tumbling save 
from Cross makes it none. This is running away from Afghanistan.
 
41st over: Afghanistan 154-8 (Shenwari 67, Hassan 3) 58 off 60 needed as Davey 
comes in for his final over. Shenwari clips him to mid-on, sends Hassan back, 
then pulls and finds the fielder again. There are so many singles to be had, he 
might just be better taking everything available, rather than hoping to take a 
boundary an over - but then he does, and Hassan pulls away from a short wide 
one.
 
40th over: Afghanistan 153-8 (Shenwari 66, Hassan 3) Two dots, and Shenwari 
goes, pulling Haq, but he miscues - he doesn’t get the intended height, and 
hits straight to the fielder at square-leg. Then run one, and then Hassan 
glances a delectable three to third man - Afghanistan are fighting here, and 
Shenwari flips a single to long-on, giving Hassan one more ball to negotiate, 
which he does easily.
 
39th over: Afghanistan 148-8 (Shenwari 64, Hassan 0) Here we go! Shenwari gets 
down on one knee and creams Davey’s second ball hard and flat, over the fence 
at midwicket for six. Then, he stands tall and long, directing four to point - 
that should improve his mood slightly - and backs it up with a single. Two 
deliveries for Hassan to defend, as we see that where Afghanistan are 148-8, 
Scotland were 149-8.
 
38th over: Afghanistan 137-8 (Shenwari 53, Hassan 0) Evans returns, and 
Shenwari has an airy drive - Afghanistan need 75 of 77. And he connects well 
with a pull next ball, but picks out the man on the fence and decides to stay 
put, before clipping a single. Hassan blocks out the rest of the over, and for 
the first time, more than a run a ball is required.
 
37th over: Afghanistan 136-8 (Shenwari 52, Hassan 0) Shenwari drives 
Berrington, who dives to cut off the prospect of a run, and then he crossbats 
hard to cover, and again, a diving fielder means he stays where he is. But next 
ball, he smacks to midwicket, they run two and that’s his fifty, only there’s 
no celebration - he’s still sulking, as well he might. A single off the next 
ball, the a walk down to order Hassan not to act like a silly-billy. He doesn’t.
 
36th over: Afghanistan 132-8 (Shenwari 49, Hassan 0) Powerplay. Shenwari hits 
over the top towards midwicket, but only gets a single, and Hassan blocks the 
remaining five balls.
 
Oh no he isn’t! Dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. For no reason whatsoever, 
Dawlat attempts to smelt the final ball before the powerplay over the top, and 
Mommsen retreats from mid-on, diving and falling to hold onto a superb catch as 
he backward somersaults. Shenwari is not giggling and chortling at the hilarity 
of it all, rather hammering his bat into the turf.
