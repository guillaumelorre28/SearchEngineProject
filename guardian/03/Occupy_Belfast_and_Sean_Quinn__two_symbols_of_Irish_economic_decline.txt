Bordering on the clashing architectural styles of gothic and art deco the old 
Bank of Ireland headquarters in centralBelfast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/belfast> has in recent years become a symbol of 
economic stagnation.

The building at the corner of North Street and Royal Avenue has lay dormant 
for more than a decade while the bank dithered on what to do with this one-time 
piece of valuable real estate.

Rumours have been circulating of late that the taxpayer-rescued Bank of 
Ireland had finally found a buyer for their former northern HQ, and that this 
may have promptedanti-capitalist activists to take it over on Monday lunchtime 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/16/belfast-occupy-bank-of-ireland>.

Just as the Occupy demonstrators broke into the building creating a stand-off 
between themselves and the Police Service ofNorthern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland>, another symbol of the demise 
of Irish capitalism was facing fiscal servitude in Dublin.

While the youthful protesters hung out banners of the Occupy movement 
overlooking Belfast's main thoroughfare the Dublin high court sealed the fate 
of thesouthern state's once-richest man – Sean Quinn 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/16/sean-quinn-declared-bankrupt-dublin>
.

The descendants of the zombie bank Anglo Irish succeeded in bankrupting Quinn 
in an Irish court and thus condemning the 65-year-old former master of the 
Republic's economic universe to up to 12 years in financial purdah. Quinn won't 
be able to trade again for more than a decade, a period of his life when he 
should have been preparing for an enjoyable retirement.

They have been more than 100 miles apart but after the high court judgment 
Quinn finds himself in the same situation as the empty landmark in Belfast.

His empire is now hollowed out and vacant as the once ornate bank that 
epitomised confidence, stolidity and trust in the Irish banking sector. Quinn 
too must feel equally "occupied" given that administrators now run his various 
businesses including the once lucrative insurance corporation.

But that is where the comparisons have to stop. Quinn was the victim of his 
own burgeoning success during the boom years when he borrowed billions from
Anglo Irish Bank <https://www.theguardian.com/business/anglo-irish-bank> to 
acquire a global property empire.

Rather than stick to the fundamentals of his business – concrete, 
construction, insurance – the Fermanagh-born tycoon branched out into the 
casino-economy that was the Irish property bubble. When it burst he was left 
owing Anglo – and hence the Irish taxpayer – billions.

As for the dreadlocked idealists currently locked inside the semi-derelict 
their actions may yet set off a chain reaction of occupation across the border. 
Their example may inspire others in theOccupy movement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy> in Dublin to start occupying 
National Asset Management Agency-owned properties across the city and beyond as 
a means of highlighting speculator greed and the fact that despite thousands of 
empty houses and flats there are thousands of homeless too.

Who would have thought that a couple of bearded neo-hippies living in tents 
outside a cathedral in Belfast might just become more loved and respected by a 
populace disgusted over the banks' reckless lending rather than a billionaire 
businessman once seen as the personification of Celtic Tiger Man.
