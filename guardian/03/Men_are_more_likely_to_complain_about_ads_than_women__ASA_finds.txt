The capital’s residents accounted for 16.4% (of all complaints made to the ASA 
last year. Residents in Northern Ireland were proportionally the least likely 
to complain, accounting for just 1.4% of the total.


“The breakdown of ad complaints provides a fascinating snapshot of the issues 
that concern people across the nations and regions,” said Guy Parker, chief 
executive of the ASA. “It can only take a single complaint to stop an 
irresponsible ad. And it doesn’t matter who or where it comes from.”
