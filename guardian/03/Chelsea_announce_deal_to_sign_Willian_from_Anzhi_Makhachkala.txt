Chelsea have confirmed that they have reached an agreement to sign Willian from
Anzhi Makhachkala <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anzhi-makhachkala>. The 
Brazilian had looked to be on the verge of joining Tottenham Hotspur earlier 
this week but Chelsea have outmanoeuvred their London rivals and the playmaker 
will now move to Stamford Bridge subject to a work permit being granted.

A statement on the club website read: "Chelsea Football Club can confirm an 
agreement has been reached with both Willian and his club Anzhi Makhachkala for 
the transfer of the Brazilian player. The transfer is subject to a work permit 
hearing on Wednesday."

Mourinho had hinted that Willian had chosen Chelsea over Spurs in his press 
conference on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/23/tottenham-chelsea-willian>, 
although the player had yet to complete his medical at that point.

"I think he's already made his decision," Mourinho said. "I don't like to 
speak before time because football can be crazy. I know what the player wants, 
so in this moment we cannot hide. That is a possibility."

Willian began his career in his homeland with Corinthians before moving to 
Europe with Shakhtar Donetsk in 2007. He made more than 100 appearances for the 
Ukrainians before moving to Anzhi in January of this year but his Russian 
adventure will be short-lived.

Mourinho is now likely to turn his intentions to getting Wayne Rooney, with a 
third bid planned after Monday's Premier League game at Old Trafford.Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> have been told repeatedly that 
Rooney is not for sale, but still Mourinho is chasing his man.

"When you own a player, you have a contract with a player for a long time, 
even if the player wishes to leave â€“ and sometimes that happens," Mourinho said.

"That contradiction happens. The player wants to leave, the club wants to keep 
[him]. We [managers] have to make a decision one way or another way. We have to 
persuade the player to stay, or the player persuades us to sell."

Asked how he rates Chelsea's chances of signing Rooney, Mourinho said: "I 
don't care. In this moment I don't care."

Where the Willian move leaves Spurs now is unclear, with the Brazilian 
seemingly lined up as their replacement for Gareth Bale should he complete his 
move protracted to Real Madrid. This latest development could prove to be yet 
another delay in the summer's longest-running transfer saga.
