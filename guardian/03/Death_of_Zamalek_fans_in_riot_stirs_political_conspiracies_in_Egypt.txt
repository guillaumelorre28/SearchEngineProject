Sitting outside Cairo’s main mortuary on Sunday night, as the bodies of dead 
football fans were carried in and out for their autopsies, Saad Abdelhamid 
thinks he knows why they have died. “The massacre that took place today was 
revenge on those who took part in the revolution,” says the 27-year-old 
salesman.


“Witness this,” shouts another mourner, raising his bloodied hands. “Witness 
what our government is doing to our kids.”

To outsiders, the death of at least 22 fans of Zamalek SC in a stampede 
outside a stadium on Sunday evening 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/08/zamalek-cairo-egyptian-league-14-dead>
 might appear to be simply a footballing tragedy. To the police, what happened 
was the fault of fans trying to break into the ground.

But the circumstances that prompted the stampede – police fired teargas and 
shotgun pellets into the midst of thousands of fans confined in a narrow 
passage lined with barbed wire – has led traumatised survivors like Abdelhamid 
to claim their friends were targeted on purpose. And for political reasons.

To understand how such a perception might be formed, Abdelhamid says you have 
to rewind to 2011. Fans from Cairo’s two main clubs, Zamalek and their arch 
rivals, Ahly, had long clashed with police and each other for footballing 
reasons. But from 2011 onwards, their members – often middle-class students –
began to play a more political role 
<http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2013/the-long-revolution-of-the-ultras-ahlawy/>, 
even if to this day the groups themselves publicly maintain that they are 
apolitical.

As protesters battled Egypt’s notorious police force in January 2011, in 
demonstrations that led tothe overthrow of then dictator, Hosni Mubarak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/11/hosni-mubarak-resigns-egypt-cairo>
, Egypt’s hardcore football fans were a key mobilising force.

“They made a difference in the street in Port Said, Alexandria and Cairo,” 
argues Abdelhamid, who, as a revolutionary himself, fought alongside them. (A
Zamalek <https://www.theguardian.com/football/zamalek> fan, he has also 
attended games with the ultras since 2007. But he is not a Ultras White Knights 
(UWK) member himself, and so is not subject to their longstanding media 
boycott.)

After Mubarak made way for an army junta, ultras from Ahly and Zamalek 
continued to make their presence felt, chanting against the regime’s new 
leaders inside the stadium, and taking part in protests outside it.

They were and are by no means a unified block, says James Dorsey, author of 
The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer 
<http://www.amazon.com/Turbulent-World-Middle-East-Soccer/dp/1849043310>. But 
their numbers mean “they constitute one of the largest social groups in Egypt”. 
And their ability to mobilise, even inside a stadium, poses an inherent threat 
to the authoritarian state.

The Egyptian regime, says Dorsey, “do not tolerate any uncontrolled public 
space – which means that both the mosque and the soccer pitch are potential 
problems. They are two of the institutions that evoke the deepest-seated 
passions of a significant section of the Egyptian public, and you can’t 
permanently shut them down.”

But depending on who you believe, this didn’t stop the regime from trying to 
do so. In February 2012, days after Ahly’s ultras chanted that Egypt’s military 
junta were “dogs like the police”,over 70 of them were killed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/01/egypt-football-match-violence-dead>
 in clashes that followed a game in Port Said.

Ostensibly, this was a case of fan-on-fan violence: Ahly’s supporters were 
attacked and killed by locals from Port Said. But for the ultras, there were 
too many smoking guns to rule out the state’s involvement – and parts of what 
happened seemed to have been planned. Someone switched off the stadium lights 
as soon as the attack began. Someone else locked the doors that represented the 
ultras’ only escape route. And as the fighting raged, the police simply stood 
and watched.

For Abdelhamid, it was obvious who was behind what happened in Port Said. 
“With that massacre, the regime made it very clear that it was against the 
ultras,” he says. “It was punishing them for their participation in the 
revolution against Mubarak regime.”

Almost exactly three years on, Abdelhamid claims that Sunday’s stampede was 
Zamalek’s Port Said moment. Having been trapped himself in what he calls the 
“passage of death”, it is hard for him to attribute the manner in which fans 
were hemmed into such a tiny space, and then sprayed with teargas, to simple 
negligence.

Others can’t be sure. “There’s always a chance that it’s politicised in some 
way,” says Islam Issa, an Egyptian football analyst, academic, and players’ 
agent. “But it’s pretty impossible to pinpoint things at this stage. I don’t 
think there’s an established account yet of the Port Said massacre three years 
ago, so we can’t even be close to understanding what happened this week.”

Certainly, the ultras, as a collective, pose a slightly smaller threat to the 
police than they did three years ago. One result of Port Said was that 
subsequent games were played behind closed doors – Sunday’s match was one of 
the first to be reopened to the public – and so the group’s ability to gather 
and mobilise has been diminished.

A return to Mubarak-era authoritarianism has also constricted their 
activities. And their potency as a united political force was undermined by the 
fallout fromthe overthrow of the ex-president Mohamed Morsi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/mohamed-morsi-egypt-second-revolution>
 in 2013, a move that left Egyptians highly polarised. Zamalek’s White Knights 
were no exception, and so in an attempt to maintain their unity, in recent 
months UWK mobilised around internal club issues, and stayed away from national 
ones.

But the particulars of those internal struggles also hint at why the ultras 
might once again be in the crosshairs of the state.

For much of the past year, the ultras have been at loggerheads with Zamalek’s 
chairman,an oddball, loudmouth lawyer named Mortada Mansour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/05/mortada-mansour-football-eccentric-egypt-zamalek>
. A self-proclaimed counter-revolutionary, Mansour has made no secret of his 
hatred for ultras and protesters in general. For their part, some of the ultras 
tried to douse him in urine. In return, the pro-regime Mansour tried to get 
them listed as terrorists.

“They are not fans, they are criminals,” Mansour claimed in an interview 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/05/mortada-mansour-football-eccentric-egypt-zamalek>
 with the Guardian late last year. “They are using bombs, live ammunition and 
shotgun pellets … but I continue because this is part of the nation’s battle 
against terrorism.”

Given this context, the idea that Zamalek’s White Knights were intentionally 
targeted is, for James Dorsey, “not an unreasonable conclusion, but I don’t 
think it’s an established fact.”

But for the likes of Abdelhamid, there are just too many coincidences, and UWK 
represent too much of a potential threat to the regime, for Sunday’s stampede 
to have happened because of incompetence alone. “I think the regime was shaking 
with fear,” says Abdelhamid. “To the degree that it imagined that the entrance 
of fans at this time of clear political upheaval might cause embarrassment to 
the regime in Egypt, that the chants of the fans would convey the facts about 
the political regime inEgypt <https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt>.”
