A police officer searching a former meth lab in Albuquerque, New Mexico 
stumbled upon artwork by the late Native American artist Alfred Morris Momaday 
that was worth more than $30,000 and was probably stolen.

The officer found the valuable prints last week during a protective sweep of 
the condemned apartment before city officials were due to board it up. 
Authorities say the building was deemed uninhabitable for two years following 
the discovery of a methamphetamine lab there.

According to police, the officer spotted a portfolio containing Momaday prints 
on the floor. The officer did an internet search for Momaday’s name and 
discovered he was a Kiowa painter born in Mountain View, Oklahoma who died in 
1981.

“Knowing this, and knowing all the history about this apartment, I knew 
[whoever] left this property behind had no lawful reason to be in possession of 
this [artwork],” the officer wrote in his report.

The officer took the prints to an Albuquerque Museum curator who valued them 
at $33,000 (£22,000).

Investigators believe the art might have been stolen while on loan. They are 
still trying to determine who it belongs to and what to do with it.

Momaday’s paintings depicting his Native American heritage have gained 
international acclaim and are in galleries around the country. He also created 
plaques for Albuquerque churches.

A teacher, Momaday married Natachee Scott at Jemez Pueblo and helped bring 
Native American art lessons to New Mexico.

He is the father of N Scott Momaday, the first Native American to win a 
Pulitzer prize for literature.

An assistant to N Scott Momaday told the Albuquerque Journal that the author 
believes some items were stolen from him during a recent move to Santa Fe. 
However, he wasn’t sure if those items included artwork by his father.
