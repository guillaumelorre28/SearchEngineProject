When I look in the mirror, I see a guy who looks every one of his 54 years. 
It's hard living, and I see it right there. I'm used to seeing the bags under 
my eyes and the creases in my forehead. I have a realistic view of myself; I 
can see what other people see – someone who's been around the block a few 
times. I know a lot of my contemporaries didn't make it this far and I feel 
blessed that I did.

When I was young, I wanted to be older, and now I'm there. From the youngest 
age I had romantic delusional ideas about being jaded. I looked up to Burroughs 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs> and Hunter S Thompson 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson> – not the best role models 
for a 12-year-old. Looking back at my younger self, I see an arrogant bastard 
with a lot of attitude who couldn't wait to grow up. I hated childhood, 
despised it. By 13, I was very tall for my age and passed for 18 in bars. I 
certainly lived beyond my years. But it took me a few decades to realise you 
have to write something or make something to get on.

I didn't own anything until I was 44; that was the first time I didn't go to 
sleep in terror that I'd be thrown out of my apartment. The only security I've 
known has come in later life.

I guess I'm pretty comfortable with who I am now. There's nothing I'd change 
about my appearance. I don't have any concerns. I'm happy to be around, with 
the best job in the world, a second marriage and an adorable daughter, so 
whatever I see in the mirror is a price worth paying.
