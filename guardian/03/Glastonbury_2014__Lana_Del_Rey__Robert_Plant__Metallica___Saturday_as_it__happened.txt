Ok, it's time to wrap up this particular liveblog – because Michael Hann is 
sitting on a sofa in north London, ready to take TV viewers through the rest of 
the Glastonbury action.

What's happened today?

 * Lots of people saw some bands, and some of them will have got muddy.

 * Some of them will have been dressed as unicorns.

Now it's time for the likes of Pixies, Jake Bugg, Metallica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/metallica>, and mayhem elsewhere too, no 
doubt, in the late night dance area and in the "naughty corner".

Thanks for reading thus far ... and here's the evening blog

BREAKING! Mumford & Sons apparently are here, quite possibly doing things like 
playing with Haim.

This, I think, IS true, because Jon Lawrence is the pr for Mumfords. And Haim.

So, it's just gone 6pm, the sort of hour at which many several festivalgoers 
nip back to their tents to ready themselves for the night ahead. Herewith a 
very brilliant film of some of the action at Arcadia last night, courtesy of 
our photographer Gary Calton.

Here is Kate Hutchinson's Lana Del Rey review! Here! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/28/lana-del-rey-glastonbury-2014-review>

Edited highlight:

She awkwardly slinks her way through kohl-smudged hits such as Born to Die, 
West Coast and National Anthem but the most exciting thing that happens is when 
she lights a cigarette for Blue Jeans.

(Not that fussed I missed that ...)

.

Oh, you don't know what normcore is? Here's a sneak preview:

Chris Mandle, 25, from London, was sporting a shapeless waterproof Mountain 
Life walking jacket bought from a camping shop years ago. "I'm not an active 
follower of normcore, I'm just really boring," he said."You don't want to wear 
your favourite clothes if you're going to get them covered in shit. That is my 
rationale. I'm going to be wearing this jacket all weekend and I'm going to 
look forward to being very smug when it rains."

has been talking to some of the comedians playing in the Cabaret tent this 
year. From his chat with Shappi Khorsandi:

Did you have a cry at Elbow?

No, I held it together - even during One Day Like This. After my divorce I 
couldn't listen to music for two years, and that song was the one that brought 
me back, and made me feel like a 15 year old discovering music again. But I 
didn't cry - just enjoyed the moment.

 So busy has Ms Gibsone been, in fact, that she was off doing another video 
interview when Courtney Barnett arrived at our cabin. Luckily you have 
professionals like me around who are more than happy to leap outside in the

Alexis Petridis spent this morning writing a tribute to Bobby Womack. You can 
read his words here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/28/bobby-womack-alexis-petiridis-talent-undimmed>
.

It seems a ridiculous thing to say about a man who was clearly gravely ill, 
but something about him suggested a weird kind of invincibility

I was lucky enough to do a Glastonbury-themed interview with Bobby last year 
in which he spoke about Mick Jagger, mud and never, ever wanting to leave the 
stage - whichseems oddly appropriate to link to again here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/28/bobby-womack-glastonbury-size-stage-dont-matter>

greatest performances.

The entire Guardian cabin has just been invited to a performance of 
"Australian permaculture electro-swing ukulele", which surely wins the prize 
for most Glastonbury sentence ever spoken.

In addition to their 3pm Other Stage slot today, Warpaint will be doing an 
acoustic set on top of the replica Arctic Sunrise ship (pictured below, with

Before we recap some of last night's action, a quick word about Bobby Womack, 
who died yesterday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/28/bobby-womack-dies-aged-70>, word 
of which won't have reached all festivalgoers yet. It's very sad news. He was 
70-years old.
 Bobby Womack Photograph: Jamie-James Medina/PR company handout 
The last time I saw him was here at Glastonbury last year, when he headlined 
the West Holts stage, and in the slightly fragile state I was in at the time, 
he damn near brought me to tears.Here's our review of that show 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/30/bobby-womack-glastonbury-2013-review>
.

The sea of waving hands showed how much love you can get for being true to 
yourself.

Here's a gallery of great images

Roll up, roll up, and welcome to Saturday at Glastonbury, which we'll be 
liveblogging through the day and into the evening, when Metallica are due to 
headline the Pyramid stage.


This is what the stage looked like not five minutes ago, a picture I snapped 
on my daily commute across the site to the Guardian's portable building/ 
Glastonbury HQ in the mythical backstage compound (the loos are nicer than 
elsewhere; the bar's ok; that's about it).

<https://twitter.com/CasparLS/statuses/482815821996388353> 
So it's muddy, and there are some dark clouds, and wee bit of sun, and 
according tothe forecast <http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/2640282>, some rain 
should start shortly and carry on intermittently through until the evening ... 
stopping just in time for Lars Ulrich and co.


Metallica are a slightly controversial choice to do so, with one report 
claiming that almost four in five fans who bought a ticket to this year's 
festival were put off by Michael Eavis's decision to sign them up. (Mind you, 
the poll was conducted by ticket marketplace site Viagogo, with results 
conveniently seeming to prove that preventing festivalgoers from reselling 
their tickets is a bad thing.)



Forget this though because the band are ON MESSAGE, tweeting about getting 
ready to play and pluggingWaterAid <http://www.wateraid.org/uk>, one of the 
festival's beneficiaries.

But how ready are festivalgoers for these titans of rock? Yesterday, Tim Jonze 
went to find out, taking (of course) his own customised metal detector with 
him. LOLS await!
