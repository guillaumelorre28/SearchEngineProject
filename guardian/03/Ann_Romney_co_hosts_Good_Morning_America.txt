If anybody needed further confirmation that a presidential election is 
imminent, this is it. On Wednesday morning the would-be Republican first lady,
Ann Romney <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ann-romney>, will co-host Good 
Morning America, following in a long line of candidates' wives to take to the 
daytime TV sofa to discuss taxing issues of the day, ranging from cooking to 
their families.

In a move that walks a fine line on journalistic and political integrity, Mrs 
Romney will co-host the lead-off 8am hour alongside George Stephanopoulos as a 
stand-in for Robin Roberts, who isundergoing treatment for a blood disease <>. 
Romney appeared on the show in July foran interview with Roberts 
<http://gma.yahoo.com/video/news-26797925/ann-romney-on-obama-s-egregious-attacks-30028621.html>
, who asked her about her husband's refusal to release his tax returns.

Good Morning America has also lined up some less political substitutes for 
Roberts, including the cast of Modern Family, as well as Rob Lowe and Stephen 
Colbert.

Daytime television appearances are part of the job of being married to a 
president during campaign season. Here are some the highlights of previous 
performances:

Michelle Obama

The first lady has made more than 40 television appearances in the past 
decade. She has been on chat shows in the morning, afternoon and late at night, 
and has made appearances on tween program iCarly, reality show the Biggest 
Loser and at the BET Honors.

She also went on Sesame Street, which is basically a requirement for first 
ladies â€“ and one that Laura Bush,Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Barbara Bush all 
fulfilled.
