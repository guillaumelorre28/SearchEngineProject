Following a successful run in London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/13/american-psycho-musical-review>, 
the musical adaption of American Psycho is set to premiere off Broadway in New 
York next year.

Second Stage Theater will bring Bret Easton Ellis’s story of sex, violence and 
yuppie culture back to city that inspired it.FX is also said 
<http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/09/10/american-psycho-tv-series/> to be working on 
a television sequel to the novel, which was published to critical acclaim in 
1991.

Tony award winner Duncan Sheik wrote the music and lyrics for the play, and 
told the New York Times 
<http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/american-psycho-musical-coming-to-off-broadway/>
 that he was writing new songs for the American run: “We’re going to put a bit 
more ‘psycho’ in the text and production; a little more horror and suspense.”

Playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa wrote the musical's script, and also said he 
was making some revisions.

Casting for the New York City run will be announced at a later date, though 
Second Stage Theater’s artistic director Carole Rothman said it would have an 
all-American cast.

Previews are set for February 2015, ahead of the March opening.
