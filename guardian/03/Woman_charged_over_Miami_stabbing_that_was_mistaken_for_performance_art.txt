 of the victim and assailant moments after the stabbing at around 5.15pm.

being patted down, Zhao spontaneously stated: “I had to kill her and two more.” 
She is also alleged to have said: “I had to watch her bleed!”

The incident, which happened near an exhibit by the artist Naomi Fisher, 
prompted at least one witness to think he was watching performance art. Fisher 
told the Miami Herald: “A guy walked up to me and said: ‘I thought I saw a 
performance, and I thought it was fake blood, but it was real blood.’”

The paper said other witnesses later thought the police tape cordoning the 
area was an art installation.Art Basel Miami

Fitzmaurice said: “The attack was an isolated incident that was immediately 
secured. Our thoughts are with the victim.”
