The advertising watchdog will no take action over controversial ads run ahead 
of the EU referendum, such as theleave campaign’s £350m NHS spending claim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs>
, despite receiving almost 400 complaints from the public.


The Advertising Standards Authority <https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> 
has received 374 complaints about what have been called misleading, inaccurate 
and discriminatory ads and claims made to sway voters ahead of last Thursday’s 
Brexit vote.


Leading Brexit campaigner Iain Duncan Smith distanced himself from Vote Leave 
posters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs>
 that stated the NHS should receive “the £350m the EU takes every week”, a 
claim that was widely picked up by media and repeated during the referendum 
campaign.


An anti-migrant poster featuring Nigel Farage, who was not part of the 
official leave campaign but very much a face of Brexit,was reported to police 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants>
 with a complaint that it incites racial hatred and breached UK race laws.


The ASA received 177 complaints relating to ads pushing voters to back leaving 
the EU, the most of any group.


The advertising regulator received 45 complaints about the official remain 
campaign.


Operation Black Vote’s “white thug” poster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/30/operation-black-vote-referendum-poster-divisive>
, one of a number of ads the group ran designed to try and galvanise ethnic 
minorities to vote in the referendum, prompted 145 complaints that it was 
racist and discriminatory against the white man featured in the advert.

There were also seven complaints about general advertising for the referendum.

The ASA said it is powerless to act against any of the campaigns 
<https://www.asa.org.uk/News-resources/Media-Centre/2016/Political-advertising-complaints.aspx#.V3JEpzYrKCe>
, even though their unvetted claims are specifically designed to sway and 
influence voters, as political advertising doesn’t fall within the regulator’s 
remit.

Political ads are banned from being broadcast on TV; instead, parties are 
given airtime designated under the party political broadcast system which 
aren’t classified as advertising.


In other media, from newspapers to billboards and posters, political ads are 
exempt from the UK advertising code.


“We can’t therefore look into complaints that political ads are misleading, 
harmful or offensive,”said the ASA 
<https://www.asa.org.uk/News-resources/Media-Centre/2016/Political-advertising-complaints.aspx#.V3JEpzYrKCe>
.


Members of the public have turned to online petitions in their tens of 
thousands to express anger about the veracity of claims made by politicians and 
in ads run in the build-up to the referendum.

A petition on the UK parliament’s website 
<https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/119416> calling for it to be illegal 
for any political figure to knowingly lie or mislead the public has attracted 
almost 45,000 signatures.


If the petition reaches 100,000 signatories, the issue will be considered for 
debate in parliament.


More than 16,000 people have so far backed a petition calling for the creation 
of an independent regulator 
<https://www.change.org/p/david-cameron-create-an-independent-regulator-to-ensure-truth-in-political-advertising?source_location=movement>
 to “ensure truth in political advertising”.


“The UK has taken possibly the biggest decision in its history based on large 
numbers of people being misled by political advertising,” said Sam Walker,

“How can a democracy be expected to function if propaganda is legitimised 
through lack of advertising regulation?,” said Sam Walker, the former senior 
executive at ad agencies Karmarama and Mother who now runs creative shop Faster 
Horses. “The UK has taken possibly the biggest decision in its history based on 
large numbers of people being misled by political advertising.”

Until 1999, some political advertising was subject to UK ad rules. 


However, factors including the failure to gain a consensus between the Labour, 
Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties to bring political advertising wholly 
within the UK ad code resulted in all of it being excluded from the code.


In 2003, an Electoral Commission consultation concluded that the ASA should 
not be responsible for regulating election advertising, but the commission did 
not establish a separate code.


A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said there were no plans to launch 
a new consultation reviewing the regulation of election advertising.
