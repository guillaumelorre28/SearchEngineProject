The fifth part of the Rest is Noise festival focuses on how music took shape 
in the US in the first half of the 20th century. By the end of the second world 
war, innovators were creating music that incorporated blues, jazz and swing, as 
well as more traditional themes.

It was at the end of the previous century, in 1890, that the Czech-born 
composerAntonín Dvořák <https://www.theguardian.com/music/antonin-dvorak> 
predicted the emergence of an American tradition based on African-American folk 
tunes and spirituals. Three years later he produced his Symphony No. 9 in E 
minor, From the New World - the 'New World Symphony'. The piece was performed 
for the first time in London in June, 1894, and the Observer's reviewer, after 
noting its musical influences, concluded the symphony was "full of ear-haunting 
tune, and palpitates with life in every bar."

While Dvořák was using more traditional influences, Edgard Varèse's
Amériques embraced such sounds as that of railways and the wail of sirens. On 
27 July 1924, the Observer published afavourable critique

 by Carlos Salzedo, the French harpist and composer.

There are only occasional references in the archive, at least in the pre-war 
years, to the works of Aaron Copland. One piece that did appear is a review 
(the Observer, 12 May 1940) of hisscore

African-American composerWilliam Grant Still

George Gershwin's output received more coverage, like, for example, the 
following piece from September 1926:

In October 1925, the Manchester Guardian's Neville Cardus predicted that in a 
100 years' time, Gershwin's 'Symphony in Blue' would be accepted as a 
masterpiece

A few years later, another of the paper's critics felt, "out of a sense of 
duty rather than from hedonism," the need to find out whether America had 
indeed "failed to produce anything in music that is of any real significance," 
when reviewing a programme of 'Modern American Music' at London's Aeolian Hall.
