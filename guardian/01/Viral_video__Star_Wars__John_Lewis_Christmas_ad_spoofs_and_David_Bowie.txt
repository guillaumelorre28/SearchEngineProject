Retail Christmas ads herald the festive season almost as soon as Halloween is 
over. This year’spromotion for John Lewis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/06/john-lewis-christmas-advert-age-uk>
 was eagerly anticipated and produced avariety of responses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/tvandradioblog/2015/nov/06/john-lewis-christmas-advert-who-is-moon-hitler>
 but also a whole host of spoofs. We’ve watched far too many men in the moon 
and have picked the best three for your delectation. Top of the list is theStar 
Wars spoof <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB_C2eOQG9g>featured Darth Vader, 
but there are also laughs witha Father Jack parody 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8lqCBSacT4> from Father Ted and a more 
thought provoking version <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYA-emYS51U>from 
Goldie Lookin Chain.

It’s ironic, but it’s the second week running we have featured Alanis 
Morrisette. Last week she was dressed as a chicken, and this weekshe updates 
the lyrics to her 1995 hit Ironic <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GVJpOmaDyU>
and sings the new version with James Corden.

It has been 40 years since Queen released Bohemian Rhapsody and to mark that – 
and pay tribute to the vocal talents of Freddie Mercury – we are featuringa 
sound recording <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMQb9LCNGxs>of him and David 
Bowie singing Under Pressure. Bowie met Queen in 1981 in a Swiss recording 
studio to do the vocals for a song called Cool Cat. He got bored and suggested 
writing a new song from scratch. According to Mark Blake, author of a biography 
of Freddie Mercury, they began a 24 hours marathon of drinking and composing 
and came up with Under Pressure – the sound is amazing when you consider this 
was recorded before the days of auto-tune.

Meanwhile Drake (Jay Pharoah) has defended his hotline bling dance moves 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeORm4LMDk>, pointing out that dads (Beck 
Bennett), teachers (Taran Killam), tax guys (Donald Trump) and Ed Grimley 
(Martin Short) all dance like him.


Those of you with a head for heights will love the clip o 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdHD8ZCIC_M>f an illegal climb of the Eiffel 
Tower. The climb started at 1am and eventually ended with a five-hour spell of 
questioning in a Paris police station which lasted into the afternoon. Some of 
James Kingston’s shots are breathtaking. It’s not for the faint-hearted. And to 
end, check outOtto the bulldog  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVnzXA9b7Ww>
who smashes the world record for dog skateboarding – honest!
