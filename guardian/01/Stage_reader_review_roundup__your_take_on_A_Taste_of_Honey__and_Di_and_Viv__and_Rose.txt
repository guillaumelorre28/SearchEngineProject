Do plays have sell by dates? Kickw 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/20842325> suggests perhaps 
they do in his/her comment about A Taste of Honey, currently being revived at 
the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh:

great acting and a fab set, but i found the story incredibly creaky. it's not 
aged well. So many of these plot lines are familiar from soaps, Jeremy Kyle and 
a host of reality shows. It would be really interesting to know what someone 
under 20 might make of this now.

Our reviewer Mark Fisher gave the performance four stars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jan/23/a-taste-of-honey-review> – but 
if you've seen the performance do tell us what you thought.

You can do that either by leaving a comment in the thread below, or by tweeting
@guardianstage <https://twitter.com/guardianstage>. Just as @no2giantpylons 
<https://twitter.com/No2giantpylons> did, in fact, to tell us about her trip to 
the opera:

#GdnReview <https://twitter.com/search/%23GdnReview> I saw "The Minotaur" last 
Thursday. Absolutely brilliant in every way. Fantastic performance of a 
wonderful opera.

<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/20834440> was in touch to 
share his/her thoughts of Genet's The Maids, at the Citizens theatre in Glasgow.

I saw it and thought it was really good. I wasn't sure what to expect but 
really enjoyed it. I feel thecritic of the performances  
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jan/22/the-maids-review>is pretty 
unfair. I felt the cast did a good job and delivered strong performances.

Although UKiwi67 <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/20808719>
 also thought Mark's view was "very fair":

[The performance's] problem was not with casting males, but with YOUNG males 
who don't, perhaps because they are asked to forgo camp, find much range or 
variety.

Seen the show? What did you think?

One last comment – a great one – on Michael Billington's review on Thursday of 
Di and Viv and Rose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jan/24/di-and-viv-and-rose-review>, 
which has just opened at London's Hampstead theatre. Though she took issues 
with the politics of the piece,Chrissie was nonetheless impressed 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/20854358>:

I found it to be a highly enjoyable, moving piece of theatre with sharp 
writing and outstanding performances all round (although for me Outhwaite was 
the revelation, a talent deserving of far more recognition).

That's it for this week's roundup. I hope you enjoy whatever you have tickets 
for this weekend, but even if not – in fact, especially if not – do tell us!
