Forget the future of journalism for a moment and ask instead: what's happening 
now? Do paywalls work? Are newspaper staffs still too white and too middle 
class? Is there any hope for the hundreds of would-be journalists emerging from 
universities and NCTJ courses?

These are the sorts of questions two panels will consider next Thursday (11 
September)in the latest Grapevine event at the Frontline club. 
<http://www.frontlineclub.com/forget-the-future-whats-happening-in-journalism-now/>

The opening panel, chaired by Archie Bland, will include contributions from 
Zing Tsjeng, digital news editor at Dazed magazine, Stephen Bush, the 
Telegraph's assistant comment editor, Emma Hogan ofThe Economist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/the-economist>, and Alex Hern, tech reporter 
with the Guardian.

On the second panel, chaired by City university's George Brock, will be Amol 
Rajan, the Independent's editor, Emma Tucker, deputy editor of the Times, Ian 
Hislop, the Private Eye editor, and Alex Miller, editor-in-chief ofVice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/vice-magazine>.

Doors open at 7pm. The first panel discussion will run from 7.30pm until 
8.20pm. After a 30-minute interval (with drinks and food), the second panel 
will run from 8.50pm until 9.50pm.
