Night time politics summary

I am going to shuffle off into the night. 

 * Parliament began in earnest today, with Labor testing the government’s 
numbers on the floor from the first hour of power. Labor tried unsuccessfully 
to move a motion for a royal commission into the banks. Labor then tried to 
move to the negative gearing issue. Many first speeches were completed, 
including Labor MP Linda Burney and Liberal MP Tim Wilson.

 * The government introduced a number of bills, including the budget omnibus 
bill, the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) bill, the 
registered organisations bill and a number of others. Malcolm Turnbull began 
the day offering negotiations on the industrial relations bills.

 * After a rowdy question time, Labor alleged the treasurer got his numbers 
wrong in the omnibus bill which was going to save the government $6.1bn. Scott 
Morrison scoffed in QT but treasury later put out a statement confirming they 
got the numbers wrong. Scott Morrison wandered into the house to update them. 
It was out by $107m.

 * Labor’s Stephen Conroy inched a step further on the AFP raids on him 
relating to the NBN leaks. The powerful privileges committee will look into the 
documents and determine whether they are protected and also whether the NBN are 
in contempt of the senate. 
Thanks to the brains trust, Murphy, Karp, Hutchens and Bowers, my eyes and 
ears in the chambers. He hears and sees everything....

And thanks to you the readers for your company and comments. Be good. Tomorrow 
is Thursday. All day and the last day of the sitting week.

Night night.

Lee Rhiannon and Derryn Hinch will get three year terms instead of a six year 
term under the allocations made this morning. Rhiannon has described the deal 
by the major parties as undemocratic.

By supporting the less democratic method of determining long term Senators, 
Labor is assisting the conservative side of politics to have more control of 
the Senate following the 2019 election.

This is because the Coalition wins a long term spot when the first six elected 
in a double dissolution method is used. That is at the expense of SenatorDerryn 
Hinch, who would displace a Coalition senator if the fairer half senate recount 
method was used.

Labor has gone for self-interest and increased the risk of right wing 
legislative outcomes.

I spoke to Derryn Hinch five minutes ago. When he first sniffed the breeze on 
this deal just after the election, he threatened it could end up in the courts. 
But he has just conceded it is a matter for the senate. He said even though the 
Australian Electoral Commission recommended according to the count he would be 
in sixth spot for Victoria (and therefore entitled to a six year term), he 
would have to settle for three.

 That’s ok, I will work hard and give people a reason to vote for me.

There are a whole lot of first speeches happening today. Liberal MP Tim Wilson 
is speaking now and it is a ripper. I will try to get the text as I am spinning 
other plates as well. I noted earlierLinda Burney. There was Liberal MP Nicole 
Flint who replaced Andrew Southcott. Liberal MP Andrew Wallace, who replaced 
Mal Brough, has spoken. Labor’s Luke Gosling, the new member for Solomon in 
Northern Territory has also spoken.

Labor ups the ante on AFP raids over NBN leaks in senate

Katharine Murphy

Labor has opened a new front in the controversy over the leaked NBNCo 
documents, asking the privileges committee to examine whether there has been 
“improper interference”, or “attempted improper interference”, withStephen 
Conroy’s free performance as a senator.


The Senate president, Stephen Parry, gave the matter precedence in the Senate 
on Wednesday afternoon, and Senators will determine whether or not the matter 
proceeds to substantive consideration on Thursday.

In making the case for the matter to be given precedence, Conroy told Parry he 
wanted to pursue whether any contempt had been committedduring the police raids 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/19/australian-federal-police-raid-labor-party-offices-in-melbourne>
 and during the investigation into leaked documents by either the Australian 
federal police or by the NBN Co.

Conroy said he was concerned that his telecommunications and communications by 
his staff may have been intercepted and accessed by the AFP – an action, he 
said, that “may constitute a contempt.”

“I am also concerned that NBNCo may have acted on information obtained during 
the raids, over which I had claimed privilege, to penalise NBN Co staff alleged 
to have been connected to the provision of information to enable me to carry 
out my functions as a Senator,” Conroy said in a letter to Parry.

“Any adverse action against an employee of NBN Co because of a suspicion that 
they provided a Senator with information in relation to proceedings in the 
parliament may also constitute a contempt,” he said.

Parry agreed to give the issue precedence, but in a statement to the chamber, 
he said that decision was procedural, rather than an overt signal that he 
believed the matter should go to the privileges committee for inquiry.

The Senate on Wednesday agreed that the privileges committee would determine 
whether material obtained by the AFP in their controversial raids during and 
after the election campaign will be protected.

The government had been signalling it was not inclined to support Labor in 
referring the matter to privileges,but waved the reference through 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/coalition-senate-labor-material-seized-police-nbn-leaks-raid-privilege>
 after Coalition Senators expressed concern about the police conduct and the 
accessing of parliamentary communications.

The Liberal senator Cory Bernardi signalled he could side with Labor  
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/cory-bernardi-signals-he-may-back-labor-over-controversial-nbn-raids>
in sending the matter off to the privileges committee.

The contempt motion raises the stakes in the transaction further, because it 
is possible, at least technically, that the Senate could resolve to apply 
sanctions.

The privileges act has penalty provisions which include “imprisonment for a 
period not exceeding six months for an offence against that house determined by 
that house to have been committed by that person.”

Labor appears confident it has the support to send the contempt inquiry to the 
committee when the vote happens on Thursday.

I missed something this morning. Senator Fifield moved a motion which set out 
who would get six years and who would get three year terms in the senate.

The senate decided on order of election method which means the first six 
senators elected in each state get the six year terms and the second six in 
each state get the three year terms.

While this is a system which has been historically used in double

Linda Burney didn’t meet her Wiradjuri father until she was 28. His first 
words were “I hope you don’t disappoint you”.

She describes the Wiradjuri wars throughout history and visiting massacre 
sites, where her blood ran cold.

Her Sydney seat of Barton has many different cultures and she notes she is not 
sure whatEdmund Barton - Australia’s first prime minister - would think of it, 
especially with a Koori woman representing the seat.

I am going to shuffle off into the night. 

 * Parliament began in earnest today, with Labor testing the government’s 
numbers on the floor from the first hour of power. Labor tried unsuccessfully 
to move a motion for a royal commission into the banks. Labor then tried to 
move to the negative gearing issue. Many first speeches were completed, 
including Labor MP Linda Burney and Liberal MP Tim Wilson.

 * The government introduced a number of bills, including the budget omnibus 
bill, the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) bill, the 
registered organisations bill and a number of others. Malcolm Turnbull began 
the day offering negotiations on the industrial relations bills.

 * After a rowdy question time, Labor alleged the treasurer got his numbers 
wrong in the omnibus bill which was going to save the government $6.1bn. Scott 
Morrison scoffed in QT but treasury later put out a statement confirming they 
got the numbers wrong. Scott Morrison wandered into the house to update them. 
It was out by $107m.

 * Labor’s Stephen Conroy inched a step further on the AFP raids on him 
relating to the NBN leaks. The powerful privileges committee will look into the 
documents and determine whether they are protected and also whether the NBN are 
in contempt of the senate. 
Thanks to the brains trust, Murphy, Karp, Hutchens and Bowers, my eyes and 
ears in the chambers. He hears and sees everything....

And thanks to you the readers for your company and comments. Be good. Tomorrow 
is Thursday. All day and the last day of the sitting week.

Night night. 
 
Lee Rhiannon and Derryn Hinch will get three year terms instead of a six year 
term under the allocations made this morning. Rhiannon has described the deal 
by the major parties as undemocratic.

By supporting the less democratic method of determining long term Senators, 
Labor is assisting the conservative side of politics to have more control of 
the Senate following the 2019 election.

This is because the Coalition wins a long term spot when the first six elected 
in a double dissolution method is used. That is at the expense of SenatorDerryn 
Hinch, who would displace a Coalition senator if the fairer half senate recount 
method was used.

Labor has gone for self-interest and increased the risk of right wing 
legislative outcomes.

I spoke to Derryn Hinch five minutes ago. When he first sniffed the breeze on 
this deal just after the election, he threatened it could end up in the courts. 
But he has just conceded it is a matter for the senate. He said even though the 
Australian Electoral Commission recommended according to the count he would be 
in sixth spot for Victoria (and therefore entitled to a six year term), he 
would have to settle for three.

 That’s ok, I will work hard and give people a reason to vote for me.

 
There are a whole lot of first speeches happening today. Liberal MP Tim Wilson 
is speaking now and it is a ripper. I will try to get the text as I am spinning 
other plates as well. I noted earlierLinda Burney. There was Liberal MP Nicole 
Flint who replaced Andrew Southcott. Liberal MP Andrew Wallace, who replaced 
Mal Brough, has spoken. Labor’s Luke Gosling, the new member for Solomon in 
Northern Territory has also spoken.
 
Labor has opened a new front in the controversy over the leaked NBNCo 
documents, asking the privileges committee to examine whether there has been 
“improper interference”, or “attempted improper interference”, withStephen 
Conroy’s free performance as a senator.


The Senate president, Stephen Parry, gave the matter precedence in the Senate 
on Wednesday afternoon, and Senators will determine whether or not the matter 
proceeds to substantive consideration on Thursday.

In making the case for the matter to be given precedence, Conroy told Parry he 
wanted to pursue whether any contempt had been committedduring the police raids 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/19/australian-federal-police-raid-labor-party-offices-in-melbourne>
 and during the investigation into leaked documents by either the Australian 
federal police or by the NBN Co.

Conroy said he was concerned that his telecommunications and communications by 
his staff may have been intercepted and accessed by the AFP – an action, he 
said, that “may constitute a contempt.”

“I am also concerned that NBNCo may have acted on information obtained during 
the raids, over which I had claimed privilege, to penalise NBN Co staff alleged 
to have been connected to the provision of information to enable me to carry 
out my functions as a Senator,” Conroy said in a letter to Parry.

“Any adverse action against an employee of NBN Co because of a suspicion that 
they provided a Senator with information in relation to proceedings in the 
parliament may also constitute a contempt,” he said.

Parry agreed to give the issue precedence, but in a statement to the chamber, 
he said that decision was procedural, rather than an overt signal that he 
believed the matter should go to the privileges committee for inquiry.

The Senate on Wednesday agreed that the privileges committee would determine 
whether material obtained by the AFP in their controversial raids during and 
after the election campaign will be protected.

The government had been signalling it was not inclined to support Labor in 
referring the matter to privileges,but waved the reference through 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/coalition-senate-labor-material-seized-police-nbn-leaks-raid-privilege>
 after Coalition Senators expressed concern about the police conduct and the 
accessing of parliamentary communications.

The Liberal senator Cory Bernardi signalled he could side with Labor  
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/cory-bernardi-signals-he-may-back-labor-over-controversial-nbn-raids>
in sending the matter off to the privileges committee.

The contempt motion raises the stakes in the transaction further, because it 
is possible, at least technically, that the Senate could resolve to apply 
sanctions.

The privileges act has penalty provisions which include “imprisonment for a 
period not exceeding six months for an offence against that house determined by 
that house to have been committed by that person.”

Labor appears confident it has the support to send the contempt inquiry to the 
committee when the vote happens on Thursday.

I missed something this morning. Senator Fifield moved a motion which set out 
who would get six years and who would get three year terms in the senate.

The senate decided on order of election method which means the first six 
senators elected in each state get the six year terms and the second six in 
each state get the three year terms.

While this is a system which has been historically used in double 
dissolutions, the Hawke government introduced adifferent rule

 known as section 282 which would have changed the outcome. I have yet to hear 
any complains out of the senate but I will do a ring around.

Burney said she was told as a school girl her race would limit her potential 
but she sends out a message to young Indigenous girls.

If I can stand in this place then so can they.
 
Linda Burney didn’t meet her Wiradjuri father until she was 28. His first 
words were “I hope you don’t disappoint you”.

She describes the Wiradjuri wars throughout history and visiting massacre 
sites, where her blood ran cold.

Her Sydney seat of Barton has many different cultures and she notes she is not 
sure whatEdmund Barton - Australia’s first prime minister - would think of it, 
especially with a Koori woman representing the seat.
 
Linda Burney has arranged for her Wiradjuri sister Lynette Riley to sing her 
into the parliament.

I was born at a time when the Australian government knew how many sheep there 
were but not Aboriginal people, says Burney.
