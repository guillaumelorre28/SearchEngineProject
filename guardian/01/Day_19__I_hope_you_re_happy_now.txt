I went down there yesterday. I had to go. And the police let me through the 
cordon as long as I promised just to look, not touch, not take anything away. 
It's all evidence now.Evidence of something

.

There was a note, scrawled on the back of a glossy image that looked as though 
it had been torn from an art book. They wouldn't let me turn over the picture 
to see what was on the other side. But, through the smeared windscreen, I could 
read:

"I'm sorry to do it like this. I really am sorry but I need the peace. It's 
too much for me. It's been too much for a long time but somehow I couldn't see 
it.

"My life has been so dark. But now I think maybe it's only when you're in the 
dark that you can see the light. Or see where the light is coming from. When 
you're in the dark, the light's so bright and clear, even if it's far away.

"No one lives forever <http://arts.theguardian.com/elvis/0,,773411,00.html>. 
So I'm on my way to heaven now. Or somewhere close to it. Close enough. Daniel, 
the Art Gallery Man will understand. He's seen it too. Tell him I hope to see 
him there one day.

I love you all,
Vic"

At the bottom she'd drawn a funny little squiggle. Like a child's drawing of a 
house. Except without the usual tree next to it. Instead, there was another 
drawing: just a triangle pointing upwards, with a squiggly line running all the 
way across, about a third of the way down. It looked like the tip of a pencil. 
Or like â€¦

Funny, one of the policemen said to me, they'd found her bag but not her 
passport. It wasn't in her house either, as far as they could see. Did I know 
where she kept it? Just routine, really.

And that's when I knew for certain.
