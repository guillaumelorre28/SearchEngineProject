In the spring of 1976, David Bowie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie> was dangerously close to burnout 
from fame and drugs. He had just released his 10th studio album, Station to 
Station, and, with Iggy Pop in tow, was travelling through a Europe that he 
interpreted through his ambiguous obsessions with cold war politics and the 
second world war.

The mid-1970s saw a remarkable renaissance in German rock, with 
ground-breaking records byKraftwerk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/kraftwerk>, Neu!, Tangerine Dream, Faust, 
Can and others.

Much of this music combined rhythmic repetition, synthesiser pulses and 
melodic, perceptual phases into something that was both ambient and perfect to 
listen to while travelling.

The title track from Station to Station, in particular, inhabited this motorik 
feel. In April, Bowie and Iggy met Kraftwerk – an event immortalised by the 
German group on 1977's Trans-Europe Express. In late summer 1976, Bowie 
resettled in west Berlin and began a series of recordings that would reassert 
his position as a cultural leader. 

During 1977, Bowie released two futuristic albums: Low and Heroes. Each 
matched a side of clipped songs with another of evocative, ambient 
instrumentals created with Brian Eno. The mood was withdrawn, remote and even, 
on occasion, lush. Their influence on British music in the late 70s and 
early 80s was immense.
