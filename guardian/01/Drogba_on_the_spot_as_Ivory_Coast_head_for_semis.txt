Ivory Coast won a dramatic 24-penalty shoot-out against Cameroon to become the 
only representative of the continent's five World Cup qualifiers in tomorrow's 
African Cup of Nations semi-finals.

With the scores level at 1-1 after extra-time all 11 players on each side, 
including the goalkeepers, scored with the first 22 penalties. Cameroon's 
Samuel Eto'o, taking his second spot-kick, wafted the ball over and Chelsea's 
Didier Drogba hit the decisive strike.

The match had been a bruising affair, with Eto'o, the tournament's top 
marksman with five, singled out by the Ivorians, including Arsenal's Kolo 
Tour√©, who was booked for a crude foul on the Barcelona striker.

Ivory Coast's French coach, Henri Michel, refused to get carried away with his 
team's victory. "Just because we've beaten Cameroon doesn't make us world 
champions," he said yesterday. "We're not even the African champions. It's good 
to have beaten them, bravo, but we've got Nigeria next. The toughest is still 
to come; we've proved nothing yet."
