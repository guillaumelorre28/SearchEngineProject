Yes it is. However, gravitational waves don't interact with matter, while 
light does. Therefore, in principle we can use gravitational waves to look 
further back in time than with light, although the the detectors required to do 
this look must look at different frequencies than LIGO.

This discovery begins a completely new way to view the universe. So far 
astronomers have only had access to the different wavelengths of the 
electromagnetic spectrum (visible light, radio, microwaves, X rays, gamma rays 
etc) to view the Universe. By using gravitational waves we can discover extreme 
astrophysical systems which are in regimes where gravity has a very strong 
influence on the evolution of the system -- black hole mergers of different 
mass ranges (all the way from BH of the mass of the sun to supermassive 
blackholes in the hearts of galaxies); mergers of neutron stars - imagine 
superdense rapidly-spinning spheres of nuclear matter roughly the size of 
London!). We might even discover gravitational waves from the first instants of 
the birth of the Universe!

"From an astronomer's point of view, this discovery opens up a completely new 
way of looking at the Universe"

LucyInthesky <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/162586> asks:

As an observation, this is a brilliant combination of technology, engineering 
and science. But given that gravitational waves have been worked on/with 
theoretically for a century, and nothing in the theoretical work has ever 
contradicted Einstein’s assumptions, in what way does this observation tell us 
anything we didn’t already ‘know’, other than verifying it by observation? And 
how is this going to change future scientific work?

You are right that this spectacular verification of Einstein's prediction from 
general relativity could have been expected, given all the other ways General 
Relativity's predictions have been confirmed. The reason that thousands of 
scientists have been patiently looking for this for such a long time, steadily 
increasing the sensitivity of their detectors, is because they were fairly 
certain that a signal would eventually be detected. However, it is fundamental 
to the scientific method that theoretical predictions are verified by 
observation or experiment. Even for our most successful theories, we have to 
keep testing their predictions, because eventually the theory will break down, 
and we will discover new physics. We already know that Einstein's gravity is 
not the full picture, as it is incompatible with quantum mechanics. From an 
astronomer's point of view, this discovery opens up a completely new way of 
looking at the Universe, in gravitational waves rather than electromagnetic 
waves. It is very significant that this is not just the first discovery of 
gravitational waves, but also the first detection of the merger of a black 
hole-black hole system. We are going to make a lot of astronomical discoveries 
that no one has yet anticipated - this has happened every time a new part of 
the electromagnetic spectrum has been opened up to astronomers, and with 
gravitational waves we are in "here be dragons" territory.

Firstly just wow. Now I’ve got lots of questions about what actually happens 
as the black holes merge and what we can learn from the signal.

Are the gravitational waves coming from inside the event horizon(s)? If so 
does this mean we’re getting information from inside the merged black hole?

Theoretically the black holes themselves are singularities with no extent. So 
what does it mean to say that they merge? They ought to be able to get 
infinitely close together without actually merging. As they do so their orbits 
should become infinitely fast. But the faster they orbit the more energy they 
radiate away as gravitational waves. At some point the orbital speed is going 
to become so high that relativistic effects will become significant. What 
happens then? Does this limit the orbital speed and therefore accelerate the 
merger? Is this effect measurable in the signal?

If the black holes are not points (as is kind of necessary to make quantum 
gravity work) would there be evidence for this in the signal? Could this 
possibly present experimental evidence to validate theories beyond the standard 
model?

Lastly I read that 3 solar masses worth of energy were radiated away as 
gravitational waves during the event. If the universe is open the radiation 
will spread out forever becoming fainter and fainter and eventually being lost 
in background noise. But if the universe is closed then the waves would 
eventually loop back on themselves - the waves would be contained. Would it be 
possible to determine the shape of the universe based on the nature of the 
gravitational background noise? I’d have thought it ought to be possible to put 
a limit on the minimum size of a closed universe based on the gravitational 
background noise although I expect we’d need much better detectors to make this 
possible.

Again wow. Probably the most significant scientific observation of my lifetime.

The gravitational waves that escaped the merger and eventually travelled to us 
were produced outside the event horizons of the original (and final) black 
holes, so that they are not coming from inside the event horizons. Since 
gravitational waves only propagate at the speed of light, they cannot escape 
from inside the event horizon of a black hole.
When we talk about two black holes merging, what we really mean is that the 
event horizons of the two black holes eventually overlap with each other, 
resulting in a single event horizon. The pre-merger black holes were already 
moving fast enough that relativistic effects were important. Further, since the 
two merging objects are black holes, the actual merger was governed by General 
Relativity and thus an example of an event where relativistic effects are 
extremely important.
This signal that was detected was created well within the classical regime, so 
that it can't be used to directly tell us anything about quantum gravity. 
Further, the various sources of noise in the detector are much, much larger 
than any quantum gravitational effects we expect in the signal so that with 
only the one event we can't probe the quantum regime.
The current bounds on the size of the universe are already stronger than 
limits we would be able to obtain from observations of binary merger events 
such as those LIGO will see.

Yes, another detector will help with determining the direction that any 
signals detected originated from. This information can then help astronomers to 
point a telescope in the direction the gravitational wave signal came from to 
look for electromagnetic counterparts such as gamma rays.

The wave will continue to propagate at the speed of light away from the 
original black hole collision. However, it will not pass by us again.

Christian Beaumont <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15888635> asks:

If gravity waves traveled at the speed of light away from the Big Bang, then 
surely they would be long gone, since the Earth is not travelling away from the 
Big Bang at the speed of light.

How would it therefore be possible to probe “..relics from the Big Bang”, 
given the wave-front already passed?

I suppose one could argue that measurements of the density structures of the 
cosmos itself are indirect measurements of the Big Bang... although that seems 
a little misleading.

The Big Bang wasn't an event that occurred at one point within our universe. 
It occurred everywhere. This means that any relics of the big ban would have 
been produced at all points in the universe. Therefore, wavefronts originating 
from more and more distant points away from us are constantly passing us, 
allowing us to look for such Big Bang relics.

Dr Jonathan Braden <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/star/people/jbraden> has also been

How are they able to be so specific about the two merging black holes, 
distance, direction and mass?

2:08pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/68544412> 
The exact shape of the signal that they saw depends on various properties of 
the two black holes that collided, so by looking carefully at the shape of the 
signal they were able to understand something about the masses of the black 
holes. To get the direction, they needed to use the fact that they have two 
detectors. As more GW detectors come online, the ability to determine the 
direction of events will improve.

this is a rather distinctive pattern of wavelengths, so there aren't many 
events like this. But the most impressive test is the near-identical traces 
seen in the two LIGO detectors, separated by a time consistent with a wave 
travelling across them at the speed of light. Local background "noise" would 
not do that.

UhOhSeven <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13276365> has a question, 
which was answered by an amateur physicist in the comments, to which Jon 
Butterworth has added his thoughts.

Can you explain why the passage of the gravitational wave through the 
detecting apparatus didn’t correspondingly alter the dimensions of the 
apparatus itself, cancelling out the interference effect?

 <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/68510823> 
I'm only an amateur physicist, but I think I can answer your question. It's 
the change in the dimensions of the detecting apparatus itself that's measured 
in the LIGO experiment. The basic set-up is two, long, high vacuum tunnels, at 
right angles to each other. Laser beams travel up and down the tunnels several 
times, reflected by mirrors at each end, multiplying the distance travelled, 
and the beams are finally brought together where the the arms meet, where they 
form an interference pattern.

When the passage of a gravitational wave causes one of the arms to lengthen by 
a tiny amount, the laser beam in that arm takes fractionally longer to travel 
the distance than the beam in the other arm, and the change shows up in the 
interference pattern.

What I don't know is whether time is affected by the gravity wave. Since we're 
often told that the universe is actually a spacetime continuum, I imagine it 
is. So I imagine there's a way of accounting for that. Or maybe in the 
mathematics of the Standard Model there's no need to distinguish between time 
and space. Professor?

you're pretty much right, except that the waves propagate like this:

<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/GravitationalWave_PlusPolarization.gif>
so they stretch one arm and shrink the other, and then back again. And the 
speed of light remains constant, so the time taken for the light to travel 
along the arms changes.

Yes it is. However, gravitational waves don't interact with matter, while 
light does. Therefore, in principle we can use gravitational waves to look 
further back in time than with light, although the the detectors required to do 
this look must look at different frequencies than LIGO.

This discovery begins a completely new way to view the universe. So far 
astronomers have only had access to the different wavelengths of the 
electromagnetic spectrum (visible light, radio, microwaves, X rays, gamma rays 
etc) to view the Universe. By using gravitational waves we can discover extreme 
astrophysical systems which are in regimes where gravity has a very strong 
influence on the evolution of the system -- black hole mergers of different 
mass ranges (all the way from BH of the mass of the sun to supermassive 
blackholes in the hearts of galaxies); mergers of neutron stars - imagine 
superdense rapidly-spinning spheres of nuclear matter roughly the size of 
London!). We might even discover gravitational waves from the first instants of 
the birth of the Universe!
 
LucyInthesky <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/162586> asks:

As an observation, this is a brilliant combination of technology, engineering 
and science. But given that gravitational waves have been worked on/with 
theoretically for a century, and nothing in the theoretical work has ever 
contradicted Einstein’s assumptions, in what way does this observation tell us 
anything we didn’t already ‘know’, other than verifying it by observation? And 
how is this going to change future scientific work?

You are right that this spectacular verification of Einstein's prediction from 
general relativity could have been expected, given all the other ways General 
Relativity's predictions have been confirmed. The reason that thousands of 
scientists have been patiently looking for this for such a long time, steadily 
increasing the sensitivity of their detectors, is because they were fairly 
certain that a signal would eventually be detected. However, it is fundamental 
to the scientific method that theoretical predictions are verified by 
observation or experiment. Even for our most successful theories, we have to 
keep testing their predictions, because eventually the theory will break down, 
and we will discover new physics. We already know that Einstein's gravity is 
not the full picture, as it is incompatible with quantum mechanics. From an 
astronomer's point of view, this discovery opens up a completely new way of 
looking at the Universe, in gravitational waves rather than electromagnetic 
waves. It is very significant that this is not just the first discovery of 
gravitational waves, but also the first detection of the merger of a black 
hole-black hole system. We are going to make a lot of astronomical discoveries 
that no one has yet anticipated - this has happened every time a new part of 
the electromagnetic spectrum has been opened up to astronomers, and with 
gravitational waves we are in "here be dragons" territory.
 
Ab Wilson <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13408478> writes:

Firstly just wow. Now I’ve got lots of questions about what actually happens 
as the black holes merge and what we can learn from the signal.

Are the gravitational waves coming from inside the event horizon(s)? If so 
does this mean we’re getting information from inside the merged black hole?

Theoretically the black holes themselves are singularities with no extent. So 
what does it mean to say that they merge? They ought to be able to get 
infinitely close together without actually merging. As they do so their orbits 
should become infinitely fast. But the faster they orbit the more energy they 
radiate away as gravitational waves. At some point the orbital speed is going 
to become so high that relativistic effects will become significant. What 
happens then? Does this limit the orbital speed and therefore accelerate the 
merger? Is this effect measurable in the signal?

If the black holes are not points (as is kind of necessary to make quantum 
gravity work) would there be evidence for this in the signal? Could this 
possibly present experimental evidence to validate theories beyond the standard 
model?

Lastly I read that 3 solar masses worth of energy were radiated away as 
gravitational waves during the event. If the universe is open the radiation 
will spread out forever becoming fainter and fainter and eventually being lost 
in background noise. But if the universe is closed then the waves would 
eventually loop back on themselves - the waves would be contained. Would it be 
possible to determine the shape of the universe based on the nature of the 
gravitational background noise? I’d have thought it ought to be possible to put 
a limit on the minimum size of a closed universe based on the gravitational 
background noise although I expect we’d need much better detectors to make this 
possible.

Again wow. Probably the most significant scientific observation of my lifetime.

The gravitational waves that escaped the merger and eventually travelled to us 
were produced outside the event horizons of the original (and final) black 
holes, so that they are not coming from inside the event horizons. Since 
gravitational waves only propagate at the speed of light, they cannot escape 
from inside the event horizon of a black hole.
When we talk about two black holes merging, what we really mean is that the 
event horizons of the two black holes eventually overlap with each other, 
resulting in a single event horizon. The pre-merger black holes were already 
moving fast enough that relativistic effects were important. Further, since the 
two merging objects are black holes, the actual merger was governed by General 
Relativity and thus an example of an event where relativistic effects are 
extremely important.
This signal that was detected was created well within the classical regime, so 
that it can't be used to directly tell us anything about quantum gravity. 
Further, the various sources of noise in the detector are much, much larger 
than any quantum gravitational effects we expect in the signal so that with 
only the one event we can't probe the quantum regime.
The current bounds on the size of the universe are already stronger than 
limits we would be able to obtain from observations of binary merger events 
such as those LIGO will see.

Yes, another detector will help with determining the direction that any 
signals detected originated from. This information can then help astronomers to 
point a telescope in the direction the gravitational wave signal came from to 
look for electromagnetic counterparts such as gamma rays.

The wave will continue to propagate at the speed of light away from the 
original black hole collision. However, it will not pass by us again.
 
Christian Beaumont <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15888635> asks:

If gravity waves traveled at the speed of light away from the Big Bang, then 
surely they would be long gone, since the Earth is not travelling away from the 
Big Bang at the speed of light.

How would it therefore be possible to probe “..relics from the Big Bang”, 
given the wave-front already passed?

I suppose one could argue that measurements of the density structures of the 
cosmos itself are indirect measurements of the Big Bang... although that seems 
a little misleading.

The Big Bang wasn't an event that occurred at one point within our universe. 
It occurred everywhere. This means that any relics of the big ban would have 
been produced at all points in the universe. Therefore, wavefronts originating 
from more and more distant points away from us are constantly passing us, 
allowing us to look for such Big Bang relics.
 
Dr Jonathan Braden <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/star/people/jbraden> has also been

How are they able to be so specific about the two merging black holes,

2:08pm <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/68544412> 
The exact shape of the signal that they saw depends on various properties of 
the two black holes that collided, so by looking carefully at the shape of the 
signal they were able to understand something about the masses of the black 
holes. To get the direction, they needed to use the fact that they have two 
detectors. As more GW detectors come online, the ability to determine the 
direction of events will improve.

this is a rather distinctive pattern of wavelengths, so there aren't many 
events like this. But the most impressive test is the near-identical traces 
seen in the two LIGO detectors, separated by a time consistent with a wave 
travelling across them at the speed of light. Local background "noise" would 
not do that.

in the LIGO experiment. The basic set-up is two, long, high vacuum tunnels, at 
right angles to each other. Laser beams travel up and down the tunnels several 
times, reflected by mirrors at each end, multiplying the distance travelled, 
and the beams are finally brought together where the the arms meet, where they 
form an interference pattern.

When the passage of a gravitational wave causes one of the arms to lengthen by 
a tiny amount, the laser beam in that arm takes fractionally longer to travel 
the distance than the beam in the other arm, and the change shows up in the 
interference pattern.

What I don't know is whether time is affected by the gravity wave. Since we're 
often told that the universe is actually a spacetime continuum, I imagine it 
is. So I imagine there's a way of accounting for that. Or maybe in the 
mathematics of the Standard Model there's no need to distinguish between time 
and space. Professor?

you're pretty much right, except that the waves propagate like this:

so they stretch one arm and shrink the other, and then back again. And the 
speed of light remains constant, so the time taken for the light to travel 
along the arms changes.
 
Just in case you need some visualisation...
