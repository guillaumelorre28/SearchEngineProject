Nigeria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nigeria-football-team> have the 
only 100% record after defeating the holders, Tunisia, 6-5 in a penalty 
shoot-out, avenging a shoot-out defeat in the 2004 tournament. West Brom's 
Nwankwo Kanu was the somewhat reluctant taker of the decisive penalty before 
Vincent Enyeama saved from Tunisia's Riadh Bouazizi.

The match had finished 1-1 with the Nigerian teenager Obinna Nsofor opening 
the scoring before Karim Hagui levelled with a far-post header after the 
interval. In between Tunisia's Jose Clayton saw his first-half penalty saved by 
Enyeama. John Obi Mikel, the 18-year-old coveted by Manchester United and 
Chelsea, was named man of the match for the second game running.

"What I'm trying to do here is to get a balance in our team," said Augustine 
Eguavoen, who is aiming to be the first Nigerian coach to win the Nations Cup. 
"If you look at the entire team, yes we have young players in key positions."

With the hosts Egypt, who beat DR Congo 4-1, facing Senegal, 3-2 victors over 
Guinea, in the other semi-final tomorrow, the tournament is wide open.
