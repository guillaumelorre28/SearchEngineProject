Elena Baltacha and Anne Keothavong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> gave Judy Murray a winning 
start to life as captain of the Great Britain Fed Cup team . The experienced 
pair were chosen ahead of Laura Robson and Heather Watson for singles duty 
against Portugal and posted straight-sets victories over lower-ranked opponents 
to give the team a solid opening to their Europe/Africa Group I Pool C campaign 
at the four-day event in Eilat, Israel.

Murray's squad gained an unassailable lead against Portugal thanks to the 
success of the singles duo, before Watson and Robson sealed a 3-0 victory for 
Britain with a 7-5, 6-0 doubles win.

Britain are a long way from competing at the highest level in the Fed Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/fed-cup>. They have been in Europe/Africa 
Zone Group I for eight years in a row but, with two top-100 players and Robson 
and Watson both on the brink of double-digit rankings, hopes are high this 
could be the year they get their chance in World Group II.

They will play Holland and Israel over the next two days with the possibility 
of a promotion play-off on Saturday if they finish top of their pool. 
Keothavong, 88th in the WTA rankings, was first on court against the world 
No194, Maria João Köhler, and recorded a 6-3 6-4 success. Baltacha, the world 
No57, then beat Michelle Larcher De Brito 6-2 6-3.

Murray, mother of world No4 Andy Murray and doubles specialist Jamie, came to 
the Fed Cup captaincy on the back of a strong track record in coaching. The 
former Scottish national coach took up her new role with the LawnTennis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Association in December.
