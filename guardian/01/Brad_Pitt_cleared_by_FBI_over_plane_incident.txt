Brad Pitt <https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradpitt> will not face any 
charges stemming from an incident on a private plane in which he was reported 
to have lost his temper in front of one or more of his children, an FBI 
spokeswoman has said.

Pitt, 52, was cleared earlier this month by the Los Angeles county department 
of children and family services over the incident on 14 September. His wife, 
the actorAngelina Jolie <https://www.theguardian.com/film/angelinajolie>, filed 
for divorce five days later.

“In response to allegations made following a flight within the special 
aircraft jurisdiction of the United States which landed in Los Angeles carrying 
Mr Brad Pitt and his children, theFBI <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> 
has conducted a review of the circumstances and will not pursue further 
investigation,” said Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the FBI’s Los Angeles 
field office.

 “No charges have been filed in this matter,” she said. 

Jolie, 41, filed for divorce from Pitt, her husband of two years and partner 
since 2005, citing irreconcilable differences and seeking full physical custody 
of their children, who are aged between eight and 15.

At the time, Jolie said her decision to end the marriage “was made for the 
health of the family”.
