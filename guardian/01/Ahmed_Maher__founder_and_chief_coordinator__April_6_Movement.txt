 Activate London 2012: Ahmed Maher 
Ahmed is the founder and chief coordinator of the April 6 Movement, one of the 
most illustrious pro-democracy movements in Egypt. The A6M acquired its name 
from the first general strike organized in Egypt on April 6, 2008. Ahmed 
organized the masses both in the virtual and real world to a show of strength 
that brought down a dictator. The A6M stresses non-violence a secular ideology 
and an apolitical stance. Since Ahmed was ousted last year Ahmed has continued 
organized protests and over heightened violence against activists and concern 
that military leadership is delaying transition to civilian rule.
