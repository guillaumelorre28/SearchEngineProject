Russell Lissack, who joined Ash when his other band, Bloc Party, went on 
indefinite musical hiatus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/19/bloc-party> at the end of 2009, 
has left the pop-punk band. His departure had prompted rumours that he has 
reunited with his band-mates in Bloc Party.

"Russell's been brilliant," Ash singer Tim Wheeler told the Sun

 this week. "We'll have him for our festivals hopefully." But the axeman is 
allegedly no longer a part of the band's day-to-day operations. "We'll have to 
think," Wheeler admitted. "I do enjoy having the second guitarist so we've got 
our eyes peeled."

Lissack was invited to join Ash

 about a year ago, after the Northern Irish trio learned he was a fan. "As soon 
as they called me I was really excited," he said. "I'm not sure how [it] will 
work out, but we seem to have got on well so far." He has since joined them on 
a string of tours, including a visit to South Africa - where he wasattacked by
