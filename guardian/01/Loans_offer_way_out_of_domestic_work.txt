Rosita Sánchez Cumbicus, 48, is proof that there are alternatives to domestic 
work. She is still employed in a domestic role for a couple of hours every 
morning, but in the afternoons she returns to her dream job – running her cafe 
in the centre of a small town near Loja, in southern Ecuador.

She has had the cafe for two years, thanks to Faces, a microfinance 
organisation handpicked by CARE International UK to participate in its new 
Lendwithcare.org programme.

"I used to be very shy. At the beginning of my marriage I only worked and 
didn't have friends or go out. My husband used to hit me – but not any more. 
Now I am financially independent, he has learned to respect me and he often 
comes to help me wash up at the cafe at the end of the day," says the mother of 
three.

Unlike a loan from a commercial bank, loans from Faces start small, so 
borrowers are not overwhelmed, and a husband's signature is not required.

Luis Palacios Burneas, executive president of Faces, says: "We design products 
especially for women because they need more advantages and we see it as a way 
of tackling poverty as a whole. If you improve the woman's situation, you 
improve the family's situation."

Most importantly, Sánchez Cumbicus's business allows her to spend time with 
her children – something difficult to do in domestic work. "They are always 
telling me to rest but I don't want to," she says. "When I'm working at the 
cafe I can forget everything and be happy. I feel very proud of what I have 
achieved."
