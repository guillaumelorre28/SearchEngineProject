Paradiso

This former church first became a music venue when it was squatted by hippies 
in the 60s, and it remains one of the city's most memorable and busiest venues 
for rock, pop and beyond. The main hall, with a capacity of 1,500, has a sense 
of grandeur, with stained-glass windows behind the band and two balconies 
overlooking the masses on the floor. Whether it's Brian Wilson on the stage or 
Queens of the Stone Age, you'll always feel close to the action, and if there 
is any remaining flower-power vibe it's that anyone can grab a spot in the 
front row or take any pew on the balcony. A smaller room upstairs hosts 
independents and breakthrough talents.

Bimhuis

Three decades after this jazz venue was established by a group of musicians in 
a smoky former furniture salesroom by a canal, it moved into a cutting-edge 
custom-built hall jutting from the side of theMuziekgebouw aan 't IJ 
<http://www.muziekgebouw.nl> building. Bimhuis is not only the top jazz venue 
in Amsterdam, but it's also regarded by professionals as one of the best music 
rooms in the world. A brilliant live space – intimate (holding just 375), 
comfortable and acoustically perfect. These days the calendar is suitably 
diverse, mixing up local improvisation maestros such as drummerHan Bennink 
<http://www.hanbennink.com> and pianist Misha Mengelberg, and international 
stars such asMarc Ribot <http://www.marcribot.com> and Joshua Redman 
<http://www.joshuaredman.com>, touching on every aspect of the jazz repertoire 
on the way.

This family-run blues bar is internationally renowned, which is impressive for 
what is essentially a narrow, beer-stained cavern on the ground floor of an 
unassuming canal-side property. As you'd expect, the atmosphere is thick in 
this bar, which has welcomed everyone from Joe Cocker to the Blasters over the 
decades. Pictures of blues icons who have graced the stage still hang on the 
walls, but these days you're more likely to come across a roster of minor 
touring acts from the US and Europe, the dirtier side of the international 
rockabilly scene, rootsy singer-songwriters and punk poets.

Melkweg

This centrally-located cultural centre houses not only two concert halls (one 
holding 1,500, the other 700), but also a cinema, a cafe, an upstairs theatre, 
a photography gallery and a recently built, rather swanky hall that's used in 
collaboration with the adjacentStadsschouwburg theatre 
<http://www.ssba.nl/page.ocl?pageID=1&mode=&version=&MenuID=0>. You'd be wrong 
to think of Melkweg as a multiplex, though – the black-walled concert halls 
still retain the rock'n'roll, beer-in-plastic-cups charm they acquired when the 
venue, then a disused dairy factory, was taken over in 1970 by a theatre 
collective to quickly become a centre of European hippydom. Rock, hip-hop and 
reggae are staples, but anything goes – its stages have seen everyone from
Wu-Tang <http://www.wutang-corp.com> through the Libertines to the Prodigy.

Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ

When it opened in 2005, this riverside concert hall promised futuristic 
solutions to classical music performance, and it has lived up to the hype. Home 
to Amsterdam's top contemporary classical ensembles, it also hosts touring 
orchestras who specialise in the sounds of today, and international festivals 
dedicated to the likes of Reich and Stockhausen. The main hall is ultimately 
flexible: every detail can be altered for specific seating, acoustic and 
lighting requirements. The venue also welcomes non-classical guests, so long as 
they bring a twist to proceedings. In 2010, Faith No More's Mike Patton gave a 
blood vessel-bursting performance alongside Dutch jazz greats and a chamber 
choir, while this year the twins from The National recreated the Long Count, 
their multimedia-meets-classical-meets-rock opera.

De Nieuwe Anita

A lounge scattered with secondhand armchairs and grandma's lamps plays second 
home to a hip (but friendly) crowd who buy their bottled beer at a round, low 
bar that sometimes doubles as a makeshift stage for some of the quieter shows. 
Walk through a door disguised as a bookshelf and you'll find yourself on a 
mezzanine looking down on the main stage. This is a place for small-scale gigs 
by local bands as well as international alternative greats such as Whiskey 
Rabbi Geoff Berner with his punk klezmer, or the lo-fi charm of Ariel Pink's 
Haunted Graffiti. On a Tuesday night you can even get a haircut while a band 
plays.

While many music rooms in Amsterdam reflect squat culture, few are still so 
openly squat-minded as this legalised art and noise complex at the end of 
Vondelpark. Besides the recently refurbished gig room (finally bringing the 
stage, sound system and toilets up to scratch), there are rehearsal studios, a 
children's theatre, a vegan cafe and a squatter library. Its programming is 
eclectic, playing host to the underground of the underground. Think queer punk 
nights, hardcore, glitchcore, new wave, experimental hip-hop, art rock and 
obscure jazz freak-out. Better-known outsiders such as Melt-Banana,Scout Niblett
 <http://www.scoutniblett.com> and the Sun Ra Arkestra occasionally pack the 
place out, but pick any of the old-school photocopied posters on the wall to 
find an interesting time.

Tropentheater
 Tropentheater 
Housed in a grand neo-renaissance building overlooking Oosterpark in the east 
of the city, the Tropentheater is the performance arm of the Tropeninstituut 
(Royal Tropical Institute), which also houses a large museum and research 
quarters dedicated to Dutch colonialism. Unsurprisingly, the programming remit 
of the theatre is music of international origin, with particular focus on 
artists from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Its two halls 
cater perfectly to such diversity, be it the delicate kora sounds of Mali's 
Toumani Diabaté or the rowdy Inner Mongolian folk punk of Hanggai. Shows are 
seated, however, so don't expect a dance-inducing atmosphere. At least not 
until the globally-infused after-party kicks in.

Tolhuistuin

Over the waters of the river IJ via a short (and free) ferry ride from Central 
Station, lies the best example of how to deal with the endless renovations, 
building sites and postponed reopening deadlines that have plagued Amsterdam in 
recent years. Tolhuistuin is a beautiful garden that plays host to gigs and 
other events throughout the summer. Situated around the former offices of the 
Amsterdam branch of Shell, the area is being regenerated as a grand cultural 
centre with a concert hall and two theatres. But for now, it's all about 
labyrinthine pathways, centuries-old trees, a bar, food stalls and a stage fit 
for both dreamy folk pop by Angus & Julia Stone and Destroyer's genre-shifting 
indie – plus a dancefloor in the evening sun!

Delicatessen Zeeburg

Situated in a mellow multicultural residential street in the east of 
Amsterdam, this subtle little room is full of surprises. In the daytime it's a 
store and art gallery, barely attempting to sell its wares, including 
seven-inch singles, clothing, books and local art. By night the shop transforms 
into a charming, intimate space (capacity for 40-70) for acoustic performance 
and experimentation, serving cheap veggie food and even cheaper beer; its cosy 
tables-and-chairs layout surrounded by ever-changing rounds of art. Admittedly 
it's not as rock'n'roll as its owner Bas Jacobs, a musician and writer who has 
been active in the Amsterdam indie scene for a decade longer than he'd care to 
advertise. But it boasts exclusive programming of eclectic local and touring 
acts such as psych-pop songwriterConnan Mockasin 
<http://www.myspace.com/connanmockasin> (who spent an evening painting T-shirts 
here) and theLevenshulme Bicycle Orchestr 
<http://www.levenshulmebicycleorchestra.com/>a.
