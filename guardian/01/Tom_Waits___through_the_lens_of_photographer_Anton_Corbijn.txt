Crows, wires, oil stains, cows, dead trees and a vulture – these are the kinds 
of things that could easily make it into a song byTom Waits 
<http://www.tomwaits.com/>. They are, too, some of the things he has 
photographed over the years – alongside the arcane instruments he uses to make 
his beautifully ramshackle music and the shadows his tall thin body throws on 
the ground.

The photographs, often accompanied by prose poetry, are included in a 
sumptuous book entitledWaits/Corbijn: '77-'11 
<http://www.waits-corbijn.com/en/the-book.html>, most of which is devoted to 
Anton Corbijn <http://www.corbijn.co.uk/>'s many portraits of Waits 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/tom-waits> over the past 35 years. Corbijn 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/13/anton-corbijn-inside-out-review>'s 
stylised photographs show Waits at work and play, growing steadily older. They 
are a testament to the merits of sustained collaboration between the 
photographer and his subject, but the most surprising portraits are the ones 
that catch Waits relaxed or off-guard, whether hunched over a typewriter or 
engrossed in a bound newspaper archive.

Waits's own photographs are more cryptic and more revealing – and exactly how 
you might imagine such images by him would be. They show an interior world of 
the imagination – dark stains on the ground that resemble the outlines of 
monsters – and his mischievous-to-the-point-of-being-surreal way of engaging 
with the world around him. One, A Collection of Wires, is just that, but also 
looks like someone has taken a line for a walk. A jack rabbit at night looks 
ethereal and ghostly, like a spirit painting.

There is an old-fashioned rigour to Waits's two photographs of musical 
instruments, and a real sense of wintery beauty in his landscapes entitled 
Fallen Trees. He definitely has a thing about stains. Alongside his scary 
sidewalk monsters, there is a photograph of a stain called Oil Can Harry who 
resembles a goblin. He "has been a constant companion since I was a boy". 
Elsewhere, a crushed tomato stain has been turned into a map of his influences, 
with seeds singled out and named with stickers – Nina Simone, Little Walter, 
WeeGee, Bukowski, Houdini, Sticks Mcgee. The title is Saved and "Named" Seeds 
(Heirloom Tomato).

This labelling recurs in Things I Found on the Ground, a photograph of various 
old and discarded items – bent spectacles, an ancient glove, screws, a spoon, 
hooks, coins, bottletops. This time, the labels relate to the locations where 
these everyday treasures were picked up. (For some reason, I am reminded of 
Waits's beautiful song,Soldier's Things 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNwC8ETa0pg>, another inventory of sadness – 
"bathing suits and bowling balls/ and clarinets and rings/ and all this radio 
really/ needs is a fuse …")

An aerial photograph of a mountainous landscape has been remapped in felt-tip 
by Waits to include regions such as the Underachiever Canyon, the High and 
Lonesome River and the EarWaxed Hills. A piece called Road Trip consists of 
four small photographs and a poem:

the road was like a question mark
I passed 3 steers in a pasture
sitting in a row
a Black cat came out of a ditch
and stood there in the rattlesnake grass
looking at me …

In the words and the photographs, we're back in Waitsland. It's a strangely 
familiar place – even without the music.
