Vera Zvonareva today blamed the organisers of the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> for ruining her chances of 
making her first grand slam final, but it was not the usual complaint about 
blistering heat.

The intense Melbourne heatwave has claimed several casualties in the past 
week, but the Russian said her hopes of reaching the women's final were 
affected by the decision to shut the centre court roof to keep the sun out.

"I think it was very difficult. I think the conditions were totally different 
from previous matches," Zvonareva said after her 6-3, 7-6 defeat to her fellow 
RussianDinara Safina <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dinara-safina>, who 
will now face Serena Williams in the final. "I think I'm a player who needs 
lots of time to get used to the conditions. I Â­really felt it was a little bit 
faster. I felt like, well, we were playing indoors, so it was different. I 
couldn't really find my rhythm."

The Russian baseliner said she had not had a chance to acclimatise to the new 
conditions. "I jumped on the Rod Laver [Court] for like 10 minutes. I got the 
chance 10 minutes today a little bit. Otherwise, no chance [to practise],"she 
said.

"I think I'm an all-surface, all-court player. I really can play anywhere 
[but] I'm a player who needs time to adjust to the new conditions.

"I would prefer to play a match or two ... I could never play my best tennis 
in the first match of the tournament. It's impossible, probably like lots of 
other players.

"So I felt like I was a little bit off the rhythm today and it was a little 
bit different for me. But, well, the same conditions for both of us. Well, 
that's it."
