Cosmopolitan magazine has increased its circulation to more than 400,000 to 
overtake rival Glamour after slashing its cover price to £1 and upping the 
number of copies it gives away to nearly 100,000.

The magazine, owned by Hearst <https://www.theguardian.com/media/hearst> UK, 
relaunched in October, cutting its price from £3.80. The drop helped the title 
increase the number of copies it sells in UK stores at full price from 76,000 
in the first six months of 2015 to more than 215,000 by December, according to 
the Audit Bureau of Circulation’s six monthly figures. Actively purchased 
copies at both full and reduced rates were up 45%.

Total circulation was up by 57%, also helped by a wider distribution strategy 
targeting gyms, shopping centres and other venues.

Hearst Magazines <https://www.theguardian.com/media/magazines> UK chief 
executive Anna Jones said: “We are delighted to see that the new marketing and 
distribution strategy for Cosmopolitan is working. Our innovative new route to 
market programmes, together with unmissable point of sale promotion through 
traditional retailers, has allowed us to get its brilliant content out to an 
even bigger audience.

“We’re also reaching 4.8 million unique users every month online, and through 
Snapchat Discover, which has carried Cosmopolitan content since September last 
year, we are able to reach more women than ever before.”

The rise takes the title past Condé Nast’s Glamour which has a total 
circulation of 347,000 and sells for £2. However, Glamour publishing director 
Jamie Jouning said the title retained its lead in terms of issues sold.

“Glamour is pleased to retain its position as the best-selling title in the 
market by 8%, despite being twice the price,” he said.

Both titles remain behind Stylist which is distributed free.
