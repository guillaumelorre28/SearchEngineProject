ADO said on Friday that it has told the 22 they will be held liable for any 
financial damages the club suffers as a result of the chants.

In an interview on Ajax’s website, Bazoer says he “doesn’t understand that 
there is still racism in stadiums in 2016” and says he is “disappointed that 
the chants and strange noises could continue throughout almost the entire 
match.”

The Dutch football association has also launched an investigation.
