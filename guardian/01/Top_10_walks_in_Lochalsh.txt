Eilean Donan castle (eileandonancastle.com <http://www.eileandonancastle.com/>
)is one of the Highlands', indeed Scotland's, most iconic landmarks – a 
picture-perfect stone fortress surrounded by water (and often thronging with 
visitors). This walk, to a much older fortification, takes you along the 
opposite side of Loch Duich with spectacular views over the water to Eilean 
Donan and the peaks of Five Sisters of Kintail. The route follows an undulating 
minor road along the lochside until this narrows to a small track and then a 
winding path which emerges through the woods to reach Dun Totaig. This bronze 
age broch (drystone tower) occupies a natural vantage point guarding the 
entrance to Loch Duich.

, Sandaig (or Camusfearna as Maxwell named it) still captures visitors' hearts 
today. An easy track leads down through the forest to emerge at the shoreline 
where a sandy arc looks out to the offshore islands. Sit quietly and you may 
well spot one of the otters that still frequent the area. The more energetic 
can pit their luck against the shoogly rope bridge that spans a small river 
running down from the waterfall behind the area where Maxwell's house once 
stood – an atmospheric memorial now marks this unspoilt and overgrown spot. 
This is a place to linger, soak up the views, wildlife and silence, and revel 
in the lack of mobile reception and other signs of modern day life. Afterwards 
have a celebratory dram at Maxwell's erstwhile local, the Glenelg Inn (
glenelg-inn.com <http://www.glenelg-inn.com/>).

Plockton is the perfect Highland village – a picturesque sheltered mooring 
complete with tidal island, palm trees, white-washed cottages, a couple of 
decent pubs and a smattering of arts and crafts shops. Lovely as it is, on a 
sunny summer's day Plockton can start to feel crowded and there's nothing like 
this hike to the summit of the crags which loom over the village to blow the 
cobwebs from your hair, taking in the view of the village and its stunning 
coastal setting. Although the walk involves a fair bit of ascent it is all on 
easy-to-follow tracks and minor roads; there is the option to extend it by 
starting from the village itself. A waterfront pint at the Plockton Inn (
plocktoninn.co.uk <http://plocktoninn.co.uk/>) while watching the yachties 
disembark is the perfect reward for the exertions of the climb.

There is something truly magical about emerging through a thicket of trees and 
gorse onto a hidden white sandy beach strewn with seaweed and rockpools. 
Examine the sand more closely and you'll find it is made up of tiny coral-like 
pieces, actually a dried, calcified seaweed known as maerl. This is a place for 
exploring the rocks and tiny coves where wading birds and any number of tiny 
sea creatures can be seen. Binoculars will help you pick out the seals on 
nearby rocks but if you fancy a closer look Calum's Seal Trips (
calums-sealtrips.com <http://www.calums-sealtrips.com/>, adults £10, children 
£6) run twice a day during the summer season and offer a money-back guarantee 
if there are no seals.

This part of the Highlands is crowded with Munros (peaks higher than 3,000 
feet), and at first glance Beinn Fhada (or Ben Attow to give its Anglicised 
name) may not seem the most exciting option. This is a mountain which reveals 
itself slowly, initially hiding its dramatic northern corries. The initial 
ascent is eased by following the route of an old deer stalkers' path built to 
aid access to the best hunting spots. This high level route provides a serious 
mountain climb for those with the necessary experience, equipment and 
navigation skills.

Distance 9¼ miles

This is one of Scotland's classic ridge walks, taking in three Munros and 
climbing a total of nearly 4,600 feet. The distance of 9¼ miles means little in 
such steep and unforgiving terrain – for those used to long mountain days this 
makes for a superb, long hill walk with unrivalled views in good weather 
conditions. It's a fantastic feeling to look back on the celebrated outline of 
the Fife Sisters with the knowledge that you have traversed the ridge. The 
Kintail Lodge Hotel (kintaillodgehotel.co.uk 
<http://www.kintaillodgehotel.co.uk/>) lies conveniently close to the end of 
the walk and provides well-deserved, hearty meals.

 At the height of the 19th-century Scottish herring boom, the waters of 
fjord-like Loch Hourn were heaving with boats bringing their catch ashore. This 
path was built to link the tiny fishing settlements along the edge of the loch 
and allow the precious cargo of "silver darlings" to be carried ashore. Now 
fallen into neglect, the well-constructed path can still be traced as it edges 
its way along the steep sides of the loch, crossing seemingly impassable rock 
faces with relative ease and an unforgettable prospect of the rough peaks of 
the Knoydart peninsula across the water. Revive yourself after this adventure 
with astrupag (Gaelic for cuppa) at Sheena's Tea Hut. Customers used to have to 
share their home baking with a friendly stag named Bin Laden, but like his 
namesake he has departed for pastures new.

Not one for the faint hearted, this Munro rises mercilessly from sea level to 
a height of 974m (3,196 ft). This direct route – a turf-clutching crawl at 
times – has ample rewards, as not only is the summit reached relatively 
quickly, but the great void all around makes for a fantastic viewpoint. The 
360-degree panorama takes in the remote and wild mountains of the Knoydart 
peninsula, Skye, and the peaks of Kintail to the north. Once safely back down 
at sea level, if time allows visit theCeilidh House and Heritage Centre 
<http://www.facebook.com/theceilidhhouse> which houses an interesting display 
on local history, boasts loos with possibly the best view in the Highlands and 
regularly hosts gigs and ceilidhs where visitors are most welcome.

Nothing can quite prepare you for the power of these immense and ancient 
structures. Built as huge fortified retreats during the iron age, enough 
remains of these high, double-walled tapering towers to allow your imagination 
to rebuild the ruined sections. Whole settlements, complete with livestock 
could have retreated to these brochs at times of Norse attacks from the sea. 
After exploring the brochs this walk wanders further up the glen, eventually 
reaching a more modest structure,Suardalan bothy 
<http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/19040>, now used as a walker's shelter and a 
welcome rest spot on open and exposed terrain.

Last time we did this route we had a close encounter with both an otter and a 
sea eagle. While we sat on the shore eating our lunch we watched the otter 
tucking into a butterfish with the same enthusiasm – and completely oblivious 
to our presence. The sea eagle didn't hang around for quite so long but the 
sheer bulk of this massive raptor showed why they are often dubbed "flying barn 
doors". This lovely coastal route also gives you an excuse to hop on the Skye 
ferry, which plies its way over the narrows to Kylerhea from the start of this 
walk. Now managed by enthusiastic locals, up to six cars can be squeezed onto 
theGlenachulish <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Glenachulish>, the only 
hand-operated turntable ferry in operation in the UK.
