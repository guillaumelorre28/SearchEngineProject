Rishi out, Scott in. Scott’s talking about Google 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> Assistant some more, and how it 
works with external partners.

“The Google Assistant will be Google’s next thriving, open ecosystem”, Scott 
says. Developers can build “actions on Google” (which seem like Skills on the 
Echo): either they’re direct actions, or conversations.
 ‘The Google Assistant will be Google’s next thriving, open ecosystem’ … Scott 
Huffman speaks about Google Assistant. Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/Reuters 
A direct action is simple enough: Google passes the request (“turn on the 
lights”, or “play Blue Suede Shoes”) on to the service, which does it. A 
conversation is more complex, and requires a back and forth. Scott’s example is 
Uber: “Book an Uber” needs a few questions to be asked before it can be carried 
out.

“The real beauty is how actions will scale”, says Scott, “letting partners 
reach people through the Google Assistant everywhere.”

More importantly, you don’t have to pre-install the actions. “Just ask Google 
for what you want, and it will find out how to do it”. That’s either going to 
be amazing, or a total nightmare, depending on how it’s handled. If you say 
“book a ride” and there’s an Uber and a Lyft action, what does it do? Who 
knows. (Google knows)

Rishi continues. Fourth area: home control. If you have a smart home (you 
probably do not have a smart home) you can control it with your voice. Not only 
Google’s sibling company Nest, but also a few other companies, like Philips.

But the definition of “smart home” has grown: you can also use Google 
Assistant to control your Chromecast. Apparently it can “completely change how 
you watch television”. I doubt that, but OK. You can control YouTube, but 
“soon” you’ll be able to control Netflix, and you can ask the Google Home to 
show your pics inGoogle <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> Photos 
on your Chromecast.

This is one of the few areas we’ve seen today where Apple is beating Google: 
all this TV stuff is fairly baked in to the Apple TV, and that device launched 
with support for much more than just voice control of YouTube.

It’s also interesting how much Google is blurring the boundaries between the 
devices. Google Home’s features are the Chromecast’s are Chromecast Audio are 
Google Photos: Rishi isn’t distinguishing.

Current count of distinguishing features: seven.


Google Home can do smart multi-room audio, which the Echo can’t do, and it can 
do smart multi-room listening, which the Echo can do.

Current count of distinguishing features: eight.

But, oh no! Turns out you can change your default music service (my bad 
<https://twitter.com/jasonwhat/status/783354602099970048>), so back down to a 
final score of seven.

That’s it. Amazon’s got a fight on its hands – but only in the US. The device 
is launching for $129 there, but nowhere else. In retail stores November 4, and 
it comes in seven colours.

And finally, Google Home. It’s a little cylinder that brings Google 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> Assistant into your home. It 
has speakers that lets you play music, and has a lot of mics that offer “best 
in class voice recognition”. It’s … look, it’s the Amazon Echo.
 Home … Google’s answer to the Amazon Echo. Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/Reuters
That’s good! The Amazon Echo is a great product. But it’s weird hearing Google 
entering a category currently defined by one product, without really talking 
about how their offering is different.

Mario hands over to Rishi Chandra, who’s shows off pre-recorded demos. It can 
play music (in this case, YouTube music), and you can control that with your 
voice. It also does other streaming options, like Spotify and Google Play 
Music. Yes, Google has two streaming music options. No, I don’t really know why 
either. You also can listen to podcasts, or cast audio to the Assistant.

Current count of distinguishing features against the Echo: two. You can change 
your default music service, and you can ask it very vague questions, like “play 
that Shakira song from Zootopia”.
 Adele … singer of Hello. Or should that be, Allo? Photograph: George 
Pimentel/Getty Images for BT PR 
On to “getting answers from Google”. He’s doxing Adele onstage (“what is 
Adele’s real name”), and asking how many Grammys she has. This is one of those 
tricky areas for comparison: the Echo can do the same thing, but it looks 
likely that the Google Assistant will be better. At least until Amazon improves 
Alexa. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Google is much better when it comes to searching for the physical world, 
though: “what are some nearby camping stores” gets a solid answer with your 
physical location taken into account, and you can ask it how long it will take 
to cycle to your favourite one.

Oh, and “How do I say ‘I would like a beer please’ in Spanish?” gets an 
answer, in Spanish.

Current count of distinguishing features: let’s say 4.5

Next up: organisation. If you want, Assistant will read your emails and 
calendar, and offer you a personalised precis of your day. This is the sort of 
thing which is either incredibly cool, or incredibly creepy, and will probably 
move from the latter to the former as we all get jaded and ignore privacy 
concerns. Cool!

You can also build a shopping list, but come on, Amazon wins on shopping.

You can ask it to flip a coin. I don’t know if the Echo can do that. I’m 
sorry. I’m a fraud.

Current count of distinguishing features: let’s say six.

Entertainment next: Remember Chromecast, the company’s dongle for letting you 
watch stuff on your TV. There’s a new one!Chromecast Ultra.
 Mario Queiroz introduces the Google Chromecast Ultra. Photograph: Beck 
Diefenbach/Reuters 
It has 4K ultra-HD, HDR, and Dolby Vision support. If you have a 
super-expensive TV, you likely know whether you have those things. If you 
aren’t sure, you probably don’t. It comes with an ethernet port, because lets 
be honest, your Wi-Fi can’t really handle 4K streaming; it’s 1.8x faster for 
actually navigating menus etc.

It’ll cost $69. No information on international launches, but our own Samuel 
Gibbs tells me it’ll launch in the UK for £69. (Thank you, Brexit)

“Connectivity, entertainment, and Google Assistant” are the three areas we’re 
going to hear about.

Connectivity first: Last year, Google launched fancy new OnHub routers, which 
you can’t really get outside the US. Apparently they’re good, US-based people 
tell me. Anyway, now we getGoogle Wi-Fi, a Google-developed Wi-Fi access point.

It’s basically Google’s Airport Extreme: It can do mesh networking to extend 
your Wifi, and it can help you get online. There’s also an app, which you can 
use to be an evil dad and kick your kids off the wifi when it’s time to eat 
dinner.

It’ll cost $129, or $299 for three. But it looks US only.

Clay out, Adrienne in. She leads VR partnerships, and will be showing some 
Daydream ‘experiences’.

There’s a Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them experience, which is going 
to sell a few thousand Daydream headsets on its own. If you’re over 30 that’s 
the Harry Potter prequel.

There’s a new game by Eve Online creators CCP, Gunjack 2. That’s a fairly good 
way of positioning Daydream: Real VR devices, likeOculus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/28/vr-isnt-a-thing-you-do-its-a-place-you-visit-readers-review-oculus-rift>
 andVive

run Eve: Valkyrie, a full dogfighting sim, while more stripped-down devices get 
Gunjack.

There’s Hulu, if you fancy watching TV on a phone less than an inch from your 
face, and the New York Times app, because other newspapers exist. And there’s 
Google, of course: Movies, Photos, Street View, and YouTube. YouTube itself has 
a heck of a lot of 360˚ Video, which some people love and some people hate, 
althoughGoogle <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> seems to be 
calling it “VR content” these days.

It’s pretty simple: “You just want to pop your phone in and get into VR”. The 
headset and phone speak wirelessly, and the headset has an auto-calibration 
feature.

There’s a controller too. A clickable touchpad at the top, two buttons in the 
middle, and a bunch of motion-sensitive sensors inside. But: “what do you do 
with a controller after you use it? You lose it. So the controller has a home 
inside the headset.”
 ‘It’s the little things that make the experience’ … Clay Bavor introduces the

Then he drops the controller, literally mid-way through saying “it’s the 
little things that make the experience”. Poor Clay.

The headset will work with every Daydream-ready phone. Pixel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pixel> is the first, but there’ll be 
more. Oh, and it’s coming in three colours.

Sabrina out. Clay in! He runs VR. “We love VR,” he says, “because unlike 
anything else we’ve seen, it can put you someplace else”. GivenGoogle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> literally makes a car, I think 
he might have picked the wrong metaphor there.

Clay Bavor is talking Daydream, Google’s new VR platform. “Let’s start with 
phones: we’ve made the Pixels great for VR. They’re the first that are 
‘Daydream ready’”.
 Google’s Daydream viewer. Photograph: Google 
“Let’s talk about the headset. We have a bit of a different take.” He brings 
out Daydream View, the company’s first VR headset. It doesn’t look like that 
much of a different take, tbh: you still put your phone in there, strap it to 
your face, and hope that you don’t throw up.

Still, “we looked to fabrics, not gadgets, for inspiration”, he says. “In 
fact, we worked with clothing designers to get the fabrics just right”. It 
weighs 30% less than “comparable devices”, and fits over glasses. That’s cool 
if you wear glasses.

Brian, out. Sabrina Ellis in!

Sabrina’s here to talk about a lot of stuff. 

Communications: Google Duo is the company’s video calling app 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/16/duo-video-calling-app-google-android>
 (we already knew that), and comes pre-installed (we didn’t know that).
 Sabrina Ellis talks about the ‘quick charging’ Pixel at Google’s launch. 
Photograph: Google 
Battery life: “We spent a lot of time optimising Pixel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pixel> to be smart about battery life,” 
she says, “and it can get seven hours of charge in fifteen minutes.”

Automatic updates: it has them.

24/7 customer support, with a screen share option: it has that too.

Switching support: it has that as well. “We built a tool to quickly let you 
transfer contacts, photos, videos, music, texts and even you iMessages.” You 
physically plug it in to your old iPhone. There’s going to be some cool hacky 
stuff to get that working, I think, and it will be interesting to see how Apple 
responds.

Sizes: 5” and 5.5”

Colours: Quite Black, Very Silver, and Really Blue (they aren’t lying about 
that last one, and I can’t decide if I love or hate it)

Specs: I just took a screenshot of that, here you go:
 The specs. Photograph: Google 
Carriers: Verizon exclusive in the US, EE exclusive in the UK, but also 
avialable unlocked from theGoogle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> store.

Price: $649 and up, £599 and up. Available for pre order today in the US, UK, 
Canada, Germany, and Australia, and India shortly.

Brian Rakowski from Google <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> 
steps in to talk us through the Pixel. Hi Brian!


First up, Assistant: “You can just say the hot-word, or press and hold the 
home button, to bring it up.” He asks it to show his photos from last October, 
and sees a picture of a show he went to last year. That prompts him to ask 
what’s happening at that venue now, and he sees the band The Lumineers. So he 
asks it to play a song from them too, and a YouTube video pops up.

Diefenbach/Reuters 
He likes the song, so he texts his wife to ask if she wants to see them. She 
does! Brian’s got a date. But his wife suggests a meal at a restaurant he 
doesn’t know about, Marzano. Conveniently, this allows Ryan to demonstrate 
another Assistant feature – it’s almost like this is all rehearsed – where he 
can tap on the screen and bring up more information about anything mentioned 
there.

Google Assistant can do more, though: he asks it to make a reservation at 
Marzano, and it does. A full OpenTable reservation, placed and confirmed, all 
through a voice communication with the service.

It’s pretty cool. Hopefully Brian’s perfectly planned life represents yours, 
because if it does, this service will change your world.

Pixel phone by Google

 * Attempt #3 at Google selling its own phones, after Nexus and Motorola, the 
Pixel is a high-end competitor to flagship devices like the iPhone and Galaxy 
S-series.

ready’.

Daydream VR headset

 * Fabric-encrusted VR peripheral for the Pixel (and other phones in the 
future). 
 * Slot your phone in, use the new controller, and get your VR on. 
 * $79, three colours. 
Google Home

 * Google’s Amazon Echo competitor. 
 * It’s Google’s Amazon Echo competitor. 
 * $129, US only. 
Chromecast Ultra

 * 4K Chromecast. 
 * If you don’t know what that means, you don’t need it. 
Google Wi-Fi

 *  Small round Wi-Fi access point 
 * US-only. $129.  
Scott out, Rick back in. “We’re committed to building hardware, and this is 
only the beginning.”

And with that, the livestream and liveblog are over.

Alex out.
 
Rishi out, Scott in. Scott’s talking about Google 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> Assistant some more, and how it 
works with external partners.

“The Google Assistant will be Google’s next thriving, open ecosystem”, Scott 
says. Developers can build “actions on Google” (which seem like Skills on the 
Echo): either they’re direct actions, or conversations.
 ‘The Google Assistant will be Google’s next thriving, open ecosystem’ … Scott 
Huffman speaks about Google Assistant. Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/Reuters 
A direct action is simple enough: Google passes the request (“turn on the 
lights”, or “play Blue Suede Shoes”) on to the service, which does it. A 
conversation is more complex, and requires a back and forth. Scott’s example is 
Uber: “Book an Uber” needs a few questions to be asked before it can be carried 
out.

“The real beauty is how actions will scale”, says Scott, “letting partners 
reach people through the Google Assistant everywhere.”

More importantly, you don’t have to pre-install the actions. “Just ask Google 
for what you want, and it will find out how to do it”. That’s either going to 
be amazing, or a total nightmare, depending on how it’s handled. If you say 
“book a ride” and there’s an Uber and a Lyft action, what does it do? Who 
knows. (Google knows)
 
Rishi continues. Fourth area: home control. If you have a smart home (you 
probably do not have a smart home) you can control it with your voice. Not only 
Google’s sibling company Nest, but also a few other companies, like Philips.

But the definition of “smart home” has grown: you can also use Google 
Assistant to control your Chromecast. Apparently it can “completely change how 
you watch television”. I doubt that, but OK. You can control YouTube, but 
“soon” you’ll be able to control Netflix, and you can ask the Google Home to 
show your pics inGoogle <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> Photos 
on your Chromecast.

This is one of the few areas we’ve seen today where Apple is beating Google: 
all this TV stuff is fairly baked in to the Apple TV, and that device launched 
with support for much more than just voice control of YouTube.
 Rishi Chandra discusses the Google Home device in San Francisco. Photograph: 
Beck Diefenbach/Reuters 
It’s also interesting how much Google is blurring the boundaries between the 
devices. Google Home’s features are the Chromecast’s are Chromecast Audio are 
Google Photos: Rishi isn’t distinguishing.

Current count of distinguishing features: seven.


Google Home can do smart multi-room audio, which the Echo can’t do, and it can 
do smart multi-room listening, which the Echo can do.

Current count of distinguishing features: eight.

But, oh no! Turns out you can change your default music service (my bad 
<https://twitter.com/jasonwhat/status/783354602099970048>), so back down to a 
final score of seven.

That’s it. Amazon’s got a fight on its hands – but only in the US. The device 
is launching for $129 there, but nowhere else. In retail stores November 4, and 
it comes in seven colours.
 
And finally, Google Home. It’s a little cylinder that brings Google 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> Assistant into your home. It 
has speakers that lets you play music, and has a lot of mics that offer “best 
in class voice recognition”. It’s … look, it’s the Amazon Echo.
 Home … Google’s answer to the Amazon Echo. Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/Reuters
That’s good! The Amazon Echo is a great product. But it’s weird hearing Google 
entering a category currently defined by one product, without really talking 
about how their offering is different.

Mario hands over to Rishi Chandra, who’s shows off pre-recorded demos. It can 
play music (in this case, YouTube music), and you can control that with your 
voice. It also does other streaming options, like Spotify and Google Play 
Music. Yes, Google has two streaming music options. No, I don’t really know why 
either. You also can listen to podcasts, or cast audio to the Assistant.

Current count of distinguishing features against the Echo: two. You can change 
your default music service, and you can ask it very vague questions, like “play 
that Shakira song from Zootopia”.
 Adele … singer of Hello. Or should that be, Allo? Photograph: George 
Pimentel/Getty Images for BT PR 
On to “getting answers from Google”. He’s doxing Adele onstage (“what is 
Adele’s real name”), and asking how many Grammys she has. This is one of those 
tricky areas for comparison: the Echo can do the same thing, but it looks 
likely that the Google Assistant will be better. At least until Amazon improves 
Alexa. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Google is much better when it comes to searching for the physical world, 
though: “what are some nearby camping stores” gets a solid answer with your 
physical location taken into account, and you can ask it how long it will take 
to cycle to your favourite one.

Oh, and “How do I say ‘I would like a beer please’ in Spanish?” gets an 
answer, in Spanish.

Current count of distinguishing features: let’s say 4.5

Next up: organisation. If you want, Assistant will read your emails and 
calendar, and offer you a personalised precis of your day. This is the sort of 
thing which is either incredibly cool, or incredibly creepy, and will probably 
move from the latter to the former as we all get jaded and ignore privacy 
concerns. Cool!

You can also build a shopping list, but come on, Amazon wins on shopping.

You can ask it to flip a coin. I don’t know if the Echo can do that. I’m 
sorry. I’m a fraud.

Current count of distinguishing features: let’s say six.

 * Google launches new Assistant and puts it at heart of Home 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/04/google-launch-new-assistant-home>
 
Entertainment next: Remember Chromecast, the company’s dongle for letting you 
watch stuff on your TV. There’s a new one!Chromecast Ultra.
 Mario Queiroz introduces the Google Chromecast Ultra. Photograph: Beck 
Diefenbach/Reuters 
It has 4K ultra-HD, HDR, and Dolby Vision support. If you have a 
super-expensive TV, you likely know whether you have those things. If you 
aren’t sure, you probably don’t. It comes with an ethernet port, because lets 
be honest, your Wi-Fi can’t really handle 4K streaming; it’s 1.8x faster for 
actually navigating menus etc.

It’ll cost $69. No information on international launches, but our own Samuel 
Gibbs tells me it’ll launch in the UK for £69. (Thank you, Brexit)
 
Clay out, Mario in. We’re going to hear about Google 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> Home.
 Google’s vice president of product management Mario Queiroz introduces the 
Google Home device. Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/Reuters 
“Connectivity, entertainment, and Google Assistant” are the three areas we’re 
going to hear about.

Connectivity first: Last year, Google launched fancy new OnHub routers, which 
you can’t really get outside the US. Apparently they’re good, US-based people 
tell me. Anyway, now we getGoogle Wi-Fi, a Google-developed Wi-Fi access point.

It’s basically Google’s Airport Extreme: It can do mesh networking to extend 
your Wifi, and it can help you get online. There’s also an app, which you can 
use to be an evil dad and kick your kids off the wifi when it’s time to eat 
dinner.

It’ll cost $129, or $299 for three. But it looks US only.
 
Adrienne out, Clay in. It costs $79. Thanks Clay.
 
Clay out, Adrienne in. She leads VR partnerships, and will be showing some 
Daydream ‘experiences’.

There’s a Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them experience, which is going 
to sell a few thousand Daydream headsets on its own. If you’re over 30 that’s 
the Harry Potter prequel.

There’s a new game by Eve Online creators CCP, Gunjack 2. That’s a fairly good 
way of positioning Daydream: Real VR devices, likeOculus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/28/vr-isnt-a-thing-you-do-its-a-place-you-visit-readers-review-oculus-rift>

Gunjack.
 Hulu! If you fancy watching TV on a phone less than an inch from your face

There’s Hulu, if you fancy watching TV on a phone less than an inch from your 
face, and the New York Times app, because other newspapers exist. And there’s 
Google, of course: Movies, Photos, Street View, and YouTube. YouTube itself has 
a heck of a lot of 360˚ Video, which some people love and some people hate, 
althoughGoogle <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> seems to be 
calling it “VR content” these days.
 
It’s pretty simple: “You just want to pop your phone in and get into VR”. The 
headset and phone speak wirelessly, and the headset has an auto-calibration 
feature.

There’s a controller too. A clickable touchpad at the top, two buttons in the 
middle, and a bunch of motion-sensitive sensors inside. But: “what do you do 
with a controller after you use it? You lose it. So the controller has a home 
inside the headset.”
 ‘It’s the little things that make the experience’ … Clay Bavor introduces the 
Daydream View VR headset. Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/Reuters 
Then he drops the controller, literally mid-way through saying “it’s the 
little things that make the experience”. Poor Clay.

The headset will work with every Daydream-ready phone. Pixel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pixel> is the first, but there’ll be 
more. Oh, and it’s coming in three colours.
 
Sabrina out. Clay in! He runs VR. “We love VR,” he says, “because unlike 
anything else we’ve seen, it can put you someplace else”. GivenGoogle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> literally makes a car, I think 
he might have picked the wrong metaphor there.

Clay Bavor is talking Daydream, Google’s new VR platform. “Let’s start with 
phones: we’ve made the Pixels great for VR. They’re the first that are 
‘Daydream ready’”.
 Google’s Daydream viewer. Photograph: Google 
“Let’s talk about the headset. We have a bit of a different take.” He brings 
out Daydream View, the company’s first VR headset. It doesn’t look like that 
much of a different take, tbh: you still put your phone in there, strap it to 
your face, and hope that you don’t throw up.

Still, “we looked to fabrics, not gadgets, for inspiration”, he says. “In 
fact, we worked with clothing designers to get the fabrics just right”. It 
weighs 30% less than “comparable devices”, and fits over glasses. That’s cool 
if you wear glasses.
 
Brian, out. Sabrina Ellis in!

Sabrina’s here to talk about a lot of stuff. 

Communications: Google Duo is the company’s video calling app 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/16/duo-video-calling-app-google-android>
 (we already knew that), and comes pre-installed (we didn’t know that).
 Sabrina Ellis talks about the ‘quick charging’ Pixel at Google’s launch. 
Photograph: Google 
Battery life: “We spent a lot of time optimising Pixel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pixel> to be smart about battery life,” 
she says, “and it can get seven hours of charge in fifteen minutes.”

Automatic updates: it has them.

24/7 customer support, with a screen share option: it has that too.

Switching support: it has that as well. “We built a tool to quickly let you 
transfer contacts, photos, videos, music, texts and even you iMessages.” You 
physically plug it in to your old iPhone. There’s going to be some cool hacky 
stuff to get that working, I think, and it will be interesting to see how Apple 
responds.

Sizes: 5” and 5.5”

Colours: Quite Black, Very Silver, and Really Blue (they aren’t lying about 
that last one, and I can’t decide if I love or hate it)

Specs: I just took a screenshot of that, here you go:
 The specs. Photograph: Google 
Carriers: Verizon exclusive in the US, EE exclusive in the UK, but also

Canada, Germany, and Australia, and India shortly.
