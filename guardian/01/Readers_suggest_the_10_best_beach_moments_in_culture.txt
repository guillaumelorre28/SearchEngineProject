“No mention of Baywatch?” scoffed hoppo, who may or may not have spilt hot 
coffee all over their “I Heart Hasselhoff” T-shirt before leaving a nonplussed 
message in the comments section. Indeed, who could forget the silly, sunkissed 
vision of the Los Angeles County lifeguards, who were world-beaters when it 
came to retina-burning grins and slo-mo shoreline runs (and creating body-image 
issues for a generation of viewers). Over 11 seasons, one never tired of that 
rip-roaring theme tune – let’s hope they keep it for the Dwayne 
Johnson-starring film adaptation that’s currently in production.

The beach is the perfect setting for the songs of 1960s girl group the 
Shangri-Las and their brand of diaphanous melancholy. Cascading waves and the 
twitter of seagulls complement the finger-clicking chorus to their 1965 debut 
single, as the then 17-year-old singer Mary Weiss warbles: “Walking in the 
sand/ Walking hand in hand/ The night was so exciting/ Smile was so inviting.” 
It reached the top five in the Billboard charts, and was covered by Aerosmith 
in 1980.

Following Derek Jarman’s HIV-positive diagnosis on 22 December 1986, the 
pioneering gay director moved into a black fisherman’s cottage in Dungeness, 
Kent. “I’m sure there is footage of him and Tilda Swinton and others cavorting 
on Dungeness beach in some experimental films,” said Yosserian, correctly 
referencing Jarman’s 1990 filmThe Garden, in which a homosexual couple are 
arrested, tortured and killed, before noting that “Dungeness is the UK’s only 
designated desert”. It is a bleak and barren environment situated beside a 
nuclear power station, and while the house is closed to the public, visitors 
still go to pay homage from a distance.

It is difficult to imagine that Spielberg’s shark-infested blockbuster has 
improved anyone’s experience of the seaside – though the fearful frisson that 
comes with swimming through a dark patch of ocean is a silver lining. 
Cinephiles have no such practical problems, with NeitherYankNorBrit 
recommending: “Any of the scenes in Jaws, although the opening scene is my 
favourite.” Yosserian concurs, but prefers “[Michael] Caine’s character fight” 
towards the end, when his character flees from Jaws into a seaplane, loudly 
proclaiming: “Oh shit!” Observer film critic Mark Kermode basked in the 1975 
summer classic’s legacy for a storyearlier this year

Graham Greene’s seventh novel is not your conventional, breezy holiday read, 
even if it is set along the Sussex coast. “People don’t change. It’s like those 
sticks of rock: bite it all the way down, you’ll still read Brighton,” are the 
most famous words of the 1938 thriller, which meditates on the nature of sin 
via the murderous confrontations of 17-year-old gangster Pinkie Brown. 
RabBurnout gave his approval, while also acknowledging “the original [1947] 
film starring Richard Attenborough”. An arcane web of duplicity, it may be 
slight on plot, but its characters are brilliantly sketched.

 Opening sequence. 
During the opening credits of this cult 1970s TV series, 46-year-old sales 
executive Reginald Iolanthe Perrin (Leonard Rossiter) decides to end his 
miserable existence – stripping naked and swimming out to sea in Dorset, before 
awkwardly losing his nerve. Adapted from David Nobbs’s book trilogy, it follows 
Perrin’s disenchantment with dull suburban life and a career at Sunshine 
Desserts that is completely bereft of job satisfaction. Grim it may first 
appear, but through the prism of pitch-black humour, it becomes a very British 
way of beachgoing (and life).

 Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. 
A product of the surreal chemistry between director Michel Gondry and Charlie 
Kaufman, who co-wrote the script, the beach becomes a peculiar hinterland, 
shorn of its usual hedonistic connotations. We see former lovers Joel (Jim 
Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), for example, play around on a 
snow-covered shore after hiring a futuristic hi-tech firm called Lacuna to 
remove memories of each other – another time, jarringly, they are there in a 
bed. “Sand is overrated,” mumbles Joel at one point, in the winner of 2005’s 
Best Original Screenplay Oscar. “It’s just ... tiny little rocks.”

The stifling heat and the oppressive glare of the sun experienced by The 
Outsider’s troubled existentialist figure Meursault reflect on a warped 
impression of the world – a postcolonial dystopia. While on a visit to a 
friend’s beach house, he ends up murdering an Arab on the beach at Algiers 
merely because the sun gets in his eyes. “I knew that I had shattered the 
harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I’d been happy,” 
he chillingly recounts in the climatic scene. “Then I fired four more times at 
the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it 
was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.”


The 400 Blows (François Truffaut, 1959)

The adventures of Antoine Doinel, François Truffaut’s charming on-screen 
mouthpiece, began in glorious fashion with this autobiographical gem of the 
French new wave – later to be joined by Stolen Kisses (1968), Bed and Board 
(1970) and Love On The Run (1979). It centres around the 14-year-old Doinel, 
portrayed by Jean-Pierre Léaud, who cheekily swindles his way through life by 
hook or by crook. Yosserian hails the film’s poignant final scene, in which 
Doinel arrives at the beach after running from the police: “Brilliant 
existential moment, running to the sea, and then turning away from it, looking 
into camera, and freezing.”
