 (3 December) that a number of English universities have lowered their proposed 
fees for 2012. The regulator,Offa <http://www.offa.org.uk/>, says it will now 
have to contact all students who have already applied to them to inform them of 
the changes. But surely the universities should be contacting prospective 
students who havenot applied to them. Indeed, surely Ucas <http://www.ucas.com/>
 now needs to invite every candidate for 2012 to reconsider their five choices. 
After all, in a market, price changes may affect the choices that students will 
make. It is only "fair" to let everyone rethink their applications – including, 
especially, those who have already placed applications through Ucas.

A year ago we were told that the fees bill had to be rushed through 
parliament, with only five hours of debate, because universities and their 
vice-chancellor leaders had to know, with absolute certainty, what they would 
charge so that they could plan for 2012. It seems now that that was misleading. 
The only honourable – if not yet fair – route left is to delay the entire plan, 
at least until it has been properly debated and thought through. The future of 
our universities and of our next generation of students is too important to 
treat in such an ad hoc fashion. Perhaps Offa can be invited to explain how its 
action on this is fair; perhaps Ucas can explain whether it has been consulted; 
perhaps Universities UK can rouse itself to come up with a properly planned 
future for our universities.

• You suggest that Aston University has cut tuition fees below £7,500 for 
undergraduate entry in 2012. Well – we have not, and we don't intend to. Our 
tuition fees are set at £9,000. This reflects the fact that an Aston University 
degree is a prestigious degree with students and with employers alike. 
According to the Sunday Times 2012 University Guide, "not even Oxbridge can 
boast a higher proportion of students gaining graduate level jobs than Aston".

We have, however, altered our access agreement with Offa, so we can offer new 
£4,000Aston excellence scholarships 
<http://www1.aston.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/student-finance/scholarships-grants-loans/scholarships/?tab=2&uniqueid=tabs_esctl_3710240_CurrentTab>
 to applicants with AAB at A-level or equivalent, while also improving our 
scholarships to applicants who have a family income of less than £42,000. If 
these arrangements were in place now, almost a quarter of Aston students would 
be getting both an excellence scholarship for academic achievement and be 
supported by a family income-based scholarship. We have been able to do this 
not because we have cut fees. It is because most Aston students take a 
four-year course with an integrated work-based placement year in business or 
the professions. The placement year is available to all for a nominal fee of 
£1,000. So – no cuts, just a real investment in academic achievement and in the 
employability prospects of our students.

• The letter above from Professor Thomas Docherty was amended on 6 December. 
An editing error led to the phrase "not misleading" appearing in a sentence, 
where "misleading" was meant. This has been corrected.
