A group of white police officers is campaigning to have the National Black 
Police Association disbanded following last week's jailing of Met commanderAli 
Dizaei <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ali-dizaei>, a former president of the 
association, who was sentenced to four years for corruption.

Keith Jarrett, another former president, said: "A number of colleagues have 
called for the NBPA and the BPA [BlackPolice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> Association] to be wound up. I don't 
mean black colleagues; I mean white colleagues.

"Those police calling for the BPA to be scrapped … show an ignorance of race 
relations in the UK."

It has also emerged that members of the Metropolitan Police Authority met in 
secret last Wednesday and agreed to denote Dizaei as a "special case", a 
decision that means they can fast-track disciplinary action against the senior 
officer and could see him dismissed from the force next month.

It is the first time the MPA has decided that action against an individual 
police officer is so urgent that it is designated a "special case".

The Independent Police Complaints Commission and Dizaei himself were formally 
notified last Thursday that he will be subject to the MPA's most extreme 
disciplinary measures.

A hearing will take place next month to determine the fate of the 47-year-old 
Iranian-born officer. Options include dismissing him from the Met, while the 
MPA can also strip him of his reported £1m pension pot.

Jarrett also revealed that the NBPA had moved to disown Dizaei. Officers 
believed that his behaviour has undermined the efforts of black and Asian 
officers to improve race relations, particularly within Scotland Yard.
