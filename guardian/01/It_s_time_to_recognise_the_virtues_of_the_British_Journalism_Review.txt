Too few journalists, and too few journalist educators and their students, take 
an interest in the British Journalism Review (BJR).

So this, from a BJR board member of long-standing, is a plea to everyone to 
start subscribing to a quarterly magazine that merits a wide readership among 
newspaper, broadcasting and online journalists plus journalism academics.

It is the one place where journalists and academics can come together to 
assess the editorial output and methodology - the events, the ethics, the 
problems, the personalities - in a readable format.

The BJR was conceived from its first issue in autumn 1989, as its website 
states <http://bjr.org.uk/>, as “a forum of analysis and debate, to monitor the 
media, submit the best as well as the worst to scrutiny, and to raise the level 
of the dialogue”.

The contents of the latest issue <http://bjr.org.uk/current> are a first-class 
example of that mission, with six writers in four articles dissecting the 2015 
general election coverage; a profile of the Guardian’s outgoing editor, Alan 
Rusbridger; a timely piece on the impact of the Data Protection Act; and a 
nostalgic look at the days of hot metal.

In addition there are critical articles on Operation Elveden, post-Leveson 
press regulation and entrepreneurial journalism plus book reviews. It’s a 
compelling package and should be essential reading for all journalists.

But the BJR’s valuable contribution to our trade is more than the magazine 
itself, as Thursday evening proved. The board hosted the Charles Wheeler award 
for outstanding contribution to broadcast journalism, which was followed by 
lecture also given in Wheeler’s memory.

The newly-restored cinema at Westminster university 
<http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/facilities-and-services/regent-street-cinema>
 was packed to see Sky News’s special correspondent, Alex Crawford, receive the 
award and speak light-heartedly about the dangerous work she has done in 
conflict arenas around the world (see also Robin Lustig’s remarks on Crawford 
<http://lustigletter.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/in-praise-of-journalists.html>).

Then we were treated to a riveting lecture by the BBC’s creative director, 
Alan Yentob, in which he mounted a trenchant and heartfelt defence of the 
licence fee (see Guardian report here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/05/bbc-alan-yentob-licence-fee-john-whittingdale>
) among other things (such as a bit of raillery with Boris Johnson, in which he 
suggested the Tory MP and London mayor might like to present Top Gear).

Sure, I’m parti pris. And, yes, I am worried about the BJR’s funding problems. 
But I sincerely believe the virtues of the magazine have been, and are being, 
overlooked. It is high time that journalists took a new look, or a first look, 
at the BJR.
