For all those who consider that James Cameron's blue avatars will be the stars 
of this year's ceremony, more style-savvy observers say the film industry's big 
night will have only one fairytale princess: Britain's great hope for a best 
actress Oscar,Carey Mulligan <https://www.theguardian.com/film/carey-mulligan>. 
The 24-year-old, nominated for her breakthrough role in An Education, has 
already won a fistful of awards, including a Bafta, for her performances, and 
gained a nickname, Dame Carey, thanks to a manner and tone of voice reminiscent 
of a young Judi Dench.

But the actor has also turned heads on the red carpets with her chic pixie cut 
and quirky fashion choices. From a ruched red strapless Lanvin at the Screen 
Actors Guild awards, to inky blue Nina Ricci with a rhinestone headband at the 
Golden Globes, to the highly patterened Vionnet gown at last week's Baftas, she 
fits in a tradition of understated high style that started with Audrey Hepburn 
and Grace Kelly, continued with Kate Winslet's smoking hot Ben De Lisi dress in 
2002 and, last year, was exemplified by the glittering former winner Marion 
Cotillard and her sweeping Gaultier gown.

"Carey is the new darling of Hollywood," says Melanie Bromley, Us Weekly's 
West Coast bureau chief. "Every designer loves her. She is the girl they all 
want to dress because she's not afraid to take a risk."

She also knows her own mind. Advised by US Vogue editor Anna Wintour to wear a 
short gown to tomorrow's ceremony, Mulligan replied: "I was like, 'No, that is 
so not what I had in my head when I was six years old!'"
