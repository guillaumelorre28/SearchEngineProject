A Guide to Recognising Your Saints 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/guide-to-recognising-your-saints> is another 
jagged look at growing up in a tough, multi-ethnic, big-city environment, in 
this case the Astoria district of Queens, the densely populated, largely 
residential borough of New York City. The film is based on a somewhat 
fictionalised memoir by the picture's writer-director Dito Montiel, who's 
played by Robert Downey Jr.

Now an established writer in California, Dito makes a sentimental journey 
home, his first visit in 15 years, to see his ailing epileptic father (Chazz 
Palminteri), his long-suffering mother (Dianne Wiest), and such old friends as 
haven't perished on the mean streets. Shia LaBeouf plays the 15-year-old Dito 
and his story is told in a harsh, semi-documentary manner with no expletives 
deleted (Dito's former girlfriend, played by the lovely Rosario Dawson, says 
'fuck' more than 30 times in one single outburst).

This naturalistic Cassavetes-Scorsese style is broken up with disconnected 
dialogue, sudden silences and chunks of the script replacing images. These 
alienation effects I found more irritating than revealing, but a number of 
people have been greatly impressed by this film.
