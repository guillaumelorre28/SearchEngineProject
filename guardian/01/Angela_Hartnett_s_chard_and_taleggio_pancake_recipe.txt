This takes some work – the batter is soft and can be difficult to handle – but 
it is so worth the effort for a cracking supper. It is a great dish for 
vegetarians, and equally wonderful with smoked salmon.

(Serves 2-4)
200g swiss chard, stalks removed
400g agria potatoes, scrubbed, skin on
3 tbsp milk
90ml double cream
3 eggs, yolks separated and whites whisked until firm
3 tbsp flour
180ml creme fraiche
Handful chives, chopped
Vegetable oil, for cooking
200g taleggio cheese, grated

Steam the chard for two minutes and set aside.

Boil the potatoes in salted water until soft, drain, scoop out the centres and 
pass through a potato ricer into a bowl.

Mix in the milk and double cream, then the egg yolks, then the whites.

Fold in the flour, then the creme fraiche, a touch at a time so it's not too 
runny. Rest for 10 minutes before adding the chives and seasoning.

Put some oil in a non-stick pan on a medium heat, then pour in half the 
batter. When it starts to cook, add half the chard and taleggio.

Reduce the heat and allow the pancake to colour. When it starts to firm up, 
slowly fold it over. Repeat for the second batch. Cut the pancakes in half and 
serve with coleslaw or a green salad.
