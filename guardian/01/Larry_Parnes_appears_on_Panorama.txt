Who would you sooner see sing, Billy Fury or a bloke called Ron? Larry Parnes 
– the first major UK music manager – had a gift for renaming the pop idols on 
his roster to add a dash of glamour. In a sense, he was the 50s' Simon Cowell, 
and the issues around pop svengalis (Was he manipulating his young stars? Did 
they deserve their success?) were as relevant on Panorama's stern 1959 feature 
about Parnes and his "golden boys" as they are now.
