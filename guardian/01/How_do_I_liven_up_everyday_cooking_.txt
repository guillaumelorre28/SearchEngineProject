How can I introduce interesting and unusual ingredients into my cooking? I 
only have half an hour or so each night to cook a meal, but I get so bored with 
using the same ingredients!

Changes have to be gradual if they are to stick – especially in the kitchen. 
Start with your cupboard: there will be some unloved items at the back. Then 
gently introduce some new additions. For example, if you're trying butternut 
squash, roast some cubes sprinkled with thyme and chopped fresh mint and serve 
as one of your veg. If it goes well, try it as part of a main course soup with 
chorizo and haricot beans.

In recent years, the use of herbs and spices has changed the way many of us 
cook. The judicious use of spices such as za'atar, ras-al-hanout and harissa 
elevate many vegetables to headline act. Maybe try stirring harissa paste 
through rice. Add some tiny florets of roast cauliflower and, for a more 
substantial meal, some flaked smoked haddock. Try makinggremolata (finely 
chopped garlic, chopped flat-leaf parsley and chopped lemon zest). This keeps 
in the fridge, and a sprinkle livens up rice, potatoes, pasta and vegetables.

Alternative carbs such as red and black rice, spelt, quinoa and polenta are 
easily available. I love polenta, but on its own is a drag: add grated cheese, 
softened onions and oven-dried tomatoes; everyone will want seconds.

And try substituting ingredients in a classic dish or changing the way you 
cook them. If you're making a nicoise salad, use salmon instead of tuna or 
serve it with roasted potato wedges dusted with za'atar. Making spaghetti? 
Roast it in olive oil instead of boiling it.

So make gradual changes, keep some old favourites, take risks and try at least 
one Cook recipe a week!
