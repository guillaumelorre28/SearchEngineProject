So there we have it. Benjamin Clementine is the winner of the 2015 Mercury 
Prize. He gave a moving speech, despite being visibly lost for words, and broke 
down as he tried to dedicate it to Paris in the wake of the terrorist attacks 
there.

At Least For Now is a deserving album – Clementine is an artist with his own 
distinct voice, and one you suspect may develop further.

Here’s what our own Dave Simpson said about the record ... 

Channeling influences such as Erik Satie and Antony Hegarty, Clementine is 
reminiscent of Kevin Rowland in that he sounds as if he is singing from the 
gut, and because he has to. If only he had Rowland’s economy: mannered vocal 
flourishes complicate the melodies when what’s needed is simplicity. The 
addition of syrupy strings and pedestrian drumming further dilutes the impact 
of his raw talent. However, when he performs unadorned, melodies dripping from 
his fingertips, and letting fly from the heart, his voice is difficult to 
forget.

You can read the full review here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/26/benjamin-clementine-at-least-for-now-review>
.

Also worth having a read of this interview with Tshepo Mokoena in which he 
talks about his connection to Paris.

And the winner is ... Benjamin Clementine!

“Dunno what to say,” he says, in a very hushed voice indeed. “Thank you very 
much. I’d like to thank music. I can’t believe I’ve actually won this.”

He’s genuinely moved.

“I never thought I would say this. If anyone is watching, any child or 
youngster or student. The world is your oyster. Go out there and get what you 
want to get.”


And then he invites every single other nominee onstage with him. This is all 
quite sweet.

He then dedicates the prize to the victims of the Paris attacks and starts to 
cry. Clementine, of course, ran off to Paris as a teenager and made a name for 
himself busking on the Metro there.

Ghostpoet <https://www.theguardian.com/music/ghostpoet> has apparently been 
nominated for this award every year since 1932. Will he win this time? Before 
we find out, there’s a quick recap of the time Klaxons won the award while 
gurning off their faces off on rave drugs.

We’re very close to finding out the winner now. Are you excited? Or could you 
literally not give the slightest toss? Either way, they’re going to open the 
envelope and read out a name. Your thoughts have absolutely no impact on that 
happening.

Róisín Murphy performs live

And she does so while holding a split mask of a human face over her own, while 
dancing like a robot. It’s a bit Twin Peaks, and a suitable visual match for 
her slightly unsettling house-infused pop, in which even a rogue bassline can 
surprise.

“Talk to me about hairless toys,” says Lauren Laverne to Corinne Bailey Rae. 
Sadly for fans of general weirdness, she’s talking about the Róisín Murphy 
album.

Eska performs live!

Eska <https://www.theguardian.com/music/eska> was too scared to put herself 
forward as a pop performer for years, which is why she’s only getting noticed 
now that she’s in her 40s. Judging by her voice, or command of the stage, it’s 
hard to imagine her doubting herself.

Ok that’s all from me. Alexis Petridis will be along with his thoughts on the 
winner shortly. Thanks for reading!
 
So there we have it. Benjamin Clementine is the winner of the 2015 Mercury 
Prize. He gave a moving speech, despite being visibly lost for words, and broke 
down as he tried to dedicate it to Paris in the wake of the terrorist attacks 
there.

At Least For Now is a deserving album – Clementine is an artist with his own 
distinct voice, and one you suspect may develop further.

Here’s what our own Dave Simpson said about the record ... 

Channeling influences such as Erik Satie and Antony Hegarty, Clementine is 
reminiscent of Kevin Rowland in that he sounds as if he is singing from the 
gut, and because he has to. If only he had Rowland’s economy: mannered vocal 
flourishes complicate the melodies when what’s needed is simplicity. The 
addition of syrupy strings and pedestrian drumming further dilutes the impact 
of his raw talent. However, when he performs unadorned, melodies dripping from 
his fingertips, and letting fly from the heart, his voice is difficult to 
forget.

You can read the full review here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/26/benjamin-clementine-at-least-for-now-review>
.

Also worth having a read of this interview with Tshepo Mokoena in which he 
talks about his connection to Paris.

Benjamin Clementine: 'I sang on the Paris metro like I was playing in a 
stadium'

“Dunno what to say,” he says, in a very hushed voice indeed. “Thank you very 
much. I’d like to thank music. I can’t believe I’ve actually won this.”

He’s genuinely moved.

“I never thought I would say this. If anyone is watching, any child or 
youngster or student. The world is your oyster. Go out there and get what you 
want to get.”


And then he invites every single other nominee onstage with him. This is all 
quite sweet.

He then dedicates the prize to the victims of the Paris attacks and starts to 
cry. Clementine, of course, ran off to Paris as a teenager and made a name for 
himself busking on the Metro there.
 
“The time has come to announce the winner,” says Laverne before engaging in 
another interview, which suggests the time hasn’t quite come has it?
 
Ghostpoet <https://www.theguardian.com/music/ghostpoet> has apparently been 
nominated for this award every year since 1932. Will he win this time? Before 
we find out, there’s a quick recap of the time Klaxons won the award while 
gurning off their faces off on rave drugs.
 
We’re very close to finding out the winner now. Are you excited? Or could you 
literally not give the slightest toss? Either way, they’re going to open the 
envelope and read out a name. Your thoughts have absolutely no impact on that 
happening.
 
And she does so while holding a split mask of a human face over her own, while 
dancing like a robot. It’s a bit Twin Peaks, and a suitable visual match for 
her slightly unsettling house-infused pop, in which even a rogue bassline can 
surprise.
 
“Talk to me about hairless toys,” says Lauren Laverne to Corinne Bailey Rae. 
Sadly for fans of general weirdness, she’s talking about the Róisín Murphy 
album.
 
Eska <https://www.theguardian.com/music/eska> was too scared to put herself 
forward as a pop performer for years, which is why she’s only getting noticed

“I’ll have to lie down in a dark room after this,” says MistaJam. “Maybe a few 
cups of tea could bring me round, but I’m not sure.”
