I made this salad using fresh, uncooked chicken, but if you have cold 
leftovers they'll work really nicely with this classic combination of flavours.

(Serves 2)
Splash of olive oil
6 chicken thighs
2 sprigs of thyme
2 baby leeks, washed and halved lengthways
1 whole lemon, halved
Â½ head of garlic, separated into whole cloves
100ml water
2 baby gem lettuces

Add a dash of olive oil to an ovenproof pan or frying pan and put over a 
medium heat.

Season the chicken and place in the pan, turning on all sides for around five 
minutes so the joints start to colour all over.

Add the thyme, leek, lemon halves and garlic cloves, still in their skin.

Saute for three minutes, add the water and put in the oven at 200C/400F/gas 
mark 6 for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, wash the lettuce and tear into pieces.

Check that the chicken is cooked through, remove from the oven, allow to cool 
slightly then cut into pieces, making sure you keep the crispy skin.

Toss the chicken together with the lettuce and the vegetables from the pan.

Check the seasoning and finish with a touch of olive oil and the cooking 
juices.
