will be here onWednesday evening live blogging Autumnwatch 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/nature/uk/autumnwatch/> on BBC2, 8pm-9pm.

Just look what's in store on Wednesday's Autumnwatch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/autumnwatch>, according to the Radio 
Times: "Simon King tries to track down rutting wild boar in the Forest of Dean 
and there's footage of spectacular whooper swans, foxes and rutting red deer." 
Plus, you can ask John for his top bird watching tips - just don't call him a 
twitcher.
