There was much rejoicing this week when Arundhati Roy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/arundhati-roy>, the author of the 1997 
Booker prize-winningThe God of Small Things, announced that her second novel, 
The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, will be published in 2017. Twenty years is a 
long time to wait for a novel, but Roy is by no means the tardiest author in 
literary history.

Recently, Jonathan Franzen <https://www.theguardian.com/books/jonathan-franzen>
,Kazuo Ishiguro <https://www.theguardian.com/books/kazuoishiguro>, Donna Tartt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/donna-tartt> and Milan Kundera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/milankundera> have taken nine, 10, 11 and 
14 years, respectively, between novels. Barbara Pym publishedQuartet in Autumn 
(1977) 16 years afterNo Fond Return of Love. James Joyce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesjoyce> was so exhausted after Ulysses 
(1922) (his readers may empathise) that he didn’t beginFinnegans Wake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations>
 for a year, and didn’t publish it until 1939. Thomas Pynchon left 17 years 
between his third and fourth novels.

Many series have had big gaps. Judith Kerr’s Mog’s Christmas Calamity (2015) 
was published 13 years after (spoiler alert) Mog the cat died inGoodbye Mog. 
There were 18 years between books three and four inUrsula LeGuin’s Earthsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/15/ursula-k-le-guin-to-publish-earthsea-story-in-print-for-first-time>
 series, and 24 between Richard Adams’sWatership Down (1972) and Tales from 
Watership Down. The boy hero of Alan Garner’s 1960 book The Weirdstone of 
Brisingamen was a professor by the time Boneland, the third in the trilogy, was 
published in 2012.

Also beating Roy’s 20 years are Tolstoy (22 years between Anna Karenina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/05/anna-karenina-review-keira-knightley>
 andResurrection); Marilynne Robinson (24 years between Housekeeping and Gilead
); and of course Harper Lee, whose “first novel”,Go Set a Watchman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2015/jul/10/go-set-a-watchman-read-the-first-chapter>
, was recently published, 55 years afterTo Kill a Mockingbird.

Fans of George RR Martin <https://www.theguardian.com/books/george-rr-martin> 
can chill their boots, then. They’ve only waited five years (and counting) for 
his next.
