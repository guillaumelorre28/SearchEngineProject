Middlesbrough <https://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough> are poised 
to make Viktor Fischer their first signing of the summer after agreeing to pay 
Ajax €5m (£3.8m) for the Denmark international.

Fischer, 21, travelled to England on Tuesday to discuss personal terms after a 
successful bid from Aitor Karanka’s side beat off competition from the 
big-spending Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg. The 21-year-old is due to have 
his medical on Teesside on Wednesday before returning to join the Danish

It is understood that the prospect of fulfilling his dream of playing in the 
Premier League and the presence of Karanka as Boro manager were major factors 
in his decision.

Fischer, a versatile forward who can play in several positions across the 
front line but is best known as a left winger, has been atAjax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ajax> since the age of 15 having signed 
from FC Midtjylland in 2011. He has been compared to the Danish legend Michael 
Laudrup in the past having been named Holland’s Talent of the Year in 2013 
after scoring 10 goals in the Eredivisie.

However, lengthy injury problems last season restricted him to just four 
appearances, although Fischer was a regular as Ajax finished as runners-up 
behind PSV Eindhoven. With just one year of his Ajax contract remaining, he had 
already hinted last week that his time at the club was coming to an end.

“I’m ready to prove myself again, but probably somewhere else. I think that it 
is a mutual desire,” he said.
