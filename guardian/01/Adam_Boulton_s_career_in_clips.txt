After 25 years as Sky News' political editor, Adam Boulton is stepping down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/13/adam-boulton-step-down-sky-news-political-editor>
 to front a new evening show for the channel from Westminster.

Boulton, part of the Sky News <https://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-news> 
launch team in 1989, has been a pioneer of live rolling news broadcasting in 
the UK. He is one of the most skilled practitioners of the tricky art – much 
under-rated, sometimes mocked – of keeping the show on the road when the 
cameras are rolling, dealing with truculent interviewees, sometimes juggling 
numerous stories and at others filling airtime with informed and engaging 
commentary when, frankly, there's not much going on.

Known for his abrasive interview style and occasional tendency to let rip when 
he loses his cool, here are some of his more memorable moments on live 
television.

Perhaps his most notorious bust up was in a live interview with Alastair 
Campbell from Westminster's College Green during the post general election 
hiatus in May 2010, which ended with the Sky News man losing his rag at the 
Labour spin doctor: "I'm fed up with you telling me what I think!"

Jackass – the newsie

Former Telegraph proprietor Conrad Black comes under pressure from Boulton 
while attempting to downplay his fraud conviction – and brands the political 
editor a "jackass".

Boulton asks BNP leader Nick Griffin whether he would have a problem with a 
member of his party marrying someone of a different race and holds him to 
account over the BNP's attitude towards women.

Fond farewell?

Gordon Brown tries to direct Adam's questions away from his future as Labour 
leader and towards policy, to no avail. Brown then walks away at the end of the 
interview.

You stay classy, Adam

And finally … reading word for word from the autocue, Ron Burgundy-style, 
Boulton includes the run time and number of words for the next feature. "Don't 
understand that at all" – indeed.
