Amy Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/amy-williams> promised to 
toast her Olympic skeleton gold medal with "a sip of champagne" after being 
presented with it in front of a cheering crowd at the Whistler Medals Plaza.

Williams held back tears as the Union Jack was raised over a Winter Olympic 
podium for the first time since Rhona Martin's curling team took gold at the 
Salt Lake City Games in 2002.

But she admitted she had shed tears earlier in the day, when she paused to 
view internet footage of her brother and twin sister cheering her home on TV in 
the local pub in Bath. Williams said: "I'm going to have a sip of champagne 
tonight but I'm going to save the party for when I get home. I did have tears 
when I saw the scenes at my local pub. It really choked me up."

Williams insisted the experience of being awarded her medal in such a public 
way had scared her and her two German rivals, who won silver and bronze, far 
more than throwing themselves head-first down a 90mph ice track.

She added: "All three of us were just shaking before going on. To have the 
medal now is just incredible. I didn't think I would get a medal â€“ I was just 
hoping to do better than my training runs.

"I've been in a bubble since I won and it feels like it's got thicker. It 
feels a little bit more real now that I'm holding the medal. I've had a message 
of congratulations from the Prime Minister and the whole thing is amazing."
