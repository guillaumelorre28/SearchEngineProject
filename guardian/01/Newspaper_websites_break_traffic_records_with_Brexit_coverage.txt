The Brexit vote helped the UK’s national newspapers break digital readership 
records in June, with the Independent, the Guardian, the Mirror and Mail Online 
all passing major milestones.

The Independent, which went digital-only in March, saw the biggest boost, with 
traffic up almost 44% to an average of 4.4 million unique browsers a day, 
according to the latest Audit Bureau of Circulations figures published on 
Thursday. The Telegraph was the next biggest riser, with an almost 30% rise to 
5.6 million.

Mail Online saw an almost 8% rise to pass 15 million for the first time, while 
the Guardian’s audience rose by more than 15%, taking it over an average of 10 
million unique daily browsers for the first time.

All four news outlets added more than 1 million daily browsers compared with 
the previous month.

The Mirror also saw a big rise, up almost 8% to bring in more than 5 million 
daily browsers for the first time, as did the Express, which saw an almost 19% 
rise to more than 1.8 million. The Sun also saw a big rise of more than 15%, 
but from a comparatively small base having only dropped its paywall fully at 
the end of November.

However, the Daily Star saw its traffic fall during the month, down 9% to 
818,188.
