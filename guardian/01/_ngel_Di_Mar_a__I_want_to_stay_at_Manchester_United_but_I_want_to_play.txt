Ángel Di María has insisted he has no plans to leave Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> this summer despite 
enduring a difficult first season at Old Trafford, although he did admit to 
feeling frustration at his lack of playing time.

The Argentina midfielder, 27, struggled for form and fitness after making his 
£59.7m British transfer record move from Real Madrid. That has led to 
speculation that he could return to Spain, with Barcelona the latest club to be 
linked.

However, with Di María currently in Chile playing for his country at the Copa 
América, he has dismissed those rumours.

Asked in an interview with the Argentinian newspaper Olé 
<http://www.ole.com.ar/copa-america-2015-argentina/titulo_0_1381661842.html> if 
he will leave Manchester United, Di María replied: “No, because I’m not 
thinking like that. In Madrid there were times when I was whistled around the 
stadium but faced it and then it turned around. I like to deal with things.”

However, he did admit to feeling uneasy about his situation at Old Trafford. 
“Yes. For me, and my family. Because not everything goes as I want, because I 
don’t play,” he said.

“Because I came with an intention and end up on the bench. It’s hard to tell 
how I feel there. I started well, with goals and assists. I was having a good 
time, until I was out. It’s a little hard to explain why I do not play.”

Early in the year Di María and his family were the victims of an attempted 
burglary at his Cheshire home hours after playing in the3-1 victory over 
Leicester
