Midsummer is when wildlife usually revels in long warm days, but this summer 
has been dire. Bees and butterflies have had a sodden time, and so have the 
insects, birds and bats that feed on them.

Gardeners are seeing fewer greenfly and blackfly in the downpours, but the 
rains have brought out swarms of slugs and snails. And a voracious alien known 
as the Spanish stealth slug has invaded the UK and is hybridising with a native 
British slug to produce highly fertile offspring that are slithering across the 
country in record numbers. At least hedgehogs have feasted on the slug bonanza, 
withKew Gardens <https://www.theguardian.com/science/kew-gardens> reporting 
their first sighting of a hedgehog in 20 years.

The downpours have also flushed away silt in upland rivers, giving clean 
shingle with well oxygenated water enjoyed by salmon and other creatures, 
including some very rare beetles, the larvae of caddis flies and even a spider 
called the river shingle spider.Mayflies have also emerged well from rivers. 
These grow as an underwater nymph on riverbeds for two or more years before 
emerging on the river surface as an adult in late May or June, flying off for a 
brief life of a day or two to breed. The females then lay their eggs on the 
river and all the adults die, without even having enough time to feed. But with 
climate change, the lifespan of the mayfly larvae has become shorter as rivers 
have grown warmer in recent years.
