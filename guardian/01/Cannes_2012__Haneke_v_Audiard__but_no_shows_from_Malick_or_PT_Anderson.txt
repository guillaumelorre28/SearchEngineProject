Cannes 2012 is shaping up to be an auteurs' reunion, with new films from old 
Croisette stagers such as Jacques Audiard, Ken Loach and Michael Haneke vying 
for this year's top honour, the Palme d'Or. Joining them in competiton are the 
likes of Walter Salles, Leos Carax,David Cronenberg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/davidcronenberg>, Thomas Vinterberg, Lee 
Daniels and Wes Anderson, whose Moonrise Kingdom is the first opening night 
film to be also in competition since 2008's Blindness.

Rust and Bone, the latest from Audiard, whose A Prophet won the Grand Prix in 
2009, was long a shoo-in for a competition spot; ditto Haneke with Love, which 
reunites him with Piano TeacherIsabelle Huppert 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/isabelle-huppert>, and Abbas Kiarostami with 
Like Someone in Love. Matteo Garrone's followup to Gommorah is another welcome 
inclusion. Loach returns with The Angels' Share, a whisky heist film set in 
Scotland, larkier than his last Cannes winner, The Wind that Shakes the Barley.

On the Road, Walter Salles's adaptation of the Jack Kerouac novel, had been 
rumoured to screen at the festival last year. Holy Motors from Leos Carax was 
more of an outside bet for competition entry, likewise new films from new wave 
veteran Alain Resnais and Mexican maverick Carlos Reygadas. Cristian Mungiu and 
Ulrich Seidl bulk up the serious European wing.

But while some of those film-makers have enjoyed apparent promotion into the 
first grade of premieres, the converse appeared to have happened to Apichatpong 
Weerasethakul, whose ghost tragedyUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135882/uncle-bonmee-who-can-recall-his-past-lives>
 took the top prize in 2010 but is a special screening this year.

The US presence at Cannes looks to be typically slight, with Lee Daniels' 
Paperboy (starring Zac Efron) leading the pack. Another Sundance alumni, Jeff 
Nichols, whose Take Shelter screened in Un Certain Regard last year, joins the 
competition lineup with Mud. Beasts of the Southern Wild, which wowed Sundance 
in January, has an Un Certain Regard spot. Killing Them Softly, a crime drama 
starring Brad Pitt and directed by New Zealander Andrew Dominik, is set in the 
States.

New films from Terrence Malick and Paul Thomas Anderson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/paul-thomas-anderson>, which had been hoped 
to premiere in France, were not completed in time, according to festival 
director Thierry Frémaux, and there was no space for Derek Cianfrance's Blue 
Valentine followup, The Place Beyond the Pines. Woody Allen's latest, To Rome 
with Love, was not at time of writing included in the lineup, but it may be 
announced at a later date. Madagascar 3 looks to fill the regulation animation 
spot (previous toons to do the honours include Up and Kung Fu Panda).

David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis, starring Twilight's Robert Pattinson, was 
another hot tip for the competition, made yet hotter when a trailer for the 
film went live last night bearing the official Cannes selection badge.

After the Battle, Yousry Nasrallah's fictional representation of the aftermath 
of Egypt's revolution, looks to be the most politically incendiary title in 
competition.

Previously announced were the president of the Un Certain Regard jury (Tim Roth
 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/13/tim-roth-jury-cannes-festival>), 
the mistress of ceremonies (The Artist star Berenice Bejo) and the opening and 
closing night films:Moonrise Kingdom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145667/moonrise-kingdom>, Wes 
Anderson's 60s-set summer camp romance,will kick off the festival on 16 May

director whodied earlier this month

Tautou, the movie willscreen out of competition

.

Yesterday, Variety revealed that also screening will be redux version of 
Sergio Leone's 1984 film Once Upon a Time in America, adding 40 minutes of 
footage to the 229-minute running time. The film was whittled down to 139 
minutes, excluding several flashback sequences, for its US release.

The list diverges from a false lineup leaked at the start of the month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/03/leaked-cannes-film-festival-list-false>
. Frémaux was scathing about the report. "It's disgusting to play with such a 
thing," he told industry website Deadline. "There is a code of conduct for 
Cannes and it must be respected. Those who don't respect the code will never 
come back to Cannes."
