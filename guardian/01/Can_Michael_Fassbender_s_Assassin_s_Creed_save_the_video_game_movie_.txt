The history of video game-to-film adaptations is littered with the rotting 
corpses of productions featuring half-arsed storylines, C-grade casting and a 
distinctly regrettable absence of directorial vision. The famously appalling 
German director Uwe Boll has made a living from trotting out cheap and nasty 
films, which usually make their money back thanks to gamers who are fooled into 
thinking they are about to re-experience their greatest moments spent with a 
PlayStation or Xbox on the big screen.

The reality is usually rather different. Movies and video games operate under 
a completely different set of rules, and quite often the extended non-playable 
sequences in games which most resemble traditional film narrative are the bits 
gamers click through in boredom after the first dozen times of viewing. Only 
the Resident Evil movies have achieved successful franchise status, and only 
then without any particular degree of critical traction, and largely because 
zombie films will always have their place in the heart of a certain type of 
filmgoer.

There is a chance, however, that the trend is changing. The upcoming World of 
Warcraft movie, Warcraft – with the much-buzzed-about director of Moon and 
Source Code, Duncan Jones, in the hot-seat – has been in development for so 
long that it is either going to be the greatest fantasy epic since The Lord of 
the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, or the worst example of the form since 
Eragon. We’ll find out in June 2016.

And now comes Michael Fassbender 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-fassbender> in Assassin’s Creed, 
based on the hugely popular video game in which players go on missions to take 
down targets in various exotic locations throughout history, – the first image 
for which has just hit the web. Fassbender, who plays a character named Callum 
Lynch not seen in the games, is shown in hooded, lightly armoured garb, his 
weapons of choice ready to slip from beneath his sleeves to be plunged into the 
nearest unfortunate public figure or political rival.

Assassin’s Creed was something of a successor to video game manufacturer 
Ubisoft’s Prince of Persia series, which filmgoers may remember from the
ill-fated 2010 big screen adaptation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/20/prince-of-persia-sands-film-review>
, which was rubbish despite starring decent actors Jake Gyllenhaal, Ben 
Kingsley and Gemma Arterton, and featuring direction from no less a figure than 
Mike Newell. So in a way, we have been here before.

But perhaps, with Fassbender on board as a co-producer, we’re entitled to hold 
out a little hope for Assassin’s Creed. The Irishman isn’t known for taking on 
duds, and has brought his Macbeth team of director Justin Kurzel and co-star 
Marion Cotillard along for the ride. Kurzel, the Australian film-maker who also 
gave us 2011’s harrowing Snowtown, is working from a screenplay by Exodus: Gods 
and Kings’ Bill Collage and Adam Cooper, with Macbeth’s Michael Lesslie. The 
supporting cast looks good too, with Boardwalk Empire’s Michael K Williams the 
key player.

Lynch, like his video game predecessors, is believed to be a modern day man 
who is able to experience the adventures of his ancestors, in this case those 
living in 15th-century Spain during the famous religious Inquisition. As well 
as playing his ancestor, Aguilar, the storyline will see Fassbender, with all 
new martial arts skills picked up from his time spent rampaging through the 
past, taking on the nefarious Knights Templar in the 21st century.

Yes Michael will play Callum in the modern day, and Aguilar will be his 
ancestor in the past. -Aymarhttps://t.co/6mgSzEFAUJ <https://t.co/6mgSzEFAUJ>

All that sounds a little bit too close to the video game for comfort, though 
James Cameron’s Avatar achieved record-breaking box office results and decent 
critical traction a few years back by adopting a similar remote control 
aesthetic. Are you holding out hope for Assassin’s Creed to take on the mantle 
of the first ever really decent game-to-film transfer? Or should we be filing 
this one alongside Doom, Tomb Raider and … shudder … Super Mario Bros?
