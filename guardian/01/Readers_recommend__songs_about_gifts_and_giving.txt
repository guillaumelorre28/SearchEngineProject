What is the greatest gift one can receive at Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas>, or any other time? Could 
it be a box of powdered cappuccino sachets? Or a large porcelain ornament frog 
complete with sticky yellow frogspawn? Tattoo sleeves, like tights for the arms 
- so you can slip them on if you want to look a bit hard or hipster? Does it 
matter if it doesn’t in any way match your skin colour? How about a bottle of 
Domestos bleach? Yes, really. Or a bag of used-only-once cotton socks? Washed, 
mind. These are all contenders, as I discovered last year when I got together 
with a group of friends on 28 December. As well as catching up over a few 
drinks, the request was to bring some of the most bizarre, awful, 
jaw-droppingly tasteless, or embarrassing gifts received during the festive 
season.

We laughed long and hard at these items. Cynical and ungrateful? Only perhaps, 
but these extraordinary items of misfiring (un)generosity expose how Christmas 
can be a season of blind panic, peer pressure and terrible judgment. So what is 
the best gift you can receive? Perhaps it’s the one you choose for yourself.

 Fancy a shopping spree? The mall awaits in Dawn of the Dead 
So this week, with shopping having reached the peak of a frenzy, not unlike, 
in my experience this week, the zombies who return, by memory and instinct, to 
the mall in George A Romero’s 1978 film Dawn of the Dead, it’s time to return 
to real life with songs all about gifts, presents and giving. So many talented 
musicians, fromAretha Franklin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aretha-franklin> have described their 
ability as being “a gift from God” (although Joni Mitchell said her own “gift 
for music was borne out of tragedy and loss”). These kinds of gifts, including 
your time, skill and love, also count alongside actual items given or received, 
but let’s abstain from more abstract terms such as gift of the gab or god’s 
gift to women.

Back to Christmas. One of best ways to relax, I always felt, was to put one’s 
feet up, with a cup of tea and a biscuit, and peruse the latest Argos 
catalogue. Known to most British shoppers as classic, colourful tome of bargain 
consumerism, and a near-miracle of mass compilation, in this substantial volume 
you could make an inner fantasy journey to imagine owning almost anything 
through the power of glorious page-flipping glossy analogue. Or you used to, 
until they turned it now mostly into a website-only version, even in stores. 
That’s technology for you. Bah humbug.

Yet technology, of course, is our friend. And this year I’ve been looking at, 
and even snapping up a few items for the ever so subtle music-loving, 
guitar--and-keyboard-playing cyclist that I am. But who then among us in the RR 
Aladdin’s Cave fraternity doesn’t fantasise about many a rare record played on 
a VPI Prime turntable, an unaffordable top-notch sound system or headphones, or 
even a beautifully hand-made wooden and metal instrument from the likes of 
Gretsch, Gibson Les Paul or Nord? Here ends the list. But one thing I have 
discovered recently is the joy of the Bluetooth speaker, handy for seamlessly 
transmitting music to any room in the house from your phone or tablet. Some can 
bequite pricey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/12/tried-tested-wi-fi-speakers>
, andothers more affordable <http://www.extremetuned.com/hangten/>, but the 
sound is often impressive.

But Christmas is really all about absolutely useless presents. Many can be 
found in so-called “innovations” catalogues in which every kind of item can be 
purchased to apparently increase the practical comfort of you your home, but, 
by a far greater degree, drastically reduce every aesthetic look. Mini step 
ladder or ramp so your dog can climb on the bed? Sold! Horrible baggy beige 
trousers with Velcro or zip sections to quickly convert them into shorts? 
Yours, sir! Some kind of wraparound vibrating electrical thingy that makes you 
think you can lose belly fat without doing anything other than switch on and 
watch it wobble? Kerching! But the greatest useful/useless items and ultimate 
expression of multi-tasking modern life is the Japanese chindogu.

These gloriously designed items, illustrated above and below, range from 
walking-stick chinrest or wall-suction helmet to help you sleep on long 
commuter journeys, mini umbrellas to keep your shoes dry, mop slippers for a 
cat or baby to clean the floor on the move, an electric fan on a chopstick to 
cool your hot noodles, the messy noodle eater’s hair guard, a toilet roll hat 
for allergy sufferers, the umbrella tie and butter stick pen. Every home should 
have some.
 Hay fever? This could be for you. Not only attractive, but also practical.
