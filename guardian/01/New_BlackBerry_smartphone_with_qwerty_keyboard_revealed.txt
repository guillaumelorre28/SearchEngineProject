BlackBerry may have stopped making smartphones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/28/blackberry-to-stop-making-phones-handsets>
, but that hasn’t stopped BlackBerry smartphones from being made, with one 
expected to be called the BlackBerry Press to be announced at CES in Las Vegas 
on Wednesday.


BlackBerry’s manufacturing partner TCL Communications Technology (TCT), which 
recently licensed the former RIM brand and makes smartphones under the Alcatel 
brand, is expected to announce a newBlackBerry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blackberry> – and a teaser video shows 
it will come with the traditional qwerty keyboard.

TCT’s president of North America, Steve Cistulli, posted several teasers of 
the Press to his Twitter account.

The new BlackBerry-branded smartphone will, like previously released 
BlackBerry smartphones the DTEK50 and DTEK60 also made by TCT, run BlackBerry’s 
version ofAndroid <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android> and its 
messaging apps.

The Press will be the first TCT BlackBerry to have a qwerty keyboard and will 
continue the long run of BlackBerry devices with such a physical input device 
as well as a touchscreen, where other manufacturers, including Apple, Google 
and Huawei have shunned the hardware keyboard in favour of larger touchscreens 
with adaptive virtual keyboards.

BlackBerry’s ditching of its own BlackBerry operating system for Google’s 
Android was seen as a positive step, giving access to the wealth of apps within 
Google’s Play Store. Whether the device will be enough to attract the former 
lovers of BlackBerry’s physical keyboard that have since ditched the brand 
remains to be seen.
