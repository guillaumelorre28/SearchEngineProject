The last unfinished novel of 19th-century novelist Alexandre Dumas, author of 
The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Christo, was published for the 
first time as a book yesterday after it was rediscovered by a French academic.

Claude Schopp, 61, who has studied Dumas for more than 20 years, said he came 
across a letter 10 years ago in which Dumas mentioned Le Chevalier de 
Sainte-Hermine or The Knight of Sainte-Hermine.

"It's amazing. What thrilled me was that the novel corresponded to the missing 
work in Dumas' history," Mr Schopp said.

The book is part of Dumas' project to document French history through 
literature.

It fits into a series of dozens of novels, just ahead of The Count of Monte 
Christo, even though it was the last novel he wrote.

"It's like a testament. He knew he was ill and that he was going to die," Mr 
Schopp said. "The text is beautiful because we can feel that he was struggling 
with the mass of historical material he was working with.

Mr Schopp found that the text had been published in installments over nine 
months in a newspaper in 1869, the year before Dumas' death.

The novel is an adventure story depicting the struggles of revolutionary France
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>. It is set at the beginning of the 
Napoleonic era and tells the story of an aristocrat divided between his 
royalist ambitions and his fascination with Napoleon.

It is the last novel in a trilogy started with Les Blancs et les Bleus, or The 
White and Blues, and followed by Les Compagnons de Jehu, or The Companions of 
Jehu.

Mr Schopp put the installments together and corrected grammatical and spelling 
mistakes. He also added two and a half chapters to finish the last episode in 
the book.

But the novel is still incomplete, according to an overall plan which Mr 
Schopp also found 10 years ago.

"I'm going to propose to write the whole novel," said Mr Schopp who has 
already written four novels.
