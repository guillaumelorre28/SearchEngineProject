special effects,whether Han shot first 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/10/star-wars-chewbacca-greedo-han-solo>
, or even merchandise, is – of course – top-quality acting. Consider Mark 
Hamill as Luke Skywalkerreacting to the sight of his immolated family

Like the Rebel Alliance, the Star Wars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> franchise has traditionally offered 
a home for the craft’s dispossessed and unloved. But now we’re entering a new 
era: The Force Awakens is slick and professional, its script drafted to 
laser-like precision. Surely there’s no longer room for wooden delivery or 
am-dram hamminess? Let’s find out …

 Scowly, scowly and scowly … Daisy Ridley’s performative range. Photograph: 
Allstar/Disney/Lucasfilm 
She was previously in Casualty, as a girl bashed up a bit on a malfunctioning 
fairground ride <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndRJtrTugdM>, and Silent 
Witness as – yes! – a corpse. But The Force Awakens is Daisy Ridley’s first 
film. Unsurprisingly, she looks a little bit lost. She plays Rey, a scavenger 
who’s supposed to be tough, independent and wise beyond her years – 
characteristics which, in the hands of an inexperienced actor, often come 
across as scowly, scowly and scowly. Is it a problem that the weight of a $4bn 
(£2.66bn) franchise squats on the shoulders of an untested telly actor? 
Probably, but it’s too late to worry about all that now. Plans for sequels 
stretch out far into the galaxy, so there’s plenty of room for improvement.

and by-the-numbers gang melodramaImperial Dreams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/18/sundance-film-festival-review-imperial-dreams>
), Boyega makes a decent go of it, particularly because he has to pick up much 
of Ridley’s slack. He’s Finn, a disillusioned Stromtrooper who quits the First 
Order to escape a life spent in a stuffy suit, murdering innocents. Boyega 
handles his leading man duties admirably – he can do funny, looks good in a 
fight and even holds his own in a snark-off against Harrison Ford.

Solid as a rock. Still caught in a love triangle between Chewbacca and Leia, 
Han Solo has been searching the galaxy for his ship, the Millennium Falcon. 
Ford was reluctant to come back on board, but once in, he’s thrown himself at 
it unreservedly. He covers for Ridley and Boyega and has been gracious about 
their talent in interviews too. Doesn’t do a whole lot of running about, but 
suddenlya septuagenarian Indiana Jones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/12/harrison-ford-indiana-jones-steven-spielberg>

), Fisher has the life experience to spin the former Princess Leia as a 
Resistance general. Inevitably, she and Ford get to look wistful about the past 
and share a couple of they-did-but-will-they-again moments. She’s no longer 
front and centre, so it’s not a great test of her talent, but she’s one of a 
clutch of the main cast who bring a welcome lightness to the sci-fi soap opera.

 Oscar Isaac reminds us that, in essence, Star Wars is a bit of lighthearted 
fun. Photograph: David James/AP 
It’s only a movie. Oscar Isaac’s performance as a X-wing ace sees him zip 
through the sky in dogfight after dogfight, but he grounds the whole thing with 
an amiable goofiness that offers a firm wink towards the franchise’s sillier 
elements. Has a nice bit of interplay with Boyega as flying buddies, but a fair 
bit of sitting around waiting for the plot to catch up with him otherwise. Like 
Luke approaching his final run at the Death Star, he could probably do this 
with his eyes closed.

 Adam Driver avoids taking his villain into overly zany territory. Photograph: 
Allstar/Disney/Lucasfilm 
A classy, subtle performance in a role that could have been lost to 
cartoonishness. Wields that wacky lightsaber like a master and – unlike Ray 
Park’s Darth Maul – gets enough time to flesh out the character and make his 
evil believable. Natty costume, too, and once the mask comes off, Driver’s 
tendency to look simultaneously naive and knackered plays nicely into the 
scriptwriter’s hands.

How strong is The Force in this one? Dark, powerful. Bournville 

Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux

The screechy pseudo-Nazi role goes to Domhnall Gleeson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/domhnall-gleeson> as the First Order toady 
General Hux. Gleeson spends the film vying with Kylo Ren for top bad boy 
honours. The part is not as colourful or as nuanced as Driver’s, but – given 
he’s a functionary – Gleeson certainly makes an impression. Watch out for his 
boggle-eyed screed against the Resistance, delivered to the massed ranks of the 
First Order army. Nice spittle!

How strong is The Force in this one? Plenty of welly. Very acidic. Malt vinegar

Lupita Nyong’o as Maz Kanata

Tucked away behind CG wizardry hides Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong’o, playing a 
elderly alien lady called Maz. She’s an oracle of sorts and a teeny bit dull 
for it. Nyong’o does her best, but the part doesn’t call for her to do much 
more than sound a bit elderly (and look a bit orange).

Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snook 

Big, bad, barely in it. As ever Serkis does his bit for all those actors who 
make a living covering themselves in dots and squeezing into spandex. But his 
character’s an evil overlord and in reboots like this, the big boss is simply a 
spectre. Sorry, is that a dirty word in these parts?

Anthony Daniels as C-3PO

Knows the drill and runs the protocols. Bit of worrying, bit of sniping. Lots 
of love for R2 and a burgeoning friendship with the brand new bot, BB-8. The
