We start this week with a couple of great clips which feature putting words 
found on social media to music. Three-time Grammy winner Kelly Clarkson takes 
the profiles of people using the dating app Tinder andturns them into big 
ballads <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nirgViXADbE>. Meanwhile, also on the 
Jimmy Kimmel show, singer, songwriter and producer Josh Grobancroons the tweets 
of US presidential hopeful Donald Trump 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-41fbDYZyLo&feature=youtu.be>.

It’s been 18 years since comic Steve Coogan’s character Alan Partridge pitched 
the idea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/20/youth-hostelling-with-chris-eubank-alan-partridge>
of a series to a BBC executive called Youth Hostelling with Chris Eubank. Now 
Partridge’s dream has come true with a very funny clip 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGG5OhEcpOQ&feature=youtu.be> featuring the 
former boxing champion.

You can’t be a comic without great timing and our best wildlife clip this week 
featuresa blue whale <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRu7W935dyk> who knows 
just when to pop up for a starring role inBig Blue Live 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02v036z>. The new series, featuring zoologist 
Mark Carwardine, will be screened on BBC1 in the UK and PBS in the US.

We’ve also got a waitress called Cherry 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hdxs4JVeLk> who thinks she’s got great timing 
as she slings insults at customers at Ed Debevic’s in Chicago and some 
brilliantly bad lip-reading which turns aRepublican debate 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufGlBv8Z3NU&list=PL-DfNcB3lim9IZmUXEjE1Ov0Ir1NDa3Yr&index=5>
 into a comedy pit.

You would expect a ballerina to have an excellent sense of rhythm but bride 
Valerie was stunned when her new husband Kirk, a professional dancer, roped in 
all his groomsmen toperform a dance  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv3fBxPY9zE> at their wedding reception in 
Richmond, Virginia.

Finally, for all those James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe fans, take a sneak 
peek at Victor Frankenstein <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvESrJ5GdHc>, in 
which the scientist goes to the brink of madness in his quest to find 
immortality.The film <http://www.foxmovies.com/movies/victor-frankenstein>, 
which also stars Downton Abbey’s Jessica Brown Findlay, plus Andrew Scott and 
Freddie Fox, is expected to be released in November. Prepare to be scared.
