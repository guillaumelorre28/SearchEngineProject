Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
have revealed that Ashley Young is facing a spell on the sidelines after 
injuring his shoulder in the controversial collision with Tottenham's 
goalkeeper Hugo Lloris on Wednesday.

Young landed awkwardly as he leapt over Lloris's flying attempt to win the 
ball, which the United manager David Moyes remains convinced should have 
resulted in a penalty for his team and a red card for the Frenchman.United lost

"Ashley has got an injury that is going to keep him out for a time," said 
Moyes. "It is a shoulder injury he received in the challenge by the goalkeeper. 
I am not sure how long it will be."

 at Lloris getting away with his challenge.

Yet Moyes is not prepared to push for the widening of video technology beyond 
its current limit of determining whether shots have crossed the line or not.

"I wouldn't go down the route of video technology," said Moyes. "I trust the 
referees to make the right decisions.

"They do make the wrong ones at times and I have not changed how I felt on 
Wednesday. I thought that was the wrong decision."

Moyes offered no further update on the fitness of Robin van Persie, who has 
missed six games with a thigh injury. "We will let you know when he is ready," 
he said.
