Ashley Giles is a strong candidate to succeed Andy Flower as England's coach, 
the ECB chairman Giles Clarke said on Saturday. Flowerstepped down on Friday

 following England's 5-0 Ashes whitewash. The managing director Paul Downton 
will now take charge of the process of appointing a successor, and Clarke was 
generous but non-committal in his praise for Giles.

"I think we would all agree he is a very strong candidate. Ashley is a very 
valued employee of theECB <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ecb> and we all 
have the highest regard for him both as a man and a coach. He is a man of high 
integrity, he's played a lot of cricket for England and is respected in the 
game. Having said that, for all I know there may well be other candidates who 
emerge. That will be a matter for Paul and whoever he chooses to advise him on 
that."

Clarke also confirmed he would be talking to Flower about an unspecified role 
within the ECB. "Andy Flower has a great deal to give English cricket. There 
are some other major roles Paul Downton and [ECB chief executive] David Collier 
have been discussing with him and I'm very confident he will remain with us."
