She went back to the clinic a few days later. Where else was there to go? She 
didn't even try to go quietly this time. It was midday, all cameras blazing, 
and the newspaper headlines seemed like the most irrelevant thing in the world. 
Outside, I spotted Mr Mulligrent giving a television interview, the sweat 
gleaming on his broad forehead under the bright light.

She stayed longer this time, long enough that I was allowed in for a visit. I 
had hoped I'd see her changed, looking healthier, happier. But she was grey and 
jittery, smoking cigarette after cigarette, drinking strong black coffee.

"Do you know what they said to me here?" she said. "They said, just keep 
going. That's it, that's all of it. Whenyou're going through hell, just keep 
going <https://www.theguardian.com/world/secondworldwar>. But I don't know if 
I'm strong enough."
Tears leaked out of her eyes, her nose started to run. What is it in me that 
still found her beautiful? Is that a force for good or for ill?

"You are," I said, "you are. You're stronger than you know."
She cried a little more, and scrubbed at her nose with a dirty tissue.
"Why has it happened so quickly?" she said, "it was so good and now it's just 
â€¦"
"I think maybe it's like mirrors," I said, "like physics. The law of 
reflection. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. The 
faster you come in, the faster you're going to go out." I drew a little diagram 
on the table with my finger.

She sniffed and wiped her nose. She could not seem to stop the tears from 
falling. "I just want to stop," she said, "that's all I want now."
