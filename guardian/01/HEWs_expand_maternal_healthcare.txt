Tobiyaw Astatkia, 38, a health extension worker (HEW) and a grandmother, 
understands only too well the importance of safely carrying and delivering 
children. Her voice falters as she remembers how things used to be. "Before the 
HEW programme was introduced, it was traditional for birth attendants to dig a 
hole, put grass mixed with hot water inside and make the woman sit over the 
hole, so that the steam would help her to deliver."

Only one in 10 women in Ethiopia deliver at a health facility, and in the 
absence of trained professionals, even the slightest complication can be fatal 
for both mother and child. Stories of women in labour being carried miles on 
the backs of donkeys – or, failing that, on the shoulders of their desperate 
families – are common.

Abdulgelil Ali, head of mother and child health at Sululta heath centre, says 
the importance of maternal health cannot be overemphasised. "If the mother's 
health is good, the baby's health is also good. But if the mother is sick, the 
baby will become sick." The consequences for the nutritional and economic 
status of the household can be dire, setting off a downward spiral of declining 
health.

But HEWs such as Astatkia, who can deliver babies safely within their 
communities, are reversing that spiral. "Now we believe in modern health 
practices," she says. "Every time a woman gives birth, I'm called to handle the 
delivery so that they feel safe. People trust me to do things properly, and I 
feel confident that I can."
