Sunday titles showed the biggest sales spikes, particularly during the weekend

increases, contributing to Sunday titles selling on average across June about 
111,000 extra copies per edition compared with May.

Major winners included the Observer, up 8.42% month on month, its biggest 
monthly rise since 2006; the Sunday Times, up 3.67%; and the Sunday Telegraph,

“Readers have always turned to newspapers at times of national significance 
and continue to do so,” said Rufus Olins, chief executive of newspaper industry 
body Newsworks. “The latest ABC data confirms newspapers’ continued influence 
throughout Brexit and beyond.”
