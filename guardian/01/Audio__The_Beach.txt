DiCaprio hype has made the backpackers' dope-soaked idyll on a Thai island 
beach and its subsequent disintegration into violence and death the best-known 
story around at the moment. Both these narrators handle the various accents and 
the changing pace and moods skilfully. So why spend more than 12 hours 
listening to the unabridged version when you can get a good story in four?

Richard, who finds the beach, and the other aimless bratpackers, all born 
after the Vietnam War ended, are in Thailand chasing the Vietnam myth created 
by Hollywood. Richard is either acting out Platoon or he's playing a computer 
game where losers are 'toast'; for the commune, batteries for their Game Boy 
are as essential as rice.

This sustained Vietnam fantasy is missing in the abridged version and, 
consequently, so too is the irony which gives the novel its guts. However, the 
abridged version is a fast-paced adventure and, with Richard caught up in a 
Lord of the Flies horror, it is faithful to the novel's strong narrative voice.

The unabridged version gives us the authorial voice as well: this is the 
countdown to doomsday for fragile parts of the globe which find themselves on 
the much-beaten track of 'Spaced Invaders' chasing dope and clutching their 
Lonely Planets.

One audiobook will eat up the miles on the M4; the other will absorb you for 
days and keep you thinking long after.
