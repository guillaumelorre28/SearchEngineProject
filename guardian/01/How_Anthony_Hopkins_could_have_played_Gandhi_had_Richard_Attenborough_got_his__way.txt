In her amusing article on questionably ethnic screen portrayals (Let’s at 
least see the films we denounce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/16/yellowface-pantomime-dames-jimmy-krankie-ab-fab>
, 16 December), Helen Lewis refers to Anthony Hopkins’ casting as Othello in 
the BBC’s 1981 production, which caused something of a furore at the time.

So imagine what might have been the tempest unleashed had Richard Attenborough 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-attenborough> got his way, years 
before Ben Kingsley was even a gleam in his eye, and snared Hopkins to play the 
title role of Gandhi in a long-cherished project. “With careful makeup and by 
losing a little weight, he would be superb as Gandhi,” the late Lord Dickie 
purred publicly in the mid-70s.

Hopkins later revealed to me that when he told his father about this bizarre 
casting notion, the old man replied: “So it’s going to be a comedy, is it then?”
