People always think that my grandfather Jacques or father [oceanographic 
explorer] Jean-Michel were my main influences. But my mother was a great 
influence too. She was an expedition photographer and from when I was about 
nine and living in France she travelled for around three months of the year – I 
used to swing by her office and see her leaning over the light table looking at 
slides from her latest expedition. It was natural to see all these far-flung 
places brought back home.

I’m passionate about the ocean and its conservation. I spent time recently in 
Cancun, Mexico with theMesoamerican Reef Leadership Program 
<http://fmcn.org/mar-leadership/?lang=en>. It’s the second largest reef system 
on the planet and there are scientists working on amazing projects, replanting 
coral and trying to understand its resilience to shifts in ocean activity. It’s 
crucial work – coral is such an important ecosystem in terms of sustaining life.

Cancun is a tourist centre, but get off the beaten track and there are 
wonderful things to explore. I’d recommend theunderwater sculpture park by 
Jason deCaires Taylor <http://www.underwatersculpture.com/projects/mexico/>, 
which snorkellers can see from above, divers from below. It creates miniature 
reef systems for animals to congregate in – a great way of using art as 
conservation.

I was never keen on the idea of diving in caves, I like having an exit above 
me, but thecenotes (the underwater caves) in the Yucatán are magical. Rays of 
light come in from the outside, it’s simply beautiful.

Diving in Cabo Pulmo feels like swimming in an aquarium. This little town in 
the far south of Mexico’s Baja California is basically a community of fisherman 
families who realised they were over-fishing their own backyard and created a 
marine protected area. They fish outside the protected section for commercial 
purposes and inside for what they can feed their family. Over the past decade 
or so they’ve seen it return to its baseline state of health, it’s amazing. And 
tourists come for diving now so the locals’ economic well-being and food source 
are secured.

I have a lifelong connection to the Amazon. I flew down there with my 
grandfather to spend two weeks on his boat, the Calypso, when I was nine. My 
entire family were somewhere in the Amazon – my mother on a land expedition, my 
father and brother on a raft on another river. It really opened my eyes to 
another world. If we can give children an opportunity to experience other 
places and cultures in whatever way they can it profoundly changes who we are 
as adults.

The Amazon tests you on a physical, emotional and mental level. I’ve been 
working on a film and engagement campaign calledTribes on the Edge in the 
Brazilian Amazon <http://tribesontheedge.com/blog/> for years and it will be 
released this year. It will tell the story of the tribes of the Vale do Javari 
indigenous territory. It’s a complex area to work in – 85,000sq km of jungle. 
We’d go for two to three weeks at a time. There’s a romantic notion of what 
such a place is like, but the reality is it’s a very intense place to be.

There’s an incredible duality to tribal life. The people still hunt and fish 
for their food in the way they always have, but sometimes use guns instead of 
blowpipes and have a generator that comes on at 8pm and then house music starts 
pumping at one end of the village. But they are still connected to their 
ecosystem in a way that those of us who walk on concrete have forgotten.

The place I was most surprised by was the southern tip of Chile. I know a lot 
of people dream of going there, but I’m not one for cold climates. But I was in 
awe. The nuances of the change of light on the ice and diving around an iceberg 
that is older than one can imagine puts you in your place as a very small being 
in time and space! It’s good to be humbled by nature like that.

My son is four and until he was two he travelled everywhere with us – Taiwan, 
South Korea, Japan, the Galápagos. Now he’s at nursery; giving him stability is 
important … it’s about balancing the romantic side of what my life is about 
with what a small human needs.
