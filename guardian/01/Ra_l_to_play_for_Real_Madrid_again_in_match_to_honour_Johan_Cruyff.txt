Roberto Carlos, Fernando Hierro, Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Clarence Seedorf 
and Edgar Davids will also feature in the match on 5 June.

Raúl’s last appearance at the Bernabéu was three years ago, when his Qatari 
side al-Saad visited for a friendly and he turned out for both teams.

Raúl’s agent, Ginés Carvajal, told the Spanish newspaper AS that the 
38-year-old’s presence was 95% assured, with commitments in his role as a La 
Liga ambassador in the US unlikely to be a problem.
