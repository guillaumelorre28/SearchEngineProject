Some sort of allegory here: the former headquarters of the National Union of 
Mineworkers <http://www.num.org.uk> in Sheffield is to be turned into a casino.

Apt, maybe, for a place associated with men who took a very big gamble and 
lost it, by going ahead withthe 1984/5 pit strike 
<http://www.agor.org.uk/cwm/themes/events/1984_strike.asp> without a ballot of 
members.

The building did not last long as the NUM's national base in spite of careful 
architectural detailing including its shape which is based on a miner's pick. 
The NUM moved there from London in 1988 but then decamped to the old Yorkshire 
regional office in Barnsley â€“nick-named King Arthur's Castle 
<http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/central-leeds/in_the_court_of_king_arthur_1_2206938>
, as the industry dwindled and the union's membership likewise.

It was never a happy residence either, with endless planning rows which led to 
the main entrance never being completed; a strange gap persisted between the 
pavement in Holly Street and the planned, but unused, front doors.

Sheffield's Labour-led city council <http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/> has 
approved conversion of the building to house a 38,000 sq ft (3,500 sq m) casino 
which will be open round the clock. There will also be two restaurants and a 
rooftop bar. The development ends the city's distinguished claim to be the only 
one of its size in the UK without a central casino.

There were only seven objection to the plan, all raising the possibility of 
late-night noise and anti-social behaviour related to drinking. But Andrew 
Stevens of the developersBrook Leisure <http://www.brookleisure.com> says:

We will respect our neighbours. Casinos tend not to be as noisy as some other 
venues in the city.

The council's planning committee agreed with its officers that renewed life 
for the building would make:

a significant contribution to the appearance of the building and the wider 
area.

Work will begin in the conversion in the spring and Brook Leisure says that 
the project is expected to create about 130 jobs.

PS on a completely different subject: Occupy Leeds are having carols in City 
Square from around 1.30pm today, Tuesday 20 December. Hope to bring you a post 
later but they always welcome visitors of all views. And singers...
