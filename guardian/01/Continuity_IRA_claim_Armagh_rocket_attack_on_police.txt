Republican terrorist group Continuity IRA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/continuity-ira> have claimed responsibility for 
a rocket attack on police in North Armagh in the early hours of Saturday 
morning.

In a briefing given to the Guardian using a recognised code word, a spokesman 
for the Continuity Army Council of the IRA said their operatives had fired a 
rocket propelled grenade at a police patrol on Lake Road, between roundabouts 
one and two of Craigavon, shortly after midnight.

There were no reports of any casualties in the alleged attack.

The attack on the police was close to where the hardline republican group shot 
dead police constableStephen Carroll in March 2009
