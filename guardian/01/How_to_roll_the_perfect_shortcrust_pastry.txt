Can you please tell me the secret to melt-in-the-mouth shortcrust pastry?

Firstly, it is important to have all the ingredients at room temperature. Now 
follow this easy recipe. You'll need: 745g plain flour, 540g salted butter, 65g 
milk powder, and 3 whole eggs made up to 285ml with cold water. Cut the butter 
into small cubes and rub it into the flour and milk powder. It's best done in a 
mixer (a food processor is too aggressive). When the mixture resembles 
breadcrumbs, add the egg and water. Mix, then spread on to a lightly 
flour-dusted surface.

Gather the dough into a ball, wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate the amount you 
need for your recipe for a couple of hours. The remainder will freeze 
beautifully.

When rolling out, remember too much flour toughens the pastry – a light 
dusting is all you need.

Avoid rolling pins with handles – these encourage you to press down at the 
ends, which leads to thin edges and a thick middle. A simple wooden pin has 
always served me well.

Try to judge how much pastry you need for the job. At every stage of rolling 
out, you should be able to lift the pastry off the surface. After rolling and 
shaping, pastry needs to relax before it is cooked – ideally overnight, but for 
at least 3-4 hours.

Lastly, if you're making a tart or quiche, the case should be baked blind with 
baking beans in a moderate oven (180C/350F/gas mark 4) until it starts to 
brown. Remove, cool slightly, then gently lift out the baking paper and beans. 
Brush the inside of the pastry with beaten egg to plug holes, and return to the 
oven until crisp and ready to fill.
