Disgraced tycoon Asil Nadir <https://www.theguardian.com/business/asil-nadir> 
has been ordered to pay back £5m of the money he stole from his Polly Peck 
business empire or face a further six years in jail.

Nadir was jailed for 10 years in August after being found guilty of stealing 
£28.8m from the company and its shareholders.

He later claimed to be penniless after prosecutors demanded that £60m be paid 
in compensation and interest to the administrators.

Polly Peck, a leading stock exchange conglomerate, collapsed in 1990 after 
Nadir stole money and sent it abroad through a complex series of companies.

Justice Holroyde, sitting at the Old Bailey, rejected his claims of poverty 
and said he believed Nadir had money stashed away.

Nadir was given two years to pay the compensation.

The judge also ruled that Turkish airline boss Hamit Cankut Bagana could apply 
for the return of the £250,000 security he paid for Nadir's bail.

Nadir fled from the UK to his native northern Cyprus in 1993 but returned in 
2010 to face trial.

He claimed to have lived on the generosity of his mother and a girlfriend 
while in exile and before he was discharged as a bankrupt.

But the judge said: "It is not true that Mr Nadir received no significant 
income or owned no significant assets since 1993."
