Night-time politics

 * Donald Trump has been elected the next president of America.

 * Malcolm Turnbull was shocked. The US alliance will survive.

 * Bill Shorten was not backing away from calling Trump’s views barking mad. 
I’ll call it as I see it.

That’s it from me. Thanks to my brains trust and to Mike Bowers for his 
images. Check them out.


Good night.

Bill Shorten: US alliance is strong enough for honesty, I call it as I see it

The opposition leader has taken to Facebook with a very strong statement.

Every time the people of the United States choose a new president, it has 
consequences for the world – and for Australia.

The American people have spoken and as always, Australia will respect their 
decision.

Australians should also know our alliance with the United States has grown and 
thrived for seven decades – no matter who’s in charge.

It is far bigger than any individual, far more powerful than any personality – 
and it will endure.

The friendship between our nations is strong enough for honesty.

I will always call it as I see it.

If I see women being disrespected, I’m going to call it out.

If I see people being discriminated against because of the colour of their 
skin or their religion, I’m going to call it out.

As the alternative prime minister of this country, Australians are entitled to 
know where I stand.

Asked about the divisiveness of the US campaign, Malcolm Turnbull quotes an 
unnamed American politician.

He said, “We campaign in poetry, but we govern in prose.” Whether you regard 
the debates in this last American campaign as poetry, the fact is that when an 
administration takes office, and a president takes office, he is confronted 
with the realities of the national interests of the United States, the 
strategic realities that confront the United States.

Asked for lessons from the election of Trump and the Brexit campaign, Turnbull 
says:

We need ensure that everybody in the community, all sectors of the community 
are included. That the strong growth that we have, for example, in Australia 
includes all Australians, that sectors and are not left behind and that when we 
defend our free trade and open markets, we make it very clear why it is in 
Australia’s interests in our country to do so.

Malcolm Turnbull is up again, this time on the 7.30 Report.

He starts with the same points recorded earlier.

Then:

Q: As prime minister could you comfortably deploy Australian troops, risk 
Australian lives, on the judgment ofDonald Trump?

Can I say to you that when Australian troops are deployed, when Australian 
servicemen and women’s lives are put on the line, with their professionalism, 
their heroism,those decisions are taken in the judgment of their government. 
The Australian government. Not any other government.

Thoughts. 

It was clear that about halfway through question time that it was dawning on 
theCoalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> that a 
Trump presidency was a real prospect.Malcolm Turnbull, foreign minister Julie 
Bishop, the front bench didn’t have to say it. It was written all over their 
faces. And their phones.

Barnaby Joyce, being Barnaby, said it anyway. Trump is ahead. Careful what you 
say.

As the afternoon and results wore on, the mood in the Turnbull end of the 
Coalition was dark. The mood in the Abbott end of the Coalition was ebullient.
Cory Bernardi, George Christensen, Eric Abetzand Tony Abbott himself sent out 
messages, statements or tweets. Like so many other issues these days, the US 
election has divided the Coalition.

Turnbull came out immediately after president-elect. The historic nature of 
the US election result was written all over his face. He was clearly trying to 
get the tone right. Turnbull did all the right things. He congratulated Trump - 
he had to. He offered Hillary the government’s best wishes. He thanked 
president Obama for his leadership. He reassured the Australian public on the 
US alliance. He essentially said the alliance would outlive any individuals, 
governments, administrations. But he was clearly rocked.

And if he was horrified by the thought of a Trump presidency, he could not say 
it - no matter how many Australians were wishing it. Greeting isolationism with 
isolationism, greeting pigheadedness with pigheadedness is not in the interests 
of Australia.

Turnbull: politicians will come and go but the US bond will be all G

The prime minister also thanked President Obama for his leadership.

This is a historic moment, it’s been a long campaign, it’s one that 
Australians have witnessed with awe, with consternation, indeed, from time to 
time, but let me reassure all Australians that the ties that bind Australia and 
the United States are profound, they’re strong, they’re based on our enduring 
national interests.

Politicians and governments, congressmen, senators, prime ministers and 
cabinets, will come and go, according to the will of the people of Australia 
and the United States but the bond between our two nations, our shared common 
interests, our shared national interests, are so strong, are so committed that 
we’ll continue to work with our friends in the United States through the Trump 
administration, just as we have through the Obama administration, just as we 
always will.

We have so much in common. Shared values, democracy, the rule of law, 
maintaining the international order upon which our security and prosperity 
depends. So the American people have made a great and momentous choice today. 
We congratulate President-elect Trump and we look forward to working closely as 
ever with his administration as it is formed and when it takes office earlier 
next year.

Turnbull: We have no stronger relationship than with the US

The prime minister reassured Australians that the American-Australian 
relationship is our strongest one.

We have no stronger relationship whether it’s on the battlefield or in 
commerce, than we have with the United States. They’re a great and powerful 
nation, they’re a great and powerful friend. And our relationship with the 
United States is built on millions of Australians and Americans who have been 
working together, fighting together, serving together, for over a century.

We have stood together in so many conflicts. Stood together side by side. 
Americans understand that they have no stronger ally, no better friend, than 
Australia. And the enduring national interests of our two countries as such 
that our relationship will continue to be strong, will continue to work 
together as we have done, with many presidents in years past to chat, to take 
on the challenges of our time.

Whether it is the challenges of global terrorism, whether it’s the challenges 
of ensuring that we maintain the stable of our economic record, whether it’s 
the challenge of ensuring we maintain the stable in our region, which is 
underpinned by the strength of the United States,which has been the foundation 
of the rules-based order in our part of the world that has seen the most 
extraordinary transformation in living standards in human history.

So I have great confidence that all our engagement will continue to be strong 
and intimate.

Malcolm Turnbull: I understand Australians have been confronted by the US 
election

Malcolm Turnbull: 

Let me say that I understand that Australians have been confronted by the 
intensity of the political battle in the United States. President-elect Trump 
himself described it as being at times a nasty campaign, and it was certainly 
by our standards, avery bitter one. You have seen already the way he reached 
out to bring Americans together. And the American people do fight their 
political contests hard. But this great nation of the United States has the 
capacity to come together and it will, behind the leaders, behind the 
president, that they have chosen.

Hillary Clinton has conceded defeat to Donald Trump.

Mike Pence, vice-president elect, is speaking now.

Given we are the Oz blog, we expect Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten to 
comment shortly.

The Donald appears.

Greens leader Richard Di Natale says we need to consider the US alliance under 
Trump

What we’ve seen tonight in the United States presidential election is shocking 
and disappointing.An American president has been elected on a platform of 
racism, xenophobia and nationalism. I expected more from our American cousins. 
They have let us down.

 The following weeks and months will reveal what leaders across the world will 
be wondering tonight: if the American moment is truly over and, if so, what 
will replace it.

But the true strength of democracy comes from all of us respecting the will of 
the people, regardless of the decisions that they make. The darkest moments 
provide us the opportunity to test the strength of our beliefs, and our 
commitment to them. We cannot retreat from democracy out of fear and anger.We 
can, however, turn a sober eye to our alliance and consider whether it 
continues to serve our interests.

We are bound to respect the outcome of a democratic election, but we are not 
bound to any country which does not reflect our values and Liberal-Democratic 
traditions.

Global markets have been severely rattled by tonight’s results. People across 
Australia and the world have been rattled by these results. But now more than 
ever, in light of everything we’ve seen in the United States, we must work to 
defend the values that underpin our great Australian democracy. I am confident 
that we will do just that.

Everyone is out for a frolic. Eric Abetz has helpfully sent out his thoughts.

As was on display with Brexit, the US election result shows that commentators 
andleftwing activists were out of touch with everyday people. While the media 
and commentators fell over themselves to writeDonald Trump off, President-elect 
Trump remained focused on his task.”

President-elect Trump tapped into a widespread disaffection with the 
self-appointed politically correct elites.”

There are many lessons to be learned from both Brexit and the US election on 
which the media and commentariat might like to reflect.”

The ABC election analyst Antony Green has called the US election for Donald 
Trump.

There are the current numbers, 259 for the Republicans, if you give 
Pennsylvania the Republicans, 279 and they can quote that. We think the 
Republicans will win Wisconsin as well. So they’ve got two paths. But 
Associated Press have given Pennsylvania away and they’ve got 97% of the votes 
counted of the precincts counted in Pennsylvania and the Republicans are more 
than 1% ahead.It looks like that’s the state that’s put Donald Trump over the 
quota and into the White House.”

 * Donald Trump has been elected the next president of America.

 * Malcolm Turnbull was shocked. The US alliance will survive.

 * Bill Shorten was not backing away from calling Trump’s views barking mad. 
I’ll call it as I see it.

That’s it from me. Thanks to my brains trust and to Mike Bowers for his 
images. Check them out.


Good night.

The opposition leader has taken to Facebook with a very strong statement.

Every time the people of the United States choose a new president, it has 
consequences for the world – and for Australia.

The American people have spoken and as always, Australia will respect their 
decision.

Australians should also know our alliance with the United States has grown and 
thrived for seven decades – no matter who’s in charge.

It is far bigger than any individual, far more powerful than any personality – 
and it will endure.

The friendship between our nations is strong enough for honesty.

I will always call it as I see it.

If I see women being disrespected, I’m going to call it out.

If I see people being discriminated against because of the colour of their 
skin or their religion, I’m going to call it out.

As the alternative prime minister of this country, Australians are entitled to 
know where I stand.
 
Asked about the divisiveness of the US campaign, Malcolm Turnbull quotes an 
unnamed American politician.

He said, “We campaign in poetry, but we govern in prose.” Whether you regard 
the debates in this last American campaign as poetry, the fact is that when an 
administration takes office, and a president takes office, he is confronted 
with the realities of the national interests of the United States, the 
strategic realities that confront the United States.
 
Asked for lessons from the election of Trump and the Brexit campaign, Turnbull 
says:

We need ensure that everybody in the community, all sectors of the community 
are included. That the strong growth that we have, for example, in Australia 
includes all Australians, that sectors and are not left behind and that when we 
defend our free trade and open markets, we make it very clear why it is in 
Australia’s interests in our country to do so.
 
Malcolm Turnbull is up again, this time on the 7.30 Report.

He starts with the same points recorded earlier.

Then:

Q: As prime minister could you comfortably deploy Australian troops, risk 
Australian lives, on the judgment ofDonald Trump?

Can I say to you that when Australian troops are deployed, when Australian 
servicemen and women’s lives are put on the line, with their professionalism, 
their heroism,those decisions are taken in the judgment of their government. 
The Australian government. Not any other government.
 
Thoughts. 

It was clear that about halfway through question time that it was dawning on 
theCoalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> that a 
Trump presidency was a real prospect.Malcolm Turnbull, foreign minister Julie 
Bishop, the front bench didn’t have to say it. It was written all over their 
faces. And their phones.

Barnaby Joyce, being Barnaby, said it anyway. Trump is ahead. Careful what you 
say.

As the afternoon and results wore on, the mood in the Turnbull end of the 
Coalition was dark. The mood in the Abbott end of the Coalition was ebullient.
Cory Bernardi, George Christensen, Eric Abetzand Tony Abbott himself sent out 
messages, statements or tweets. Like so many other issues these days, the US 
election has divided the Coalition.

Turnbull came out immediately after president-elect. The historic nature of 
the US election result was written all over his face. He was clearly trying to 
get the tone right. Turnbull did all the right things. He congratulated Trump - 
he had to. He offered Hillary the government’s best wishes. He thanked 
president Obama for his leadership. He reassured the Australian public on the 
US alliance. He essentially said the alliance would outlive any individuals, 
governments, administrations. But he was clearly rocked.

And if he was horrified by the thought of a Trump presidency, he could not say 
it - no matter how many Australians were wishing it. Greeting isolationism with 
isolationism, greeting pigheadedness with pigheadedness is not in the interests 
of Australia.
 
The prime minister also thanked President Obama for his leadership.

This is a historic moment, it’s been a long campaign, it’s one that 
Australians have witnessed with awe, with consternation, indeed, from time to 
time, but let me reassure all Australians that the ties that bind Australia and 
the United States are profound, they’re strong, they’re based on our enduring 
national interests.

Politicians and governments, congressmen, senators, prime ministers and 
cabinets, will come and go, according to the will of the people of Australia 
and the United States but the bond between our two nations, our shared common 
interests, our shared national interests, are so strong, are so committed that 
we’ll continue to work with our friends in the United States through the Trump 
administration, just as we have through the Obama administration, just as we 
always will.

We have so much in common. Shared values, democracy, the rule of law, 
maintaining the international order upon which our security and prosperity 
depends. So the American people have made a great and momentous choice today. 
We congratulate President-elect Trump and we look forward to working closely as 
ever with his administration as it is formed and when it takes office earlier 
next year.
 
The prime minister reassured Australians that the American-Australian 
relationship is our strongest one.

We have no stronger relationship whether it’s on the battlefield or in 
commerce, than we have with the United States. They’re a great and powerful 
nation, they’re a great and powerful friend. And our relationship with the 
United States is built on millions of Australians and Americans who have been 
working together, fighting together, serving together, for over a century.

We have stood together in so many conflicts. Stood together side by side. 
Americans understand that they have no stronger ally, no better friend, than 
Australia. And the enduring national interests of our two countries as such 
that our relationship will continue to be strong, will continue to work 
together as we have done, with many presidents in years past to chat, to take 
on the challenges of our time.

Whether it is the challenges of global terrorism, whether it’s the challenges 
of ensuring that we maintain the stable of our economic record, whether it’s 
the challenge of ensuring we maintain the stable in our region, which is 
underpinned by the strength of the United States,which has been the foundation 
of the rules-based order in our part of the world that has seen the most 
extraordinary transformation in living standards in human history.

So I have great confidence that all our engagement will continue to be strong 
and intimate.
 
Malcolm Turnbull: 

Let me say that I understand that Australians have been confronted by the 
intensity of the political battle in the United States. President-elect Trump 
himself described it as being at times a nasty campaign, and it was certainly 
by our standards, avery bitter one. You have seen already the way he reached 
out to bring Americans together. And the American people do fight their 
political contests hard. But this great nation of the United States has the 
capacity to come together and it will, behind the leaders, behind the 
president, that they have chosen.
 
Malcolm Turnbull is making a short statement about the Trump victory shortly. 
He will take no questions.

Mike Pence, vice-president elect, is speaking now.

Given we are the Oz blog, we expect Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten to 
comment shortly.

The Donald appears.
 
What we’ve seen tonight in the United States presidential election is shocking 
and disappointing.An American president has been elected on a platform of 
racism, xenophobia and nationalism. I expected more from our American cousins. 
They have let us down.

 The following weeks and months will reveal what leaders across the world will 
be wondering tonight: if the American moment is truly over and, if so, what 
will replace it.

But the true strength of democracy comes from all of us respecting the will of 
the people, regardless of the decisions that they make. The darkest moments 
provide us the opportunity to test the strength of our beliefs, and our 
commitment to them. We cannot retreat from democracy out of fear and anger.We 
can, however, turn a sober eye to our alliance and consider whether it 
continues to serve our interests.

We are bound to respect the outcome of a democratic election, but we are not 
bound to any country which does not reflect our values and Liberal-Democratic 
traditions.

Global markets have been severely rattled by tonight’s results. People across 
Australia and the world have been rattled by these results. But now more than 
ever, in light of everything we’ve seen in the United States, we must work to 
defend the values that underpin our great Australian democracy. I am confident 
that we will do just that.
 
Everyone is out for a frolic. Eric Abetz has helpfully sent out his thoughts.

As was on display with Brexit, the US election result shows that commentators 
andleftwing activists were out of touch with everyday people. While the media 
and commentators fell over themselves to writeDonald Trump off, President-elect 
Trump remained focused on his task.”

President-elect Trump tapped into a widespread disaffection with the 
self-appointed politically correct elites.”

There are many lessons to be learned from both Brexit and the US election on 
which the media and commentariat might like to reflect.”
 
The ABC election analyst Antony Green has called the US election for Donald 
Trump.

There are the current numbers, 259 for the Republicans, if you give 
Pennsylvania the Republicans, 279 and they can quote that. We think the 
Republicans will win Wisconsin as well. So they’ve got two paths. But 
Associated Press have given Pennsylvania away and they’ve got 97% of the votes 
counted of the precincts counted in Pennsylvania and the Republicans are more 
than 1% ahead.It looks like that’s the state that’s put Donald Trump over the 
quota and into the White House.”
