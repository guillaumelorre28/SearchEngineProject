The most influential album in the wake of Sgt Pepper was the Who's Tommy, the 
fulfilment of the rock opera ideaPete Townshend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/petetownshend> had been banging on about 
since 1966. In keeping with previous Who albums, Tommy featured some crackling 
electric powerpop (Pinball Wizard, I'm Free), and a few comedy moments for 
Keith Moon and John Entwistle to let fly (Tommy's Holiday Camp, Fiddle About), 
but was stretched to double album length to accommodate the album's overriding 
concept (deaf, dumb and blind kid finds deliverance in amusement arcades). As a 
pop record it is patchy; as an opera it is badly executed. But it wasn't 
received that way in a world hungry to move forward.

Eighteen months before Tommy was released, the Moody Blues had been asked by 
their label, Deram, to record an album to showcase the company's latest studio 
equipment. Days of Future Past was loaded with mellotrons, snatches of poetry 
and minor key whimsy, wrapped up neatly as a suite to give it added gravitas. 
It, not Tommy, was the first concept album, but a tad too early â€“ Tommy shouted 
louder and got the critical respect.
