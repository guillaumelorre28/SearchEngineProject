At a barbecue in Melbourne, a man hits someone else's unruly three year old 
son. The incident is so shocking that the party soon breaks up, and within a 
day the child's parents have the man arrested. The novel examines the incident 
through eight different perspectives to build a rich and complex picture of 
Australian suburban life.
The Slap made headlines for its controversial subject matter and for its huge 
popularity – it became an international bestseller, was longlisted for the Man 
Booker prize and won the Commonwealth prize in 2009. Tsiolkas's latest novel, 
Barracuda, is published this month.

It is almost four decades since Armistead Maupin's much-loved Tales of the 
City saga began its life as a newspaper serial in the San Francisco Chronicle. 
In a rare visit to London, Maupin will talk to John Mullan about the very first 
novel in the series. San Francisco, 1976. Mary Ann Singleton, a naïve young 
secretary from Cleveland, Ohio, moves into an apartment on 28 Barbary Lane. 
Through her friendship with a rich cast of characters, including eccentric 
marijuana-growing landlady, Anna Madrigal and quiet young gay man Michael 
Tolliver (known as Mouse), Maupin's sparkling comedy chronicles Mary Ann's 
adventures in 70s San Francisco.
