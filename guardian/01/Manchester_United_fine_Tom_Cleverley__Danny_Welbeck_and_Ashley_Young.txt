 last week. The three players were photographed in Manchester city centre on 
Thursday evening after returning from the 4-2 aggregate defeat to Bayern in the 
quarter-final at the Allianz Arena.

While United had no game for 10 days before Sunday's trip to Everton and the 
manager had given his squad three days off, Cleverley, Welbeck and Young are 
thought to have contravened stipulations that they should not be out late 
within 48 hours of the tie.

The trio's indiscipline follows Moyes having to sanction Chris Smalling for a 
similar indiscretion at the end of last month. The defender was also 
photographed out in Manchester in the early hours apparently singing and 
dancing. It was the player's second transgression since January when he was 
forced to apologise for appearing to dress as a suicide bomber at a privateparty
