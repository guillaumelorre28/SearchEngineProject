Adam Curtis’s newest film, Bitter Lake 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/posts/TRAILER-TRASH>, which arrives on 
iPlayer-only this Sunday at 9pm, traces the threads between America, 
Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia; between finance, oil, drugs and guns. Curtis has 
reviewed the unedited rushes of almost everything ever shot by the BBC in 
Afghanistan – many thousands of hours of news coverage from the country.

The atmosphere is of deep foreboding, and the soundtrack is dark and dingy, 
from ambient stirrings to Bob Dylan’s melancholy Forever Young. But when those 
trademark Curtis shots of dancing kick in, you’re off to the races again. There 
are darkly comic moments too: the Afghan The Thick of It, Carry on Up The 
Khyber, Valerie Singleton grooming afghan hounds on Blue Peter.

Dogs were where Curtis started. They were a regular feature on consumer issues 
groanathonThat’s Life! <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p012tgs2> Curtis worked 
on the show before going on to make serious documentaries such as Inquiry – The 
Great British Housing Disaster, in 1984.

It’s a well-researched indictment of system-built flats – those duff 
prefabricated ones that gave council housing a bad name. But casual viewers 
might be hard pressed to spot the difference between this failed architecture 
and decent modernist blocks by architects such as Berthold Lubetkin, Denys 
Lasdun or Ernő Goldfinger, which stand proud to this day. This was Thatcher’s 
era, when all estates were lumped together as problems, rather than noble 
solutions to Britain’s housing crisis.

Curtis’s breakthrough came in 1992 with Pandora’s Box, his first full series, 
which cast a critical eye over science and game theory. Curtis seems drawn to 
intriguing chancers who have had a disproportionate effect on world events. He 
made a documentary about one-man financial meltdown Nick Leeson titled 25 
Million Pounds.

Then came The Century of the Self in 2002. A fascinating demolition of PR and 
its inventor – Freud’s nephew, Edward Bernays – it explores how we evolved from 
communal society into self-centred consumers, and how politicians play to our 
increasingly gory narcissism. It was followed by2004’s The Power of Nightmares: 
The Rise of the Politics of Fear 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/oct/15/broadcasting.bbc>.

The Rise and Fall of The TV Journalist is one of a number of shorts Curtis 
made for Charlie Brooker’s Screenwipe. Yellow press hacks and their rolling 
news equivalents should be the people explaining the world to us, he argues, 
but instead they just hop from story to story, chucking the context out with 
the bath water.

The filmmaker’s most sublime moment to date comes 18 minutes into 2009’s It 
Felt Like a Kiss, a collaboration with Punchdrunk Theatre. The hairs on your 
neck stand up when you see the sign saying “Saigon” and watch monk Thích Quảng 
Đức self-immolate to a soundtrack of He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss) by the 
Crystals. Shocking song, unpalatable images.

Curtis’s mission is, essentially, to explain a messy world. He exhorts us to 
look backwards, showing how actions have unintended and far-reaching 
consequences – wars or terrorist attacks emerge from specific chains of events 
stretching back decades. Where he really thrives is raiding the TV archives and 
layering music over it to create programmes that are addictive viewing, 
whatever the argument is.

He pulled this trick again in 2011’s All Watched Over By Machines of Loving 
Grace, about how technology grew to dominate us. But there is one film he 
didn’t make. It’s an amusing (and quite sharp) send-up of his stylistic tics by 
Ben Woodhams titled The Loving Trap (a very Curtis-esque title).
