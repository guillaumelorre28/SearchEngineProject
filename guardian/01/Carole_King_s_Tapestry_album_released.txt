Carole King's Tapestry album wasn't just a 25m-selling super-success – it 
ushered in the age of the singer-songwriter. Unembellished intimacy became the 
order of the day, as scores of songwriters invited listeners into their worlds. 
The emphasis was on honesty and imperfection, and the only kit needed was an 
acoustic guitar or piano and a notepad to transform emotional turmoil into 
lyrics. Every poet–with–a-guitar who's ever bared their soul at an open-mic 
night has Tapestry to thank for the inspiration.
