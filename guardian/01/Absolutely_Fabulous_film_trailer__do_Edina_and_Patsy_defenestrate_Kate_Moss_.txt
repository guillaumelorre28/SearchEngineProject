Jennifer Saunders <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jennifer-saunders> 
and Joanna Lumley reprise their roles as the champagne-drinking fashionistas 
for the first time in four years, while the film brings back the sitcom’s other 
co-stars Julia Sawalha and Jane Horrocks.

The trailer also shows off a long list of celebrity cameos, including Jon 
Hamm, Rebel Wilson, Stella McCartney, Gwendoline Christie, Lily Cole and Moss 
herself. Other stars set to make an appearance include Joan Collins, Perez 
Hilton and Jeremy Paxman.

The original TV series was first broadcast in 1992 and continued for five 
seasons, also inspiring a French film called Absolument Fabuleux, starring 
Nathalie Baye and with a cameo from Saunders herself.

Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie has been in development for about five years, 
with Saunders saying she would do the film for no other reason than to have the 
two characters walk the red carpet at the premiere.

The production has already been subject to controversy, when it was announced 
that Krankies comedian Janette Tough would be playing a Japanese man called 
Huki Muki.

“I love AbFab but #YELLOWFACE is something I cannot watch – I just can’t,” 
Korean American comic Margaret Cho tweeted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/17/margaret-cho-twitter-storm-accusing-ab-fab-movie-yellowface-racism>
. “It’s sad when heroes are no longer heroic. Too bad. #racism.”

Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie will be released in UK cinemas on 1 July
