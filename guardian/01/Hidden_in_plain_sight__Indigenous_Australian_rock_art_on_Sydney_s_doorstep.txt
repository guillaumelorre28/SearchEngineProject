A woman on my rock art tour who works in tourism reels off the usual rushed 
itinerary for overseas visitors to Sydney: “They put them in a bus, drive them 
to Bondi and Manly, have a day in the Blue Mountains on the Scenic Railway then 
it’s back in the bus and that’sSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>.”

It’s all a bit wham bam thank you m’am, with scant attention paid to Sydney’s 
rich Indigenous heritage.

Paul Pickering feels the same way. “Where are all the tourists?” he asks as we 
walk down an empty track in the Ku-ring-gai Chase national park, home to around 
1,500 pieces of Aboriginal rock art. It’s the largest concentrationof 
Indigenous sites in Australia, 
<http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkAboriginalHeritage.aspx?id=N0019>
 eclipsing Kakadu which has around 5,000 sites but over a much greater land 
mass, says Pickering.

After leaving his job in the finance industry last year, Pickering started 
Sydney Out Back <http://www.sydneyoutback.com.au/>which runs Indigenous rock 
art tours in the national park that borders Sydney’s northern suburbs and in 
the adjacent Hawkesbury river. He’s passionate about the national park and 
believes it’s underappreciated.

“I’ve met some people who live in Curl Curl [on the nearby northern beaches] 
who haven’t even been here,” he says.

Sydney is spoilt for national parks. Within an hour of the city limits sits 
the Royal national park to the south and the Blue Mountains to the west, and 45 
minutes from the city lies the 14,977 hectare Ku-ring-gai Chase national park.

“What we are seeing today is a time capsule from pre-European times,” says 
Pickering near the park entrance. We walk a few metres to a picturesque 
clearing that reveals a sandstone rockface, thick bushland and a creek where 
water is flowing fast down rocks due to overnight rain. It’s one of those 
brilliant, sunny winter days, where the smell of the eucalypt is especially 
strong and fresh. The city feels very far away.

Until recent times, the area remained relatively unexplored. It wasn’t until 
the 1960s that roads were built into the park, with the road to Cottage Point 
(where there is a lovely restaurant) not built until 1967.

We are visiting on a Wednesday and come across only five other people – all at 
local beauty spot West Head lookout, with a great view across to Palm Beach 
(and the set of Home and Away), Barrenjoey lighthouse and Lion Island. The 
beach beneath the lookout is also the place of first recorded contact between 
NSW governor Arthur Phillip andIndigenous Australians 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/indigenous-australians>.

Our Indigenous guide, Les McLeod, passes around old logs from the NSW National 
Parks and Wildlife Service. The logs are fascinating, cataloguing all the known 
rock art in the region: what the site is, what it depicts and its level of 
degradation.

The area’s significant Indigenous sites include rock engravings, art sites, 
burial sites, caves or shelters (some with shell deposits), marriage areas, 
men’s areas, women’s areas, birthing areas, midden sites, stone arrangement 
sites and tool manufacturing locations.

But first we have a welcome to country. We are on Guringai land, and McLeod 
has the elders’ permission to hold tours and explain the rock art.

McLeod smears ochre on our faces and hands and we stand in a circle as he 
claps message sticks.

The first rock art he takes us to is carved into the ground on a flat, 
treeless ledge in the park. The engravings here are outlines created on rock 
surfaces by pecking, hammering or scraping. Their exact age isn’t known but 
Pickering estimates they’re between 5,000 and 7,000 years old.

We have to bush-bash to get in there, and a small sign is the only hint of 
what lies off the track. McLeod squirts water over the rocks and an enormous 
engraving – metres long – of a serpent appears.

“A lot of Aboriginal people believe they were created from animals – there are 
engravings here of wallabies, fish and emus,” says McLeod. “Sydney sandstone is 
easy to engrave but easy to fade. The Guringai people would have visited a 
couple of times a year to re-engrave it.”

He and Pickering speculate that some of the patterns on the rocks resemble the 
Milky Way and may have been intended as an astrological guide. The site would 
have also been a meeting place for ceremonies and corroborees, says McLeod.

Then it’s on to Akuna Bay. From the (very posh) marina, we sail up the 
Hawkesbury river on a very comfortable charter boat in order to see Indigenous 
rock art that’s visible only from the water.

“Sometimes the best way to see Aboriginal sites is actually in the natural 
environment, as opposed to in a museum or art gallery,” says McLeod as we get 
close to a small cave on the water’s edge where there are ochre hand stencils 
from a group of Guringai men (and from a smaller handprint – a child). The 
stencils would have been a way of letting other members of your clan know that 
this particular cave or ledge is a safe place to stay, McLeod explains.

Further up the river we come across rock paintings of a fish just above the 
water line. This would have been a signal to others that fish could be found at 
this spot, says McLeod.

(As an aside: if you haven’t been the Hawkesbury, get there. It’s one of the 
most magnificent rivers in the world, with bushland running all the way down to 
the water and has a particular quality of silence broken only by the occasional 
lyre bird or kookaburra.)

The part of the Hawkesbury we’re in is fairly remote (and we are the only boat 
in these waters), but McLeod doesn’t want us going much further. There are 
significant Indigenous sites upriver but they have been vandalised with racist 
graffiti.

It’s a jolt back to reality after an afternoon exploring such a pristine 
environment. Nature may wear away at the rock art, but it’s human beings who 
pose the biggest threat.
