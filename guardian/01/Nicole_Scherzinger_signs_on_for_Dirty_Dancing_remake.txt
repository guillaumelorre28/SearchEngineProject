. Scherzinger joins a cast that already includes Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin

working-class dance instructor. Penny is Johnny’s dance partner and part of the 
entertainment staff at the Catskills resort where Baby and her family are 
staying.

Waverly Place. On stage she appeared in Rent at the Hollywood Bowl and 
impressed in the 2014 London revival of Cats where she played Grizabella.

contestant on season 10 of Dancing With the Stars in 2010, a competition she 
won. The network has yet to announce a premiere date for the TV movie.
