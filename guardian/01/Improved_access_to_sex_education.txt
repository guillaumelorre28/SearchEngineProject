Although tradition is often blamed for the stigma surrounding sexual and 
reproductive health in Zanzibar, at the age of 62, Kidawe Mohammed is making 
some of the boldest strides of all. "We started Zacada in 1998 because the 
rights of children were not being acknowledged. The most vulnerable children, 
in particular, were not getting any support. So we teach them who they are and 
how they are going to develop – starting from the age of 10."

The local charity provides Zanzibari children and adolescents between the ages 
of 10 and 24 with education on sexual and reproductive health, using classroom 
sessions and theatre performances. After school and at the weekend, Kidawe and 
her colleagues speak to youth about the risks associated with HIV/Aids and 
early pregnancy, and how to protect themselves. Their office is always open for 
those who want to ask for advice in private – generally, they have five to 10 
visitors a day.
Zacada is well respected within the local community, as the education sessions 
are authorised by the district commission. This allows the organisation to 
speak to youth about family planning – although, to avoid rumours that it is 
promoting sexual activity, they stress abstinence and the importance of being 
faithful. They are driven by the belief that adolescents "have the right to 
visit clinics and access services", says Kidawe. "More youth education is 
needed so that young people know that sexual activity can lead to pregnancy and 
endanger their lives."
