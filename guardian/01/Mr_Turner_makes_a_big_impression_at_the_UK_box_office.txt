The winner

After the five-star critical adulation that greeted Mike Leigh’s new film in 
Cannes, prospects for Mr Turner always looked strong. On the other hand,
Topsy-Turvy <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/80091/topsy-turvy> – the 
director’s other celebration of 19th-century artistic achievement – sits only 
in a modestly respectable fifth place in the Leigh box-office table, behindVera 
Drake <https://www.theguardian.com/film/vera-drake>, Secrets and Lies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/secrets-and-lies>, Another Year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135875/another-year> and Happy-Go-Lucky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/happy-go-lucky>. The biggest UK opening for a 
Leigh film came from Happy-Go-Lucky, with £385,000 from 77 cinemas.

It’s fair to say that Mr Turner <https://www.theguardian.com/film/mr-turner> 
opened above and beyond industry expectations, with £905,000 from 129 cinemas, 
including £24,400 in previews. That delivered a site average of £7,015, by far 
the biggest of any film in the market. Top site was the Curzon Chelsea, with an 
impressive £19,900, and top cinema from a multiplex chain Odeon Richmond. 
Outside the capital, top site was Cambridge Picturehouse, and top regional 
multiplex Guildford Odeon.

Distributor eOne reported that the film did exceptionally well in London, as 
you’d expect for a reviews-driven title, but also in the south-east in general, 
with big numbers at plexes in Guildford, Tunbridge Wells and Chichester.

 Cannes 2014: Mr Turner’s Timothy Spall: ‘I like to paint angels in anguish’ 
At 150 minutes, the epic length of the film posed a challenge to programmers 
trying to offer customers a choice of two evening showtimes, and there was 
evidence of straddling across two screens, alternating with a shorter film. 
After the Friday numbers came in, some cinemas promoted Mr Turner to screens 
with bigger seating capacity.

The film is playing an even balance of arthouses and multiplexes, with the 
former scoring particularly well on Friday. Growth on Saturday came more in the 
plexes, perhaps as a result of bigger screen allocations or tinkering with 
showtimes. Across the weekend, Picturehouse claimed top share, with 18% of Mr 
Turner’s box-office.

Due to its limited screen count, Mr Turner had to content itself with seventh 
place in the weekend chart. However, partly thanks to family films and horror 
pictures fading on Monday, Mr Turner found itself surging to become the 
top-grossing title on that day, auguring well for continued success. The film 
expands to about 250 cinemas from its second weekend, by far the widest play 
for a Leigh title. The director’s biggest ever hit, Vera Drake, enjoyed an 
exceptionally sustained run, eventually reaching £2.38m. It’s now a question of 
when, not if, Mr Turner exceeds that figure.

 Why you might like to watch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles this week - video 
review 
For the first time since January, six films managed £1m in weekend takings at 
the UK box office, spreading the wealth evenly. The frame coincided with the 
end of half-term, fuelling strong results for family fare Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles (returning to the top spot thanks to a modest 26% drop), The Book of 
Life (up 8%) andAlexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alexander-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day>
 (down 9%), although the latter title is not one of the six £1m weekend movies. 
Halloween on Friday propelled Ouija to a nifty £1.37m opening, and sustained 
the likes of Annabelle and The Babadook (down just 15%) lower down the chart. 
Universal will be happy to see Ouija deliver the second-biggest horror opening 
of the year, behind Annabelle (£1.94m).

The current chart is one of the tightest of recent weeks, if not the whole 
year. The top film grossed just 3.12 times the 10th-placed title. In October, 
there were charts in which the top title variously grossed 17, 16.5 and 10.5 
times the film in 10th place. In summer blockbuster season, the disparity can 
be even more pronounced:The Inbetweeners 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-inbetweeners-2> opened at the top with a 
gross 72 times the 10th-placed film that weekend.

with anything’ - video interview 
Sixth-placed Nightcrawler <https://www.theguardian.com/film/nightcrawler> 
crept past the £1m weekend tally thanks to £59,000 in previews. The 
well-reviewed title ranked third place on Monday, behind Mr Turner and Fury. 
With a reported production budget of only $8.5m, this was potentially an 
attractively priced acquisition for UK distributor eOne, especially if 
word-of-mouth sustains.

Gone Girl picked up another £1.06m at the weekend, and £2.27m over the seven 
days. Its £19.33m cume puts it within sniffing distance ofSeven 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,558621,00.html>
 (£19.52m) in the all-time 18-certificate chart. Once it has overtake Seven, it 
will start bearing in on the top three 18-cert titles:The Wolf of Wall Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/16/wolf-of-wall-street-review> 
(£22.70m),Hannibal <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/16/1> (£21.58m) 
andAmerican Beauty <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jan/28/4> (£21.39m). 
Of course, both Wolf and Gone Girl benefit from significantly higher ticket 
prices than those earlier films.

 The film team review Horns 
Hoping to catch some Halloween updraft, Horns, starring Daniel Radcliffe, 
landed rather weakly in 11th place, with £396,000 from 379 cinemas, including 
£95,000 in previews. Going just by weekend numbers, that’s roughly comparable 
with Radcliffe’s last film, romcomWhat If 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/21/what-if-review-daniel-radcliffe>, 
which began with £336,000 plus £257,000 in previews. Radcliffe enjoyed a huge 
hit withThe Woman in Black 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/09/the-woman-in-black-film-review>, 
but has subsequently proved less commercially surefooted. Risk-averse studios 
will be pondering the degree to which Radcliffe ticks the “guys want to be him, 
women want to be with him” boxes, usually accepted as prerequisites for A-list 
stardom among male film actors.

Shia LaBeouf <https://www.theguardian.com/film/shia-labeouf> in Charlie 
Countryman proved a virtual wipeout, with £12,100 from 103 sites, and a £118 
average. The film premiered at the Sundance film festival in January 2013, 
going on to limited US release last November. It was always going to be a 
challenge to generate excitement for this film in cinemas.

 Matthew McConaughey and the cast of Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar: ‘Mother 
nature’s going to be just fine, it’s us that might not be’ - video interview 
Despite those six films picking up at least £1m at the weekend, the absence of 
any really big hit saw box-office come in at 39% below the equivalent weekend 
in 2013, whenThor: The Dark World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/03/thor-the-dark-world-review> 
exploded at the top of the chart with £8.67m. In truth, the market was to some 
degree simply drawing breath, since Christopher Nolan’sInterstellar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/interstellar> arrives on Friday – surely set 
to restore grosses to year-ago levels. Alternatives to the space-travel sci-fi 
include Keira Knightley inSay When 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2034031/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_3>; Pierce Brosnan in 
November Man <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-november-man>; Kristen Wiig 
inThe Skeleton Twins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/20/kristen-wiig-skeleton-twins-edinburgh-2014-review>
; and Elijah Wood in Set Fire to the Stars. Which of those four can 
successfully carve out a counter-programming niche will be interesting to watch.
