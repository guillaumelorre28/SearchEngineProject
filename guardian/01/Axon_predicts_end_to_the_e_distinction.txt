The distinction between traditional and e-business will more or less disappear 
in about 18 months, the chief exexecutive officer of technology consultancyAxon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/axongroup> Group predicted yesterday.

Mark Hunter said most companies would integrate the internet into their 
businesses, providing opportunties for consultancies such as Axon.

Mr Hunter was speaking as he attributed rising turnover and profits to an 
increase in e-business projects.

Axon has won significant contracts to build internet portals for organisations 
including WH Smith, Miller Freeman and Electrocomponents.

Profit before tax was up 66% to £2.8m and net income rose to £1.91m from 
£1.13m for the same period last year. Turnover was up 47% and prospects looked 
good.

The main business of the Surrey-based company is still installing management 
software developed by SAP of Germany. This division had also performed strongly.

Mr Hunter said that although the market generally experienced a slow start 
because of the Y2K hangover, the group showed strong growth for the period.

Over the last 18 months Axon has become more involved in advising companies on 
their technological requirements for e-commerce.

"The business that relates to e-business has grown very quickly this year," a 
spokesman said.

Axon's new business wins are now primarily generated by e-business. The 
company said that 70% of the business it is winning is e-business and the 
sector counts for 40% of total business.

With business growing Axon wanted to acquire a British media company, but has 
struggled to find something suitable.

The company has recruited about 120 consultants this year. 

Axon shares yesterday closed at £11.10, down 47.5p. They have almost doubled 
this year, valuing the company at £570m.
