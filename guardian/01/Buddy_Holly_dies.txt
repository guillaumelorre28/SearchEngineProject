Buddy Holly <https://www.theguardian.com/music/buddy-holly> was very important 
to Britain; he was almost single-handedly responsible for the sound and look of 
the Mersey groups. He was a new kind of hero, and he packed an indecent amount 
into his 22 years. For a start, he didn't look like a pop star, lacking the 
Hollywood gloss or weirdness of his contemporaries. In spite of this, he was 
defiant and narcissistic – he wanted the world and, pretty much, he got it. His 
group, the Crickets, was entirely self-contained; the vim of the three-piece on 
That'll Be the Day, Oh Boy, Rave On and Maybe Baby encouraged shy, bespectacled 
UK kids to dream of their own DIY pop. He was starting to move into an 
orchestrated sound and had already mastered the mixing desk when he died in a 
plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa. That death – he was the first big rock star 
to die young – came to be a symbol of unfulfilled promise, remembered as "the 
day the music died" thanks to Don McLean's American Pie. And the widespread 
grief over the plane wreck in the snow finds its echo every time another 
generation loses one of its musical heroes.
