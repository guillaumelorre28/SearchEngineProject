For the first time in a long time it feels as if England’s men have as good a 
chance of making the final of the World T20 as the women. Both matches take 
place on the same pitch and the same day in Kolkata: 3 April. Few scoff at the 
World T20 now. It is the one ICC tournament where the format seldom changes – 
because it works fine. The tournament is short, sharp and entertaining and it 
is just possible to remember who has won. There have been five different 
winners: chronologically they are India, Pakistan, England, West Indies and Sri 
Lanka. England have been hopeless in four tournaments andunexpectedly brilliant 
in one 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/16/england-australia-world-twenty20-final>
. Now England have some dangerous cricketers in this format. We know about Jos 
Buttler but keep an eye on Billings as well. He’s never afraid to go for it.Vic

Football: Jamie Vardy, Leicester City

When Leicester City’s supporters started chanting “Jamie Vardy, he’s scored 
more than you” duringChelsea’s final match under José Mourinho 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/14/leicester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report>
 they were only slightly exaggerating. Vardy has scored 15 times, only two 
fewer than Chelsea’s total when Mourinho was sacked, and if he continues this 
momentum into the new year Roy Hodgson will surely be emboldened to make him 
the principal point of England’s attack. Hodgson’s loyalty to Wayne Rooney 
seems unwavering but if the England manager insists on keeping a fading player 
in the team it surely has to be in the No10 role behind Vardy. Leicester’s 
striker is a much greater threat to opposition defences and, though his club 
will find the suggestion galling, nobody should be surprised if substantial 
bids are lodged for him in 2016.Daniel Taylor

Rugby union: Ardie Savea, New Zealand

This is a big year for wannabe No7s. New Zealand, typically, have a ready-made 
replacement for Richie McCaw in the shape of Sam Cane but also lurking in the 
queue is Savea, the younger brother of the All Blacks’ prolific winger Julian. 
The 22-year-old flanker has already been compared to a young Michael Jones and 
hassigned up to represent New Zealand at sevens this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/19/sonny-bill-williams-signs-on-for-nz-sevens>
 alongside Sonny Bill Williams. While it will rule him out of immediate 
15-a-side international contention, the hunt for an Olympic medal in Rio is set 
to boost his profile further. England are also searching for new, influential 
open-side flankers; among the jostling contenders keep an eye out for Jack 
Clifford of Harlequins. The 22-year-old could be involved sooner rather than 
later.Robert Kitson

Athletics: Adam Gemili, GB

It was a bittersweet 2015 for Gemili, who in June became the only British 
athlete to go under 10 seconds for the 100m when he ran 9.97sec in Birmingham … 
andin the next step ruptured a hamstring 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/07/adam-gemili-diamond-league-dina-asher-smith>
 which meant he missed the rest of the season. Gemili’s injury coincided with 
the 20-year-old Zharnel Hughes switching his allegiance from Anguilla to 
Britain – and while Hughes finished fifth in the 200m at the world championships
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/27/usain-bolt-wins-justin-gatlin-200m-world>
, Gemili was temporarily forgotten about. But given Gemili’s form before his 
injury, and the lightning fast track in Beijing, it is not unreasonable to 
assume the 22-year-old would have smashed his PB of 19.98 (which was set into a 
-1.6 m/s headwind in Zurich in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/15/adam-adam-gemili-gold-european-athletics-championships-2014>
) and possibly even ran the 19.86 needed to take the bronze medal behind Bolt 
and Gatlin. Don’t be surprised if he makes up for lost time in Rio.Sean Ingle

Tennis: Johanna Konta, GB

We were already watching Konta in the second half of the 2015 summer and she 
is worth keeping an eye on again in 2016. The new British No1 has very few 
points to defend in the first half of the season and could climb steadily into 
the world’s top 20 if she can reproduce the form that won her 21 of 23 matches 
after her first-round loss to Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon. That could secure 
her seeding in the majors, a significant advantage in the first week. Konta is 
24 and looks to have shed the self-doubt and nerves that once hindered her 
development. She is a contented and intelligent athlete who seems finally to 
have found her level. Shereached the last 16 at the US Open last September 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/08/johanna-conta-us-open-fourth-round-petra-kvitova-dream-come-true>
 and looked as if she belonged there; she may go one win further either there 
or at this month’s Australian Open.Kevin Mitchell

Golf: Maverick McNealy, US

McNealy may not even pursue a career in professional golf. Quite what he 
chooses upon graduation from Stanford University will prove fascinating in 
itself. He is the son of arenowned technology multi-millionaire 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy> and one of the finest, if not the 
finest, young amateurs in the United States. He therefore has a decision to 
make: whether to step into the business world of his father, Scott, and use his 
widely-hailed management and science skills to begin his own firm or take what 
is probably a no-lose gamble on the professional golf circuit. Publicly, 
McNealy has spoken of commerce over golf as a preference but plenty of people 
will try to pull him the other way. In 2016, further tests of his amateur 
prowess will be worthy of scrutiny. These will prove a key 12 months.Ewan Murray

Cycling: Adam and Simon Yates, GB

The Yates twins are inseparable in looks, ability and potential. The Bury duo 
continued their meteoric rise in 2015: top-six rides in major stage races such 
as the Dauphiné, Tour of the Basque Country and Tour de Romandie for Simon;a 
victory in the Clásica San Sebastián for Adam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/01/great-britain-adam-yates-clasica-san-sebastian>
. Between them, if they keep improving as fast as in their first two 
professional seasons, 2016 could well see another breakthrough with victory for 
either one in a week-long stage race such as Paris-Nice or a stage at the Tour 
de France. It’s hard to believe but Adam and Simon are still only 23 and with 
their bravado, climbing ability and tactical nous it is hard to know quite 
where the limit is for either of them.William Fotheringham

Rugby league: Stevie Ward, Leeds

With Leeds Rhinos’ holy trinity of Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock and Kylie 
Leuluainow retired from the sport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/11/leeds-wigan-super-league-grand-final-match-report>
, all eyes will be on how the Super League champions replace them in 2016. The 
young forward Ward will not be a like-for-like replacement for Sinfield at 
half-back but he has taken on the No13 shirt made famous by Sinfield throughout 
his illustrious career. Ward’s season was cut short by injury last year but a 
full recovery for the early part of next season is expected – and he has all 
the credentials to make the step up to international level with England if he 
fulfils the potential he showed on occasions last year.Aaron Bower

Formula One: Jolyon Palmer, GB

It would be easy to plump for Max Verstappen, who so thrilled us in 2015. But 
the driver I’m most looking forward to seeing is new, and British, and he’s 
Palmer,who will be lining up with Pastor Maldonado for Renault-Lotus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/23/jolyon-palmer-f1-seat-lotus-2016>
. Son of the former Formula One driver Jonathan, Jolyon has replaced Romain 
Grosjean, who quit the team to join Haas. He is a real talent; he won the GP2 
title in 2014, the first British driver to do so since Lewis Hamilton in 2006. 
The popular Palmer is already well known having been a regular practice driver 
with last year’s Lotus team.Paul Weaver

Boxing: Callum Smith and Khalid Yafai, GB

This time four years ago, there were three British boxers who claimed versions 
of world titles: Ricky Burns, Nathan Cleverly and Amir Khan. None of those 
fighters has a world belt now but there are 12 others with titles approved by 
one or more of the four main sanctioning bodies, an extraordinary rise.Tyson 
Fury stands tallest at heavyweight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/28/tyson-fury-shocks-wladimir-klitschko-world-heavyweight-title-champion>
 and his rematch with Wladimir Klitschko could be a highlight of 2016. Outside 
the obvious, however – including Khan v Kell Brook and Scott Quigg v Carl 
Frampton – there are many fine contenders lurking in the pack, chief among them 
two former star amateurs, the Liverpool super-middle Smith and the Birmingham
