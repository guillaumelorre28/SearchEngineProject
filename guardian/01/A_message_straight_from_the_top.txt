You don't necessarily need a sympathetic personality to lead a leading 
American sub-prime mortgage lender, as Countrywide Financial's boss, Angelo 
Mozilo, has demonstrated plentifully. But it would be helpful to have a firm 
grasp on how to use email.

Mozilo decided it was "disgusting" when a struggling homeowner had the 
audacity to appeal to him about difficulties in repaying one of Countrywide's 
sub-prime homeloans. Unfortunately, the millionaire Californian tycoon 
disseminated this view rather too liberally last week.

Mozilo's senior moment came when a customer, Daniel Bailey, emailed him to ask 
for help in hanging on to his home of 16 years, a modest "shotgun" bungalow.

The homeowner explained that he had misunderstood the terms of his mortgage: 
"I was told that after the first year of payments, I would be able to refinance 
to a better fixed rate - then the bottom fell out of the industry."
Mozilo had heard it all before. In a message intended for a colleague, the 
California-based lending tycoon wrote: "This is unbelievable. Most of these 
letters now have the same wording. Obviously they are being counselled by some 
other person or by the internet. Disgusting."

Unfortunately, Mozilo pressed "reply" instead of "forward" and his 
short-tempered opinion bounced back to Bailey, who swiftly posted it on an
online discussion board

.

Countrywide subsequently issued an apologetic statement: "Countrywide and Mr. 
Mozilo regret any misunderstanding caused by his inadvertent response to an 
e-mail by Mr. Bailey. Countrywide is actively working to help borrowers, like 
Mr. Bailey, keep their homes."

But it won't help Mozilo's public image. The man, whose orange perma-tan has

$2m? $12m?

How nice it must be to earn such big bucks that you don't need to keep track 
of your personal finances. That appears to be the pleasing position of 
America's top energy executives.

Up before a congressional committee this week, senior figures from five 
leading oil companies were asked how much they earn. Several of them didn't 
know.

"I know it's a matter of public record. I do not know the exact amount," said 
John Lowe, executive vice-president of ConocoPhillips.
Peter Robertson, vice chairman of Chevron, suffered a similar outbreak of 
amnesia and the venerable senators weren't universally impressed.

"Mr Lowe, I wish that I made enough money that I didn't have to know how much 
I made," said Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont. "Do you suppose you might 
be able to find out how much you make and let us know?"
The other oilmen at least had a stab at recalling their income. BP America's 
boss, Robert Malone, was able to remember that he made "in excess of $2m" while 
Shell's chairman, John Hofmeister, was slightly more precise with his "about 
$2.2m". Exxon Mobil's vice chairman, Stephen Simon, owned up to taking home 
$12.5m.
For the record, a rank-and-file senator gets a relatively paltry annual salary 
of $169.300.

Super-sized

Some good news: times can't be all that terrible on Wall Street if traders can 
afford to spend $175 (£89) on a burger.

The Wall Street Burger Shoppe has raised the price of its top-of-the-range 
sandwich by $25 from $150. The gourmet bite contains black truffles, foie gras 
and Gruyere cheese and, in a neat touch, it's topped with flakes of gold.
"Wall Street has good days and bad days," says the restaurant's co-owner, 
Heather Tierney, who suggests that this is a burger for those who have had "a 
really good day".

Apparently she sells 20 to 25 of the things a month. The price even beats 
Selfridges' rather decadent £85 sandwich

London department store's menu in 2006.
