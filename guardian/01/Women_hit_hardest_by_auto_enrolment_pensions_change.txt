Thousands of women working part-time will not be put into their workplace 
pension under the auto-enrolment scheme when the earnings limit rises next 
month.

Workers are being gradually enrolled into pension schemes since auto-enrolment 
was introduced in October 2012 in a bid to tackle growing concerns about a 
poverty crisis among people in old age.

However, the earnings threshold for workers who qualify rises to £10,000 from 
£9,440 in April, meaning that 170,000 fewer people will be placed into their 
employer's scheme. The vast majority of those – 120,000 – are women, according 
to calculations from Scottish Widows.

Jackie Leiper, director of employer relationships at Scottish Widows, says: 
"The rise in the threshold will have a disproportionate impact on women, as 
they are more likely to work part-time than men.

"As well as greater access to information and education, some simple 
structural changes, such as widening the scope for paying into a pension 
outside of paid employment and allowing couples to plan for retirement together 
would give women more flexibility in building up their own pension savings."

Employees can opt out of the scheme, and the government estimated that about 
30% of those eligible might choose to do so.

Under automatic enrolment, a portion of an employee's pay packet is diverted 
to a savings pot for their pension, assuming they are aged 22 and above and 
qualify. For each £100 a worker pays in, the government adds £25 and their 
employer adds £75. So, for a £100 personal investment £200 is paid into a 
pension, doubling your money.
