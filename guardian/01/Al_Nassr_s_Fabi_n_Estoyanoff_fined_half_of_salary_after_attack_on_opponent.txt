The former Uruguay international Fabián Estoyanoff has been fined half of his 
salary by Saudi club Al-Nassr after attacking the South Korean Nam Tae-hee 
following their 3-1 home defeat in the AFC Champions League on Tuesday.

The loss to Qatari champions Lekhwiya meant the Saudis missed out on the 
knockout stages of the continental tournament. Estoyanoff could be seen chasing 
after attacking playmaker Nam, who scored the second and won a penalty for the 
third goal, down the tunnel.

The South American grabbed Nam from behind and threw a number of punches 
before being dragged away. The South Korean appeared stunned and held his face 
after the incident.

“50% will be deducted from Fabián Estoyanoff’s salary until the end of the 
season due to assaulting a player from the guest team,” Al-Nassr posted on 
Twitter.

“Such behavior shall never be tolerated. It doesn’t represent the good moral & 
sportsmanship of #ALNASSR players, staff, or fans.”

Estoyanoff, 32, could also face further sanctions from the Asian Football 
Confederation for the incident, which was captured on television.
