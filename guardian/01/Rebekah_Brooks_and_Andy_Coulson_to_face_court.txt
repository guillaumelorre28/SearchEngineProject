Former News International chief executuve Rebekah Brooks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/rebekahwade> and ex-No 10 communications 
director Andy Coulson are due to appear in court to face charges linked to the 
investigation into phone hacking.

The pair are due at the Old Bailey in London on Wednesday with five other 
journalists from the now-defunct tabloid the News of the World, as well as 
private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.

Ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, former news editor Greg Miskiw, former head 
of news Ian Edmondson, ex-chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter 
James Weatherup are also facing charges.

The seven former NotW staff face one general accusation of conspiracy to 
access voicemails that prosecutors say could affect up to 600 victims, along 
with other charges related to specific people.

Mulcaire is accused of four counts related to particular individuals. 

Brooks, 44, from Churchill, Oxfordshire, is also due to appear with husband 
Charlie, 49, and five other people accused of perverting the course of justice.

The charges relate to an alleged attempt to conceal material from police 
investigating claims of phone hacking and corrupt payments to public officials 
at the Sun and the News of the World.

Brooks's former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, head of security at News 
International Mark Hanna, Brooks's chauffeur Paul Edwards and security staff 
Daryl Jorsling and Lee Sandell are also due to appear.
