A South Armagh <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/armagh> village was sealed off 
today after a suspect device was abandoned.

Up to 60 houses were evacuated in the Newry Street and Commons area of 
Newtownhamilton, near the border with the Irish Republic. Families were moved 
to Newtownhamilton high school.

Army technical officers went to the scene after the device was left in an 
abandoned car at about 2am. Dominic Bradley, an SDLP assembly member for the 
region, said there were similarities to bombs left by dissident republicans 
that exploded in Newry in February and close to MI5'sNorthern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> headquarters in Holywood, 
County Down, yesterday.

"It seems as if this incident has a similar modus operandi to that used at 
Newry courthouse and Palace Barracks, in that a suspect vehicle has been left 
at the gates of the police station," he said. "Newtownhamilton is quite a 
large, heavily fortified station. If it were to explode it would do negligible 
harm to the actual police station but would be more harmful for other buildings 
nearby."

There is confusion over which dissident republican group was behind 
yesterday's bomb attack on the MI5 base

Last night the Real IRA issued a second statement denying involvement.

Another organisation opposed to the peace process, Óglaigh na hÉireann, is now 
being blamed for the blast. ONH contains a number of ex-IRA members who were 
bomb makers for the Provisionals during the Troubles. The terror group was 
behind the car bomb that seriously injured PSNI constable Peadar Heffron at the 
start of this year.
