More than two decades since the first, gut-crunching Terminator movie, James 
Cameron andArnold Schwarzenegger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/arnold-schwarzenegger> have collaborated 
again on a campaign encouraging people to cut down on the amount of meat they 
eat.

Spearheaded by WildAid, the drive has American and Chinese audiences in its 
crosshairs, and endorses efforts by the latter government to reduce the 
population’s meat consumption by 50%.

“You have to respect that,” says Cameron in backstage footage from the shoot 
<http://wildaid.org/news/james-cameron-arnold-schwarzenegger-speak-out-reduced-meat-consumption>
. “That’s a leadership position.” The director, whose off-screen ecological 
activism has been detected in the plots of films such as Avatar, said he’d been 
stirred into action after clocking his own hypocrisy.

“How can I call myself an environmentalist when I’m contributing to 
environmental degradation by what I eat?”

Speaking alongside Cameron, Schwarzenegger reports health benefits of cutting 
down his meat and dairy intake on the advice of doctors. “I’m slowly getting 
off meat,” he says, “and I tell you: I feel fantastic.”

The video, which is part of a wider strategy including billboards and online 
pledges, features Schwarzenegger staggering through a ravaged landscape 
presumably destroyed in part by the carbon emissions of the livestock industry.

“Less meat, less heat, more life,” concludes the actor in the film, who also 
states that the notion meat is needed for muscle strength is incorrect.

The campaign makes curious contrast with a video released earlier this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/21/matt-damon-rooney-mara-joaquin-phoenix-campaign-against-dog-slaughter>
, fronted by Matt Damon, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara, lobbying for an end 
to the torture and slaughter of some 10,000 dogs in the far east as part of an 
annual food festival.
