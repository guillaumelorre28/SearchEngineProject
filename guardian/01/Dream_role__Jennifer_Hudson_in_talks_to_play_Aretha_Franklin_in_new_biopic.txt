, the Dreamgirls star is the favourite to play the Grammy-winning soul singer 
and a representative for Hudson has confirmed that conversations have been 
taking place.

The long-gestating biopic, currently called Untitled Aretha Franklin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aretha-franklin> Project, will reportedly 
focus on Franklin’s rise to fame throughout the 1960s and into the 70s and will 
also include her relationship with abusive ex-husband Ted White.

The film comes from producer Scott Bernstein, currently riding high after 
Straight Outta Compton posted a $60.2m opening weekend in the US, and is still 
seeking a director.

Franklin originally stated that she wanted Halle Berry to take on the role but

part of it.”

After winning the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Dreamgirls, 
Jennifer Hudson has appeared in the first Sex and the City movie, The Three 
Stooges and Black Nativity. She will next be seen in Spike Lee’s Chiraq and HBO 
movie Confirmation, alongside Kerry Washington.
