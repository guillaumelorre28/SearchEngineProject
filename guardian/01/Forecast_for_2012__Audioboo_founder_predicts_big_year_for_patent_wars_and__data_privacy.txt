Mark Rock <https://www.theguardian.com/media/mark-rock>, founder and chief 
executive of Audioboo, says the past 12 months highlighted how "marginal" 
traditional media is becoming – and forecasts a big year ahead for data privacy.

• What will 2011 be remembered for? 
2011 was the year of realtime data, which showed us just how marginal mass 
media is increasingly becoming. From the Arab Spring to Wikileaks to News of 
the World to Ryan Giggs, we learnt the true power of networks. And just how 
much traditional institutions are ill equipped to handle them.

Apple and Android cemented their understanding and dominance of the mobile 
space. Nokia and RIM both seemed to partake in the same game of Russian 
roulette (every chamber was loaded) and Microsoft quite cleverly lurked on the 
sidelines.

• What was your best and worst moment?
Best - 15 metres down in the Red Sea. Motionless. You can't beat the utter 
calmness of neutral buoyancy.

Worst - probably the scary grin on the doctors face as he reached to reset my 
shoulder after a bike crash, muttering "this won't hurt at all".

• What's your hot tip for 2012?
2012 is going be about patent wars and data privacy. The big issues will be 
about the implications of technology rather than its implementation.
