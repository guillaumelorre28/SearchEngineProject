Laura Wasser’s office, perched high over Los Angeles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles>, has a gold hand grenade for 
a coffee-table centerpiece, according toBloomberg News 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-laura-wasser-hollywood-divorce-lawyer/>
. Clients sit in one of two green leather chairs facing her desk, a box of 
tissues nearby. On the wall hangs a framed canvas print with two words: The End.

Apposite, because clients come here to end their marriages, but for Wasser 
each request is really a beginning, a springboard into a process in which she 
must protect the psyches, secrets, reputations and fortunes of famous people in 
the lottery known as divorce while the media turn the whole thing into a 
carnival.

Wasser, 47, a partner at the law firm Wasser, Cooperman & Mandles, has proved 
so skilled at the game that she is known as Hollywood’s “disso queen”, for 
dissolution of marriage. Her clients are a roll-call of entertainment royalty: 
Johnny Depp, Kim Kardashian, Britney Spears, Ashton Kutcher, Heidi Klum, Stevie 
Wonder.

Those divorce cases were celebrity squalls compared with the storm in whose 
eye Wasser now finds herself, as the official splitter of Brangelina, 
representing Angelina Jolie in herdivorce from Brad Pitt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/20/angelina-jolie-files-for-divorce-brad-pitt>
. An ostensibly private affair that is already playing out in a vortex of 
Google-powered rumor, every detail, real or imagined, devoured in a blink.

“For high-profile cases, Laura tries to keep clients out of the media 
spotlight. Which I agree is the better way to go, especially when there are 
children involved,” said Stacy Phillips, another high-profile divorce lawyer 
who works in the same office tower as Wasser in Century City, bordering Beverly 
Hills.

Maintaining control, not to mention dignity, is a challenge when camera crews, 
craving any tidbit, stampede the lawyers. “The pressure, oh yes, it can be 
annoying. I literally got knocked down in court by the media. Twice,” Phillips 
said.

Wasser will handle the pressure, she predicted. “Laura’s a very fine lawyer. 
Clients like her. Colleagues like her. She’s earned her stripes.” It helps that 
she is stylish and by all accounts funny, blunt and undazzled by star wattage.

Wasser has a particular view about marriage: don’t. Briefly married while a 
law student, she has been divorced more than two decades and remains unmarried, 
preferring long-term live-in boyfriends to husbands.

“I don’t know that human beings were meant to mate for life or be monogamous,” 
she toldInterview magazine 
<http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/laura-wasser/#_>. “But, for me, the 
aspect of marriage that is troubling is that it’s a contract that is governed 
by the state, and I don’t want the state to have control over my personal 
affairs.”

She has two children by different partners (who came after the divorce) and 
has verbal – not written – agreements with them over custody.

Intimate involvement in some of Hollywood’s most fraught divorce cases has 
left Wasser unsentimental about nuptials. “A lot of Hollywood is fantasy and 
when that idea of walking down the aisle in a beautiful dress or suit is so 
lovely, and you’ve got unlimited funds, why wouldn’t you want to do it time and 
time again?” she told theTelegraph in 2013 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/divorce/10385892/Beware-Laura-Wasser-the-queen-of-Hollywood-divorce-lawyers.html>
.

I don’t know that human beings were meant to mate for life or be monogamous
Laura Wasser to Interview magazine 
“They think: ‘So, the first one didn’t work out and the second one didn’t work 
out, but this one really is the one!’ I’m being glib, but if there’s one thing 
I’ve learned, it’s that people love to get married.”

Divorce <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/divorce>, she said, is the 
great equalizer. Rich or poor, everybody has the same concerns, sadness and 
resentments when a marriage ends. “Whether it’s, ‘Who is going to walk the red 
carpet with me at the Oscars?’ or ‘Who is going to go to the office Christmas 
party with me and Xerox their face next to mine?’, the fears are the same. They 
all have the same look on their faces when they first come in.”

Even so, the stakes are higher with Jolie. There are six children, biological 
and adopted. There is wealth thanks to films such asMaleficent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/28/maleficent-review-angelina-jolie-sleeping-beauty-horns-vinegar>
, Tomb Raider, Salt andMr & Mrs Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/sep/21/mr-mrs-smith-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce>
. If the actor were divorcing Ned from accounting there would still be public 
fascination, but after a 12-year romance and two years of marriage, she is 
divorcing the star ofTroy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,1215911,00.html>
,Fight Club <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79278/fight.club> and 
Legends of the Fall. Sex symbols both, their pairing a unity of impossible 
glamour, a sheen not seen since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, now 
sundered.

Within minutes of Jolie, 41, initiating divorce proceedings on Tuesday, citing 
irreconcilable differences, the internet foamed. There were gifs of Pitt’s ex, 
Jennifer Aniston, smirking. Then allegations –vigorously denied 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/22/marion-cotillard-issues-statement-denying-role-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce>
 – that Pitt, 52, had an affair with co-star Marion Cotillard. Thenclaims he 
boozed and smoked too much weed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/21/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-brangelina-divorce-marijuana-use>
 for Jolie’s comfort. And that he was being investigated for child abuse 
following an in-flight tantrum, a claimsince discredited

If Brangelina broke up over marijuana, what could it mean for their divorce?

Wasser must negotiate all this knowing that the celebrity news site TMZ 
<http://www.tmz.com/> seemingly has informants all over LA – in police 
departments, prosecutors’ offices, courthouses, hospitals, domestic staff – a 
web constantly thrumming with gossip, misinformation and genuine facts.

“Most of the high-profile, high-asset cases are resolved quietly through 
alternative dispute resolution, ADR,” said Gloria Allred, a prominent attorney 
who represents many of Bill Cosby’s alleged victims. “Jolie has agreed to joint 
legal custody but she’s asking for sole visitation for him. We don’t know if 
he’s going to dispute that. We don’t know if there’ll be a custody battle.”

If Wasser follows her usual pattern, there will be no battle, at least not in 
court. She may charge a $25,000 retainer (£19,000) and $850 an hour but she is, 
after all, the author of It Doesn’t Have to Be That Way: How to Divorce Without 
Destroying Your Family or Bankrupting Yourself.

She was, quite literally, named after the law: Laura Allison Wasser. An idea 
of her father, Dennis, who founded Wasser, Cooperman & Mandles in 1976.

She impressed teachers at Loyola law school, said Sande Buhai, one of the 
professors. “Laura was exceptionally mature and diligent, one of the best 
students we ever had. She has great communication skills and wonderful empathy. 
I remember she was working on a case that seemed pretty hopeless and she 
refused to give up and managed to get a good settlement for our client who had 
been discriminated against because he was disabled.”

She moved to her father’s firm in 1995 and worked on low-profile cases until 
2001 when she helped Johnnie Cochran, of OJ Simpson fame, represent Stevie 
Wonder in a $30m palimony suit filed by an ex-girlfriend. It opened doors to 
other celebrity clients: Spears (who filed to divorce Kevin Federline), Melanie 
Griffith (Antonio Banderas), Denise Richards (Charlie Sheen), Maria Shriver 
(Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Jolie (Billy Bob Thornton, in 2003).

“There’s a mythology of Laura Wasser in Hollywood,” Brian Grazer, the 
co-founder of Imagine Entertainment, who hired her for his own divorce,told 
Bloomberg News 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-laura-wasser-hollywood-divorce-lawyer/>
. “She has a reputation for being tough. You can call Laura and say, ‘I’m so 
angry, blah blah blah blah,’ but Laura does not operate in that space. She will 
be calm and logical, and she’ll tell you to think about what you’re saying.”

Sound advice. If people followed it there might be a lot fewer divorces. But 
people do not follow it, least of all in Hollywood. For the disso queen, 
despite the wall hanging, there is no end.
