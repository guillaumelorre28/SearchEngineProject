Night time politics

 * Malcolm Turnbull, immigration minister Peter Dutton and justice minister 
Michael Keenan all contradicted their former PM’s statement that there was no 
deal with David Leyonhjelm to trade a sunset clause on the Adler shotgun in 
return for his vote on a migration bill.

 * Tony Abbott then rose and claimed to have been misrepresented by Labor 
questioning, but repeated his assertion there was no deal and that his ban was 
acting on security advice that the Adler shotguns were flooding the country. 
While he aimed the barbs at Labor, it was obviously really aimed at his former 
cabinet colleagues.

 * During Abbott’s statement, Turnbull and four of his senior ministers stayed 
to hear the answer.

 * The day marks a new low for the split in the Coalition MPs from Abbott, 
since he started freelancing on the issue of gun control.

 * His actions will now set him apart from many conservative colleagues such 
as National party MPs who were hoping for a less emotive debate on the Adler, 
not to mention many of his Liberal colleagues, who will not thank him for 
throwing guns on the table in a week when the unions and the CFMEU were 
supposed to be the issue.

 * Also today, we learned that the government through the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and trade knew of plans by former Liberal MP Wyatt Roy in Iraq 
because they were told he was interested in any “meetings” while he was there. 
Dfat told him there was a no travel order on the country but it contradicts a 
statement from Julie Bishop that the government knew nothing of it. 
 * The government’s plebiscite bill passed the lower house but is expected to 
be blocked in the senate by Labor, the Greens, the Xenophons and Derryn Hinch. 
That’s enough for tonight. Here is a string of magnificence from Michael Bowers
to give you a flavour of the day. Thanks toPaul Karp, Gareth Hutchens, Ben 
Doherty and Katharine Murphy for their input. 

See you in two weeks time when parliament resumes on 7 November.

Go well.

So to recap, Labor asked a series of detailed questions of the prime minister, 
immigration minister and justice minister relating to the Adler gun.

In the process of answering, Malcolm Turnbull, Peter Dutton and Michael Keenan 
confirmed that Leyonhjelm was offered a sunset clause on an import ban on Adler 
shotgun in return for supporting a migration bill.

Tony Abbott then rose to make a personal explanation, which is a process that 
allows members to claim they were misrepresented.

Malcolm Turnbull, Kelly O’Dwyer, foreign minister Julie Bishop, treasurer 
Scott Morrison and environment energy minister Josh Frydenberg – who had been 
walking out – stopped to listen to the answer.

Abbott said there was no deal and quotes security advice which said the Adler 
should be banned.

This leaves us at a stalemate. They said-he said.

If you have Sky, it might be worth tuning into Peta Credlin tonight.

The point to make about Abbott’s note is that just because there were security 
grounds for Abbott’s import ban, this does not mean a deal was not done between
Keenan-Duttonand Leyonhjelm. The two factors are not mutually exclusive.

In fact, if there were such strong grounds for stopping the Adler imports, 
then it made no sense to put a sunset clause on it.

Tony Abbott quotes his advisor’s note on security. It said of the Adler 
shotgun:

 * 7,000 Adlers preordered

 * 20,000 Adlers ordered

 * 10,500 Adlers already in the country.

Abbott said had order gone ahead it would have more than doubled the number of 
Adlers.


An old shotgun had been used in the Lindt seige and shut down the city, he 
says.

The advisor’s note relates to the security reasons for keeping the guns off 
the streets.

The note said the Adler would have gone into the same category as an air rifle.

Of course the government shut down the Labor motion below. The government gets 
one more question. Turnbull delivers a firm and fairly defiant answer on his 
economic plan, looking at the opposition but directed at his backbench.

 * Malcolm Turnbull, immigration minister Peter Dutton and justice minister 
Michael Keenan all contradicted their former PM’s statement that there was no 
deal with David Leyonhjelm to trade a sunset clause on the Adler shotgun in 
return for his vote on a migration bill.

 * Tony Abbott then rose and claimed to have been misrepresented by Labor 
questioning, but repeated his assertion there was no deal and that his ban was 
acting on security advice that the Adler shotguns were flooding the country. 
While he aimed the barbs at Labor, it was obviously really aimed at his former 
cabinet colleagues.

 * During Abbott’s statement, Turnbull and four of his senior ministers stayed 
to hear the answer.

 * The day marks a new low for the split in the Coalition MPs from Abbott, 
since he started freelancing on the issue of gun control.

 * His actions will now set him apart from many conservative colleagues such 
as National party MPs who were hoping for a less emotive debate on the Adler, 
not to mention many of his Liberal colleagues, who will not thank him for 
throwing guns on the table in a week when the unions and the CFMEU were 
supposed to be the issue.

 * Also today, we learned that the government through the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and trade knew of plans by former Liberal MP Wyatt Roy in Iraq 
because they were told he was interested in any “meetings” while he was there. 
Dfat told him there was a no travel order on the country but it contradicts a 
statement from Julie Bishop that the government knew nothing of it. 
 * The government’s plebiscite bill passed the lower house but is expected to 
be blocked in the senate by Labor, the Greens, the Xenophons and Derryn Hinch. 
That’s enough for tonight. Here is a string of magnificence from Michael Bowers
to give you a flavour of the day. Thanks toPaul Karp, Gareth Hutchens, Ben 
Doherty and Katharine Murphy for their input. 

See you in two weeks time when parliament resumes on 7 November.

Go well.

So to recap, Labor asked a series of detailed questions of the prime minister, 
immigration minister and justice minister relating to the Adler gun.

In the process of answering, Malcolm Turnbull, Peter Dutton and Michael Keenan 
confirmed that Leyonhjelm was offered a sunset clause on an import ban on Adler 
shotgun in return for supporting a migration bill.

Tony Abbott then rose to make a personal explanation, which is a process that 
allows members to claim they were misrepresented.

Malcolm Turnbull, Kelly O’Dwyer, foreign minister Julie Bishop, treasurer 
Scott Morrison and environment energy minister Josh Frydenberg – who had been 
walking out – stopped to listen to the answer.

Abbott said there was no deal and quotes security advice which said the Adler 
should be banned.

This leaves us at a stalemate. They said-he said.

If you have Sky, it might be worth tuning into Peta Credlin tonight. 
 
The point to make about Abbott’s note is that just because there were security 
grounds for Abbott’s import ban, this does not mean a deal was not done between
Keenan-Duttonand Leyonhjelm. The two factors are not mutually exclusive.

In fact, if there were such strong grounds for stopping the Adler imports, 
then it made no sense to put a sunset clause on it.
 
Tony Abbott quotes his advisor’s note on security. It said of the Adler 
shotgun:

 * 7,000 Adlers preordered

 * 20,000 Adlers ordered

 * 10,500 Adlers already in the country.

Abbott said had order gone ahead it would have more than doubled the number of 
Adlers.


An old shotgun had been used in the Lindt seige and shut down the city, he 
says.

The advisor’s note relates to the security reasons for keeping the guns off 
the streets.

The note said the Adler would have gone into the same category as an air rifle.
 
He says any Leyonhjelm deal for a vote is false.

Essentially calling his former ministers liars. 
 
OMG Tony Abbott is giving a personal explanation.
 
Of course the government shut down the Labor motion below. The government gets 
one more question. Turnbull delivers a firm and fairly defiant answer on his 
economic plan, looking at the opposition but directed at his backbench.
