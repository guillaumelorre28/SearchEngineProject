World Cup qualifiers Ivory Coast secured their place in the quarter-finals of 
the African Nations Cup at the expense of Libya. Chelsea striker Didier Drogba 
gave the Ivorians a 10th-minute lead in their 2-1 win against Libya by 
capitalising on defensive disarray.

Winger Arouna Kone, who plays for PSV Eindhoven, wriggled into the penalty 
area from the left flank and although his initial shot was saved, it caused 
chaos.

Libyan goalkeeper Muftah Ghzalla fumbled badly, his defence failed to clear, 
and Kone stabbed the ball back for Drogba to blast home from eight yards.

The minnows equalised with Kames Ezwae's header before the break, after the 
Ivory Coast wasted a flurry of chances.

He found space and got just enough power onto Jehad Muntaser's chipped cross 
to beat goalkeeper Jean-Jacques Tizie.

Both sides had chances to win it in the second half as Libya's Nader Amhimed 
Karra hit the post and Ivory Coast were denied two penalties, but Yaya Toure 
eventually provided the decisive goal courtesy of a speculative header with 16 
minutes left.

Libya failed to clear a corner and Kone's drive ballooned into the air for 
Yaya Toure to head goalwards, with Younes Shibani's attempted clearance on the 
line only diverting the ball off the bar and back into the net.
