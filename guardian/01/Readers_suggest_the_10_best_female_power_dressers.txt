The most powerful woman on this list, Good Queen Bess may have had the body of 
a weak and feeble woman but she dressed like no other, giving off a fearsome 
impression of riches and authority. During her reign sleeves became wider and 
costumes more elaborate. Despite the ostentation, she was scrupulous in 
recording how much she spent on her clothing, and it is these accounts that 
provide much of the information on the fashion of her age.

Known for her bold red lipstick and masculine suits, Bacall was a style icon 
through the decades right up until her death at 89 this year. Her 5’8” stature 
meant that she favoured big collars, capes, and high-waisted trousers, and was 
proud to wear jumpsuits, now enjoying so glorious a comeback. This is all 
before we mention her eyebrows – Cara Delevingne, eat your heart out.

As recommended by Keyboardaddictagain

Julianna Margulies’s style as Alicia Florrick in legal drama The Good Wife is 
indicative of her character’s transitions: initially returning to law after her 
husband is embroiled in a sex scandal, she wishes merely to be a“wallflower” 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/27/the-good-wife-daniel-lawson-costume-designer_n_3997592.html>
, says the show’s costume designer. But she is then promoted, has an affair, 
and decides to wear more expensive clothes and jewellery. Her wardrobe is 
inextricably linked to the notion of power.

Her silver locks and piercing eyes make Lagarde a distinctive-looking 
politician. So do the bold scarves and sharp, English-tailored suits in which 
the lawyer costumes herself. Items such as her pink Chanel jacket ensure that, 
in a sphere bogged down by male politicians in black suits, she provides an 
explosion of colour. A refreshingly unconventional dresser, Lagarde wore an 
eye-catching pink scarf to her first press conference as managing director of 
the IMF. Say no more.

Entire wardrobes have been inspired by Keaton’s androgynous style in Annie Hall
, Woody Allen’s 1977 comedy. Her waistcoats and ties have become fixtures in 
fashion and, as AugustaG admits, “no one can rock a trouser suit quite like

The controversial wife of the late former president of the Philippines is 
infamous partly for owning thousands of pairs of shoes. “I was born 
ostentatious,” she said in 1998. “They will list my name in the dictionary some 
day. They will use ‘Imeldific’ to mean ostentatious extravagance.” In her 
heyday Marcos invited comparisons to Jackie Onassis, and the ‘terno’, a long 
dress with conspicuous butterfly sleeves, became her trademark. David Byrne and 
Fatboy Slim are behind a recently opened musical –Here Lies Love 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/14/here-lies-love-byrne-marcos-review>

In House of Cards, Claire Underwood’s clothes are an armour. She is married to 
conniving politician Frank Underwood and, as such, is constantly on show but 
also able to afford all the Ralph Lauren, Burberry and Gucci she desires. These 
come in simple, largely light-blue, often grey shades, in part because the 
latter is the favourite colour of director and executive producer David 
Fincher. Hers is a sharp, tailored wardrobe; a study in minimalism.

Bellodgia waxes lyrical about the character of Catalina Creel, portrayed by 
María Rubio in Mexican soapCuna de Lobos (‘Den of Wolves’). “The series was 
made in the mid-1980s,” says Bellodgia, “and Catalina Creel’s clothes echoed 
that period in a very powerful way.” A facet that distinguished Creel from 
perhaps any other character in popular culture was that the colour of her eye 
patch – worn because of a partial blindness that was in fact invented – matched 
that of her garish blouses. “Not for her the usual black eye patch, held in 
place by a band,” says Bellodgia.

Jackie Onassis <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jackie-onassis> is 
basically the 60s. Entire exhibits have been devoted to her influence on the 
fashion choices of women in the late 20th century: the pillbox hat, pink Chanel 
suit and extremely large sunglasses would have enjoyed none of their status 
were it not for her. An impulsive and indulgent shopper, Onassis wore elegant 
shift dresses, tailored coats and came to epitomise the modern, cool look that 
we now associate with President Kennedy and the era as a whole.

Washington’s sartorial portrayal of crisis manager Olivia Pope in Scandal is 
scrutinised monthly byHarper’s Bazaar and Glamour, who covet her Movado 
watches, Prada purses and Burberry trench coats. Pope, like Claire Underwood, 
wears modest pastel colours and tailored outfits but she is also unafraid to 
wear white in a room full of men in dark suits. “She’s very feminine but she 
also manages to look commanding and authoritative,” says acwacw.
