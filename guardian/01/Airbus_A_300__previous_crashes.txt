 The A300-600, is one of the world's most popular mid-size airliners, and is 
used by 27 airlines across the world.
Yesterday's incident brings to more than a dozen the number of crashes the 
Airbus has been involved in over the past 13 years.

However, with an Airbus taking off or landing every 10 seconds, the plane is 
considered in the aviation industry to have a good safety record, with 
"take-off crashes" - as happened yesterday - being extremely rare.

Since 1992 there have been four crashes involving an Airbus jet as it came in 
to land, prompting safety queries, especially regarding the plane's autopilot.

The aircraft usually seats 266 passengers in a standard two-class 
configuration. The first A300-600 entered service in 1984 and by the end of 
last month there were 242 aircraft in operation.

Eyewitnesses have been reported as saying that an engine was seen falling from 
the plane before the crash. The plane would have been capable of flying with 
only one engine.

The Airbus is made by the European consortium Airbus Industrie and the 
A300-600 is an early version. American Airlines has 35 in service.

Wings for the A-300 are manufactured at the Airbus factory in Broughton, on 
the Welsh/English border near Chester. Airbus describes the A-300 and the A-310 
family of aircraft as "regional profit machines".
