This is a repeated pattern from a photograph I took this year. It's based on a 
Bruegel painting and I called it People, in homage to those old paintings in 
which every flower is treated like an individual. I had to source a lot of fake 
flowers for my bouquet, as there are plenty of bad ones on the market. I 
initially worked with a florist, then realised I had to do it myself – because 
I wanted it to look very particular. It took me two weeks; there was a lot of 
playing with wires and florist's foam, getting each flower to have its own 
space and still work as a whole.

As a pattern, it has a certain hypnotism. It almost has the shape of a 
Christmas tree when it's in repeat: you can't really see what it is. I didn't 
make this specifically for Christmas, but it makes me think of those 1970s 
special edition Christmas gift chocolate boxes, like Milk Tray, which were 
based on classical paintings of flowers or landscapes. They remind me of
Christmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> more than tinsel 
does.
