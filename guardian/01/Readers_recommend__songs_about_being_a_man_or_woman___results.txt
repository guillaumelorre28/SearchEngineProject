Let’s go girls! Shania Twain makes her intentions perfectly clear in Man I 
Feel Like a Woman – an exuberant celebration of female independence. She lets 
her hair down, eschews political correctness and does it with raunchy 
intelligence and the self-confidence that comes in bucketloads when you’re 
young.

There is a brazen verve also in Neko Case’s Man. Case transcends the 
limitations of gender stereotypes in the song and declares that she is as much 
a man as any man only that she has invested in a woman’s heart as the 
“watermark” for everything that matters.

Chrissie Hynde’s autobiographical Tattooed Love Boys shows what can happen to 
a young woman when she is faced by men corrupted by violent language and 
violent deeds. As RR reader Megadon says: it is “a terrific tune brimming with 
attitude and driven by a riff so urgent it almost falls over itself”.

Men are imperiously dismissed (by a man) in Stromae’s exotic Tous Les Memes 
(All The Same) as being ‘cheap infidels and wimps’ An ambivalence to gender 
certainly infuses the song which nevertheless carries a marvellous zest for 
life in the music.

In Cowboy Junkies’ exquisite If You Were the Woman And I Was the Man there is 
a desire to break down the walls which get in the way of our reaching out to 
one’s other half.Aretha Franklin then yearns for equality in Do Right Woman, Do 
Right Man, powerfully asserting that: “A woman’s only human … she’s flesh and 
blood just like a man” – a nugget of truth often overlooked perhaps because men 
repeatedly seem to make itHard for themselves and everyone else. Tom Robinson’s 
droll take on the pressures of being a man shows a debilitating process of 
conditioning from the playground onwards.

The perplexing journey of life for many men and women is littered with too 
many calamities for their own good. The open road calls to many and inKing of 
the Barley, Jackie Leven juxtaposes a man’s devastation with the heartbreaking 
grandeur of the natural world. A feeling of loss and damage reverberates inJohn 
Callaghan’s I’m Not Comfortable Inside in my Mind – a discordant questioning of 
what a man’s life is supposed to be about, immersed in music that is sparingly 
beautiful. The absence of certainties is also explored inKode9 & The Spaceape’s 
sonic sledgehammer,Am I; assigned roles in life so vast and diverse as to fill 
a universe and an individual’s bewilderment in the face of it all.

And on to something really heavy: a girl power anthem that spoke loud and 
clear years before the Spice Girls. It is the complete lack of doubt which 
enablesHelen Reddy to carry all before her in I Am Woman. Starting out rather 
innocuously, the song and Reddy gather an irresistible momentum – surging 
arrangements and gospel backing that wouldn’t have been out of place in Sister 
Act.

To grow older is to hope that the disappointments will have been few and that 
you’ll have gained friends, family and the kinds of achievements not 
necessarily counted at the bank. It doesn’t always work out that way.Ed Harcourt
 inThe Man That Time Forgot stands stripped of everything and waits on a 
platform for “a train that never comes sending tears down the track”, while
Janis Joplin seems to carry all the loneliness in the world on her shoulders in 
A Woman Left Lonely.
