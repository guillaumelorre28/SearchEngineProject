So what does the end of an era at Channel 4 look like? A bit like this, 
perhaps? The car was waiting outside the broadcaster's Horseferry Road HQ,just 
after chief executive Andy Duncan's exit was announced on Wednesday 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/sep/16/channel-4-andy-duncan-departure>. 
Channel 4 is no longer a Rolls-Royce broadcaster, it would appear. Taxi for Mr 
Duncan!
