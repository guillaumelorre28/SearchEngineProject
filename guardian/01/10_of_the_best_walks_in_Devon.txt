The Teign Valley is one of Dartmoor's hidden gems: on one side the famous 
bleak high moor, on the other, the less well known eastern side, a series of 
steep-sided wooded valleys. The Two Moors way passes through it – for the truly 
adventurous this route, as the name suggests, goes from north to south Devon 
through both Exmoor and Dartmoor national parks. Fingle Bridge itself is a 
stunning setting, and a steep climb up Hunter's Path rewards you with fantastic 
views fromCastle Drogo <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/castle-drogo/> out 
across the North Moor. In the castle's cafe, Christine's team do great cake. If 
you prefer to stay down by the river, the option to explore the Gorge on the 
Fisherman's path is equally rewarding.

This fascinating area used to be HMS Cambridge – the navy's gunnery school. 
Since its purchase by the National Trust it has been lovingly returned to 
nature and is now a significantly more tranquil place. The views out to sea are 
spectacular and this is a great place to see the wide variety of craft that 
come and go from Plymouth. You get a great view of the navy's Thursday War (the 
weekly war-fighting exercises) from here too. The bay back towards Wembury 
church is a top spot for rock-pooling adventures.

The area around Noss Mayo and Newton Ferres has some spectacular walks, this 
is one of my personal favourites. Gara Point is the wilder side of the Yealm; 
you pass some striking coastline, gorgeous woods and picturesque grazing, not 
to mention the options for good pubs – the Ship (nossmayo.com 
<http://www.nossmayo.com/>) and the Swan (swaninnnossmayo.co.uk 
<http://www.swaninnnossmayo.co.uk/>), both in Noss Mayo, pull a fine pint. All 
of this is packed into a relatively compact area, the paths are good but the 
climb out of Noss Mayo is not for the faint-hearted. On a clear day, as you 
walk along Revelstoke Drive you can see across the mouth of Plymouth Sound, to 
Cornwall, and all the way out to the Eddystone Lighthouse.

This is a beautiful valley and beach that is tucked away – the route down to 
the cove passes through old sunken lanes, one of which was supposedly used by 
smugglers. The area is well known for its reptiles, which can often be seen 
basking in the sun. The cove itself provides hours of fascination; at low tide 
the vast rock pools are teeming with marine life such as blennies, anemones and 
starfish. The sand dunes, bound together with marram grass, are constantly 
shifting and home to sea sandwort, forming a lush green carpet bearing greenish 
white flowers in summer. The cove also has unique and colourful rock formations.
The Journey's End Inn (thejourneysendinn.co.uk 
<http://www.thejourneysendinn.co.uk/>) is a great little spot to stop once 
you've scaled the lanes.

This area is probably best avoided in the height of summer as the sheer number 
of people can detract from the outstanding charm of the place. That said, it 
doesn't take long to leave the crowds behind. The headlands on both sides of 
the Salcombe estuary provide excellent walks. Catch the ferry from Salcombe and 
you can walk directly up the beautiful valley at Mill Bay, this opens up as you 
reach the top and is the start of a lovely walk to Prawl. The Pig's Nose at 
East Prawl (pigsnose.co.uk <http://www.pigsnose.co.uk/>) provides great 
entertainment as well as a welcome stop. On the opposite side, the area between 
Bolt Head and Bolt Tail has amazing views and the walk up from Salcombe to 
Overbecks is really stunning – as you climb up it is well worth looking back to 
take in views of the estuary.

Start Greenway Quay, grid ref: SX876548

The Dart estuary is a brilliant area to walk, and there is a good system of 
ferries which link Dartmouth, Dittisham and Kingswear, as well as options to 
travel further up the river to visit the brilliantSharpham's vineyard 
<http://www.sharpham.com/>. My favourite walk is from Agatha Christie's old 
house at Greenway <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/greenway/> along to Coleton 
Fishacre, right out on the end of the peninsula. You pass through Long Wood to 
join theDart Valley Trail 
<http://www.southdevonaonb.org.uk/sitedetails.asp?PageId=32&SiteId=868>, the 
steam railway runs alongside and provides the perfect time machine experience, 
and once through Kingswear you join the South West Coast Path and your 
surroundings become more exposed. The walk to the old gun battery at Froward 
Point is spectacular, the views back across to Start Point and Slapton are 
breathtaking.

The route of the River Plym provides some amazing and varied scenery. Up on 
the High Moor it feels like you are in the middle of nowhere yet you are only a 
few miles north of Plymouth. The area of the upper Plym is littered with bronze 
age archaeology; there are barrows, hut remains and standing stones within a 
very short walk of the car park at Cadover bridge. Following the river south 
brings you to the Dewerstone, which takes its name from the Dartmoor legend of 
demonic hunter Dewer; the devil himself. When night fell, Dewer would hunt down 
people who were lost on the moor. Accompanied by a pack of fearsome, ghostly 
dogs called Whist Hounds, Dewer would drive people to their deaths via a fatal 
fall from Drewerstone's highest cliff. Thankfully these days Devil's Rock is 
more commonly used for climbing.

Watersmeet is one of Britain's deepest river gorges, where the lush valleys of 
the East Lyn and Hoar Oak Water meet. This entire area is a walkers' paradise, 
with options to explore inland or take the coastal path along the cliff tops. 
Watersmeet House is now a great little cafe where you can refuel on an ample 
cream tea. The river is home to otters, salmon and the occasional brave kayaker.
The varied terrain in this area is striking, but it is the wealth of wildlife 
which is the real treat: red deer, herons, wood warblers and jays all call this 
beautiful place home.

A beautiful walk through ancient woodland alongside the River Heddon to where 
it meets the sea on the north Devon coast, between some of England's highest 
sea cliffs, framing an amazing view out to sea. Down on the beach you will find 
a restored 19th-century lime kiln. The coppiced woodland and meadows are 
specifically maintained to provide habitat for the high brown fritillary 
butterfly. The best season to spot them is between mid-June and early July. For 
those of an adventurous disposition, a steep walk down to Woody Valley provides 
a great opportunity to take a dip.

This part of the coast was once notorious for smugglers and wreckers. During 
the second world war it was a D-Day planning centre; today it is home to the 
Royal Marines amphibious testing centre. The walking around this corner of 
north Devon is great, stretching from the rocky headland of Baggy Point at 
Croyde to the rugged heights of the Tors of Ilfracombe, Lovely Woolacombe beach 
sits beneath the surrounding hills, miles of golden sand to wander along while 
watching surfers in action. You can scramble up the stegosaurus' back of Morte 
Point's wild headland, and if you're really lucky you might spot seals basking 
in small coves below. This coastline also has a Victorian past – the Torrs Walk 
above Ilfracombe was created for the enjoyment of tourists many years ago, and 
you can see why this stretch of coastline has had such an enduring appeal.
