The Brazilian said after they clinched the trophy in the super tie-break that 
he had not slept well after he finished his official duties at 0400 local time 
and had sent Vesnina a text message at 0430 saying he was “ready to go”.

“Been living on coffee ever since. So I had 22 coffees already today. But now 
it’s all worth it,” Soares said. “It feels amazing. It was long days, tough 
days. Last night I finished really late. It’s tough. A lot of adrenaline going 
on. Tough to sleep.

“But I knew I had another important day. You don’t get the chance to play many 
grand slam finals. I think you got to make the most of it.

“To get the chance to play one and win one, it’s already extremely special. I 
mean, I got two in the same day, so... it’s special.”
