Amanda Palmer is clearly not a woman to cross. After the Daily Mail claimed 
she had "made a bit of a boob of herself" with a Glastonbury "wardrobe 
malfunction", the singergot her own back by writing a song mocking the paper

. On Monday, Palmer had another chance to stick the boot in whenshe was 
interviewed by BBC2's Newsnight 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23420810>. "The Daily Mail 
clearly don't know who I am if they're writing a story about my breasts being 
exposed," said Palmer, pointing out that her "entire body had escaped" on stage 
in the past. "Obviously the Daily Mail don't care one way or another if I'm the 
kind of performance artist or musician who gets naked – they just know that 
they've caught a photograph of a woman with her breast slightly exposed." 
Palmer reflected on how the UK press differs from US newspapers, adding: "The 
Americans don't really have an equivalent newspaper to the Daily Mail, that is 
part right wing agenda, part tabloid." Warming to the theme, she continued: 
"There's not enough attention on [US tabloids] to revile them, whereas the 
Daily Mail seems to be nationally despised." She admitted she didn't hang out 
with many Mail readers, but said: "I don't know if anybody really loves – 
deeply, passionately loves – the Daily Mail." Monkey looks forward to Palmer's 
reaction the next time the paper "spreads the love" in its sidebar of shame.
