I loved her before everyone else did. That's my claim to fame. Funny, I never 
noticed that phrase before. Claim to fame. As if fame is a territory and we 
want to march into it, pierce its soil with our flag and say "this is my 
share". As if we are pioneers and fame is our new-found land.

She walked into my life like that; proprietary. My name's Daniel, I'm an 
artist. Well, can you be an artist if you've never sold a painting for more 
than £30? I keep on doing it, though. To make ends meet, I work in a gallery in 
London. I'm just a shopkeeper. The owner, theforward-looking Mr Matadides 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2006/nov/23/gatheringartsfuturehistory>
, truffles out the bargains, charming artists and old ladies with his 
impeccable manners and manicured hands. My job is to look after the paintings. 
I like to spend the time with them, to be honest.

And when she walked into the gallery, my first thought was: she looks like 
Caravaggio's Ursula. The same long nose. The face half in light and half in 
shadow.

There were three of them. Bright, loud girls: one blonde, one brunette, one 
redhead. She wasn't the prettiest, but I couldn't stop looking at her. The 
redhead marched up to my desk and shouted: "D'you own this place?"
"I, er, no," I stood up, "what is it that you want?"

The blonde was getting too close to a late Lowry. A photographer was with her, 
crouching down, testing angles. And then she walked over. Ursula. She stuck out 
her hand. "I'm Vic," she said, "this is Jules, that's Frankie. Can we take a 
couple of pictures here? Just because it's so beautiful."

She smiled. Her smile was like the sun. I had to sit down.
"What's this about?" I said
"We're a band. Publicity shots. Our future's so bright you've gotta wear 
shades."
