I read with interest about Ada Lovelace Day (This woman’s work 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/13/ada-lovelace-day-women-computing-60s>
, G2, 14 October), as I too was a programmer at Elliot Brothers from 1951-53. I 
wrote the first in-house program for its prototype computer “Nicholas”, as well 
as the “initial orders” that instructed Nicholas how to read and assemble the 
punched tape holes which were to be fed to it. I left Elliot Brothers to marry 
and live in Cornwall. It was another 10 years before the first computer made an 
appearance. After bringing up my children I was informed by the government 
training department that anyone over 35 was past it as far as computers were 
concerned and I should concentrate on shorthand and typing. Eventually the 
advent of the PC remedied this. Now in my old age, I have no regrets for not 
making a fortune as did Dina St Johnston and Dame Stephanie Shirley. My riches 
are my memories of Cornwall, its beautiful coast and its Celtic culture. These 
too can change the world.
