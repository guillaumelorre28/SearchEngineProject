I love the flavour of fruit and meat together, while the chicory and walnuts 
give a lovely crunch. If you're short of time, cook the duck ahead and serve 
the whole dish at room temperature. Another nice addition is some ginger and 
sliced spring onions in the vinaigrette.

4 gressingham duck breasts
100g soft dates
75g walnuts
3 large yellow chicory heads
3 large ripe pears, sliced
1tsp vegetable oil 

For the vinaigrette:
75ml olive oil
15ml red wine vinegar
1tsp Dijon mustard
Grated rind of one orange

Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.

In a bowl make the vinaigrette – mix the olive oil, vinegar, orange rind and 
mustard. Season and leave to one side.

Prepare the ducks – make sure the skin is evenly scored, making a criss-cross 
pattern.

In a hot pan add a teaspoon of vegetable oil. Season the duck breasts and add 
them to the pan fat side down and allow the duck to crisp up. The fat will 
start to render down gently – tip it away from the pan.

Continue to crisp the skin until golden brown. Turn over and place in the oven 
for four minutes.

Remove from the oven and allow to rest. Put the chicory, sliced pears, walnut 
and dates all in a bowl and add the vinaigrette. Mix well and serve on a large 
plate with the sliced duck breast..
