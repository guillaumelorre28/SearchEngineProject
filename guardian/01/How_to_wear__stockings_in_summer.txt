My first book on lingerie arrived courtesy of a book voucher Christmas present 
when I was 14 and, naturally enough, spurred the desire for stockings.

 Finely woven, sheer stockings with saucy black seams and thick bands to 
encase my young thighs, held up by my first real garter belt – powder-blue 
satin – bought after school from a local sex shop with my checkout-chick wages. 
I wore them under my school uniform and told no one.

The years since then have seen explorations into every material: cotton, wool, 
silk, nylon and all manner of polyesters. From sheers that gently grazed my 
skin like a giggly blush to the deepest, darkest of multi-thread opaques. 
Stockings, pantyhose, tights, stay-ups and hold-ups: all year, all around the 
world they have formed the one constant of my wardrobe.

 It hasn’t been easy. Hosiery, while finding a natural home in winter as a 
delightful splash of contrasting colour or wide ribbing to keep you warm under 
your high-waisted trousers, can be a bane during the sunnier months. Unfazed, I 
explored the options.

 Firstly, let’s look at sheer: the most popular summer weight is a 15 denier 
but if that’s too hot consider a seven denier for the very lightest of 
stockings – choose a colour close to your natural shade for almost invisible 
wearing, with bonus smoothness to the touch. Sheer toe styles are best for 
sandals, to avoid the tell-tale seam.

 Ladies blessed with tanned skins are well served by an array of warm tones, 
or perhaps, like me, you go for pale and interesting – soft caramel beiges, 
whites and creams might tickle your fancy.

 When even a sheer coverage can be too much, a textured selection can be 
lovely – consider fine laces and nets – nude fishnets can be particularly 
becoming as the colour dials down their impact ,or icy bridal shades as cool as 
a summer breeze. If feeling daring, perhaps a black feathered lace or stripes 
for dramatic effect.

 Light and bright colours are fun and draw attention to shapely legs: sorbet 
colours work well with summer frocks and conjure dreams of the swinging 60s.

 These days hosiery has become a vintage look, so why not dip into the 
authentic styles with seams? A nice look is a nude seam on a nude stocking worn 
with stilettos, but contrasting seams are now available in red, blue or black.

For evening, perhaps a shimmery golden glow can enhance your gams as you dance 
into the night.
