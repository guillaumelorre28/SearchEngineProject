Q I am nearing retirement and need to give the pension trustees of the various 
companies I worked for my new address and personal details, so they can pay me 
the pension I earned while working for them. However, in 1988 I worked for 
Berger Paints, which was part of the BJN Group. They were subsequently taken 
over by Williams Holdings who then made me redundant. But I have no contact 
details for them - I've heard there is a website or telephone number to help 
people find their various pension funds. Could you please help me?

A The Department for Work and Pensions offers a  pension tracing service 
<http://www.thepensionservice.gov.uk/atoz/atozdetailed/pensiontracing.asp>. It 
is free and covers 200,000 occupational and personal pension schemes. You can 
also obtain an application form by telephoning 0845 60 60 265.

However, as usual with this type of service getting through may take some 
time. It might be quicker to fill out an application form online - the website 
gives full details of what to do. You will then need to supply as much 
information as possible.

I used the service some years ago to try and find an obscure final salary 
scheme I contributed to at the start of my journalistic career. As it happened 
they couldn't find it, despite giving me three alternatives to try. However, I 
know of several cases where the tracing service has been successful, and I 
think your scheme should be fairly easy to locate. You also have nothing to 
lose because the service is free.
