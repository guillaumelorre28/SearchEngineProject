When Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s he recalled his wife’s 
relief that he hadn’t got a brain tumour. “All I could think then was, ‘I know 
three people who have got better after having a brain tumour. I haven’t heard 
of anyone who’s got better from Alzheimer’s,’” thelate author wrote in 2008

Nearly a decade on, not much has changed for people facing a new diagnosis of 
Alzheimer’s. Unlike patients with heart disease, cancer or diabetes, there is 
no well-trodden medical track to follow and no treatments that can slow the 
disease’s devastating progress.

Between 2002 and 2012, 99.6% of drugs studies aimed at preventing, curing or 
improving Alzheimer’s symptoms were either halted or discontinued. The 
consistent failure of trials, at vast financial cost to drugs companies, caused 
many to shut down dementia programmes as a result.

The latest trial results

 from Merck,together with other drugs in the final stage of development

, provide hope that the years of deadlock may be drawing to a close.

The Merck trial may be preliminary, in the clinical sense, but it represents 
an entire career’s work for some of the scientists involved. “We’re 16 years 
into the program,” said Matt Kennedy, the neuroscience director at Merck who 
led the research. “It’s a good example of how long it takes.”

The first challenge scientists faced was creating a compound that would get 
through the blood-brain barrier, without also causing toxic side-effects or 
damaging healthy structures in the brain. Simply optimising the structure of 
the compound to do this took a decade, Kennedy said.

The latest results appear to show that the scientists got this bit right - the 
drug appeared to have few side-effects and it substantially lowered levels of
toxic amyloid compounds.

The real question, which the next phase of the trial should answer, is whether 
the formation of plaques are a root cause of the disease or simply a visible 
symptom. Previous drugs aimed at clearing abnormal tangles of proteins from the 
brain have not been successful, andsome argue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/30/alzheimers-treatment-researchers-licensed-drugs-halt-brain-degeneration>
 that by the time the plaques are present irreparable brain damage may have 
already occurred.

It is possible that previous drugs based on the so-called amyloid hypothesis, 
were given to patients whose disease was too far advanced for them to benefit. 
Merck hopes that its drug, which acts at an earlier stage in the disease 
process by shutting down the production of the misshapen proteins rather than 
clearing them once they appear, will fare better.

There is no guarantee that the drug will ultimately make it to market, but in 
a field that has seen such scant progress, the fact that a major clinical trial 
is underway is welcome news.

Professor John Hardy, a neuroscientist at University College London and 
pioneer in the study of Alzheimer’s disease, said: “Conveying some excitement 
isn’t the wrong thing to do in this case.”
