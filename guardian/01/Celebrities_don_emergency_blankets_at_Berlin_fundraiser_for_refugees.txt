A film charity event held alongside an installation in Berlin by the Chinese 
artistAi Weiwei <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei> has 
sparked anger.

According to Artnet 
<https://news.artnet.com/art-world/ai-weiwei-cinema-for-peace-berlin-427484>, 
the Cinema for Peace fundraiser took place at the Berlin Konzerthaus, whose 
pillars the artist decorated – as part of his installation Safe Passage – with 
14,000 lifejackets flown in from Lesbos, Greece, where almost 450,000 refugees 
arrived in 2015 on their way into the EU.

Fundraiser guests, including actor Charlize Theron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlize-theron> and Pussy Riot member Nadya 
Tolokonnikova, were encouraged to don emergency thermal blankets similar to 
those given to refugees.

In a Facebook post, Tim Renner, Berlin’s culture secretary, was highly 
critical of the sight of dinner guests at a star-studded gala posing in the 
blankets at the party.

There are better ways for Ai Weiwei to take a political stand than posing as a 
drowned infant

“When Ai Weiwei illustrates the dimensions of terror outside [the gala] with 
14,000 life jackets from Lesbos, it is perhaps not subtle but effective and 
justified; but when the guests of Cinema for Peace are prompted by the 
organiser to don emergency blankets for a group photo, even if understood as an 
act of solidarity, it has a clearly obscene element,” he said.

Ai Weiwei, whose recent work has focused on the migration crisis, was 
criticised two weeks ago forrecreating a photo of the drowned Syrian toddler 
Alan Kurdi

 – for the magazine India Today – in which the artist lies face down on a 
beach. He maintained that his work was intended to “defend the dignity” of the 
refugees.
