The wives of the British and German ambassadors to the United Nations have 
released avideo <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzUViTShIAo> urging Syria's 
first lady to demand her husband should stop the violence in her country.

The video asks viewers to sign a petition 
<http://www.change.org/petitions/asma-al-assad-stop-the-bloodshed-in-syria> 
calling on Asma al-Assad to "stand up for peace â€¦ for the sake of your people". 
Sheila Lyall Grant and Huberta von Voss-Wittig said in a letter accompanying 
the video that as a champion of women's equality, Assad could not "hide behind 
her husband".

"Her public voice is needed," they said, noting that many female victims of 
the violence had taken the risk to stand up for their freedom. "We are asking 
Asma Assad to take a risk, too, and to say openly: stop the bloodshed, stop it 
right now," Voss-Wittig and Lyall Grant said.

The four-minute video alternates pictures of Assad with scenes of Syria's 
conflict and its victims, including graphic pictures of children who have been 
killed or injured.

It starts out by saying "some women are for style", against a photo of the 
first lady wearing designer sunglasses, "and some women care for their people", 
against a photo of a woman cradling a child surrounded by many other youngsters.

It says "some women have forgotten what they preached about peace", followed 
by a clip of Assad telling a group of young people "we should all be able to 
live in peace, stability and with our dignity".

The video says: "One day, our children will ask us what we have done to stop 
this bloodshed. What will your answer be, Asma?"
