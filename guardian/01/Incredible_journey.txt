April 1987 and for reasons still unknown we joined a package tour to Albania. 
We flew from Heathrow to Belgrade, caught a plane onwards to Titograd and then 
by coach to the Yugoslavian-Albanian border. We walked down a dimly lit road to 
be greeted by an Albanian army officer and his men. One by one we had to show 
him our passports, which he compared to the group visa we had.

We were finally in Albania and by now it was midnight (it could have been 
straight out of a Len Deighton novel). Our luggage was searched and various 
items confiscated including, I noticed, some women's magazines. We got to our 
hotel in Shkoder at 2.30am and were given a hot three-course meal with bottles 
of rough red Albanian wine. We had a fascinating holiday and wished we could've 
stay for longer.

At the end of our trip, back at the border post, everyone was amazed to be 
given back all their confiscated property - including those magazines.
