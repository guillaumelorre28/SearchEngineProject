It was all about the stomp: Coz I Luv You's bootboy rhythm anchored its 
swirling, menacing violin line and the two combined to give this single – 
Slade's first No 1 – its frightening, primitive edge. The band went on to 
become the most successful UK singles act of the 70s, but their music – setting 
aside their Christmas pension plan – never totally lost this hint of muscle and 
threat. As for the look, there's still something more startling about the 
band's brickies-in-platform-heels image than any amount of crafted androgyny.
