her father, for years she was a heroin addict. When I first heard her, I didn't 
know anything about that. I must have been about 14, and a bit of a grunger, 
when in the jazz section of the HMV on Oxford Street, surrounded by musos, I 
bought two records in a two-for-a-fiver deal. One was by Ella Fitzgerald and 
one was by Etta James. I just loved the way she looked, really – her curves and 
her catty eyes, and one of my cousins was a hairdresser so I asked her if she'd 
do me anEtta James <https://www.theguardian.com/music/etta-james> beehive.

"By then, of course, I'd listened to her record as well, and that had a huge 
influence on me. Everything she sings – you believe her, even if she never 
wrote a word of it herself. I saw her live in New York not so long ago: 
extraordinary. There she was, at the age of 71, singing 'I want to ta ta you, 
baby' – almost groping herself, as if the meaning wasn't clear enough already. 
She just hasso much attitude <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADDigK8LwyE>.

"I met her backstage after the show, very briefly. My mind went completely 
blank. I didn't know what to say. Afterwards, I was crying my eyes out."
