Q I've had a gap year and am beginning another before, I hope, going to 
university in September 2006. My personal savings have been in a two-year 
reward bond with Nationwide which is about to come to an end. The total amounts 
to around £1,500 and I am wondering what to do with it. I don't want to be able 
to access it very easily in case I spend it accidentally, but I am unsure as to 
what is the best thing to do with it. I have been considering another bond, but 
I was wondering if an investment linked to the stock market was a good idea. 
What do you think?

A If you are looking for a longer-term investment, then it is worth 
considering the stock market. Historically shares have provided a much higher 
average return than cash. However you have to be aware that the value of shares 
can go down as well as up, especially over shorter periods. In other words 
there is an element of risk.

In your circumstances l would put the full £1,500 into an Individual Savings 
Account (Isa). Even if you are not a taxpayer there are advantages to Isas - 
they tend to have cheaper charges, because of the intense competition in the 
market, and any capital gains over the longer term will be completely tax free.

I can't recommend any particular Isa since l don't know your personal 
circumstances and attitude to risk. But if you do want a stock-market linked 
Isa the fund networks, operating via the internet, have a huge choice on offer. 
The charges tend to be cheaper since there is no middle man involved to be paid 
- advice costs money.
