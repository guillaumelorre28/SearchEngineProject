A maintenance loan is tempting. It’s likely to leave you with a bank balance 
higher than you’ve ever seen before, and you can feel like you’ll never run out 
of money. But for the average student living outside of London (it’s even worse 
in the capital), the loan won’t cover the cost of living – leaving an extra 
£250 to find every month, according to a recentsurvey 
<http://www.savethestudent.org/money/student-money-survey-2016.html> by the 
money website Save the Student.

To make up the difference, seven out of 10 students rely on their parents, and 
around the same proportion have a part-time job.

Financially, your first year can prove the most difficult, since you may not 
have mastered budgeting yet. Here, students and recent graduates explain how 
they wasted their cash as freshers, and how you can learn from their mistakes:

Book in advance

James Beeson, a recent politics, philosophy and economics (PPE) graduate from 
the University of Exeter, spent £100 a term on train tickets. 

“I was in a long distance relationship for the whole of first year of uni and 
half of second year,” he says. “The most I ever paid for a journey was £90 when 
I booked the day before I travelled. But generally, if I booked far enough in 
advance, I could get a return for about £50.

“Look at when the advance fares go on sale and try to plan as far ahead as you 
can, though obviously that’s not always possible. And there’s always themegabus

 Pizza cravings? The supermarket might be the sensible option. Photograph: Alamy
Go easy on the pizza


Adam Stoner is a recent radio production graduate from the University of 
Gloucestershire. He “probably averaged two pizzas a week” in his first semester.

“I was very lazy with cooking in my first year,” says Stoner. “I remember 
having pizza on our first ever night, and since there were 50 of us living 
together in one halls, when one person got pizza, everyone else got pizza.

“Dominos also gave students 50% off, thanks to a deal with our students’ 
union, so while it was cheaper per order, we just ended up ordering twice as 
frequently. Looking back, it’s a miracle I didn’t put on any weight.

“If you have pizza cravings, go to a supermarket. It’s probably quicker and 
will save you a lot each time.”

Be choosy about textbooks

Holly Price graduated last year from the University of York. She bought five 
textbooks for £200 at the start of her first year and never read actually read 
them.

“You don’t question it at the beginning of a new degree. I realised about 
halfway through the year that these were of no use, no lecturers had set 
reading from them, and they were available at the library anyway.

“I managed to sell them at the end of second year for a tiny fraction of the 
price,” she says.

Kick the coffee habit

Olivia Firth, a second-year business student at the University of York, spent 
“£4 per day” on coffee. 

“Paying on my debit card meant I didn’t realise how much I was spending, until 
I received a statement. So I now take out a set amount of money every week to 
spend on luxuries such as coffee and nights out.”

Write it down

Molly Delmar is an English literature and history student at the University of 
Southampton. She says she lost track of how much she spent on alcohol – which 
makes sense – but she takes more care nowadays.

“My advice is to budget and write down anything you spend, so you can look 
back on it,” she says. “It might seem tedious and long, but it’s a great thing 
to get into, because it really will make you more conscious of what you’re 
spending.”

Be wary of the campus shop

Caitlin Doherty studies English literature at the University of East Anglia 
(UEA). She used to spent “at least £40” a week on groceries.

“To try and offset this I started buying groceries every two weeks, but a lot 
of the excess that I didn’t need was still having to go in the bin,” says 
Doherty.

“I found that meat products were the most expensive, but they went out of date 
more quickly than the majority of my shop. I started stocking up with tins, 
fruit, veg and other things I needed like stationery using home delivery, and 
then I would go to my campus shop – which was slightly more expensive – to buy 
meat only on the days that I would be cooking it.”

Sports gear is pricey

Laurence Reid spent “£1,000 over three years” on sports while a history and 
political science student at the University of Birmingham.

The says new students should avoid getting overenthusiastic when signing up 
for societies – it can end up costing you a lot of money.

“I was part of the University of Birmingham’s fencing team, and competed on 
the national circuit. My biggest – and most ludicrous – purchase was a special 
type of mask that cost me over £300.”

Get a railcard – and train split

Matt Weston is a student at the University of Central Lancashire (Uclan). He 
regularly visited home in his first year, spending at least £100 a journey.

“The average train from my university in Lancashire to Truro in Cornwall was 
at least £100, and flying was even more expensive. Travelling home can be quite 
frequent in the first year, because you miss family and they want to see you.

“Make sure that you have a railcard in date and go on train-splitting websites 
as they can reduce your costs.”

Cook with flatmates

Katy Baines is a recent Spanish graduate from UEA, who tended to overspend at 
her nearest shop on campus.

“The shop was visible from my kitchen window and Tesco was a whole 20 minutes 
away,” she says. “To go to a big store would involve getting the bus, and as a 
new fresher you tend to go with what’s comfortable. It was stupid stuff like 
tomato sauce being double the price, or a pack of sausages for £3-something.

“My advice is to make use of the communal kitchen. Frozen mixed vegetables can 
be easier than fresh – and try sharing meals with flatmates.”
