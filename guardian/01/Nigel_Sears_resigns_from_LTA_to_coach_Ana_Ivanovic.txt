Nigel Sears has resigned as head coach of women's tennis for the Lawn Tennis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Association to coach the former 
world No1 Ana Ivanovic.

Sears, who spent four and a half years in the post, said: "It's been a real 
privilege to be in charge of women's tennis at the LTA, an honour to captain 
Great Britain's Fed Cup team, and I feel we've made considerable progress in 
the women's game over this period.

"I've been fortunate to work with some great coaches, trainers and physios, 
and I look forward to following the progress of our players over the next few 
years."

During Sears' time as head coach of women's tennis, five British women broke 
into the world's top 100, two made the top 50 and two girls – Laura Robson and 
Heather Watson – won junior grand slam titles.

The LTA chief executive, Roger Draper, said: "I would like to thank Nigel for 
his significant contribution to the LTA over the past four and a half years.

"Nigel has been instrumental in developing the player programmes for our most 
talented girls and women, and he leaves behind a real sense of confidence and 
optimism that we can look forward to a bright long-term future in the 
international game."

The British No3, Anne Keothavong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong>, admitted her 
disappointment at Sears' departure.

She said on Twitter: "Really sad Nigel Sears has decided to resign from his 
position as head coach of women's tennis. He has been one of the most 
influential people in my career and it's been a privilege to work with him. 
It's a loss for British tennis and I wish him all the best working with Ana."
