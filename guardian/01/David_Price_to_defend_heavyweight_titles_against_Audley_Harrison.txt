David Price will defend his British and Commonwealth heavyweight titles against
Audley Harrison <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/audley-harrison> at 
Liverpool's Echo Arena later this year.

Price, a bronze medal winner at the Beijing Olympics four years ago, will meet 
the 40-year-old, who won gold in Sydney in 2000, in his hometown on 13 October.

"Audley was an inspiration to me when I was younger, someone our amateur squad 
always looked up," said Price. "He called me before Beijing to offer advice, 
which I'm grateful for, but he's still getting flattened."

The bout will be Harrison's first major contest since he was knocked out in 
three rounds by David Haye in Manchester in November 2010. His last fight was 
again Ali Adams at the Brentwood Arena last May. Harrison won in four rounds.
