Faisal Islam, Channel 4 News economics editor, is to replace Adam Boulton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/adam-boulton> as Sky News political editor.

Islam will join Sky News <https://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-news> later 
this year, in time for the Scottish independence refendum in September, and 
lead the broadcaster's general election coverage in 2015.

He is taking over from Boulton, by some distance the UK's longest serving 
political editor, who has been in the job at Sky News since the channel 
launched 25 years ago.

Boulton, who turned 55 in February, is to become anchor of a new evening show 
based at Sky News' Westminster studio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/13/adam-boulton-step-down-sky-news-political-editor>
.

John Ryley, head of Sky News, said: "We have a long history of challenging the 
way politics is reported in the UK and I know Faisal is keen to continue this; 
I am confident he will rise to the challenge."

Islam said: "I've had a fantastic decade at Channel 4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> News and I will miss all my 
talented colleagues and the world of economics. The opportunity at Sky to help 
transform political broadcasting is an exciting challenge that I could not 
resist."
