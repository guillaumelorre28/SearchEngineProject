I had an Online Saver account linked to my Alliance & Leicester current 
account, from which I transferred money every month to pay off my credit card 
bills and any other large bills. At the beginning of August I applied for an 
eSaver account and ticked the box asking for the £46,000 in my Online Saver to 
be transferred and the Online Saver closed.

A&L was very efficient at closing the Online Saver, but, to date, I have not 
been given an eSaver account and my money has disappeared. While it 
investigates, I asked whether I could have an interest-free or fee-free 
overdraft to cover the large bills (£5,000 or more) which are now due, as I 
cannot access my savings. This has been ignored. I have contacted the Financial 
Services Ombudsman, but it allows A&L eight weeks to resolve my complaint 
before it will intervene. I cannot wait.SJ, Woking, Surrey

When Brignall and King raised this with Alliance & Leicester's parent company, 
Santander, it swung into action fast. It has found your missing account and 
arranged for money to be transferred in so you can pay your bills in time, as 
well as giving you access to the account.
