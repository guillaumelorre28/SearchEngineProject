Walk in the footsteps of giants to St Michael's Mount, Marazion

Cross the causeway to a sea-encircled castle, once home to a legendary giant 
who was lured to his death by a brave local lad. Children love to hunt for the 
giant's stone heart etched in the pathway, follow clues to the castle turrets 
and stand in the firing line of bygone battles. The climb to the castle is too 
steep for buggies, but hipster seats are available (free) or you can take in 
the island vibe from the 18th-century village and seafront cafe. To emphasise 
the magic of being an island castaway, time your trip with the tides so you 
walk one way and ferry hop back.

Play lighthouse keeper on the Lizard
 Looking across Housel Bay to The Lizard Lighthouse. Photograph: Alamy 
The UK's most southerly point offers a dramatic landscape, and sometimes a 
peep of a seal or a basking shark, too. But even with a Cornish ice-cream in 
hand, a wave-lashed promontory will distract the kids for only so long. So head 
for the Lizard Lighthouse Heritage Centre, where they can climb the tower, 
sound a foghorn, track ships and build their own lighthouse. This should fire 
them up to explore the surroundings, and take the coastal stroll to Lizard 
Point (not too taxing, but it does stray close to the cliff edge). Top it off 
with a trip to the village for a legendary Anne's pasty (Sunny Corner, Beacon 
Terrace, Helston,annspasties.co.uk <http://www.annspasties.co.uk/shop.html>) 
and watch local serpentine rock being turned in one of the gift shops.

Theme park thrills at Flambards, near Helston
 Photograph: Alamy 
There are enough adrenaline-packed rides at Flambards to put a smile on 
teenage faces. Younger visitors can take a more leisurely ride on the Cornish 
Mine Train and Animal Express; inquisitive minds can try the Hands On Science 
Experience, and if the weather pulls a face you can pile into the new indoor 
play zone (for 1 to 11-year-olds). All ages collide on the car track, where 
teenagers and toddlers race around sporting policemen's hats and butterfly 
wings (from the dressing-up cabin). And if it all gets too much for the 
grown-ups, then slink off for a moment's peace in the award-winning gardens and 
aviary.
• 01326 573404, flambards.co.uk <http://www.flambards.co.uk/>, £21.95

Jungle trek at Trebah Garden, near Falmouth
 Trebah Garden, Cornwall 
You can't mention a day out in Cornwall's gardens without signposting its 
mega-star, theEden Project <http://www.edenproject.com/>, but there are other 
sub-tropical gardens which flourish naturally in the county's mild climate. At 
Trebah, follow children's trails under lush canopies and through colourful 
tunnels; check out Tarzan's Camp; paraglide through treetops and emerge on the 
small river beach on the Helford river. If it's warm enough go barefoot on the 
sand, grab an ice-cream from the Boathouse cafe and unpack a picnic; if it's 
drizzling, the Planters Café serves locally-sourced snacks.
• 01326 252200, trebahgarden.co.uk <http://www.trebahgarden.co.uk/>, £8.50 
adults/£2.50 children (aged 5-15), discounted winter rates November-March. Open

Beach activities at Swanpool, Falmouth
 Swanpool Beach 
It's no surprise that this picture-perfect crescent of sand is a hit with 
families. Its trump card is Elemental UK water sports centre, which offers 
kayaking, sailing, snorkelling, stand-up paddle-boarding, windsurfing and 
coasteering. It also runs kids' clubs on most weekends and during school 
holidays from Easter through to October, so parents can opt out and flop on the 
beach (on cooler days, pick up a poncho and hot water bottle from the beach 
cafe) or head into Falmouth for some retail therapy.

National Maritime Museum Cornwall, Falmouth
 National Maritime Museum Cornwall 
Where can children board a chopper, dress as a pilot and play a virtual 
lifeguard? At the NMMC, which has a 70ft Sea King helicopter on display this 
year – so climb aboard. As well as experiencing search and rescue heroics, 
children can helm radio-controlled yachts, watch harbour wildlife in the 
underwater gallery, celebrate Britain's Olympic sailing heritage and climb to 
the lookout. Round off the day by stepping into the shoes of local seafarers 
with a 20-minute boat trip from the Prince of Wales Pier to St Mawes, where you 
can visit the castle and eat pasties on the beach (buggies welcome on the 
ferry).

Hire a river boat, Mylor Creek

 Tregothnan's Tea Bar, Cornwall 
Children, dogs and wannabe sailors can cast off on the waterways of the 
Carrick Roads from Mylor Harbour, a chic little marina tucked into the mouth of 
Mylor Creek. With basic sailing experience under your belt you can hire a 
pocket cruiser; if not, putter along creeks and rivers on a motorboat. Pack 
binoculars (a pair per child to save bickering) to keep the kids enthralled as 
they look out for herons, peregrines, seals and even dolphins. Pack reins to 
secure wriggling babies and toddlers as you explore this boating paradise: 
anchor in sandy bays, go with the tide to Truro, or moor up for a riverside 
cuppa and cake at Tregothnan's Tea Bar (pictured).
• Mylor Boat Hire (01326 377745, mylorboathire.co.uk

Frolic with fairies at Golitha Falls, Bodmin Moor

 Photograph: Alamy 
Cornwall's natural beauty isn't all about the seaside; veer inland to Bodmin, 
to explore a wilderness said to be inhabited by a mischievous fairy tribe, the 
Cornish piskies. Golitha Falls Nature Reserve is one such place, where 
footpaths (including a buggy-friendly trail) tunnel through a wooded valley 
alongside the tumbling river Fowey. Kids can scale tree trunks, tiptoe across 
stepping stones and march over bridges – there's enough to keep them happy for 
hours. The centre of attention – for most adults at least – is the waterfall 
finale as it cascades down the gorge. There are plenty of places to unpack a 
picnic in a fairytale glen, but come prepared – there are no facilities or 
refreshments en route.

Paddle the River Tamar

 Photograph: Alamy 
With its medieval roots and glorious grounds sloping to a watermill on the 
Tamar, Cotehele (nationaltrust.org.uk 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cotehele/>) is a fantastic family day out in 
its own right. Better still, hop on a guided Canadian canoe trip from 
Cotehele's quay and delve deeper into the Cornish mining world heritage site, 
traced by Cornwall and Devon's watery border. Family teamwork is essential as 
you manoeuvre through steep-sided woodland punctuated by boatyards, mining 
chimneys and quays – once the heart of a thriving copper industry. Children 
from three upwards can hop aboard, and when they tire of paddling keep them 
busy looking for leaping salmon and the blue flash of kingfishers, until you 
moor up in a riverside meadow for a picnic break.
• Canoe Tamar (01822 833409, canoetamar.co.uk <http://canoetamar.co.uk/>) 
offers return trips from Cotehele to Harewood from April-September, £25 
adults/£21 children (under-5s free). Cornish mining world heritage site:

Explosive exhibitions at Wheal Martyn, near St Austell 

 Photograph: Alamy 
Kids love seeing machinery in action – and watching giant drills blast china 
clay from the pit at Wheal Martyn is like a trip through Play School's round 
window. Explosions aside, there are attractions for the whole family. Hands-on 
exhibits and audio-visual displays delve into the history of Cornwall's china 
clay; there are activity sheets with colouring, crafts and quiz trails. Run off 
steam on the commando-style assault course, wander through acres of woodland 
(look out for deer) and visit Cornwall's largest working water wheel. Complete 
the authentic Cornish experience with a taste of the local produce, served in 
the Victorian remains of a china clay settling tank.
• Wheal Martyn China Clay Country Park (01726 850362, wheal-martyn.com 
<http://wheal-martyn.com/>), £8.50 adults/£4.75 children (6-16), family saver 
£26. Open mid January-24 December from 10am (see website for days)
