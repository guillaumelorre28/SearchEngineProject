As the dis-United Kingdom reels from the Brexit result and the consequential 
political meltdown, what we all need is a really good chuckle. Friday means the 
release of Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie, which is crammed withlaughs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie-review-absolutely-fatuous-thank-god>
, gaffs and silliness (US readers will have to wait until 22 July and those in 
Australia until 4 August). The film, and the TV show, suggest a star-studded 
cast of women who really know how to have a good time. But the first meeting 
between Jennifer Saunders (Edina) and Joanna Lumley (Patsy) did not go quite as 
expected, as our first clip <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-NGlfFmS1A>, from 
Graham Norton’s BBC show, explains. Meanwhile, many royal commentators suggest 
the Queen has a good sense of humour.Her encounter  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a57EAoQFAfc>with Sinn Féin chief Martin 
McGuinness would suggest so – very droll, ma’am.

There were laughs too, of a more ironic and bitter nature, when would-be US 
president Donald Trump declared himself pleased with Brexit during a visit to 
Scotland. Pro-Remain Scots were quick to pile onto Twitter to correct the 
former host of The Apprentice. Samantha Bee’s Full Frontal Brexit special,Rue 
Britannia <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nTrs-HuuUc>, persuaded former 
Doctor Who David Tennant to read out the tweets. Game of Thrones fans, 
suffering withdrawal symptoms after the season six climax, should watch 
Scheiffer Bates’samazing impressions

The romantics among you will love a surprise marriage proposal 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn8mf_hmlh8> by a member of the Met police 
force to his partner during London Pride and Bridget Jones fans can enjoya 
cheeky preview <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJsvmscPY9w>of Bridget Jones’s 
Baby, which opens in September and stars Renée Zellweger, Colin Firth and 
Patrick Dempsey. We’ve also got a couple of Brexit funnies – Boris Johnson’s HQ
as the result comes in <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a6HNXtdvVQ>, and we 
couldn’t resist a re-run of Michael Gove falling over 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAqyf7a4xFM> in Downing Street. Politics is a 
cruel game …
