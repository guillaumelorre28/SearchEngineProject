Blackstar, David Bowie


We’re not claiming there’s anything scientific 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89455762> about this 
roundup, or of the whole body of your contributions, but one thing was clear – 
David Bowie received by far the most nominations. Here’s what some of you said 
about Blackstar:

While it might appear an obvious or even maudlin choice given its critical 
acclaim and Bowie’s untimely death, Blackstar is an extraordinary piece of 
work. It’s an art installation that forces a total reevaluation of how music is 
released and listened to. The electro-soaked jazz tone, the premonition in the 
lyrics and the constantly revealing vinyl cover, in a world of disposal streams 
of music, make this more than a collection of legacy tunes – it defines 
everything Bowie. It will watch over us all for decades.
David Hodgson, Harrogate

It’s funny, it’s sad, it’s sexy, it’s a farewell to old friends and an 
introduction to new.
Tony Wood, London

This would have been one of the most musically and lyrically arresting albums 
of the year even if Bowie’s death within days of its release had not brought a 
whole new dimension to the work, a whole new register of resonances to his very 
last lyrics, written in the knowledge that he was terminally ill. Bowie 
transformed his life into a work of art and did the same with his death. A true 
pioneer until the very end.
Chris Hughes, Cambridge

A difficult choice between two goodbyes. Bowie and Leonard Cohen’s leaving 
framed the year for me. Both left huge life legacies and also knowing farewell 
notes. In the end, forced to a choice, I have gone for Bowie’s majestic 
Blackstar for its typically Bowie yet entirely new, alien soundscape and often 
opaque lyricism. I’m still wondering what half of it is about, lyrically and 
musically – and that’s meant as praise.
Ken Fletcher, China

Lemonade, Beyoncé

Many of you were in agreement with Guardian music’s favourite when asked for 
yours.

IMO Yes, there's loads of collaborations, producers, etc... but at the heart 
of it is an incredibly hard-working singer who has developed amazing vocal and 
performing abilities. I would love to see her in a small venue, rather than a 
stadium. Speaking as a vocal coach, I think she is incredibly dexterous and 
pretty much flawless. (There's a song title in there somewhere.)

The songs of Lemonade are fantastic in and of themselves – but the film and 
spoken word of the visual album make it soar. I would class it as one of the 
top three concept albums ever.

I agree. Lemonade is politicised and beautiful. To find your place in the 
world, and the fight for the right to be there…not easy. Anyway, "Sorry" and " 
Formation" touched me. Well done, Beyonce.

A Moon Shaped Pool, Radiohead


Radiohead made number 10 in the Guardian music rundown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/05/best-albums-of-2016-no-10-a-moon-shaped-pool-by-radiohead>
 – and in your responses were mentioned more than any other artist bar Bowie.


The most accessible and melodic Radiohead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/radiohead> album in years. A true return to 
form including the quite stunning Decks Dark and the haunting True Love Waits. 
A reminder of how significant this band is.
Jonny Marshall, Leigh on Sea

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/88877733> 
It seemed like the perfect culmination of a mature Radiohead with Johnny 
Greenwood's mastery of orchestration and arrangement.

A brilliant and haunting record that describes Radiohead at their best. Maybe 
they don’t deliver a rock opera like Paranoid Android anymore or a Stanley 
Kubrick-esque track like Idioteque, but songs like Daydreaming and Identikit 
deliver the same magic that only Radiohead can bring.
David Wahyu Hidayat, Jakarta, Indonesia 


Skeleton Tree, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds


The Observer’s review at the time called this a “raw document of grief” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/11/nick-cave-bad-seeds-skeleton-tree-review-grief>
 – and it had a powerful effect on many readers.


Whether it would have had the same emotional impact had I been unaware that 
Cave’s son died while the album was being recorded, I can’t say, but no other 
album has ever moved me in the same way before. It was around about halfway 
through the song I Need You, near the end of the album, that it finally broke 
me – it almost sounds like a guttural cry of pain, likeNick Cave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/nick-cave> was on the verge of tears 
throughout. Chances are I’ll never listen to Skeleton Tree again, but it will 
stick with me forever. A masterpiece.
Chris, Bristol

In the age of inauthenticity, Skeleton Tree is a beautiful, simple testimony 
to the rudiments of what is to be alive, in all it’s heartbreak and hope, and 
I’ve listened everyday for weeks.
Ian Seddon, Wigan

Hopelessness is a fitting title for a year that has shocked the world to its 
core and an album that has stuck with me throughout. It’s lyrics reflect the 
state of the world, from drone strikes to execution, climate crises to 
surveillance. But through the bleakness and negativity there is hope; in 
hopelessness, Anohni’s songs invoke empathy in the listener. Hopelessness is a 
call to action that unites us in its despair.
Jon Cornejo, London


Viola Beach, Viola Beach


Here, a review – one of many for the band – that speaks for itself.


Death can often make you reassess an artist’s body of work, making you cherish 
it a whole lot more. However, I truly believe even without the tragic 
circumstances surrounding this album it would still be high on my list for 
album of the year. The songs are incredibly catchy and show how fun indie pop 
can be when done right. It’s impossible to remove the tragic context from your 
mind, which adds a bittersweet element to the joyful nature of the songs, but 
I’m thankful for the great pop songs they left rather than the ones we have 
lost.
Luca Van Dresh, Brighton

22, A Million, Bon Iver


Experimentalism abounds here, and many of you were impressed enough during the 
album’s short running time to give Justin Vernon your vote.

When I read the reviews of this album I was expecting something really obtuse. 
When I heard it, it was 30-odd short minutes of pure syrupy vocal harmonic 
bliss. Lots of rising major 7ths and 9ths, sliced up saxophones and glitching 
pianos, it sounds like an early morning run on the beach, the sun cracking 
through the edge of the sky.
Bren Collins, Liverpool

Even if they (/he) were off their usual far-sighted creativity, Bon Iver 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/boniver> still produce the most interesting 
music around today. Not afraid to experiment, to distort, to wrong-foot; the 
brilliance of this album is evident from the opening bars. There is not a trite 
idea or note on this collection of songs – the only disappointment is that it 
is too short.
Joff Curtoys, York


The Colour in Anything, James Blake

Readers making the case for Blake’s third album might have been disappointed 
to see it at onlynumber 29 on the Guardian list

A bold move away from the winning formula of Overgrown, this album really gets 
under your skin, and the more I listen to it the more I hear its beauty and 
depth. My favourite track keeps changing – today it is Choose me, tomorrow it 
could be I Hope My Life –as all are so strong. Blake is ahead of his peers with 
his unique sound, amazing vocals and depth of emotion, and there are some great 
guest vocals, particularly Justin Vernon on I Need A Forest Fire.
Lizzie Reake, West Sussex 

Night Driver, Busted

Finally – though this hasn’t been an exhaustive list of your suggestions of 
course – it turns out a lot of Busted fans who found our callout really liked
the band’s return 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/27/busted-night-driver-review-charlie-simpson>
.


I have been a fan of Busted since they first emerged onto the music scene over 
14 years ago. Like most of their fans, I was heartbroken when they decided to 
split in 2005 and never imagined they would ever reunite, let alone create a 
third album. The album is completely different to Busted’s old sound, yet I 
think I prefer it. Night Driver will be on my playlist for years to come.
Ellie, South Wales

nominations or were well justified by readers.
