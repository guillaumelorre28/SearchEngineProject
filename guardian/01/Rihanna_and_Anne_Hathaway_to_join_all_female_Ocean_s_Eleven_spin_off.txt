Rihanna and Anne Hathaway <https://www.theguardian.com/film/anne-hathaway> are 
set to join the all-female lineup of an Ocean’s Eleven spin-off.

According to Deadline

, Helena Bonham Carter, Mindy Kaling and rapper and actor Awkwafina are also 
close to signing on to the crime comedy. Awkwafina, also known as Nora Lum, was 
recently seen inBad Neighbours 2

. They will join Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett, who were already attached.

“It’s a really good script — but I still don’t know if I’m going to be in it,” 
Bonham Carter toldEntertainment Weekly 
<http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/28/helena-bonham-carter-oceans-eight> in 
June. “But it’s a great script, and it’s great for women. Just hilarious.”

The film will be known as Ocean’s Eight, which means that one lead actor is 
still to be cast. Rumours have suggested that Elizabeth Banks may join the 
film. It will be directed by Gary Ross, known for The Hunger Games and 
Seabiscuit, and will be produced by Steven Soderbergh, who directed the 2001 
remake of the 1960 original, which starred Frank Sinatra as Danny Ocean.

“I think it’s a pretty similar tone,” Ross told Slashfilm 
<http://www.slashfilm.com/gary-ross-discusses-oceans-eight/> in June. “This is 
very much an extension and a continuation ... I’m in no way trying to reinvent 
the tone, and I’m thrilled and honoured to be extending it. It’s really fun to 
work with.”

The news comes after reports that the all-female Ghostbusters reboot 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-heading-70m-loss-sequel-918515>
 will lose $70m (£54m), making further instalments unlikely.
