It was only a few months into my career as a movie location scout in New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> City that I was first asked to 
find a neighbourhood that didn’t exist.


 In 2008, I was scouting on a gritty police thriller, and had been assigned 
the job of driving one of the designers around to various potential shooting 
locations. He took a particular interest in a scene set in a down-and-out 
neighbourhood, and asked me to take him through the “bad sections” of Brooklyn.

This posed a slight problem: I had no idea where to go. 

 I started with Bushwick – at the time, a heavily industrial area still years 
away from its current revival as a haven for young artists. As we drove past 
the crumbling factories and weed-strewn lots, I was sure I had a winner. “Not 
residential enough,” the designer groused.

 From there, we headed south through Bed-Stuy, where crime rates were still 
particularly high (a friend had recently been mugged and beaten with an 
aluminium bat while returning to his apartment late one night). Another 
misfire: with its tree-lined streets and rows of beautiful townhouses, 
“down-and-out” was the last way anyone would describe Bed-Stuy, even then.

‘You know, the bad neighbourhoods! Burning barrels! Trash everywhere! Where do 
we find it?’

 After striking out in Crown Heights, Brownsville and East New York (often 
referred to as the “murder capital of New York”), I was literally out of 
options. The designer was undeterred. “You know what I mean – the bad 
neighbourhoods! Burning barrels! Trash everywhere! Homeless people in the 
street! Where do we find it?”

 That’s when I realised we were looking for something that only exists in the 
movies.

There is no other city one can know as completely from the movies and 
television as New York. Even if you’ve never set foot in Manhattan, there’s a 
good chance you can instantly picture a multitude of its neighbourhoods: Carrie 
Bradshaw’s favourite cupcake spot (the Village); the Ghostbusters’ firehouse 
(TriBeCa); the deli where Harry met Sally (Lower East Side).


 As a scout, it’s my job to find the real-world locations that best match the 
director’s vision of New York. The problem arises when that vision comes not 
from real life, but from the movies.

 Take alleyways, for example. From the movies, you’d think Manhattan to be 
riddled with dank, dangerous, trash-strewn back-alleys, complete with rusting 
fire escapes and crumbling, graffiti-covered brick walls. So it often comes as 
a total shock to most directors when we tell them that Manhattan actually has 
only three or four of these types of alleys (Cortlandt Alley, Great Jones 
Alley, Broadway Alley, Staple Street), and none are dangerous in the slightest.

 Will this cause a film-maker to rewrite the scene for a location that 
actually exists in modern-day,gentrified Manhattan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/06/dangers-ecogentrification-best-way-make-city-greener>
 and treat New York as a living, breathing world? Never, which is why you’ve 
seen these four alleyways used over and over again, perpetuating the same tired 
cliche. Similarly, the nonexistence of a “bad neighbourhood” as described above 
didn’t stop that particular director from simply dressing down a random street 
to fit his desired look.

This has not always been the case. For decades, film-makers came to New York 
City not for a generic urban backlot set, but to capture the essence of the 
city. ConsiderTaxi Driver <https://www.theguardian.com/film/taxi-driver> and 
Annie Hall. Despite being made less than a year apart (1976 and 1977, 
respectively), their competing portrayals of New York couldn’t be more 
different. Whereas Scorsese’s New York is a simmering cauldron of filth, 
neglect and despair, Allen’s is a playground for the upper-crust intelligentsia 
and middle-aged hippies.

 And yet both are valid representations of New York at the time. Each director 
simply focused on and exaggerated the elements of the city that pertained most 
to his story.

Exaggeration has always been a fundamental aspect of film-making. You’ll often 
hear a director or production designer complaining that a particular 
neighbourhood “does not look enough like itself”, and making various cosmetic 
changes – a nondescript wall in the East Village might be gussied up with 
flyers for punk shows, for example, or a Chinatown byway given additional 
Chinese signage and decoration, as was done on Disney’s The Sorcerer’s 
Apprentice.

Exaggeration is one thing. Flat-out lying is another.

 The trajectory of this unfortunate shift in New York film-making is perhaps 
best exemplified by looking at how Coney Island has been portrayed throughout 
film history. Since the dawn of cinema, Coney Island has been a beloved 
shooting location. From the early 1900s through the 1950s, film-makers 
emphasised its glorious, one-of-a-kind splendour, from silent shorts starring 
Fatty Arbuckle and Buster Keaton through the seminal 1953 cinéma vérité 
classic, Little Fugitive.

As Coney Island’s fortunes shifted into decline in the 1960s and 1970s, its 
portrayal in the movies followed suit. Allen emphasises this inAnnie Hall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/annie-hall> by contrasting the nostalgic 
perfection of the park from his childhood to its then desolate state. By 1979, 
it was so dilapidated that The Warriors was able to depict it as a 
post-apocalyptic wasteland with only minor changes.

Today, Coney Island 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/may/15/coney-island-new-york-photos-sixties-pictures>
 is a neighbourhood desperately trying to find its identity in the 21st 
century. While the Cyclone rollercoaster, the Wonder Wheel and Nathan’s Hot 
Dogs continue to thrive, much of its iconic architecture has been bulldozed, 
leaving enormous vacant lots and an otherworldly feeling of abandonment to what 
should be a joyous, carnival atmosphere. How fascinating it would be to capture 
such a singular neighbourhood in flux on film.

The same four alleyways in New York are used over and over again, perpetuating 
the same tired cliche

And yet today, film-makers instead simply treat it as a backlot set, a blank 
slate to create whatever version of amusement park best fits a script. A great 
example of this can be found in two competing episodes of Law & Order: SVU. In 
the season 10 finale, Zebras, the park is shown as a thriving joyland, packed 
to the gills with parents and children enjoying state-of-the-art rides while 
munching on popcorn and cotton candy. But just three seasons later, it would be 
depicted in another episode, Strange Beauty, as a mysterious, freak-filled 
carnival home to body-mutilation enthusiasts, the last place a family would 
think to go. The fact that neither of these portrayals resemble reality hardly 
seems to have bothered the film-makers.

 A blank slate, not a real neighbourhood ... Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke at 
Coney Island in 9 1/2 Weeks (1986). Photograph: Art Zelin/Getty Images 
A few summers ago, I was hired to scout for a movie being shot entirely in the 
Bronx. If you believe its Hollywood portrayal, the Bronx is hell on Earth, a 
lawless Gomorrah of sin and vice where crime runs unchecked and if your car 
breaks down in the Bronx, you better run like hell.

I knew this wasn’t the case, but I was still a bit nervous when I first 
started scouting. We were shooting in some of the more dangerous 
neighbourhoods, and walking the streets with a big stack of neon flyers and a 
$5,000 camera around my neck, my mind kept returning to ... well, the movies.

Sure enough, on my first day, a tough-looking guy came right up to me as I was 
walking down the street. “Nice camera,” he said.

This was it. A scene I’d watched a million times over. I knew exactly how it 
was going to end.

“What kind of lens you got?” he asked. 

“Canon 24-70mm L-series,” I replied.

“Cool. I’ve been thinking of getting one myself.”

With that, he walked off down the street and disappeared.

Just like in the movies, right?

For the rest of my scouting gig that summer, I had more casual, friendly 
exchanges like this with people on the street than I can count. In New York 
City, random conversations with strangers are usually to be avoided like the 
plague. And yet the Bronx reminded me of my travels in the midwest, where a 
visit to the grocery store might lead to a five-minute conversation with a 
clerk you’ve never met before about your recent vacation to Hawaii. There’s a 
wonderful, almost small-town spirit that permeates much of the Bronx, and I can 
easily say it’s the friendliest borough in New York.

 Of course, you’d never know it from watching the film I worked on. Once 
again, the Bronx was treated as a desolate hellhole. I’m not even sure if the 
director had ever set foot there before. But he had seen it in the movies.
