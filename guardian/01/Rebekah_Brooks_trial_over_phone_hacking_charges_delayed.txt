The trial of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/rebekahwade> has been delayed by seven weeks.

Brooks and seven other defendants, including her racehorse trainer husband, 
Charlie, and David Cameron's former head of communicationsAndy Coulson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/andy-coulson>, were due to face 
phone-hacking charges in a three-month trial, starting 9 September.

The trial will now not start until 28 October after Mr Justice Saunders 
adjourned the case for legal reasons at a hearing in the Old Bailey. Those 
reasons cannot be reported.

The other defendants are Stuart Kuttner, a former managing editor of News of 
the World, Ian Edmondson, a former head of news on the now defunct tabloid, 
Cheryl Carter, Rebekah Brooks's former secretary, Mark Hanna, head of security 
for News International, and Clive Goodman, a former NoW royal correspondent.

Brooks faces five charges in relation to allegations of conspiracy to hack 
phones, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and conspiracy to commit 
misconduct in public office.

Coulson is facing three charges in relation to allegations of conspiring to 
hack phones and allegations over a conspiracy to commit misconduct in public 
office when he was NoW editor.

Brooks, Coulson and the other defendants have all denied the charges and 
pleaded not guilty.
