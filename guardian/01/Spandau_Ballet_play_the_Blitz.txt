There was a Tory government in power and a new scene in London clubland, 
spearheaded by Steve Strange and Rusty Egan at the Blitz. The outlandish 
regulars – AKA the Blitz Kids – soon had their own house band, Spandau Ballet, 
who wanted to return pop to what songwriter Gary Kemp called a "visual 
extravaganza" in the spirit of Ziggy Stardust. Dressing up and dancing was in; 
anything dour was definitely out (it was only later that they made that song, 
True).
