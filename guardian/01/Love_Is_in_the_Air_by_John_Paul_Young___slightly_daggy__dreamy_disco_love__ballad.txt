Call it my Sliding Doors moment: in 1992 my mother and I went to Greater Union 
cinema on Russell Street, Melbourne, to see Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin in 
Housesitter. As it turned out, that evening’s sessions of the screwball hit 
were sold out, so we took a punt instead on the newly releasedStrictly Ballroom

Strictly Ballroom: Rewatching classic Australian films

By the time John Paul Young’s Love Is in the Air played the film off, I was 
weeping hysterically – a response I still enjoy to this day – and convinced 
this was a new classic. As it turned out, I was correct: the film went on to be 
a box office smash, and is still perhaps the most successful crystallisation of 
Baz Luhrmann’s particular vision (if only he’d had just $3m a movie to play 
with for the rest of his career).


My disappointment at not having been able to see Housesitter evaporated 
instantly over a fistful of rapidly melting compound chocolate and ice cream as 
soon as the Blue Danube fired up and Scott and Liz walked through those glass 
doors and into the Southern Districts Waratah Championships.

And it was JPY’s dreamy disco love ballad that stuck with me as one of the 
most romantic songs of all time. I guess these are the sorts of opinions you 
have at 10-and-a-half – especially one as eccentric as myself (I was alreadyvery
 interested in costume design, especially rhinestones, and eminently quotable 
films). But listening to the song today, I still agree with my fun-sized self.

Young’s hit, with its slightly daggy, not-quite-fast-enough disco beat, was 
the perfect fit for the film: in 1992 the world of competitive ballroom dancing 
was, in a pre-Dancing with the Stars world, not considered especially groovy. 
In a funny way, though, it’s that specific quality that makes Love Is in the 
Air such an appealing song.

Testament to the production nous of Harry Vanda and George Young (no 
relation), JPY had originally asked the songwriting gurus to pen him a 
potential hit for the German market after his singleStanding in the Rain 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPccGxm4y7Y> had become a runaway success 
there. Inspired by the “clicks and electronic buzzes” of Euro disco, even if 
the end result wasn’t quiteGiorgio Moroder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/may/29/giorgio-moroder-10-groundbreaking-tunes>
, it remains one of Australia’s enduring disco classics.

In truth, there wasn’t an awful lot of difference between the 1978 original 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNC0kIzM1Fo> and the 1992 redo that 
accompanied the film (the biggest was the loss, RIP, of his glorious Timotei 
mane): a new intro based on David Hirschfelder’s score, a punched up version of 
the original arrangement, and a heavenly backing choir.

But it was those subtle differences that took it from sweetly earnest disco 
slow jam and into the stratosphere – helped immeasurably by the very Luhrmann 
music video for the new version:

Strictly Ballroom the Musical review – plenty of sparkle but not much

I haven’t seen the stage production of Strictly Ballroom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/australia-culture-blog/2014/apr/13/strictly-ballroom-the-musical-review-plenty-of-sparkle-but-not-much-emotional-depth>
 that is now playing in Melbourne, and I’m not sure that I will – how could it 
ever hope to recapture the alchemy that led to its cinematic predecessor’s 
success?

There’s an innocence (though some would probably say an infantile quality) to 
Love Is in the Air’s lyrics, what with its vague and wistful references to “the 
whisper of the trees” and “the thunder of the sea”. Perhaps that’s why it 
struck such a chord with preteen me, whose idea of romance was only just 
beginning to take shape.

Either way, to this day, whenever Valentine’s Day rolls around I take a break 
from cynicism by putting John Paul Young on the stereo and weeping freely while 
thinking of Scott and Fran’s triumph at the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix.
