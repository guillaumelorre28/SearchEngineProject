 spy on the world body’s communications.

 “We obviously have security and safety measures in place including through 
... our information and technology department. We are looking at this and how 
best to respond,” UN spokeswoman Vannina Maestracci told reporters.

 “The United States authorities had previously given us assurances as to the 
fact they are not and were not monitoring our communications,” she said.

The United Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations> said in 
2013 that the United States had pledged not to spy on the world body’s 
communications after a report that the NSA had gained access to the UN video 
conferencing system.

 “The inviolability of the United Nations is well established under 
international law and we expect member states to act accordingly and to respect 
and protect that inviolability,” Maestracci said.

 The 1961 Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations protects functions 
of the United Nations, diplomatic missions and other international 
organizations.
