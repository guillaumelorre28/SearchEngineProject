The Argentina coach Edgardo Bauza has travelled to Spain in an effort to 
persuadeLionel Messi <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lionel-messi> to 
stay on the national team.

Messi, a record five-times world player of the year, said in June  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/27/lionel-messi-says-he-is-quitting-argentina-team-after-copa-america-final-defeat>
that “the national team is over for me” following Argentina’s loss in the Copa 
América final. That was Argentina’s third straight loss in a final, including 
the 2014 World Cup.

Bauza said on his arrival in Barcelona: “The sensations are good because I 
will talk about football, a language we both know.

“That talk will lead to a decision but I’ve not come to convince Messi, I’ve 
come to talk about football. He can tell me his frustration and I can express 
to him the idea that I have of the national team, so he feels comfortable.

“I’m here to talk to both Messi and Javier Mascherano and if I have time I’ll 
be travelling to another destination. I’m optimistic by nature,” added Bauza.

Bauza took over as Argentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> 
coach after Gerardo Martino stepped down following the Copa América.

Messi will kick off his season on Sunday, when Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona> play in the Spanish Super Cup 
against Sevilla.
