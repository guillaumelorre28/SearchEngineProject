It was a beautiful evening, warm but not too warm. Helena Ayeh, a freelance 
architect, had stepped out from her apartment on 23rd Street, to buy some wine 
to go with the dinner she was about to cook.

“I was going to make a lovely meal, some fish and asparagus,” she said. “I was 
really looking forward to it.”

Ayeh strolled to a wine store in the West Village, then headed home with a 
bottle of Burgundy, a bottle of Bordeaux “and a plonk”. There were 10 to 15 
paces left, she thought, before she reached the entrance to her building, 
between Sixth and Seventh Avenues in Chelsea.

“I heard the biggest bang ever,” she said, “and the next thing I knew I was 
airborne.”

Ayeh was knocked forward then down to the sidewalk. She scrambled up, confused.

“I felt for my keys in my bag; my knees were wobbly. When I pulled my keys 
out, I couldn’t see them properly – everything was blurry. I must have realized 
there had been some sort of blast, because I wondered if my glasses had been 
blown off. But they were intact.”

On Friday, sitting in her sunlit sixth-floor studio, Ayeh put her hand to her 
glasses. She recalled her realisation that there was glass underfoot and one of 
her sandals was broken. She had put one hand up to her right eye.

“It was all wet. I saw blood and that’s when I freaked out. I ran into the 
road shouting, ‘Help, help’. Some man came up and put his arm around me. I 
learned later that it was plainclothes police officer.”

Six days after a bomb exploded directly opposite her apartment building, 
Ayeh’s right eye is still vividly bloodshot, with dark bruising below. She is 
one of 31 people who were injured when the Chelsea bomb exploded, at around 
8.30pm on Saturday 18 September. Shortly after that, another pressure cooker 
bomb was retrieved, unexploded, from 27th Street.New York

terrorist was likely at large.

“I’ve heard nothing, zilch’

On Monday morning, prime suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/ahmad-khan-rahami-pakistan-taliban-new-york-bombing-terrorism>
, 28, was arrested in Linden, New Jersey. An Afghan-born US citizen, he has 
been charged in connection with both New York bombs and several explosives that 
were found in New Jersey. Two of those devices exploded – no one was hurt.

As Ayeh spoke on Friday, Rahami was still in hospital, having been shot and 
seriously wounded during his arrest. He had yet to appear before a judge. His 
father, Mohammad Rahami, said he had warned the FBI his son was a potential 
terrorist, but they did not interview Ahmad.

It is believed Ahmad Khan Rahami may have become radicalized on visits to 
Pakistan, where he spent time studying in an area where the Taliban has a heavy 
presence,the Guardian revealed on Friday

Father of bombing suspect says he contacted FBI in 2014

The 23rd Street bomb was filled with ball bearings, but it did not kill 
anyone. Nonetheless, while the sense among New Yorkers is that their city has 
had a lucky escape, Ayeh and others spent time in in four hospitals, spread 
across Manhattan.

A handful of those injured declined medical attention. Others were bleeding 
profusely from lacerations, pierced by shrapnel, nursing concussions and broken 
teeth or, in the case of a woman who had been driving on 23rd Street with her 
boyfriend, wondering whether her unborn baby would be OK.

Ayeh said on Friday that when people were killed, many forget the injured. 
Even in this case, where, perhaps miraculously, no one died, nobody from the 
city authorities had been in contact with Ayeh since the bombing.

“I’ve heard nothing, zilch,” she said, though she commended authorities for 
finding the suspect and capturing him alive.

She was shocked, she said, that although New York mayor Bill de Blasio had 
been on the scene on 23rd Street in the days after the bombing, he had not, so 
far as she was aware, contacted those who were injured. She certainly had not 
heard from anyone from city or state government. FBI agents had been “very 
sweet”, she said, and had checked up on her. Someone even left a bunch of Get 
Well balloons outside her apartment.

After the blast, Ayeh said, she was quickly bundled into an ambulance. “First 
thing I asked the medic inside was, ‘Is my eye still there?’ and she said it 
was.”

The bleeding wouldn’t stop. Ayeh’s white T-shirt and shorts were soaked. The 
paramedic told her to close both her eyes and stay still.

The paramedic said, ‘Do you believe in God?’ and I said ‘yes’, and she said 
‘pray’. I thought, ‘That’s not good.’

“She said, ‘Do you believe in God?’ and I said ‘yes’, and she said ‘pray’. I 
thought, ‘That’s not good.’ I started mumbling a prayer, I asked her to pray 
for me too and she said, ‘I’ve been praying all along’. That was worrying. I 
could feel the blood dripping on to my arm.”

At the hospital, a nurse called one of Ayeh’s friends. Ayeh recalled a 
“precious moment” of relief when her friend Sylvia arrived.

She was still dazed and in pain. She waited on a stretcher for several hours. 
She was given a Cat scan and a specialist examined her. She had also hurt her 
knee, her right arm and her wrists and hands, though not seriously.

There were no splinters of glass, metal or other shrapnel in her eye. The main 
cut was in the eyelid. Hospital staff stitched her up and gave her some fresh 
clothes. Then she was released.

She had been holding on to her purse with a death grip, she said, but although 
she had her ID and keys, law enforcement officers would not allow her back on 
to her block. She showed them the bloodied clothes in her bag and bandaged 
head. No dice.

“So I just wandered the streets,” she said. She had a coffee, then when her 
gym opened at 8am she sat in there for while. Around 11am she begged a police 
officer to escort her to her apartment. She succeeded, and has since been 
interviewed by the FBI.

‘It’s rough. I’m not sure of my next step’

As a freelance architect, Ayeh specializes in residential buildings. She had 
been taken on for a project that would last until the end of the year, and on 
Monday, despite pain and a burning sensation in her swollen eye, she went to 
the office. After 10 minutes, she knew her blurry vision meant she could not 
read documents or a computer screen. She was let go from the project.

“I understand,” she said. “Architects have deadlines and I was commissioned 
because they needed someone immediately, so they could not delay while I healed 
… but it’s rough. I’m not sure of my next step.”

Ayeh was born in Ghana and qualified as an architect there after attending 
private school in the capital, Accra. Her late mother was a diplomat, her late 
father a lawyer. She lived in France and traveled extensively before settling 
in New York 25 years ago, then gaining US citizenship.

She has been told her vision will recover completely. Like a true New Yorker, 
she is waiting impatiently.

“I’m not one to sit around,” she said. Calls from friends have helped and she 
has been walking west to the Hudson, to watch the sunsets.

“It’s very calm at the river,” she said.
