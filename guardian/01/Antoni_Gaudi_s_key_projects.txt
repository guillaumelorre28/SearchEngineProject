Casa Vicens (1878-1880) 
 Gaudí's first major commission in Barcelona; Moorish-influenced villa. 


Palau Güell (1886-1889) 
 Mansion for the Catalan industrial tycoon; ornate walls and ceilings. 


College of the Teresianas (1888-1890) 
 The parent convent of the sisterhood of Teresa, the relatively sober building 
of the college had already been started when Gaudí was commissioned to complete 
the project.


Crypt of the Church of Colònia Güell (1898-1916) 

Brainchild of Eusebi Güell, Gaudí's greatest patron, who also commissioned the 
Palau Güell and the park; only the crypt was completed.


Casa Calvet (1898-1900) 
 Built for textile magnate Pere Calvet, now converted to private apartments, 
with a restaurant in Calvet's former groundfloor offices.


Casa Batlló (1905-1907) 
 Gaudí's other great house in the Passeig de Gràcia, known locally as the Casa 
dels Ossos (house of bones).


Park Güell (1900-1914) 
 Steep garden complex with architectural elements (and much-photographed 
lizard fountain), in the Gràcia district of Barcelona; a festival of trencadís, 
the Catalan broken mosaic technique.


Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família (1882- present) 
 Vast Roman basilica, still under construction. Gaudí worked on the project 
for over 40 years, and the last 15 years of his life were entirely devoted to 
it. Since his death, work has been based on reconstructions.
