The most successful sailor in Olympic Games history is to join forces with 
Formula One’s most decorated designer in a bid to win the America’s Cup.

The quadruple gold medallist Ben Ainslie and Adrian Newey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adrian-newey>, who has helped several F1 
teams win numerous drivers’ and constructors’ titles over the years, are to 
pool their considerable expertise for the 2017 race.

The 37-year-old yachtsman formed Ben Ainslie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ainslie> Racing in December last year and a 
month later the 37-year-old confirmed his intention to target sailing’s top 
trophy, which has never been in British hands since the race started in 1851.

During the recent F1 season, Red Bull said Newey would be taking a backseat in 
his role as the chief technical officer, and instead focus on a new position as 
the head ofRed Bull <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/red-bull> Advanced 
Technologies.

BAR are to work with RBAT on the America’s Cup project to draw on the latter’s 
expertise and knowledge.

A joint statement read: “Founded on the group’s impressive F1 DNA, which has 
resulted in eightFormula One <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone> 
world championships in the last five seasons, RBAT excels in advanced 
simulation and mathematical modelling.

“RBAT will apply its simulation and modelling skills to assist Ben Ainslie 
Racing in various areas of their campaign, as BAR aims to bring the America’s 
Cup home to Britain.”

Ainslie added: “BAR are really excited to be partnering with Red Bull Advanced 
Technologies. We are in a unique position in this country, and this campaign is 
about assimilating the very best of British in design and engineering – RBAT 
epitomises this.”
