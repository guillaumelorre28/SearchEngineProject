Mail Online’s revenues increased by 20% to £36m in the six months to the end 
of March, a sharp slowdown compared with last year and not enough to offset the 
advertising and sales decline at the Daily Mail andMail on Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/mailonsunday>.

Its owner, Daily Mail <https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailymail> & General 
Trust, said total revenue across its Mail businesses fell by 4% to £296m 
compared with the same period last year.

The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday saw total revenues fall 6% year on year from 
£278m to £260m, with an 8% decline in print advertising revenue and a 4% 
decline in sales revenues.

The print titles lost £18m in revenue year-on-year for the period, while Mail 
Online <https://www.theguardian.com/media/mail-online> managed to add £6m 
growing 20% year-on-year from £30m to £36m.

Mail Online’s revenue growth has halved compared to the 40% achieved last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/26/mail-online-revenues-grow>, 
although the US operation is surging with 47% growth in the first six months 
this year.


Total advertising revenues across the Mail businesses was £131m, a 2% fall, as 
print advertising fell 8% (£8m) and Mail Online’s 20% boost (£6m) in revenue 
fell just short of offsetting the fall.

DMGT said that the underlying increase in digital advertising revenues across 
its entire DMG Media portfolio – which includes businesses such as free sheet 
Metro and daily deals operation Wowcher – continues to exceed the ongoing 
decline in print advertising revenues.

The company said that total underlying advertising revenues increased by 2%.

Its Mail businesses saw profits rise 21% to £46m. 

Metro saw revenues rise 4% year on year to £39m. Wowcher increased its 
revenues by 32% to £15m.

In January, DMG Media acquired Elite Daily, the US-based news and 
entertainment website popular with 18- to 34-year-olds. It continues to be run 
as a separate business and is expected to make a small loss this year.

Operating profits for Metro, Wowcher and Elite Daily rose by 39% to £10m.
