Brandis-Gleeson stoush: the summary

This is what we know, that we did not know this morning. 

 * The solicitor general, Justin Gleeson, believes the legal services 
direction that all requests come through the attorney general wasinvalid and 
had already ignored it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/gleeson-says-he-ignored-invalid-direction-from-brandis-to-seek-consent>
.

 * Brandis denied that Gleeson had ignored the direction because the matter 
Gleeson acted on came directly from Brandis. Therefore he did not need 
Brandis’s consent.

 * Brandis said Gleeson disclosed this advice – which related to the 
composition of the Senate – without Brandis’s consent, a fact which left the AG 
“astonished”.

 * Gleeson had a conversation with Labor’s shadow attorney general, Mark 
Dreyfus, during the caretaker period in the election campaign and told him he 
did not agree with the legal services direction and was not consulted.

 * Brandis said Gleeson should have informed him of his conversation with 
Dreyfus when it happened, even if he thought it was the right thing today – 
which Brandis disputed. Brandis said Gleeson should have sought permission to 
speak to Dreyfus during the election period.

We are going over old ground here. This ground has been well and truly 
ploughed.Ian Macdonald had his last go. Greens senator Nick McKim has his last 
questions.

So I need to pull up too.

Thanks to Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens. Also thanks to Mike Bowers and 
Katharine Murphy for coming in on their days off in order for me to bring you 
the blog.

Goodnight and see you bright and early on Monday morning.

Brandis has talked about why the citizenship bill in question changed a number 
of times.


The bill related to removing citizenship from sole citizens over terrorism 
suspects. It is contentious in this committee because while Gleeson gave advice 
on the earlier draft, he had drawn a different conclusion on later drafts. He 
objected to Brandis using his earlier opinion – that the bill would withstand 
high court challenge – when the bill had been changed since that time.

Brandis has told the committee this afternoon the bill had to change a number 
of times because the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, wantedPeter Dutton and 
George Brandis on the same page. 

But Dutton and Brandis were at odds and the cabinet was split, as shown in 
Peter Hartcher and James Massola’s story in May last year

This is Dreyfus’s statement:

Today’s Senate inquiry has put beyond doubt that Senator Brandis has destroyed 
the integrity of the office of the solicitor general and knowingly misled the 
Senate. He must resign.

Senator Brandis – through his own inexcusable actions – has made his own 
position untenable.

If he does not resign, then prime minister Turnbull must live by the standard 
he has set himself and sack him.

Solicitor general Justin Gleeson, in an appearance at the Senate committee 
today, could not have been clearer in establishing the following facts:

 * Senator Brandis’s statement to parliament that the solicitor general was 
consulted about the legal services direction “was not an accurate statement”; 
 * He was not consulted, in any way, about the legal services direction that 
was issued on 4 May; 
 * Senator Brandis said he had received Mr Gleeson’s advice on the 
constitutionality of the final version of the Australian citizenship amendment 
(allegiance to Australia) bill 2015 whenin fact he had not; 
 * Mr Gleeson’s ability to do his job, without impediment or interference, has 
beenseverely compromised. 
Senator Brandis has now, on repeated occasions, knowingly misled the Senate 
with his statements that he had in fact consulted the solicitor general. After 
today’s Senate hearing we now know, beyond doubt, that is not true.

Brandis says (in his mind) when he “consulted” Gleeson, he had not decided to 
implement the LSD (legal services direction).

Mark Dreyfus is speaking, calling for Brandis to resign.

He described LNP senators’ behaviour towards Gleeson as:

extraordinary, disrespectful, rude conduct.

Dreyfus said it was inappropriate behaviour towards senior statutory office 
holders.

He called on Turnbull to make it clear to the senators it was inappropriate.

Brandis says there is an obligation on every legal practitioner, solicitors or 
barristers, not to disclose advice.

Even if there is some “construction” from Gleeson for talking to Mark Dreyfus 
during an election campaign, Brandis says there is no excuse for not telling 
Brandis.

He says Gleeson should have sought Brandis’ consent first and if Gleeson 
thought he was obligated to talk to Dreyfus, Gleeson should have recommended to 
Brandis that the AG allow it.

Brandis said he may have sought advice and may well have allowed the 
conversation to take place.

Reynolds again complains about the treatment of Brandis by Watt.

Brandis again steps in and says he is fine. He notes Watt was very polite to 
Gleeson but:

If you want to be rude to me, go right ahead.

Murray Watt just questioned why the secretary of the department, Chris Moraitis
, did not appear. I missed the comment but general outrage ensued and Watt 
withdrew – given Moraitis had requested leave some time before.

Brandis says as a lawyer “all of my adult life” he understands lawyers have 
different views about different contestable issues.

This is what we know, that we did not know this morning. 

 * The solicitor general, Justin Gleeson, believes the legal services 
direction that all requests come through the attorney general wasinvalid and 
had already ignored it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/gleeson-says-he-ignored-invalid-direction-from-brandis-to-seek-consent>
.

 * Brandis denied that Gleeson had ignored the direction because the matter 
Gleeson acted on came directly from Brandis. Therefore he did not need 
Brandis’s consent.

 * Brandis said Gleeson disclosed this advice – which related to the 
composition of the Senate – without Brandis’s consent, a fact which left the AG 
“astonished”.

 * Gleeson had a conversation with Labor’s shadow attorney general, Mark 
Dreyfus, during the caretaker period in the election campaign and told him he 
did not agree with the legal services direction and was not consulted.

 * Brandis said Gleeson should have informed him of his conversation with 
Dreyfus when it happened, even if he thought it was the right thing today – 
which Brandis disputed. Brandis said Gleeson should have sought permission to 
speak to Dreyfus during the election period.

We are going over old ground here. This ground has been well and truly 
ploughed.Ian Macdonald had his last go. Greens senator Nick McKim has his last 
questions.

So I need to pull up too.

Thanks to Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens. Also thanks to Mike Bowers and 
Katharine Murphy for coming in on their days off in order for me to bring you 
the blog.

Goodnight and see you bright and early on Monday morning.

Brandis has talked about why the citizenship bill in question changed a number 
of times.


The bill related to removing citizenship from sole citizens over terrorism 
suspects. It is contentious in this committee because while Gleeson gave advice 
on the earlier draft, he had drawn a different conclusion on later drafts. He 
objected to Brandis using his earlier opinion – that the bill would withstand 
high court challenge – when the bill had been changed since that time.

Brandis has told the committee this afternoon the bill had to change a number 
of times because the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, wantedPeter Dutton and 
George Brandis on the same page. 

But Dutton and Brandis were at odds and the cabinet was split, as shown in 
Peter Hartcher and James Massola’s story in May last year

This is Dreyfus’s statement:

Today’s Senate inquiry has put beyond doubt that Senator Brandis has destroyed 
the integrity of the office of the solicitor general and knowingly misled the 
Senate. He must resign.

Senator Brandis – through his own inexcusable actions – has made his own 
position untenable.

If he does not resign, then prime minister Turnbull must live by the standard 
he has set himself and sack him.

Solicitor general Justin Gleeson, in an appearance at the Senate committee 
today, could not have been clearer in establishing the following facts:

 * Senator Brandis’s statement to parliament that the solicitor general was 
consulted about the legal services direction “was not an accurate statement”; 
 * He was not consulted, in any way, about the legal services direction that 
was issued on 4 May; 
 * Senator Brandis said he had received Mr Gleeson’s advice on the 
constitutionality of the final version of the Australian citizenship amendment 
(allegiance to Australia) bill 2015 whenin fact he had not; 
 * Mr Gleeson’s ability to do his job, without impediment or interference, has 
beenseverely compromised. 
Senator Brandis has now, on repeated occasions, knowingly misled the Senate 
with his statements that he had in fact consulted the solicitor general. After 
today’s Senate hearing we now know, beyond doubt, that is not true.
 
Dreyfus confirmed he had a conversation with Gleeson during the caretaker 
period.
 
Brandis says (in his mind) when he “consulted” Gleeson, he had not decided to 
implement the LSD (legal services direction).

Mark Dreyfus is speaking, calling for Brandis to resign.

He described LNP senators’ behaviour towards Gleeson as:

extraordinary, disrespectful, rude conduct.

Dreyfus said it was inappropriate behaviour towards senior statutory office 
holders.

He called on Turnbull to make it clear to the senators it was inappropriate.

Brandis says there is an obligation on every legal practitioner, solicitors or 
barristers, not to disclose advice.

Even if there is some “construction” from Gleeson for talking to Mark Dreyfus 
during an election campaign, Brandis says there is no excuse for not telling 
Brandis.

He says Gleeson should have sought Brandis’ consent first and if Gleeson 
thought he was obligated to talk to Dreyfus, Gleeson should have recommended to 
Brandis that the AG allow it.

Brandis said he may have sought advice and may well have allowed the 
conversation to take place.

Reynolds again complains about the treatment of Brandis by Watt.

Brandis again steps in and says he is fine. He notes Watt was very polite to 
Gleeson but:

If you want to be rude to me, go right ahead.
 
Murray Watt just questioned why the secretary of the department, Chris Moraitis
, did not appear. I missed the comment but general outrage ensued and Watt 
withdrew – given Moraitis had requested leave some time before.
 
Watts says former SG Griffiths, the current SG Gleeson and Sir Anthony Mason 
disagree with the direction at issue.

Brandis says as a lawyer “all of my adult life” he understands lawyers have 
different views about different contestable issues.

Only in the high court, does the majority rule.
