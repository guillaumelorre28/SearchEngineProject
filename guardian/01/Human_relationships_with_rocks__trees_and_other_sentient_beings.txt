Paul Kingsnorth urges us to follow the poet Robinson Jeffers in “unhumanising” 
our views, to open our (human) minds “from ourselves” (The call of the wild 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/23/paul-kingsnorth-imagine-how-land-feels>
, Review, 23 July). He presents an inspiring list of novels to help us to 
acknowledge the sentience of other beings. Many ethnographers also help us to 
gain precious insight into other ways of thinking. From the 1930s Alfred Irving 
Hallowell adopted the phrase “other-than-human persons” in his exploration of 
relationships between entities such as rocks and humans among the Northern 
Ojibwe (Canada) and how these sentient others reveal themselves to people. More 
recently, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro has been urging us to exchange 
perspectives not only with other human beings whose intellectual traditions 
differ from the “artifact[s] of western individualism” discussed by Kingsnorth 
but also with other sentient beings of the cosmos. In what he calls 
perspectival multinaturalism, Viveiros de Castro argues there is no one 
undifferentiated state of “nature” as western orthodoxy would have it. Eduardo 
Kohn’s How Forests Think is an example of an ethnography that dissolves human 
and non-human categories. He set himself the task of understanding the 
existence of forests as an emergent process in which human and non-human beings 
engage in making and communicating signs to each other.
