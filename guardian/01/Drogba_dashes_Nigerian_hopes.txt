Ivory Coast booked their place in the African Cup of Nations final with a 1 - 
0 win overNigeria <https://www.theguardian.com/football/nigeria-football-team>.

The Ivorians have not made it to the final of the competition for 14 years, 
but went through thanks to a 47th minute goal from Chelsea's Didier Drogba.

Drogba had already tested Nigerian keeper Vincent Enyeama from a free-kick 
just outside the area when he nipped past Joseph Enakahire, onto a long ball, 
and calmly side-footed it home.

The Nigerians refused to lie down but were unable to find a way past some 
stern Ivorian defending. Ivory Coast will now face the winner either Egypt or 
Senegal (who meet later today) in the final.
