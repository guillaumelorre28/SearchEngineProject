how are you? its been some time. just been following the latest developments 
in syria -- i think its great that the opposition are willing to speak to the 
syrian gov in russia. i know their condition seems outrageous, but in all 
honesty -- looking at the tide of history and the escalation of recent events 
-- we've seen two results - leaders stepping down and getting political asylum 
or leaders being brutually attacked. i honestly think that this is a good 
opportunity to leave and re-start a normal life - it cant be easy on the 
children, it can't be easy on you!

i know at times i am too blunt - but its because i care and consider you and 
the family as part of our own. every day i think about the thoughts running 
through your head and the safety of your chidlren --i only pray that you will 
convince the president to take this as an opportunity to exit without having to 
face charges. the region needs to stabilize, but not more than you need peace 
of mind.

i am sure you have many places to turn to, including doha.
