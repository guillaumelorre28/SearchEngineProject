For me it’s not a book, but the poem ‘Twas The Night Before Christmas 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/night-before-christmas-46.html>’ by Clement 
Clarke Moore. I love the sense of excitement and anticipation that it conveys. 
And I love hearing it read out when you’re indoors all cosy and warm, with lots 
of holly and other Christmas greenery and tinsel all dancing and flickering in 
the candlelight. When I was about eight, I stayed awake to try to catch Father 
Christmas coming in and around midnight, I saw a bunch of little coloured 
lights, like miniature UFOs or fireflies, float into the room. It was really 
weird but I was probably just dreaming…

 Chris Riddell’s favourite Christmas read Illustration: PR 
Candy Gourlay, author of Shine  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/shine-259001.html>

My all time favourite Christmas story was a short story from one of the 
American reading scheme books we read when I was growing up in the Philippines. 
It was called A Tree for Nick by Mary Lou Brown (the story was originally 
published in 1959). It told the story of a brother and sister decorating a tree 
for a Christmas tree competition while waiting for their eight-year-old brother 
Nick to come home from his boarding school for blind children. They are 
desperate to win the prize and yet Nick dominates all their choices. They leave 
out the shiny foil decorations in case Nick cuts himself. They leave out the 
electric lights because Nick burned his hand on them last year. Instead, they 
hang soft, fuzzy sheep, and sweet candy canes, the shabby old horn that tooted 
when you blew, and an old music box that tinkled when you touched it. You could 
feel and taste and hear the tree – but it was nothing much to look at. They 
knew they they didn’t stand a chance of winning the tree competition. And then 
Nick comes home. The line that always gets me is when Nick finally meets the 
tree: “ ‘Whee!’ breathed Nick, his face shining with happiness. ‘This is the
prettiesttree I’ve ever seen!’ “ Aaaaah. Here come the tears again.

My Christmas choice would be The Dark is Rising 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dark-is-rising-2.html> by the inimitable 
Susan Cooper. The word ‘magical’ gets used a lot to describe children’s books, 
but it really applies in this case. It is superb from snowy start to finish.


Mick & Brita, co-authors and illustrators of The Beatles 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/beatles-14.html> and many other books 

We often read the chapters in Kenneth Graham’s Wind in the Willows 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/wind-in-the-willows-29.html> when Moley and 
Ratty get lost in the Wild Wood and end up in Badger’s kitchen. It never fails 
to please.

I gotta say, the children’s book that always means Christmas for me is the 
good oldThe Snowman <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/snowman-6.html>, by 
Raymond Briggs. There’s simply nothing like it for summing up everything that 
is special and cosy and snowy and wonderful and magical about this time of year.

Taran Matharu, author of Summoner: The Novice  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/280898/>

I enjoyed reading A Street Cat Named Bob 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/street-cat-named-bob-2.html> by James Bowen 
for Xmas, but it’s not really a children’s book.Bob: No Ordinary Cat 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bob.html> is the children’s version with some 
of the adult scenes taken out.

Keren David, author of This is Not a Love Story 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285485/>

 The books that sums up Christmas for me is End of Term by Antonia Forest. 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Forest> There’s a character, Miranda 
West who is Jewish like me, and has to negotiate that “suddenly I’m an 
outside”’ Christmas feeling that comes around at this time of year. I never 
came across anyone else like Miranda in any of the books I read, which partly 
inspired my latest book This is Not a Love Story.

We usually go to my parents’ house for Christmas and I love being able to see 
all my old books. I always reread something, choosing betweenLittle Women 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-women-20.html>, I Capture the Castle 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/i-capture-the-castle-7.html> or the Anne 
books by L M Montgomery. If I get started on Anne of Green Gables 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/anne-of-green-gables-18.html>, I often carry 
on and read them all through to Rilla of Ingleside. There are lots of 
Christmasses described in the Anne books but I also vividly remember my delight 
at being given them in a boxed set by my parents when I was probably about ten. 
There’s something about a boxed set that is especially and sumptuously festive.

Lauren St John, author of One Dollar Horse trilogy and Operation Rhino

The children’s book that most reminds me of Christmas is The Tiger That Came 
to Tea <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tiger-who-came-to-tea-9.html> by 
Judith Kerr, mainly because I bought if for my niece, Summer, one Christmas, 
and she made me read it to her about 25 times in succession. I also had to 
crawl around the floor for hours pretending to be a tiger. The tiger’s feast is 
appropriately Christmassy too!

First of all a chapter book: The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, by Barbara 
Robinson. When I was in school, my teacher read this to our class and we all 
loved it. It’s about an almost completely feral family called the Herdmans 
whose six loathsome children hijack a very proper middle-class church nativity 
play and turn it into something much more exciting and meaningful for everyone.


And I have a picture book: Toot and Puddle: I’ll be Home for Christmas, by 
Holly Hobbie (2001) Known for her (now rather kitsch) American girls in 
bonnets, Holly Hobbie reinvented herself with Toot and Puddle, two pigs who are 
best friends. We follow the adventures of Toot, who’s fighting storms to get 
back home from Edinburgh to Puddle, who’s decorating the house for Christmas. 
The masterful and delicate watercolour paintings create marvelous contrasts 
between the snow and warmth and make me feel caught up in the festive wonder. 
My family live too far away to visit each Christmas, so I think that gives the 
story added poignance.

Me and my little boy are Mog fanatics so it has to be Mog’s Christmas Calamity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2015/dec/01/judith-kerrs-mogs-christmas-calamity-sainsburys>
 by Judith Kerr. Sainsburys don’t exist where I currently live in Hobart so we 
are innocently thumbing through a very well worn and loved copy without the ad. 
I love the fact that Mog is rather grinchy and vaguely terrified about the 
festive season and opts for the roof rather than the house. It’s a feeling most 
of us can sympathise with at about 9 A.M on Christmas Day. There’s a beautiful 
ending obviously. That is the genius of Kerr - manageable anxiety and peril 
solved beautifully.

Christmas for me is all about the symbolism of light in the dark. I know it’s 
not a book as such, but for me the season starts on the first Sunday of Advent 
with the collect “Give us grace to cast away the works of darkness and to put 
on the armour of light”, which never fails to send a shiver down my spine and 
always reminds me how much emotion and meaning can be packed into just a few 
words. Then, at the other end of the spectrum, on Christmas Eve we light a fire 
and as many candles as we can, gather whoever is around and readThe Night 
Before Christmas 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/night-before-christmas-46.html>, a big 
picture book edition illustrated by Christian Birmingham. Everyone has to take 
turns doing silly voices, then we put out a glass of wine, a mince pie and a 
carrot for Santa. It’s really not about the book anymore. It’s about snuggling 
down together and reminding ourselves of what is important.

Piers Torday, author of The Last Wild 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/last-wild.html> trilogy

Christmas has always been the best time for books. So much time to read, and 
even if climate change means that curling up by the fire while the snow piles 
up outside is a thing of the past, you can pretend by diving into the classics 
likeThe Box of Delights 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/box-of-delights-2.html> by John Masefield or 
The Dark is Rising <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dark-is-rising-2.html> by 
Susan Cooper. If you prefer something contemporary, I shall be giving my 
nieces, nephew and god children copies of the very cheeringA Boy Called 
Christmas 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/352776/s/a-boy-called-christmas/>
 by Matt Haig or for the younger ones, Coralie Bickford Smith’s stunningThe Fox

I can be a bit of a Scrooge when it comes to Christmas, but I can always be 
cheered up by the story of Scrooge himself - I always try to read Charles 
Dickens’s A Christmas Carol 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rollercoasters-a-christmas-carol-reader.html> 
at this time of year (I also love to watch the classic 1951 film version 
starring Alastair Sim - it’s always on one channel or another!). Naturally I’m 
also a big fan ofFather Christmas  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/father-christmas-4.html>by Raymond Briggs. 
And this year I discovered a new book that really does make me feel some 
Yule-tide magic - the wonderfulA Boy Called Christmas 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/352776/s/a-boy-called-christmas/>
 by Matt Haig. A Merry Christmas to one and all!

Sally Nicholls, author of An Island of Our Own  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/273627/s/an-island-of-our-own/>

Barbara Robinson’s The Worst Kids in the World – recently reissued as The Best 
Christmas Pageant Ever – is the story of what happens when the worst family in 
town gatecrash the church Christmas pageant. The Sunday School are horrified 
when their pretty blonde Mary is ousted by a girl who looks like a teenage 
refugee mother. But, as the narrator muses, isn’t that who the first Mary 
really was? A very funny and surprisingly heartwarming reminder of what the 
Christmas story is really about. Lucy Boston’sThe Children of Green Knowe 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/river-at-green-knowe.html> is a book I’ve 
loved since I first read it as a child. Tolly Oldknowe comes to spend Christmas 
with his great-grandmother at a manor house haunted by the ghosts of a family 
who lived there three hundred years before. The scene where they accidentally 
attend a seventeenth century midnight mass has haunted me for over twenty years.

Christmas-wise, I grew up with Nikolai Of The North by Lucy Daniel Raby, which 
is great for 8-12 year olds, if not an even wider audience. In a more YA 
market, I really enjoyedMy True Love Gave To Me 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/347170/> by various 
authors, edited by Stephanie Perkins.

My favourite Christmas book is not strictly a Christmas novel but I have 
somehow made it tradition to readThe Princess Bride  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/princess-bride.html>by William Goldman every 
Christmas holiday... I really love that book.

Katherine Rundell, of The Wolf Wilder 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/289113/s/the-wolf-wilder/>

 The book that I think most beautifully captures the ebullient joy of 
Christmas when you’re young is theBrambly Hedge ‘Winter Story 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/winter-story.html>’ by Jill Barklem. The mice 
make an ice palace, and have an ice ball; as with all the Brambly Hedge books, 
the illustrations are pitch-perfect and delicious. I’ve bought half a dozen 
this year for children I love.

It’s got to be A Christmas Carol 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rollercoasters-a-christmas-carol-reader.html> 
(really is worth rereading Dickens once a year) and the sublimeJolly Christmas 
Postman <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/jolly-christmas-postman-2.html>by 
Janet and Allan Alhberg.

The book that says Christmas to me is Moominland Midwinter 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/moominland-midwinter.html> - the description 
of the valley under snow is magic. And the thought of being awake when everyone 
else is still hibernating is lovely. The first book I ever bought with my own 
money was a Moomin book. Love all of them

Matt Haig, author of A Boy Called Christmas 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/352776/s/a-boy-called-christmas/>

My favourite Christmas book is an obvious one, A Christmas Carol 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rollercoasters-a-christmas-carol-reader.html>
. Second only to the Bible, this is a book that invented Christmas, in terms of 
how we see it today. The ultimate redemption story it’s genius is in bringing 
us all into the Christmas narrative, because none of us are quite as miserly as 
old Ebenezer and even he manages to get into the spirit, with the help of those 
literal spirits. It remains Dickens’ snappiest and most readable book, though 
written very early in his career.

Every year, I go back to remembering the love I have for Raymond Briggs’s The 
Snowman <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/snowman-6.html>. I find that 
sometimes hold the closest memory, and my memories of The Snowman include 
sitting next to the fire, dreading the moment when - (spoiler alert) the 
snowman melts. It might not be the longest or most complicated book in the 
world, but it’s beautiful and reminds me of being a little girl!


Katherine Woodfine, author of The Mystery of the Clockwork Sparrow 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/295174/s/the-mystery-of-the-clockwork-sparrow/>

There are so many books that I love to revisit at Christmas - Susan Cooper’s 
The Dark is Rising <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dark-is-rising-2.html>, 
and John Masefield’sThe Box of Delights 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/box-of-delights-2.html> are two especial 
favourites. But the one book that really says ‘Christmas’ to me more than any 
other is my mum’s battered old copy of The Christmas Book by Enid Blyton, which 
we always used read together at this time of year when I was growing up. It may 
seem incredibly dated to a contemporary reader, but it’s nonetheless a 
completely charming vision of a traditional Blyton Christmas - complete with 
plum pudding, yule log, and even an appearance from Father Christmas himself.

The book that most gets me into the Christmas mood is My True Love Gave To Me 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/347170/>, an 
anthology of Christmas stories from top YA authors curated by Stephanie 
Perkins. There’s something for everyone, and the cover even has fairy lights on 
it. What more do you want in life?

Thought about which book sums up Christmas for me; a bit idiosyncratic perhaps 
but my mind kept going back toThe Little Prince 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-prince-23.html> by Antoine de 
Saint-Exupéry. Probably because each year goes by in a flash and yet is made up 
of so many distinct emotions. And then, it’s Christmas and you pause, take a 
break and look back; before moving forward. And each year I still feel like 
that little prince, trying to make sense of this insane adult world. Like him I 
often feel I am neither grown up nor a child, and each year is a voyage to 
different worlds in my head; where I meet the equivalent of the rose, the 
cautious fox, the sinister angel and the fox that deceived me.

Margaret: I have just remembered a book by an American, Barbara Robinson which 
you may not have come across. I anglicised it and made it into a play for 
middle school children about 35 years ago - my daughter and her friends were in 
it. It is called The Best Christmas Pageant Ever but was originally published 
as The Worst Kids in the World. It is about a dysfunctional family of neglected 
kids who take over the Christmas pageant in a local church and bring a whole 
new perspective to the nativity story. Although I’m not very religious it 
always gave me a lump in my throat when I read it to kids. You, or someone in 
the team, may know it. The character who plays Mary listens to the reading from 
the Bible: “ I shall be called wonderful counsellor, everlasting God, Mighty 
Father” etc and says, “My God! with a name like that he’d never get out if 
First Grade. I would have called him Fred” There is lots of humour as well as 
some tear jerking moments.

@GdnChildrensBks <https://twitter.com/GdnChildrensBks> I'd recommend The Wolf 
Wilder by@kdbrundell <https://twitter.com/kdbrundell> as a fabulously snowy 
festive read. Also A Christmas Carol just because.
