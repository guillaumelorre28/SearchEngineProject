What matters more – the title of a newspaper or the name of a publishing 
company? The question arises from a decision by Norwich-based publisherArchant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/archant> to remove the titles of its two 
flagship titles from the exterior of the papers’ offices and replace them with 
its own name.

 that the publisher has applied for planning permission to take down the 
Eastern Daily Press and Norwich Evening News titles from its headquarters and 
substitute them with its own corporate branding.

Does Archant really think it’s more important than the papers it publishes? At 
least one of its staff doesn’t like the idea. A journalist who works in the 
building, Prospect House, has objected on the grounds that an Archant logo 
“isn’t going to shift newspapers or get people coming to our websites”.

Naturally enough, wishing to withhold his/her identity, s/he said: “It might 
seem minor but the current signs show we are at the heart of the community. 
It’s worrying that there is no one at the top table who seems to understand 
basic marketing.

“People don’t want to give their stories to Archant – they want to give them 
to the papers they know and love.” Who can disagree?
