the journalist shot dead five years ago in the north of Ireland.John Leckey, 
the coroner, said he was satisfied thatO'Hagan was murdered because he had been 
investigating drug-dealing loyalists. Chief InspectorCharles Patterson told the 
inquest in Armagh that he was confident the killers were among eight people 
associated with loyalist paramilitary organisations who were interviewed by the 
police. But no-one has ever been charged. "I don't have the evidence to proceed 
against these persons," he said. Northern Ireland Police OmbudsmanNuala O'Loan 
has been asked to investigate the police inquiry. (ViaBBC
