William Hogarth – The Painter and his Pug (1745) Photograph: Tate 
An oval self-portrait of Hogarth is propped on leather-bound volumes of the 
works of his favourite authors: Milton, Shakespeare and Swift. The palette in 
front of them is inscribed and illustrated with his philosophic idea of The 
Line of Beauty, which is serpentine, not straight, according to Hogarth – an 
idea that puts him at the heart of the European Rococo movement. But his pug 
dog brings such highfalutin speculations down to earth. Hogarth’s own face 
mirrors the dog’s ordinariness and toughness. Beauty is not only serpentine, it 
comes out fighting.
