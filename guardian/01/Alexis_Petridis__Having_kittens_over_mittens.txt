Age used to dictate how men dressed. Now, we live in a world of middle youth, 
where anyone is supposed to be able to wear whatever they like. I operate on 
the principle that it's led to nothing other than sartorial disaster, from the 
late thirtysomething I saw in Brighton rocking the fullPete Doherty 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/petedoherty> – unaware the louche bohemianism 
he was trying to convey via his rakish trilby and skintight jeans was undercut 
by the fact that he was also wearing a small baby in a Mamas & Papas papoose – 
toRichard Hammond <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hammond>, with his 
terrible hair and bootcut jeans and dreadful little necklace. He's not dressing 
like that in some kind of knowing, ironic way, like a 20-year-old 
Shoreditch-ite with a mullet and a tache. He doesn't think he looks like an 
unbelievable tit; he thinks that's how young people dress.

Yet designers keep foisting ever younger clothes on men. First there were 
fitted shorts – which I thought I'd seen the back of when I left junior school. 
Now there's mittens, something I thought I'd seen the back of around the time I 
learned to cut up my own food. I loudly remarked to this effect when I modelled 
them – they weren't just infantilising, they were impractical – before handing 
them back with a flourish of disdain. Then I went outside, where it was 
freezing, and they didn't seem impractical at all. Nor did they seem that 
infantilising, at least compared with the sight of a grown man crying like a 
toddler because his hands were too cold. What price my principles now?
