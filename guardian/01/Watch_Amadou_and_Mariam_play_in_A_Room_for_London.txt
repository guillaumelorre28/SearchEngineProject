It was in west Africa that Amadou and Mariam first became known as "the blind 
couple of Mali", but now the husband-and-wife duo are famous around the world. 
Not only are theya pair of rare charm 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/feb/26/amadou-and-mariam-bamako-interview>
, they're also an infectious live act, but one whose reputation also rests on 
their willingness to embrace new challenges: collaborations with acts from 
around the world (as on their excellent new albumFolila 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/0751dab9-d6ad-420c-9906-5d204e9d1431>), 
and also the staging of gigs in unusual locations â€“ such as with their series 
of shows calledEclipse 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jul/18/amadou-and-mariam>, which take 
place in total darkness.

This week, continuing in that vein, the couple are in London to play a gig in 
the boat now perched on top of the Southbank Centre, the structure that's known 
asA Room for London 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/may/23/amadou-and-mariam-a-room-for-london>
. And the pair are promising a new song, created especially for this very 
special venue.

You can watch their performance from the boat live on the Guardian site 
between 6pm-6.45pm BST on Wednesday 23 Mayso bookmark this page and head there
