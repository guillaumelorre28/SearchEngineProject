the American business television network, CNBC <http://www.cnbc.com/id/31553869>

Now we know exactly how close Vijay Singh was to Allen Stanford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/allen-stanford>.

The professional golfer was one of three people who offered to sign for a 
portion of the financier's bail, his attorney said in court in Houston on 
Thursday, according to CNBC's Scott Cohn.

Cohn said Singh would have been on the hook for $500,000 if Stanford fled, but 
he was not allowed to help with bail because he is not a citizen of the United 
States.

The golfer signed an endorsement deal with the firm in January and has 
continued to wear the Stanford logo on his shirt and hat despite the fact that 
Singh was no longer being paid by the company. Last week, Stanford and other 
executives with his firm were charged with swindling $7bn from investors. 
Stanford and three other executives pleaded not guilty to all charges on 
Thursday.

This is the crucial quote: 

"Vijay's opinion is that Stanford has yet to be proven guilty and until then 
has chosen to act supportively," said Dave Haggith, spokesman for IMG, the 
management company that counts Singh as a client.
