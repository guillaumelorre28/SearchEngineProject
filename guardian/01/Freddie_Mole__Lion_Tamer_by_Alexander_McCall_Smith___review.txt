This book is called Freddie Mole, Lion Tamer, and it starts off like this. 
Before Freddie Mole was even a lion tamer he was just a young boy, and his 
family didn’t have very much money. He had to wear one sock of one pair and 
another sock of another pair for two days. Freddie’s mum worked on a ship and 
whenever she got home she only had time to have a big sleep.

Now let’s talk about what we were about to talk about before: Freddie said to 
his Father, “is there any way that I can help earn some money?” His father 
sadly shook his head and said no. Then straight after that he had a phone call, 
and someone asked, “Can you please come and fix my washing machine?” (Freddie’s 
dad was a washing machine repairer). It took half an hour to get there, and it 
was the longest half an hour of Freddie’s life. In another half an hour it was 
fixed! Do you want to know whose washing machine it was? Well, it was the 
Ringmaster’s washing machine!

Freddie wanted to raise some money for his family, and luckily, meeting the 
Ringmaster gave him a job in the circus! Freddie did really well at his job 
because he was helpful and he worked really hard. I liked that Freddie had good 
ideas and he gave everything a go, even though he was a bit scared of some 
things. If I was in the circus I would like to be an acrobat. I liked this book 
more than the twinkling stars and I would recommend it to someone who really 
likes circuses, because it’s all about circuses.
