Health <https://www.theguardian.com/society/health> chiefs at organ scandal 
hospital Alder Hey today announced that acting chief executive Tony Bell is to 
take the job on a permanent basis.

Senior nurse manager Tony Bell, who was awarded the OBE in 1998 for services 
to healthcare, has run the trust since March 2001, following the suspension of 
former chief executive Hilary Rowland. Ms Rowland left the trust in November.

Her employment was terminated after a three-day disciplinary hearing which 
concluded the former hospital boss had brought both the Royal Liverpool 
children'sNHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> trust and herself into 
disrepute.

Ms Rowland was suspended on her Â£85,000 salary following the publication of 
the Redfern report into the Alder Hey scandal which saw thousands of organs 
secretly stripped from the bodies of dead children.

Angela Jones, chairman of the Royal Liverpool children's NHS trust, today 
welcomed the appointment of Mr Bell.

She said: "Tony Bell has shown considerable leadership and commitment during 
his time as acting chief executive at Alder Hey and I look forward to working 
with him in the future."

Mr Bell previously served for five years as director of joint commissioning 
and nursing adviser at Liverpool health authority.

He is a member of the national paediatric and congenital cardiac services 
review group, which is part of the children's taskforce, and a member of 
ministers' nursing advisory body the standing nursing and midwifery advisory 
body.
