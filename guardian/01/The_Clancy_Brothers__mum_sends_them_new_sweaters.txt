In late 1960, reports of a particularly harsh winter in New York had spread 
across the Atlantic, and the Clancy Brothers, a troupe of expatriate Irish folk 
singers in Manhattan, received a parcel from their concerned mother back home 
in Ireland. It contained four Aran sweaters. The brothers wore them at a 
Greenwich Village folk club, and it quickly became their trademark. When they 
played the Ed Sullivan Show in March 1961, their pristine knitwear made them 
the most famous Irishmen on earth. Their recordings went on to influence a new 
generation of artists, including a young Bob Dylan.Â
