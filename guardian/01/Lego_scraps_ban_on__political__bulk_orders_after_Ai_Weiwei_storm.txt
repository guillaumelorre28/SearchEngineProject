Lego has dropped restrictions on bulk orders after facing a storm of criticism 
forrefusing to sell thousands of toy bricks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/24/artist-ai-weiwei-banned-by-lego-to-build-artwork-australian-exhibition>
 to dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.

Ai, known for his criticism of China’s rights record, accused the Danish 
toymaker of censorship in October after it declined a bulk order of bricks, 
which he wanted for a new work.Lego 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lego> said at the time it had a 
long-running policy of not fulfilling bulk orders or donating bricks if it knew 
they would be used as part of a political agenda.

But the decision was condemned by rights groups and triggered an online 
campaign asking people to donate Lego 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/25/artist-ai-weiwei-accept-offers-lego-around-world>
 to the artist and free speech campaigner.

Lego said in a statement on Tuesday that it would stop asking people why they 
wanted its bricks. It did not refer directly to Ai’s order but acknowledged 
that the rules “could result in misunderstandings or be perceived as 
inconsistent”.


Customers wanting to build public displays out of Lego bricks will now only 
have to make clear that the company does not endorse the project, it added.

 Ai has used Lego bricks before to build portraits of other dissidents, 
including Nelson Mandela.

Lego is the world’s largest toymaker by sales, having recently overtaken US 
Barbie-maker Mattel and Monopoly-maker Hasbro.
