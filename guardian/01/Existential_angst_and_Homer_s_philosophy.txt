I have been a disciple of the philosopher Homer (D’oh-levels; the wisdom of 
the Simpsons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2016/nov/16/glasgow-university-homer-simpson-philosophy-course-perfect-sense>
, 16 November) even before I heard his response to Bart’s request to switch on 
the TV: “Well, please turn something on, I am beginning to think.” The prospect 
of thinking is now more terrifying than ever. It is a courageous person who is 
prepared to think of the implications of having a narcissistic sociopath as 
commander-in-chief of the most potentially destructive armed forces the world 
has ever seen. A few of the other matters which do not bear thinking about 
include Brexit, the rapid loss of species diversity, and the population 
explosion. D’oh.

• I am not surprised that Glasgow University is providing a course on 
philosophy as covered by the Simpsons. Everything I know of the topic I picked 
up from Monty Python.

• Will 2016 go down in history as the year that exposed the basic flaw in 
democracy – the mistaken belief that the people know best? The final proof must 
have been the vote to keepEd Balls

The people have indeed had enough of experts.

• Shock, horror. Dylan labelled “arrogant” for not collecting his Nobel prize (

honour, so be responsible and collect it.

• The way Robert Vaughn, playing nice-but-Nazi Major Paul Kruger, whips off 
his sunglasses inThe Bridge at Remagen <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064110/>
