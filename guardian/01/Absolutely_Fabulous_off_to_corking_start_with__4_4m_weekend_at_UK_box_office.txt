the biggest UK film opening since Spectre, taking £4.4m over its debut weekend.

However, it still falls some way short of the opening weekend totals for both 
Inbetweeners movies, as well as the most recent James Bond movie,which took 
£6.3m on its opening day alone

.

The sitcom spin-off is said to have benefited from better-than-expected 
reviews, while releasing during Euro 2016 was always going to boost a film 
whose target audience is predominantly female.

The film, which is marketed as an unchallenging and celebratory adult comedy, 
may also have been aided by current political uncertainty and national 
despondency.

Absolutely Fabulous’s international rollout is protracted: it arrives in the 
US on 22 July, in Australia on 4 August and territories such as Singapore and 
Germany later in the autumn, before a Russian release in October.
