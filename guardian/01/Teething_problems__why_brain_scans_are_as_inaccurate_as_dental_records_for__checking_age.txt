The media furore over dental checks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/home-office-rules-out-unethical-dental-checks-for-calais-refugees>
 to establish the ages of child migrants arriving from Calais has raised the 
question of how we define – and prove – adulthood. Dentists have said the 
checks would likely be inaccurate, not to mention unethical. Brain imaging 
wouldn’t be much use either, as recent research has shown the brain continues 
developing right up until the mid-20s and beyond.

Growth of grey matter is very rapid from around the age of 12, but peaks a few 
years later. What follows in later adolescence is a pruning and sculpting of 
the many connections that have sprouted during puberty. It could be argued that 
experiences in this period are as important as earlier ones, and in some ways 
more significant, as they affect the brain’s frontal lobe which deals with the 
development of character and morality.

Insurance companies seem to have realised this, as car insurance premiums 
change depending on your age right into your 20s. And since 2013, child 
psychologists have worked with under 25s, not just under 18s. It’s just a shame 
that this is not currently reflected by our asylum policy.
