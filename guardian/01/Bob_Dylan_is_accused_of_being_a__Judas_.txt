Looking back, the rage at Bob Dylan's abandonment of political songwriting in 
favour of performing with a Fender Stratocaster and a rock'n'roll backing band 
seems utterly baffling. Folk fans' arguments – that it was evidence of 
dilettantism, of an arrogant remoteness, of a lack of commitment to a worthy 
cause, that you couldn't hear the words, that it was just too loud – have been 
trampled by the weight of rock history. If nothing else, the famous cry of 
"Judas!" that interrupted his performance at the Manchester Free Trade Hall on 
17 May 1966 and the footage of outraged fans streaming out of other dates, 
carrying on as if they'd been personally insulted by his decision to "go 
electric", tells you that the heightened, hysterical pitch of the online 
comment board is actually nothing new: "Bob Dylan was a bastard in the second 
half," bellows one disgruntled patron. The most lasting effect of the whole 
controversy was not on Dylan, but on folk revivalism itself, which, ever after, 
was doomed to be labelled a bit fusty, boring and uncool by onlookers: the 
price you pay for trying to stop progress.
