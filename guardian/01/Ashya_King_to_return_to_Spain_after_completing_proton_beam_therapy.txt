The parents of Ashya King <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ashya-king> say 
they still fear returning to Britain, after a clinic treating the boy in Prague 
said he had completed his proton beam therapy for a brain tumour.

Brett and Naghmeh King, from Portsmouth, triggered an international police 
hunt when theyremoved their five-year-old son from Southampton hospital 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/01/ashya-king-timeline> in August 
without the consent of doctors and travelled to Spain.

The couple had rejected conventional radiotherapy offered in Britain, 
believing proton beam treatment was more effective in limiting the collateral 
damage to other organs, and would lead to less severe long-term side effects 
for Ashya. But after a European arrest warrant was issued, they were arrested 
and held in a Madrid prison for three days. They were later released without 
charge.

A high court judge in London approved the treatment with the agreement of 
doctors who had been treating him in Southampton. Ashya is expected to undergo 
further treatment inSpain <https://www.theguardian.com/world/spain>, possibly 
including chemotherapy.

His parents said on Friday they did not feel safe enough to return to the UK.

Holding his son, Brett King said: “After some time we decided that perhaps it 
was best to return to Spain. We have a property there so life can be 
established quite easily for us.

“At the moment we don’t feel 100% safe, I suppose you would call it, 
contemplating being in England until perhaps they do this investigation into 
how everything was conducted for us,” he told Sky News. “Once that has been 
established then we can think about going back to England. But for the time 
being we have been in contact with a doctor in Spain so we are continuing with 
[Ashya’s] treatment in Spain instead of England.”

Asked why they were reluctant to return to Britain, he said: “Because there is 
so much still at stake. We wouldn’t want to lose Ashya. It would probably never 
happen, but just having that small risk that you don’t have to do anything 
wrong to have your children taken away and [be] thrown in prison …”

Iva Taťounová, the director of the Prague clinic, said Ashya had responded 
well to the treatment.

“Ashya does not have to stay in bed, he is able to sit and hold his own head, 
reacts with interest to his surroundings and faces the people around him.”

Doctors have said that if chemotherapy and radiotherapy are combined there is 
a 70-80% chance of a cure for the medulloblastoma.

Brett King said every parent should be aware that consent to treatment 
proposed by a doctor could influence the destiny of their child.

“We should always ask ourselves whether we really have all the information, 
and that we have done everything to ensure that our children receive the very 
best,” he said. “The doctor may not know everything, or can follow other 
interests, official, corporate or personal. I did my research, made my decision 
and I’m happy.”

Ashya’s case had previously been turned down by a specialist expert panel of 
doctors in Britain, on the basis that proton beam therapy offers no benefit 
that the child could not get from standard radiotherapy in the UK. But it 
emerged last month thatNHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> England 
had agreed to fund proton beam therapy for Ashya under the reciprocal 
healthcare arrangements that exist within the EU.
