The $11m-budget film was showing on just five screens, but its total take was 
only £97, making its per-site average £19.40. It received negative reviews on 
release, with the Observer’s Wendy Ide giving it one star and writing that it 
“could be shown in film schools as a textbook example of how not to make a 
movie”.

The cinemas were all regional Reel cinemas, in locations including 
Kidderminster and Burnley, and the opening coincided with a digital release, 
making the film simultaneously available to stream at home.

With an adult ticket at a Reel cinema costing £6.20, it means that less than 
four people caught the film at each site. One of them was Twitter user

@reel <https://twitter.com/reel> cinema. A slow meandering film with a good 
plot and a few twists in it. Critics hated it. We liked it

nefarious plot involving kidnap and murder. The film also stars Alice Eve, 
Julia Stiles and Malin Åkerman. It was set to starDownton Abbey’s Dan Stevens

, but he had to leave the film after a scheduling conflict.

It was originally titled Beyond Deceit

but during production too many people thought it sounded like Beyond Da Sea.
