Trinity Mirror’s new national newspaper the New Day is thought to have sold 
about 150,000 copies on its first two days as a paid-for title.

Two million copies of the New Day were distributed to 40,000 retailers on 
Monday and made available for free as a first daypromotion to spark interest in 
the new title

.

It is thought that about 500,000 of those 2m copies were returned, which would 
suggest that 1.5 million members of the public took a look at the 40-page 
newspaper.

On Tuesday the price was raised to 25p, where it will remain for two weeks 
before being made its full price of 50p, with sales thought to be about 153,000.

On the second day of paid sales, Wednesday, the New Day is thought to have 
sold about 148,000 copies – 4% down on the previous day.

The print run is understood to be about 800,000 on Tuesday and Wednesday and 
the figures are unofficial industry estimates.

Simon Fox, the chief executive of Trinity Mirror, has said that the publisher 
intends to keep the sales figures as“secret”

as possible, with the first official numbers likely to be the May Audit Bureau 
of Circulations report which covers April sales.

Trinity Mirror is aiming for a “settle down”

sales figure of about 200,000, although it is thought that breakeven is a 
little over half that number.

The i, the last new national newspaper to launch, in 2010, took about a year 
to hit a sales figure of 200,000. Its circulation is close to 270,000.

About 70,000 of those are bulk copies which are distributed free to locations 
such as airports, railway stations and gyms.
