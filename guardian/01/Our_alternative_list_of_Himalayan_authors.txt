We were intrigued by Robert Twigger’s Top 10 books about the Himalayas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/09/top-10-books-about-the-himalayas>
 (theguardian.com, 9 November), which consists almost entirely of books by 
foreign travellers and mountaineers. It reminded us of Edward Said’s reference, 
in Orientalism, to the western belief that “the Orient” cannot represent itself 
but must submit to understandings of itself drawn from the descriptions of 
others. As academics who teach and conduct research among the people and 
societies of the Himalaya in the only British university that offers such 
courses, we would like to offer an alternative list which, unlike Twigger’s, 
includes books by people from the region itself: Manjushree Thapa, The Tutor of 
History; Thomas Bell, Kathmandu; Chetan Raj Shrestha, The Kings Harvest; 
Michael Aris, The Raven Crown: the origins of Buddhist monarchy in Bhutan; 
Tsering Shakya, The Dragon in the Land of Snows; Kim Gutschow, Being a Buddhist 
Nun; Lil Bahadur Chettri, Mountains Painted With Turmeric; Martin Brauen, 
Dreamworld Tibet: Western Illusions; Prawin Adhikari, The Vanishing Act; 
Prajwal Parajuli, The Gurkha’s Daughter.
