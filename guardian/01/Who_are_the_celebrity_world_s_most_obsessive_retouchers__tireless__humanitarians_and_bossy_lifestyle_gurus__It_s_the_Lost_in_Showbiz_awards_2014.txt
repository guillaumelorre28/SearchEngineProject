Quote of the year

“Can you imagine telling someone who wants to just Instagram a photo, who’s 
the No 1 person on Instagram, ‘We need to work on the colour of the flower 
wall,’ or the idea that it’s a Givenchy dress, and it’s not about the name 
Givenchy, it’s about the talent that is Riccardo Tisci – and how important Kim 
is to the internet.” No, I can’t make head nor tail of it either. But according 
toKanye West, it’s the reason he and Kim Kardashian were forced to spend four 
days of their honeymoon becoming “exhausted” byretouching the single wedding 
picture they eventually uploaded to Instagram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/lostinshowbiz/2014/jun/19/kanye-west-annie-leibovitz-kim-kardashian-wedding-photo>
. Here’s hoping these two finally catch a break in 2015.

 Soon to be the former Mrs Rupert Murdoch, Wendi Deng stunned the world with 
her notes about Tony Blair and Google boss Eric Schmidt. Photograph: Facundo 
Arrizablaga/EPA 
All credit to Wendi Deng, whose ability to think herself into the mind of a 
not especially bright 13-year-old should really have won her a column on the 
now-defunct News of the World. Still, that ship has sailed – as indeed has the 
Rosehearty, the yacht upon which she married her soon-to-be ex-husband Rupert 
Murdoch (flogged for $29.7m, possibly in a heartbreak fire sale). The awards 
judges were impressed by both of the notes from Wendi, to herself 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/14/tony-blair-rupert-murdoch-deconstruction-friendship-wendi-deng>
, which appeared in Vanity Fair’s account of the demise of her marriage. The 
first appeared to concern Google boss Eric Schmidt, and began with a 
disparaging reference to his girlfriend. “Lisa will never have my style, 
grace,” observed the former Mrs Murdoch after bumping into the couple at a 
party. “I achieved my purpose of Eric saw me looking so gorgeous and so 
fantastic and so young, so cool, so chic, so stylish, so funny and he cannot 
have me. I’m not ever feel sad about losing Eric … Plus he is really ugly … I’m 
soooo happy I’m not with him.” But the winning entry starred none other than 
our own Mr Tony Blair. “Oh shit oh shit,” it began. “Whatever why I’m so 
missing Tony. Because he is so charming and his clothes are so good. He has 
such good body and he has really really good legs Butt … And he is slim tall 
and good skin. Pierce blue eyes which I love. Love his eyes. Also I love his 
power on the stage … and what else and what else and what else …” What else 
indeed? We await the rumoured 2015 publication of Wendi’s epistolary novel with 
great excitement.

Someone called James from the Vamps 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/17/the-vamps-wild-heart-11-formats>
. It’s not the lyrics to their biggest hit, Can We Dance, that got Lost in 
Showbiz – however infused with anti-establishment cool those unquestionably 
are: “I talk a lot of shit when I’m drinking, baby/ I’ve been known to go a 
little too fast/ Don’t mind all my friends, I know they’re all crazy/ But 
they’re the only friends that I have.” No, it was James’stweeted verdict 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/may/29/one-direction-zayn-malik-louis-tomlinson-joint>
 on seeing the leaked video of Zayn and Louis from One Direction appearing to 
smoke a joint in a blacked-out vehicle while they were being driven past some 
cops in Brazil. Having harrumphed that he hated seeing people ruin their 
careers, James clarified: “Just not a fan of people undermining authority.” 
Let’s hear much, much more from this rebel heart next year, please.

 She does a lot for charity, don’t you know. Photograph: Justin 
Tallis/AFP/Getty Images 
In a year in which Paris Hilton and Tony Blair each added to an already 
existing humanitarian trophy cabinet, this was always going to be a tough 
category. But like at least 387 other celebrity humanitarian awards, many 
confected entirely for her, this one goes toAngelina Jolie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/nov/27/angelina-jolie-paris-hilton-tony-blair-lassie-save-the-children-award>
. Why? Well, she does a lot for charity – a bit like people who work every 
single day for minimal pay for charity, or people who get shot at while working 
for charity, or are decapitated by militants having been captured while working 
for charity. Except famous. And with a day job. Still, Lost in Showbiz realises 
we all still have to pretend that Angelina isn’t rather bonkers in a way that 
deserves at least some scrutiny, so it will only say what a tribute it is to 
her infinite grace that she has never once opted to refuse the lavishly 
glittering awards galas in her honour, nor to denounce the deeply weird idea of 
humanitarian awards in general, nor decline to accept one of her many gongs on 
the basis that non-famous folk might be more deserving.

 The unbelievable Kieran Hayler and Katie Price. Photograph: Rex Features 
Kieran Hayler, the stripper who last year became Mr Katie Price, and who 
clearly had no clue of the jihad he was about to invite on his frequently bared 
arse when he cheated on her with her best friend. He will have caught a flavour 
of what was to follow when Katie opened hostilities by tweeting: “Jane Pountney 
is 50 next year cloned into me with my help she is a whore, home wrecker slut 
<https://twitter.com/misskatieprice/status/463996643457925120>.” But by the 
time he had been suspended from his part-time stripping job for some 
impenetrable act of Adonis-troupe misconduct, he will have been more fully 
across things.Cue the arrival of lie-detector expert from the Jeremy Kyle show 
at the couple’s home 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/may/29/katie-price-autobiography-kieran-hayler-lie-detector>
. The polygraph was strapped on in the couple’s front room. “There are two 
wrist straps, a heat sensor under your bum, two chest straps, two sweat 
monitors and a cuff you have to wear on your fingers,” Kieran recalled 
movingly. “Katie wrote a list of questions she wanted me to answer, but the man 
only chose three … I had read so much crap about these tests being inaccurate, 
so I convinced myself I had a 50/50 chance of getting away with it.” Alas, that 
was not to be. Still, the couple seem to have – and I’m both delighted and 
somewhat amazed to be typing this – got through this little local difficulty, 
and approach 2015 back together on the cover of OK magazine announcing that 
“It’s not about Christmas presents this year – it’s about Kieran saying his 
vows again and sticking to them.” Festive good cheer and a happy new year to 
all.

 No paparazzi in sight and Alec Baldwin is looking happy. Photograph: Steve 
Schofield for the Guardian 
No showbiz awards love-in would be complete without a tear-jerking look at the 
stars to whom we said goodbye in 2014. Not the ones who died, you understand – 
but the people who announced they were formally retiring from public life. 
Whatever the hell that means remains unclear, given the enduringly high 
visibility of retirees such as runnerupShia LaBeouf 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/10/shia-labeouf-retiring-from-all-public-life>
. Even so, honours would go toMr Alec Baldwin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2014/feb/24/alec-baldwin-fine-art-becoming-unfamous>
 for his 5,000-word essay in New York magazine, entitled:Goodbye, Public Life 
<http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/alec-baldwin-good-bye-public-life.html>. Its 
best bits are too numerous to detail in full, but perhaps reached their apex in 
an analysis of why Alec so frequently resorts to vicioushomophobic slurs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/feb/27/alec-baldwin-farewell-homophobia>
 when confronted with paparazzi. “Warren Beatty, who is mystifyingly 
intelligent and wise,” explained Alec, “said to me: your problem is a very 
basic one, and it’s very common to actors. And that’s when we step in front of 
a camera, we feel the need to make it into a moment. This instinct, even 
unconsciously, is to make the exchange in front of the camera a dramatic one.”
