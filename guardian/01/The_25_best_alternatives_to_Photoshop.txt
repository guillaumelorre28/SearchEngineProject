Adobe’s Photoshop is now 25 years old and is arguably the pinnacle of photo 
editing. But, at £8.57/month, it’s also much more expensive than most people 
can afford, so here are 25 alternatives for 25 years of photoshoppery.

The five best …

Pixelmator - best for Mac 

£22.99 - OS X
 Pixelmator is one of the best for OS X. Photograph: Pixelmator 
Pixelmator <http://www.pixelmator.com/> is arguably the best photo editor on a 
Mac. It handles even the largest photos with ease, replicates as many Photoshop 
tools as are generally required, as well as Photoshop file support, and has an 
excellent heal tool that can interpret what’s around it and fill in detail.

Excellent for quick touching up of photos to detailed manipulation for novices 
and pros alike. There’s even a very capable £7.99 iPad Pixelmator app with many 
of the same tools and ease of use that make the Mac app great.

Paint.net – best for Windows

Free - Windows

 Microsoft Paint on steroids. Photograph: Paint.net 
Paint.net <http://www.getpaint.net/> started life as a simple replacement for 
Microsoft Paint, but evolved with new features such as multiple layers and more 
advanced photo editing tools. Today it is one of the fastest free photo editors 
for Windows, with a capable feature set that stops just short of some of the 
professional manipulation tools.

Excellent for quick edits, crops and the majority of daily photo editing. Best 
of all, it’s free.

Adobe Lightroom - best for bulk-managing photos

 Adobe Lightroom 5 is available as a standalone product or as part of the 
company’s Creative Cloud subscription service. Photograph: Adobe 
Arguably the best photo manager, Adobe Lightroom <https://lightroom.adobe.com/>
 has enough tools, even for professionals, to avoid having to open up a 
separate image editor, including some of Photoshop’s healing and manipulation 
tools. It also has a solid collection of batch processing and automated 
correction tools based on lighting, lens and camera models, which makes it fast 
for most jobs.

Aviary Photo Editor - best for mobile 

Free - Android, iOS
 Aviary for the iPad, iPhone and Android Photograph: Aviary 
Aviary <https://www.aviary.com/> is a solid image editor with very capable 
image touch-up and resizing tools, now owned by Adobe. It’s straightforward 
interface makes it easy to use and has more to offer than most mobile editors 
obsessed with Instagram-style filters.

Autodesk Pixlr - best in the browser

Free - Windows, OS X, Android, iOS and web
 Pixlr for Mac. Photograph: Autodesk 
Pixlr <https://pixlr.com/> is a free jack of all trades photo editor with a 
solid tool set for almost any project. The web app is one of the most fully 
featured, while its mobile and desktop apps are also solid. Some of Pixlr’s 
most advanced features require a $15 a year subscription, but it has the 
backing of Autodesk, making of some of the best computer-aided design tools.

The best of the rest …

 PaintShop Pro - Photoshop’s long-term rival. Photograph: Corel 
Photoshop’s long-standing rival. PaintShop Pro is cheaper than its juggernaut 
of a rival but similarly specified. It lacks some of Photoshop’s most advanced 
features, and is bettered by some of its newer often-free competitors, but is 
still a capable editor.

 Serif PhotoPlus Photograph: Serif 
PhotoPlus is a solid all-round image editor for Windows from the company that 
created Affinity Photo for OS X. It has a decent set of tools, including lens 
correction tools and other favourites of photographers. The only downside is 
that many of the advanced tools require more manual manipulation than some 
other programs and therefore it isn’t as beginner friendly.

 Photoshop Elements is Adobe’s cut-down image editor that includes most of the 
tools people use from the full Photoshop for a lesser cost. Photograph: Adobe 
Photoshop’s cut-down cousin Elements has improved dramatically over the last 
couple of years from a tool to avoid to a photo editor for everyone else. It 
has many of the same tools as its bigger brother, save for the advanced Content 
Aware Fill and a few other professional tools. Solid for most tasks, although 
free or cheaper tools with similar features are available.

Another excellent image editor for OS X, Acorn is billed as the “image editor

users and easy to pick up for notices.

Affinity Photo attempts to be Photoshop on a budget, but not dumbed down. It’s 
fast, packed with advanced tools and is aimed at professionals. Part of that

Photoshop Content Aware Fill-like tool called Inpainting.

Aperture

£59.99 - OS X
 Apple’s professional photo management and manipulation software, but Aperture 
will be replaced by Apple Photos in the near future. Photograph: Apple 
Apple’s long-standing photo organiser and editor, Aperture is one of the most 
efficient ways of tweaking groups of photos, and making and reviewing small 
adjustments. The magnifying loop tool is particularly effective. It’s simpler 
to use than many of its competitors and can be used in conjunction with iPhoto.

 ACDSee Pro 8 Photograph: ACDSee 
ACDSee is an Adobe <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/adobe> Lightroom 
analogue with photo management at its heart. It is fast and effective, but has 
limited metadata sorting and no automatic correction based on lens profiles. It 
has enough editing tools to improve the odd photo, but some of it can be a 
clumsy mix of destructive and non-destructive editing.

The cheaper ACDSee 18 lacks some of the more advanced features but could be a 
good option for photo management.

 Behind the simple image viewer, Preview offers some useful image editing tools.
Apple’s built-in image and document viewer for OS X is a bit of a dark horse. 
Underneath its simple viewing exterior hides a fast and effective image editor 
that’s perfectly capable of cropping, resizing, reformatting and simple 
touchups. It is particularly good at editing a bunch of images at once.

Microsoft Paint

Free - Windows
 Microsoft’s long-standing image editor is still available. Photograph: 
Microsoft 
Microsoft’s original image editor. It’s changed a bit in recent years and is 
still a solid, basic image editor. It’s worth a go for nostalgia’s sake at the 
very least, or for simple cropping and resizing jobs that really don’t require 
something as powerful as Photoshop.




Sumo paint

Free - web

A Photoshop facsimile in the browser, the free Sumo Paint is an excellent 
quick photo editor. Many of the advanced tools are only available in a $19 pro 
version, but for straightforward touching up of images, resizing and similar 
the free editor does the job.

 FotoFlexer 
Billed as “the world’s most advanced online image editor” it has numerous 
features for most types of editing. Image manipulation tools are just a simple 
click and drag-a-slider away, but most tools have little in the way of guidance 
so beginners might struggle. Those looking for more powerful fill features will 
need to look elsewhere.

Ribbet, despite it’s odd name and frog logo, is a quick and easy-to-use online 
image editor that does most of the editing for you, making it excellent for

options are out there.

 Snapseed might have been sidelined for Google+, but the image editor is still 
one of the better ones around. Photograph: Google 
Snapseed is Google’s mobile image editor that’s been sidelined after it was 
acquired to be integrated into Google+. But the app still works and its tools, 
filters and easy-to-use touch controls are still some of the best around.

 Adobe’s mobile version of Photoshop is a capable touchscreen image editor. 
Photograph: Adobe 
Photoshop Touch is Adobe’s touchscreen focused mobile variant, but it isn’t 
nearly as powerful or feature rich as its namesake. It has a selection of photo 
filters and some decent touchup tools, but it’s biggest selling point is 
integration with Adobe’s Creative Cloud, which is useful for desktop Photoshop 
users.

Adobe’s lighter Photoshop Express is also available for free with very basic 
tools.
