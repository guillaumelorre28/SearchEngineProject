 Watch the trailer for Fury 
Fury <https://www.theguardian.com/film/fury> beat out competition from two new 
films. In third place was musical animation The Book of Life, with a healthy 
opening haul of $17m. The well-reviewed riff on Mexico’s Day of the Dead 
festival, featuring the voices of Diego Luna, Ron Perlman, Channing Tatum and 
Christina Applegate, has been timed to hit cinemas ahead of the Halloween 
period.

Romantic drama The Best of Me <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-best-of-me>
, starring Michelle Monaghan and James Marsden as lovers reunited after 20 
years apart, debuted in fifth spot with $10.2m.


There were no other new films in this week’s top 10. However, the Oscar-tipped 
black comedy Birdman, starring Michael Keaton as the faded one-time star of a 
superhero blockbuster, picked up spectacular figures on its first week of 
limited release. Alejandro Inarritu’s film scored an average of $103,750 from 
four cinemas in New York and Los Angeles, the second best figures in the past 
two years behind Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel.
