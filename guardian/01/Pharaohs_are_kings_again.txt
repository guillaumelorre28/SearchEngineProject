(Egypt win4-2 on pens) 


Hosts Egypt won the African Nations Cup for a record fitfh time after 
prevailing over Ivory Coast in a penalty shoot-out.

Captain Didier Drogba and second-half substitute Bakary Koné both missed spot 
kicks for the Ivorians, giving Mohamed Abo Treka the opportunity to seal 
victory by sending goalkeeper Jean-Jacques Tizié the wrong way - and 74,000 
home fans into delirium.

Egypt had a goal disallowed for offside in the 85th minute and also missed a 
controversially-awarded penalty in the first half of extra-time, when Tizié 
dived full-length to tip Ahmed Hassan's low shot onto the post. But despite 
those close shaves, the Ivorians were unquestionably the better team throughout 
the game, and would have won comfortably had their penetration been as 
effective as their foreplay.

Drogba was particularly wasteful, squandering several opportunities in the 
second half as the Ivorians' superior power and technique was obvious. The 
Chelsea man's most inexcusable miss came in the 79th minute when Arouna Koné 
retrieved the ball on the by-line and cut it back to Drogba, who, from just 
five yards out, ballooned it high over the bar.
