Set in the summer of 1963, Dirty Dancing is a love story revolving around 
17-year-old Baby and Johnny, the man who teaches her how to dance.

Eleanor Bergstein, who wrote the screenplay for the original movie, is on 
board for the new small screen incarnation.

She was also behind the successful 2004 musical, Dirty Dancing: The Classic 
Story on Stage.

A prequel called Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was released in that same year, 
with British actress Romola Garai.

ABCâ€™s Dirty Dancing is the latest musical adaptation planned for television. 
Recent US productions have included The Sound of Music Live! and Peter Pan 
Live!, which starred Girls actress Allison Williams.

This Christmas, ITV will present a live broadcast
