The British No3 Anne Keothavong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> suffered a second-round 
hammering at the hands of the top seed, Italy's Roberta Vinci, at the 
Luxembourg Open.

Keothavong had beaten the Dutch player Kiki Bertens 6-2, 6-2 in the first 
round but had no answer on Thursday as Vinci's second break of the match helped 
her win a close first set 6-4.

The Italian took both of her break-point opportunities in the second set as 
she clinically wrapped up a 6-4, 6-1 win in just over an hour and set up a 
match with either the American Venus Williams or ninth-seeded Mona Barthel from 
Germany.
