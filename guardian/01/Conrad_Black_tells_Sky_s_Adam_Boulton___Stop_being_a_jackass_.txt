Disgraced former Daily Telegraph owner Conrad Black is back in town, throwing 
verbal haymakers at all and sundry ahead of aguest hosting turn on Friday's 
Have I Got News for You 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/15/conrad-black-appear-bbc1-hignfy?INTCMP=SRCH>
.

In barely 24 hours since touching down in Britain after a three-year jail 
stint in the US, in his tour of London TV studios the former mogul has already 
brandedSky News's Adam Boulton "a jackass" 
<http://news.sky.com/story/1001568/conrad-black-ill-keep-my-seat-in-the-lords> 
andtold Newsnight's Jeremy Paxman he's "a priggish, gullible British fool" 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20036674>. This after telling the 
Mail on Sunday 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediamonkeyblog/2012/oct/22/rupert-murdoch-conrad-black>
 that Rupert Murdoch is "a psychopath ... like Stalin, except that he doesn't 
kill people".

After serving 37 months in the US for defrauding investors and obstructing the 
course of justice, viewers might have expected more humility from the former 
press baron. Not a bit of it – he's got a book to promote, after all:Conrad 
Black <https://www.theguardian.com/business/conradblack> – a Matter of 
Principle.

In round one with Paxman on Monday night, the Newsnight presenter appeared to 
adopt Muhammad Ali's rope-a-dope strategy, goading Black with repeated 
suggestions that he was a criminal – with spectacular results.

Black came out swinging: "Let me tell you something. I am proud of having gone 
through the terribly difficult process of being falsely charged, falsely 
convicted and ultimately almost completely vindicated without losing my mind, 
becoming irrational, ceasing to be a penitent and reasonable person and 
actually being able to endure a discussion like this without getting up and 
smashing your face in."

When a slightly flummoxed Paxman interjected: "Well, you go ahead", Black 
replied: "No, I don't believe in violence."

Earlier he told Paxman: "I've been persecuted half to death. I don't have any 
shame. I am proud of what happened. I am proud of being in a US federal prison 
and surviving it."

Throughout his Sky News <https://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-news> and 
Newsnight appearances, Black's line of defence is that he was a victim of a 
terrible miscarriage of justice.

"Everything I did was legal, I didn't misunderstand [the law]. It as a smear 
job from A to Z because 99.95% of prosecutions are convicted, the whole [US 
legal] system is a fraudulent fascistic conveyor belt of corrupt prison 
system," he told Newsnight.

When Paxman reminded him he was nonetheless a convicted criminal, Black turned 
to him: "You're a fool, you're just a gullible fool; a priggish, gullible 
British fool, who takes seriously this ghastly American justice system that any 
sane British person knows is an outrage."

On Tuesday afternoon, he popped up for his second round on Sky News's Boulton 
& Co. "Stop being a jackass, you're just being abrasive," he chided menacingly 
when Boulton asked him where he was going to live when his nativeCanada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada>, where he is on a one-year temporary 
visa, turfed him out. "I am not a refugee."

"Let me tell you something," he chided, before stopping to ask Boulton "What's 
your name again?"

Later when asked why he had agreed to appear on BBC2's Have I Got News for You 
to be mocked, he said: "I am here to sell books; I am not here to enjoy your 
somewhat predictable questions."

He branded Boulton's employer, Rupert Murdoch, "a sleaze-mongerer" and 
insisted he wasn't a criminal because the US legal system had no "validity".

In 2007 Black was convicted of defrauding Hollinger International shareholders 
of $6.1m (£3.8m), by paying himself a tax-free bonus from the sale of newspaper 
assets without the approval of the company's board. He had been forced out of 
the company by shareholders in 2003.

Black was released on bail after serving two-and-a-half years while his case 
was under an appeal, which resulted in two of his three fraud convictions being 
quashed. His original 78-month sentence was reduced to three years.

He returned to jail last September to serve another 13 months and with time 
off for good behaviour he has completed his sentence.

It is clear he does not see this as a bar to returning to public life in the 
UK, or resuming his seat in the House of Lords. He compared his plight to that 
of Nelson Mandela when he was released from Robben Island.

"First of all there is not a prohibition on a convicted criminal sitting [in 
the Lords]," Black said on Newsnight. He told Boulton that he would 
"presumably" return to the upper house but hadn't decided yet.

When Paxman moved to the subject of the extravagance of his wife Barbara 
Amiel, he feigned biliousness: "Oh, God, I'm going to throw up.

"My first morning back in Britain and am I to be subjected to this? She wasn't 
extravagant. She's a magnificent wife – she visited me every week in prison, 
even when she had to come back from China to do it."

Tom Bower, author of a book about Black, told Newsnight: "What is so comical 
about Conrad Black is when he was in London he was always saying how genius 
capitalism is, but when shareholders said that he was stealing money in 2001, 
he said he was the victim.

Five years ago he was convicted of defrauding the company he ran, Hollinger. 
He still claims to be innocent of all crimes. In the end Conrad Black believes 
he is god and everyone must bow to him."

"The one thing you can't say is he is a coward, he comes back again and again 
to suppress his critics."
