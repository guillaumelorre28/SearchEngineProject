Tory MPs including Amber Rudd <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd>
, the home secretary, whose constituents have been affected by the disruption 
of Southern rail services, have stepped up their criticism of the continuing 
industrial action.

Members of rail union Aslef will strike for three days this week in a move 
that the MP for Hastings and Rye branded totally unacceptable. The strikes will 
halt allSouthern <https://www.theguardian.com/business/southern> services, 
disrupting the 500,000 passengers who use its services in southern England 
every day.

Rudd said the strikes were resulting in misery for commuters. “It is totally 
unacceptable that our local area and communities will suffer further strikes 
over driver-only operated trains when they already run safely across much of 
the UK network and when current staff will take home the same pay following the 
changes proposed by the train company,” theDaily Telegraph reported 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/11/amber-rudd-condemns-unacceptable-strike-due-shut-one-countrys/>
 her as saying.


“Southern’s plans, opposed by the unions, will lead to better journeys for 
passengers. I call on both sides to come together and bring an end to this 
miserable period of strikes and industrial action suffered by our constituents.”

Huw Merriman, the Tory MP for Bexhill and Battle, told the Telegraph the 
strike action was “totally selfish and unnecessary”.

He said: “This is utterly unfair on local rail users who have already endured 
years of travel misery and just want to be able to get to work. Our local 
businesses are suffering, as is our local tourist industry.”

Peter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove and chair of the all-party parliamentary group 
on Southern Rail, said he believed that it would be first time since 1994 that 
London Victoria to Brighton trains had been completely halted by strikes.

“The prospect of not a single Southern train running on Tuesday will be a 
catastrophe for passengers, businesses and the wider economy during the busy 
Christmas period. There is now no end in sight to this misery,” he said.

“The government now offers the only way out of the situation, so ministers 
must stop hiding in the shadows of this dispute and become an active partner in 
finding a resolution.”

A high court ruling last week refused to grant an injunction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/08/court-rejects-bid-to-prevent-southern-train-drivers-industrial-action>
 to prevent Aslef members striking, but Govia Thameslink Railway, the company 
that owns Southern, has appealed against the court’s decision.

Charles Horton, its chief executive, said: “Our passengers have suffered 
months of travel misery and we call again on the unions to call off their 
action and work with us to find a resolution to their dispute.”

Drivers from Aslef and the Rail, Maritime and Transport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> union (RMT) are due to strike on 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday this week, and for a further six days in January.

The RMT is embroiled in a bitter dispute over the role of conductors, while 
Aslef is opposed to driver-only trains.

Aslef members have imposed an overtime ban for drivers, which is having a more 
significant effect than the parallel series of strikes by Southern’s 
conductors, who belong to the RMT. A shortage of drivers has left Southern 
reliant on voluntary overtime to fill rosters and many trains have been 
cancelled owing to a lack of crews.
