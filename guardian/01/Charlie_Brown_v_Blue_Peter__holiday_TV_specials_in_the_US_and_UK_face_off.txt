A Charlie Brown Christmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas>
, the beloved holiday special featuring Charles Schultz’s Peanuts characters, 
was originally commissioned and sponsored by Coca-Cola and aired in the US on 
CBS on 9 December 1965. This year marks its 50th anniversary, and to celebrate 
its history, ABC (which has owned the rights since 2000) will host a special 
about the creation of the program, featuring musical performances by Kristen 
Chenoweth, Glee’s Matthew Morrison and Boyz II Men.


But while A Charlie Brown Christmas is a holiday institution in the US, in the 
UK it’s more of a cult favorite. So what do our holiday TV viewing differences 
say about us? We asked American and British TV writers Brian Moylan and Hannah 
Verdier to explain.

 The opening scene of A Charlie Brown Christmas. 
Brian Moylan: I can’t believe you don’t watch Charlie Brown Christmas on your 
side of the pond, Hannah. As soon as I hear the opening score, a smooth jazz 
song called Christmas Time Is Here, I get in the mood for hot chocolate and 
writing a letter to Santa. The funny thing about A Charlie Brown Christmas, 
however, is that it isn’t just a happy, funny Christmas story. It’s actually 
melancholy and emotionally complex. Charlie Brown is depressed around the 
holidays, something that millions of people can understand.
Charlie’s problem with Christmas is that it’s become so commercial, and lost 
its true meaning. He sees shiny aluminum Christmas trees for sale everywhere, 
but instead he buys a scrawny, sad tree and decorates it with a single 
ornament. To lighten his spirits he throws a Christmas pageant with his 
friends, narrated by Linus, who tells us that the real meaning of Christmas is 
about baby Jesus being born.

In America we love to enforce Christianity at every turn. Linus really would 
have hated the “war on Christmas” and those plain red Starbucks cups.

What sort of holiday specials did you guys watch as kids?

Hannah Verdier (UK): Where have you been all our lives, A Charlie Brown 
Christmas? I’ve just watched it for the first time with a three-year-old and 
we’re blown away. Who knew Charlie Brown waged such a war on capitalism? He’d 
be one of those annoying people who posts on Facebook urging his friends to 
avoid the shops on Black Friday.

 Mr Tumble’s Christmas Something Special 2015 
Over in the UK, Christmas specials take a more practical approach. In the 
1970s and 80s, Christmas couldn’t start until the Blue Peter presenters had 
made their advent crown. (For the uninitiated, Blue Peter is a BBC show for 
kids that’s been running since 1958.) The advent crown was carefully crafted 
from two coat hangers, some tinsel and candles held in place by plasticine. 
Flammable is an understatement. Add in a dog on the loose in the studio (the 
beloved and often excitable Shep) and it’s a health and safety nightmare that 
wouldn’t be allowed today.

BBC children’s TV presenters always perform a pantomime, telling a traditional 
tale like Peter Pan, but with cross-dressing, boo-ing and cries of “Oh no you 
didn’t/Oh yes you did!” from the audience. That, my friend, is essential 
festive entertainment. These days, the star of the show is Mr Tumble, a genius 
of a clown who uses sign language to entertain children with learning 
difficulties. Inclusive, plus he looks pretty special in a dress.

Beat that, Charlie Brown.

Brian Moylan: Your pantomimes sure sound like a lot of fun, and a lot edgier 
than the children’s Christmas fare we were reared on. Most of our specials 
teach the importance of family and that it’s OK to be different even at 
Christmas time. How the Grinch Stole Christmas (the animated special, not the 
awful Jim Carrey movie) is all about how a Scrooge of a green fuzzy thing 
learned that Christmas wasn’t about gifts, but about being together with those 
closest to you. That’s how his heart grew three sizes that day.

 The Grinch’s heart grows three sizes bigger. 
But the most memorable special was the Claymation version of Rudolph the 
Red-Nosed Reindeer. Naturally it’s based on the song (you have to know that, 
right?) but in this very 60s telling of the story, the nonconformist Rudolph, 
the burly bear of a man Yukon Cornelius, a (seemingly very gay) elf who wants 
to be a dentist and his wacky friends from the Island of Misfit Toys are the 
ones who help Santa deliver toys to all the kiddies across the globe. From this 
we learned that sometimes it’s good to be a weirdo, but only if being a weirdo 
gives you superpowers.

Hannah Verdier: If we did have an animated Christmas special to rival yours, 
it would beThe Snowman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/dec/14/the-snowman-and-snowdog-remakes>
, Raymond Briggs’ tale of a small boy with a melty friend. Spoiler alert: 
there’s no happy ending. Every year, we hear a sweet-voiced choirboy singing 
Walking in the Air and we know that small boy will be left with just a puddle 
of water and a scarf where the Snowman once stood. You might as well start 
crying at the beginning to save yourself the hassle later. A bit like Frosty 
The Snowman, right?

Brian Moylan: That sounds super depressing! Being the optimistic Americans 
that we are, Frosty the Snowman has a similiar but much more upbeat ending. 
Frosty melts in a greenhouse, but then Santa arrives and uses his magic and 
Frosty is magically revived. Then Santa promises that Frosty will return every 
year to make the kids happy. Isn’t that sweet?

 Santa saves Frosty the Snowman. 
We know from Downton Abbey that you guys also have a long history of Christmas 
specials for popular series. Our shows air for most of the year, so they all do 
a Christmas-themed episode, but it’s not such a big deal. What’s up with 
Christmas specials over there? Are there any great ones?

Hannah Verdier: Oh yes, so many greats, but we can’t promise to match your 
country’s optimism at this most wonderful time of the year. Over here, a merry 
Christmas isn’t always guaranteed – our soaps thrive on fights, death and 
misery. EastEnders loves a shocking revelation over the turkey dinner and it’s 
not Christmas on Coronation Street without a catfight at the school nativity.

Ricky Gervais took a more romantic approach in The Office and a nation cheered 
when will-they-or-won’t-they couple Dawn and Tim finally kissed at their work 
Christmas party. The Royle Family celebrated family time sitting round 
complaining about what’s on telly, then moved us to tears when Denise went into 
labour. One of the warmest sitcoms of recent times, Gavin and Stacey, nailed 
the great British tradition of singing along toBand Aid’s Do They Know It’s 
Christmas? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE> and panic-buying 
underwear at Marks and Spencer.

 Dawn kisses Tim on The Office. 
Blackadder’s Christmas Carol may be nearly 30 years old, but few tire of 
hearing the words: “Baldrick, I want you to go out and buy a turkey so large 
you’d think it’s mother had been rogered by an omnibus.” Yes, repeats are big 
in these budget-conscious times. But for the big Christmas special that brings 
the family together around the TV and sparkles with famous faces, monsters and 
stories that work on many levels, look no further than Dr Who.
