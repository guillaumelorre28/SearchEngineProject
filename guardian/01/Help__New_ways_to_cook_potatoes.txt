I always cook potatoes the same way: mashed, fried or boiled, usually with a 
pinch of salt and pepper. Have you got any advice on a more creative way of 
cooking them?

With a little preparation, you can create some memorable dishes with your 
spuds. One of my all-time favourites is the potato cake. Bake 2-4 large jacket 
potatoes on a tray with a little salt. When ready, allow them to cool a little. 
Holding a potato in a cloth, cut it in half and scoop out the flesh. Put the 
flesh through a ricer and season with a little salt and a generous amount of 
pepper. Then, on a clean surface, roll the potato into a tight cylinder and 
slice into 2cm-rounds. Allow each "cake" to cool, then refrigerate.

To fry, heat a little oil and butter in a frying pan and colour the cakes 
quickly. These are fabulous with a rich tomato sauce and some parmesan as a 
supper dish, or they can be the carb of a main meal. They can be prepared well 
in advance and will keep for a couple of days in the fridge.

New potatoes should soon be in the shops, so here's a braised dish that works 
well with fish. Chop a couple of shallots and sweat in a little olive oil with 
a clove of garlic, a pinch of sea salt, a sprig of thyme, a bay leaf and a good 
pinch of saffron threads. Add some well-scrubbed jerseys and continue sweating. 
Add a little white wine, burn it off, then cover with veg stock or water and 
cook in the oven until tender. Lift the potatoes out and reduce the liquid.

Finally, here's a quick, delicious potato salad: peel and cube the raw 
pototoes. Then, using either sunflower or olive oil, roast at 180C/250F/gas 
mark 4 until cooked, then drain on kitchen paper. Mix with feta, capers, basil 
and oven-dried tomatoes.
