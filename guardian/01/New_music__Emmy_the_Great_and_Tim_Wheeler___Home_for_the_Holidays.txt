As much as the festive season is about mistletoe and wine, children singing 
Christian rhymes, it's also about returning home to your family and seeing 
people from your past who only appear in your life once a year. This sense of 
rekindling old relationships is at the heart of Home for the Holidays, the 
first single to be taken fromEmmy the Great 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/emmy-the-great> and Tim Wheeler's 
forthcoming Christmas collection, This Is Christmas. Comprising nine original 
songs and an obligatory cover, it was initially recorded under the moniker 
Sleigher, with sessions starting after the pair were grounded by snowstorms 
last December. As with recent Christmas albums by She & Him and Sufjan Stevens, 
there's a danger of twee overload with Home for the Holidays – "Let's meet up 
for a drink/ On the old park bench/ In the place we almost kissed" – but the 
endearing nostalgia and the fact that they both know their way around a good 
melody means the song should melt even the coldest heart. For the video – 
premiered here – the pair sport their finest knitwear in a lovely looking 
wood-panelled pub, their coyness around each other soon banished by mistletoe 
and a festive-fuelled loss of inhibition.

• This Is Christmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> is 
released through Infectious Music on 21 November.
