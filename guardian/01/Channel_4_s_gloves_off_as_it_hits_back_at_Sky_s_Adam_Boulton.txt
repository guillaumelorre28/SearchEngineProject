This is better than Anchorman. Adam Boulton's dismissal of Channel 4 News 
presenters as "muppets … fighting over the autocue" 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/02/sky-adam-boulton-politicians> 
has prompted a fierce response from Ben de Pear, the Channel 4 News editor. He 
tweeted the Sky News political editor: "IF Jon's co hosts r Muppets, (they're 
not) u lot r Fraggle Rock. Don't remember them? Exactly". Sky News anchor 
Dermot Murnaghan, who had been staying out of the fracas, was included in 
another barbed tweet from de Pear to Boulton: "u have the advantage, being on 
Sky, of no one recognising you. Hassle free." Channel 44 anchor Krishnan 
Guru-Murthy intervened to play peacemaker. "Ben wasn't referring to Dermot 
(Murnaghan) who is obviously huge star and ex-C4news," he tweeted. Guru-Murthy 
challenged Boulton to donate £500 to Duchenne Dash, a 24 hour bike ride from 
London to Paris attempted by media figures to raise funds to combat Duchenne 
Muscular Dystrophy, as penance for his "unprovoked rudeness."
