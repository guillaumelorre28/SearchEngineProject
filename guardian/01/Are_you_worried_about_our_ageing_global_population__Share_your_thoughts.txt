The global population is ageing fast. The number of over 60s will top 1bn in 
the next couple of years, and the ratio of pensioners to working age people is 
changing fast. People are routinely living to 100 in some parts of the world, 
leading to the possibility of longer retirements than careers. Governments are 
scrambling to make provisions for this changing demographic.

As part of our coverage of the topic, we’d like you to shape our journalism. 
If you’re an older person or work with older people, you can share your 
thoughts by filling in the form below. If you’re a younger person, tell us your 
hopes and fears for your silver years. We’ll use a selection in our reporting.

How should societies around the world adapt and what provisions do they need 
to make for their elderly millions? How can we create societies where people 
aren’t so worried about getting old? What opportunities are there for older 
people where you live? Do we need to encourage more inter-generational contact? 
What are the issues around financing retirement, and how do we make sure older 
people have the money to participate in society? Is it possible to live too 
long - and if so, what should be done about this?
