I read the heartwarming letter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/28/music-shone-through-my-wifes-alzheimers>
 (29 November) in which Dennis Ruston said that even when his late wife had 
advanced Alzheimer’s she loved to join in the hymns on TV’s Songs of Praise and 
was word-perfect.Singing for the Brain 
<https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=760> 
groups, organised by the Alzheimer’s Society, allow people with dementia to 
join in songs from their youth. They normally each have a carer with them to 
support and encourage them to sing. Researchers have found that the brain’s 
musical pathways remain relatively unscathed by the illnesses that affect 
normal speech, and people who have lost their speech because of dementia, 
stroke and other conditions can often still access the words of songs. In such 
cases, singing is one of the few remaining activities that a dementia patient 
and their spouse can enjoy equally together.
