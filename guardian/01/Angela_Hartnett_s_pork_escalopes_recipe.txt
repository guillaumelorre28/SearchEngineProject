Chicken escalopes are ubiquitous in Italian restaurants, often covered in 
tomato sauce and mozzarella. My pork version has more in common with the veal 
schnitzel, and works well garnished with anchovies and capers. If you're 
feeling decadent, it's lovely with a fried egg served on top.

4 pork escalopes, about 130g each
150g flour, seasoned
2 eggs, beaten and seasoned
250g breadcrumbs
3 tbsp olive oil
75g butter
8 anchovy fillets
1 tbsp capers
1 tbsp flat leaf parsley, chopped

Flatten the escalopes between two sheets of greaseproof paper until they are 
roughly ½cm thick.

Divide the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs into three different bowls.

Dip the escalopes into the flour, then the egg, and finally the breadcrumbs, 
shaking off any excess crumbs.

Put the oil into a shallow pan on a medium heat. Add the pork and start to 
brown.

Add the butter and cook the escalopes for a couple of minutes on each side 
until golden brown.

Remove from the pan and place on kitchen paper to remove any remaining oil, 
before plating up.

Garnish each escalope with the anchovies, capers and parsley and serve with a 
green salad.
