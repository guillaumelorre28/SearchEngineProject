At least 16 people died early on Sunday in a suicide truck bombing outside the 
busy sea port of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, the director of the ambulance 
service said.


“We assisted 48 wounded people and carried 16 others who were killed in the 
blast,” said Abdikadir Abdirahman Adem, director of Mogadishu’s AMIN ambulance 
service.

Mogadishu residents described a huge blast that could be heard across the city 
and a plume of smoke that rose above the skyline.

A spokesman for the city adminstration, Abdifatah Omar Halane, confirmed the 
blast but gave a lower toll of “nearly 10” killed. He said investigations were 
under way. Other reports put the toll as high as 29.

The al-Qaida aligned al-Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility in a 
statement distributed on its Telegram messaging account.

It said the target was a military base close to the port.

Al-Shabaab <https://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab> is fighting to 
overthrow the internationally backed government of Somalia and regularly stages 
deadly attacks on government, military and civilian targets in the capital and 
elsewhere in the wartorn country.

The attack took place close to the entrance to Mogadishu’s port. 

“The bomber targeted a civilian area, there were porters and other small scale 
traders in the area when the blast occurred,” said Ibrahim Mohamed, a senior 
police officer.

The attack comes as Somalia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia> is in 
the process of electing a new government, with the much-delayed presidential 
vote due on 28 December.
