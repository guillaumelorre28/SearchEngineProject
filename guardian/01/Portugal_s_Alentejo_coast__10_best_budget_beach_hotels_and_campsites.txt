The beaches of Portugal's Alentejo region are mostly part of the south-west 
Alentejo and Vicentina Coast natural park, making this one of Europe's 
best-preserved coastlines. But while strict planning laws have restricted the 
building of high rises, you can still find lovely places to stay on the beach 
for well under €100 for two B&B. Here's our pick of the best small hotels, 
guest houses and campsites.

Ilha do Pessegueiro campsite, Porto Covo

Directly in front of this campsite lies Ilha do Pessegueiro, with the ruins of 
a 16th-century fortress, a reminder of how strategic this stretch of coast once 
was. Boat trips to the island can be arranged in the village. The campsite is 
in a nature reserve, and although it is well-equipped its pitches don't have 
much shade. The best choice in summer is an apartment (sleeping four) or wooden 
bungalow (sleeping five). Most apartments have barbecues and there is a 
restaurant, bar, playground and shop.

Monte Carvalhal da Rocha campsite, Brejão
 Monte Carvalhal da Rocha campsite, Brejao. 
This campsite is on a rugged stretch of coast, close to quiet Praia do 
Machado, a less well-known beach than Praia do Carvalhal, partly because it is 
harder to reach – check your route with the friendly staff. The site has 2.5 
hectares of woods overlooking the sea and the valley, a swimming pool, 
restaurant, cafe, mini-market and playground. It is also a perfect spot for 
hikers on the Rota Vicentina. Explore small, hidden bays, take a walk on the 
rocks with a local fisherman to pick goose barnacles, or watch the boats arrive 
with the catch of the day in the fishing port of Azenha do Mar (weekdays until 
11am). Choose between camping, a room or an apartment (sleeping up to six ) 
– and ask for a sea view.

Hotel Soltróia, Tróia
 The Hotel Soltróia, Tróia has direct access to two beaches … if you can pull 
yourself away from its own pool 
This new nine-bedroom hotel is in a small village complex, on the Tróia 
peninsula, a nature reserve with gorgeous beaches about an hour south of 
Lisbon. The hotel has direct access to two beaches, each with its own charms. 
One, 30m from the hotel, is on the quiet Sado estuary; the other, opposite this 
narrow sand corridor, is the Atlantic beach, with views of theSerra da Arrábida 
<http://www.visitportugal.com/NR/exeres/B1508929-5EDF-4187-B8B8-9349F1C48485,frameless.htm>
 and passing dolphins. Away from the beach, you can walk around Roman ruins, 
where fish used to be processed, and a lagoon with sunken boats and birdlife.

Comporta Village, Comporta

Comporta beach has been discovered by the rich and famous (from politicians to 
royals), but this stretch of glorious white sand is still affordable and 
peaceful, though the stretches near the beach bars and restaurants are busy at 
times. There are 26 colourful apartments at Comporta Village, close to the 
Museu do Arroz (Rice Museum) restaurant. Hop on a bike (ask to hire one when 
you book) and visit Tróia, 15km away, partly on a cycle path, and the fishing 
village of Carrasqueira, with its simple but great restaurants. Restaurants in 
Comporta to try includeDona Bia <http://restaurantedonabia.pt/pt> and A Escola 
<http://restauranteaescola.pai.pt/>. Beaches at Pego, Brejos da Carregueira, 
and Carvalhal are also worth a visit.

Refúgio da Praia, Praia do Queimado

This isolated, six-room monte (the name for single-storey rural houses in 
these parts) is on the beach south of Porto Covo. It has stunning views amid 10 
hectares of countryside and is on theRota Vicentina 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2013/mar/15/rota-vicentina-walking-portugal-holiday>
 – the old fishermen's route that has been restored as a 110km coastal walk. 
The village of Porto Covo is great for fish and seafood: don't miss O Marquês 
restaurant (+351 269 905 036) in the main square, with its cheerful atmosphere 
and reasonable prices (seafood rice is a speciality).

for those who want to keep driving to a minimum. Renovated five years ago, it 
has one self-catering apartment and 10 bedrooms, some with a balcony. There's 
also a roof terrace. Take time to explore the village, where Jeremy Irons,

HS Milfontes Beach, Vila Nova de Milfontes

This modern hotel probably has the best location for sunseekers. There are 15 
rooms with balconies facing the sea and the river, and another 10 facing the 
pool. The beach is nearby and the hotel provides boat rides up the river. Take 
a day trip to nearby Cercal and further inland toOdemira 
<http://www.portugalgolfe.com/alentejo/odemira.htm>, two traditional Alentejo 
villages where there are fewer tourists and great local food – the famous

Herdade do Touril, Zambujeira do Mar

This monte has a great location. Zambujeira is the site of a music festival, 
Sudoeste <http://sudoeste.meo.pt/en>, each August. But for the rest of the 
year, Herdade do Touril is a perfect sanctuary. The house is set in 365 
hectares, mostly farmland, and families can stay in the estate's little houses 
(one or two bedrooms), decorated in rustic style. Tonel beach is close by 
(though it is an adventure to get down there) and free bikes are available to 
venture to other beaches, or to the impressive Cape Sardão, for the lighthouse 
and nesting storks.

Rosa dos Ventos, Zambujeira do Mar

This small B&B in Zambujeira do Mar is also a good base if you are hiking the 
Rota Vicentina 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2013/mar/15/rota-vicentina-walking-portugal-holiday>
