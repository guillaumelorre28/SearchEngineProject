Police <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> officers across Britain are 
expected to be issued with a new and more powerful Taser gun despite calls for 
use of the potentially fatal weapon to be curtailed, the Guardian has learned.

Amber Rudd <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd>, the home 
secretary, is due to give approval to the new model of the electric stun gun 
within weeks.

The X2 model has a second shot, in case the first fails to subdue a suspect, 
and is equipped with a warning crackle of bright electric light designed to 
encourage suspects to surrender before being fired upon.

The Home Office has been studying the new Taser for several months after 
police applied to use it in Britain. The current single-shot model, the X26, 
used by UK police forces, is 13 years old and spare parts are beginning to run 
out. Its likely successor, like the current model, delivers a 50,000-volt surge 
of electricity to incapacitate a suspect.

Steve White, chair of the Police Federation, which represents 124,000 
rank-and-file officers, said: “A police officer gets assaulted every 22 minutes 
and they should have access to the right equipment, so we welcome the new model 
Taser. The current model is obsolete and forces can’t get spare parts for them.”

But critics believe a string of deaths 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/timeline-of-taser-controversies-in-the-uk>
 allegedly linked to its use means Taser use should be curtailed. According to 
government figures, use of the devices has grown over recent years, with 1,921 
Taser discharges recorded by police in England and Wales in 2015.

Black and minority ethnic people are also three times more likely to be on the 
receiving end of the weapons when discharged by officers, according to official 
figures. At least 11 deaths in Britain have followed the use ofTasers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/tasers>, but none have conclusively been 
shown to have been caused by them.

An inquest jury found the use by police in Manchester of a Taser in 2013 on 
Jordon Begley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/25/court-quashes-report-clearing-police-death-of-man-tasered-jordon-begley>
 was “not reasonable” and that failings by police officers had contributed to 
his death. An official investigation into the incident has been reopened after 
the first one exonerated police.

Former footballer Dalian Atkinson

 died after a clash with officers in which a Taser was used in Telford in 
August 2016. A criminal investigation is under way and it is yet to be 
determined what the cause of death is and whether the Taser played any part.

Solicitor Sophie Khan, who has represented families who have lost relatives 
and believe Tasers are to blame, said: “The government should be looking to 
curb the use of Tasers instead of considering whether to authorise a new breed 
of Tasers, which is reported to be more powerful and more deadly then the model 
police forces use at present.

“The number of deaths and life-changing injuries that people have suffered as 
a result of the Taser cannot be ignored by the government, when they have a 
duty to protect us from harm. The families of those who I represent, whose 
loved ones have been Tasered are horrified that without a public consultation 
the government has pressed ahead with testing a weapon, which if unleashed 
would cause more Taser-related deaths.”

The US company that produces the device says it is wrong to describe the 
weapon as non-lethal, preferring instead the label “less lethal”. Steve Tuttle, 
vice-president of strategic communications for Taser, said the warning arc of 
electricity should make it less likely the device has to be fired. He said: 
“You can use a warning arc button that lights up electricity at the front of 
the device. They [the suspect] would see two large electrical arcs crackling 
loudly and they are pretty bright at the front of the weapon being aimed at 
them.”

Tuttle said the X2 was first on sale in 2011 in the US. It has a host of new 
features which improve accountability and the protection it offers police: “It 
is more powerful in that you have a second backup shot,” he said.

The Police Federation wants any officer who wants a Taser to be given it.

White said the public supported Taser use but a funding squeeze may slow the 
new models being introduced to Britain. He said: “It remains to be seen whether 
forces will be able to fund replacements, though, due to budget constraints. 
Public attitudes towards Taser are changing and it is a hugely valuable tool 
which can defuse situations, protect the public and save lives.”

The Home Office said: “We have now received a formal request from the police 
to authorise a replacement device and a decision will be made in due course. 
The home secretary follows a stringent authorisation process before approving 
less lethal weapons for use by the police, which includes extensive technical 
and medical evaluations, as well as operational trials.

“We are committed to giving the police the necessary tools to do their job – 
and Taser, a form of conductive energy device, provides officers with an 
important tactical option when facing potentially physically violent 
situations.”
