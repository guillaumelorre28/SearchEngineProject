The owner of the 27-year-old, white, BMW 5S Series sedan was concerned when 
buyers turned up to collect his car, which he had listed for sale on Gumtree.

The car had been in the family since it had been been bought brand-new and he 
was worried it might be crushed for scrap metal.

Ai Weiwei: supporters urged to fill collection cars with Lego bricks

Responding to his concerns, staff from the National Gallery of Victoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria> who collected the car 
from his Wheelers Hill home in Melbourne’s south-east told him to “keep any eye 
on stories about the NGV over the next few days”.

By 3.30pm, the car was parked in the sculpture garden of the gallery, and 
children were rushing to gleefully throw Lego blocks through its sunroof as 
part of a project with the Chinese dissident artistAi Weiwei 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei>. Colourful bricks and tiny 
men and women - mostly Star Wars figurines, it seemed - began forming in piles 
around the gear stick, over the centre console, and along the dashboard.

On Friday Weiwei announced on social media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/24/artist-ai-weiwei-banned-by-lego-to-build-artwork-australian-exhibition>
 that Lego had refused to fill a bulk order of the bricks, which the artist 
intended to use to create a series of portraits of prominent Australian human 
rights figures large enough to fill a 6x6x6 metre room at the NGV as part of 
his exhibition alongside Andy Warhol opening later this year.

The Danish mini-construction set giant did not wish for their brand to be 
associated with works of a political nature.

Its reasoning backfired. People from around the world immediately offered 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/25/artist-ai-weiwei-accept-offers-lego-around-world>
 to part with their bricks, and so swift was the reaction that by Wednesday, 
Weiwei had responded by asking the gallery to buy the car in order to use it as
a Lego collection point 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/ai-weiweis-lego-collection-points-are-you-donating-bricks>
. He said the car must have clear windows, a sunroof, and be free from any 
corporate logos.

While the NGV could not disclose the value of the car, an ad for the same 
model on Gumtree, which has since been removed, lists it for $5,500.

Though the gallery was due to close about two hours after the car arrived, a 
trickle of people nonetheless arrived armed with the bricks, including 
seven-year-old Wolfgang Maltby.

“There’s already all sorts of great stuff in there,” Wolfgang tells Guardian 
Australia, having disposed of his little plastic bag ofLego 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lego>.

“If he’s going to build something, he’s going to have to build something 
massive. After all, itis a whole car full.”

India Ross, a 17 year-old photography student at the Victorian College of the 
Arts, lives nearby the gallery and plans to return on Thursday, the official 
launch day of the Lego collection point. She will come with all the Lego she 
can find in her parents’ house.

“My parents have some very old Star Wars Lego, which might mysteriously find 
its way into the car,” she said. “I have some as a kid which I’m sure is still 
lying around in drawers.”

When Guardian Australia inspects the inside of the car, only sparsely littered 
with Lego so far, there do seem to be an abundance of firing missiles, 
spaceship hull pieces and tiny Captain Kirks.

“The new Star Wars Lego is coming out soon,” 15-year-old Aleph Johnston 
offers, clutching a box of ‘City Lego,’ appropriate, according to the box, for 
ages 6-12, making it slightly outside of Weiwei’s age range.

“I just bought it,” Johnston says.

“It looked the coolest.” 

While he says he wasn’t familiar with the work of Weiwei before today, he has 
been reading vigorously about the artist “for about the past half an hour,” 
ever since his dad, who works at the gallery, told him what was going on.

“I believe in the freedom of Lego,” Johnston says seriously. “Everyone 
deserves to make what they want with Lego.”

Meanwhile, some teenagers have written “Ai Weiwei” in yellow, orange, red and 
white bricks in front of the sedan.

Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin was announced as another official collection 
point on Wednesday, and will also receive a car.

For Max Delany, senior curator of contemporary art at the NGV, the furore the 
Lego saga has created could not be better publicity.

“We’re looking at the interesting connections and differences between Warhol 
and Wei Wei, they’re both artists who do engage with communication and the 
media very actively, and they are both artists who have cultivated their own 
celebrity,” he says of their upcoming show.

In addition to more than 300 works spanning the careers of both artists, 
Weiwei will contribute several major new installations to the exhibition.

It was too late for the Lego bricks to be used as they were intended, for the 
NGV installation of human rights figures, Delany said. Other materials would be 
used for that work instead.


“The Lego being donated will be used for a longer term project that is 
developing as we speak, and it is developing in a way not unlike social media, 
in an organic way,” he said.

“All the collecting of Lego taking place internationally will be sent to 
Weiwei’s studio, which will then be used to form a new major work focusing on 
freedom of speech and political art.”
