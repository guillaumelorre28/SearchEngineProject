Axon <https://www.theguardian.com/business/axongroup>, the IT services firm, 
brought forward its interim results yesterday - and took the opportunity to 
reverse abruptly its confident forecast three months ago of a return to sales 
growth by September.

"[Some European] contracts took longer to close than UK deals," investors will 
recall the company explaining in June. "We will see revenues start to ramp up 
in the autumn and through into 2002."

Yesterday, humbled management admitted there would in fact be no revenue 
growth this year thanks to "a rapid decline in demand for pure internet 
projects". This prompted a halving in the company's valuation, as shares fell 
132.5p to 120p.

Some analysts had advised investors to sell after Axon's chief operating 
officer Don Kirkwood sold £2.1m of shares in July.

As expected Axon's revenues for the six months to July rose 27% to £3.6m.
