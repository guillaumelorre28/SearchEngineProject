Bland singer-songwriters who have 14 people proofreading every tweet are over: 
Ariana Grande <https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande>, with her 
insistence on being carried like a baby by her bodyguard and constant sassing 
of journalists, is the pop star we need. In Side To Side, a sultry reggae-lite 
song about getting banged so hard you can’t walk properly, she recruits Nicki 
Minaj to lay it out: “I’m the queen of rap, young Ariana run pop.” Ariana is 
the pop star wedeserve.

Gaga’s comeback – co-written by Mark Ronson and Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker – 
is her first mainstream record since 2014. And it’s just… fine? It does make 
you think, though: what if we were all experiencing some kind of collective 
hallucination between 2009 and 2011, and Lady Gaga was never actually that 
amazing? The tea cup, the meat dress: what if it was all a distraction from the 
fact her voice has the same pitch as a commuter whining “Can you move down 
please?” in a packed train?

Soft Hair

Soft Hair is a new project from Connan Mockasin and Late Of The Pier’s Sam 
Dust. This starts off all trippy and 70s, then there’s a bit that sounds like 
an elderly R&B singer teetering on the edge of a nervy B, then a long clarinet 
solo and then 10 seconds of a lone drum. It’s begging to be used during a scene 
in a Seth Rogen comedy when someone accidentally takes LSD.


Kaytranada ft Syd 
You’re The One

Summer’s over, the big duvet’s out and you’re secretly putting the heating on 
when your partner’s out of the flat. So it’s almost a kick in the stomach that 
Kaytranada has made this sunshine house anthem. It features the Internet’s Syd 
Tha Kyd, who whispers: “You ain’t no good for me, I know it’s true.” It could 
be a plea not to break her heart, or a goodbye to the last Solero in the 
freezer.

Ninety per cent of music in 2016 is tropical house or Sean Paul. This week 
alone, he has two tracks out: Crick Neck is an aggressive electro-dancehall 
anthem about an expensive chiropractor bill as a result of leching in the club, 
and Trumpets is basically the same thing with trumpets. They could have saved 
time and studio fees by just merging these two tracks and giving Sean Paul the 
afternoon off.
