The Senegal midfielder Papa Bouba Diop has joined AEK Athens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aekathens> from Portsmouth on a two-year 
deal. The 32-year-old has agreed an option to extend the deal for another 
season.

Diop said: "I wanted to leave Portsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth>. I had already spent six 
years in England and wanted to try a new perspective. I talked to the 
president, who called me and told me how much he wanted me to move to AEK. At 
that time I had gone on vacation but when I returned to England I pushed for a 
move from my side of things.

"The truth is that I'm impressed [by AEK]. I was not expecting it. I've played 
in other countries, England, France, Switzerland, and I have not come across as 
warm an attitude anywhere else in the world. This reception I got is an 
incentive to fight with all my strength for this group."
