Arrested Development 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/arrested-development> is honoring its 
cult of fans with the opportunity to design the cover for the DVD release of 
its fourth season.

Show creator Mitch Hurwitz said in a letter to fans: 

So what do you say? Share the art you’ve made over the years or create new 
pieces just for Season 4 and I’ll help select one for the new DVD cover. And 
you’ll probably get paid something. Right? They’d probably have to just 
legally. I don’t know. I’m not a lawyer. But I do have lawyers. And they 
suggest I retract everything I’ve just written.

But they’re lawyers, they retract. You’re artists, you put out. Generally 
because no one will buy your art. I know that’s how I got into the business.

The contest <http://arrestedfanart.com/> ends on 19 September. Submissions 
will bereviewed on a criteria <http://rules.arrestedfanart.com/> of skill, 
design, connection to the show and originality.

The winner is set to be announced on 1 November and it could be one of these 
people:
