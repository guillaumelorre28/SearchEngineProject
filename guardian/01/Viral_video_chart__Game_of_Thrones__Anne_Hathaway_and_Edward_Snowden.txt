We start this week with a Sesame Street spoof on Game of Thrones – Game of 
Chairs <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhWUFXvaZjo>. The Game of Chairs will 
decide who will be crowned king or queen of Jesteros. Four players will march 
around three chairs while music plays until one of them remains. Who will win 
this game of musical chairs? Robb, Cersie, Joffrey, Daeneyrus or … ?

If that parody whets your appetite for history and fantasy then you will also 
enjoy a fun ride through musical history with three girls in a car 
<https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1015137791848363> and we also have some 
footagefrom 1947 of self defence for women 
<https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=994871383908830> – check out those heels.

Fitness and movement are big themes this week, from a lip-sync battle 
featuring Anne Hathaway doing Wrecking Ball by Miley Cyrus 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LguStmm8bRk>, to some amazing treadmill 
dancing featured on the Ellen DeGeneres 
<https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10153335336152240> show. And if flips, 
dance moves and tumbles of a moving walkway aren’t crazy enough for you, take a 
look at theSlip N Fly at Ohio Dreams,  
<https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1051953814833385>a private residential 
summer camp in the US for children aged seven to 17. The amazing waterslides 
are only open to the public for one weekend a year – but they certainly make 
you yearn for some summer pool fun.

Finally, we’ve got a couple of cute animal clips. I’m a mop 
<https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10153210705081661> will make you chuckle 
andtwo cats having a chat 
<https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10152673839843611> will hopefully stroke 
your fancy. Purrfect!
