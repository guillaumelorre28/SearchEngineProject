: 'This book should be bottled and sold at the chemist's, the perfect antidote 
to austerity and job loss – reading it feels like a rest cure.' - Lucy Ellmann

Our review 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/aug/28/being-wrong-kathryn-schulz-review>
: 'In this lovely book about human mistakes the sickeningly young, forbiddingly 
clever and vexingly wise American journalist Kathryn Schulz doesn't cite 
Aristotle, but he is a kindred spirit.' - Stuart Jeffries

Our review 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jan/02/first-novels-review-roundup>: 
'Mixing startling lyricism and sheer brutality, she plunges into the 
chattering, viscous heat and "hyena darkness" of Aden, 1935, in her portrayal 
of Jama, a young street boy ... His sufferings are too relentless and 
dehumanising to be called mere hardship – this is a significant, affecting book 
of the dispossessed.' - Catherine Taylor

Our review 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/aug/14/boxer-beetle-ned-beauman-review>: 
'It's clear from this compelling debut that Beauman can perform the complicated 
paradoxical trick required of the best 21st-century realist novelists: to take 
an old and predictable structure and allow it to produce new and unpredictable 
connections.' - Scarlett Thomas

Romantic Moderns: English Writers, Artists and the Imagination from Virgina 
Woolf to John Piper by Alexandra Harris

Our review 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/sep/25/romantic-moderns-alexandra-harris>
: 'In this brilliant book ... Alexandra Harris sets out to show that English 
culture between the wars contained another strand, one she calls romantic 
modernism. Whereas high modernism wanted to lay waste to the material past in 
order to re-fashion it upon rational lines, romantic modernists had a soft spot 
for what had gone before.' - Kathryn Hughes
