This is a British version of pannacotta, a special pud that's adapted 
from a Mark Hix recipe. The buttermilk gives it a real silkiness, and 
the poached fruit finishes it off with a flourish.

Serves 6

4 leaves of gelatine
250ml low-fat single cream
50g caster sugar
350ml buttermilk
100ml unsweetened apple juice

1. Soak the gelatine in a bowl until soft, following the instructions 
on the packet.

2. Bring half the low-fat cream to the boil with the sugar, remove 
from the heat and add the gelatine, then whisk until dissolved.

3. Add the rest of the cream, the buttermilk and the apple juice.

4. Pour into ramekins or small glass cups and leave to set in the fridge 
for 2-3 hours. When they've set, lightly loosen the ramekins by dipping them in 
hot water.

5. Tip the puds into dishes and serve with poached fruit such as rhubarb, 
apricots, prunes or pears.
