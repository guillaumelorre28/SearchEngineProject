The association reportedly said the former Australian of the Year had asked 
not to be considered for the medal which honours football achievement, personal 
development and community spirit and off-field engagement.

It comes after Goodes opted not to take part in the grand final motorcade for 
retiring players before last Saturday’s decider.

Earlier in the year, he took time out from football after he was booed by fans 
in Perth in round 17.

Goodes said racism was a reason for the jeering from some opposition fans, 
sparking widespread condemnation of the crowd behaviour from the wider 
community.

This year’s Madden Medal finalists are Carlton’s Chris Judd, Dustin Fletcher 
and Paul Chapman from Essendon, Fremantle’s Luke McPharlin, Daniel Cross from 
Melbourne, Kane Cornes from Port Adelaide and Chris Newman of Richmond.

The two-time Brownlow medallist is expected to bid farewell the game at 
Sydney’s best and fairest dinner on Friday.
