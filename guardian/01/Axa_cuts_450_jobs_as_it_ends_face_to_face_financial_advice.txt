Insurer Axa <https://www.theguardian.com/business/axa> is cutting 450 jobs in 
branches of the Co-operative, Yorkshire and Clydesdale banks under plans to 
cease face-to-face financial advice.

The group blamed the decision on new regulations that banned commission 
payments, forcing customers to pay up front.

Axa has started consulting affected staff, who are based in bank branches 
across the UK but employed by the insurance giant.

Other firms including HSBC have also cut back on financial advice or 
restricted it to wealthy customers.

The chief executive of Axa, Paul Evans, said: "We are very disappointed that 
Axa UK must also now withdraw this service having not found a model which 
balanced the regulatory requirement that the service be profitable in its own 
right, whilst setting advice fees at an affordable level."

The insurer has sold life insurance and savings products through bank branches 
for the past nine years. Customers will now have to rely on call centres.

A government shakeup of the financial advice sector last October banned free 
advice in a bid to stop firms selling unsuitable products.

Instead, financial advisers must clearly explain to the customer up front how 
much advice will cost and agree how the customer will pay for it.

A spokeswoman for Yorkshire and Clydesdale banks said: "This decision does not 
impact on any of the advice our customers have received nor on any policies 
they hold. We will continue to focus our support for Clydesdale and Yorkshire 
bank customers across our core retail and business banking strengths."

A Co-operative spokeswoman said: "The financial planning service has been 
provided by Axa for a number of years and following their decision to withdraw 
from this market we will now be considering alternative options."
