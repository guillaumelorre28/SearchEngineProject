I'm not really sure what to say about this book ... in a bad way.

At first, it was just silly, with one boy called Simon Martin and the other 
Martin Simon. This is what I would call a page-filler, as it had no real point 
and wasn't entertaining or dramatic. The rest is about Simon and his flour 
baby. Class 4c (Simon's class) are the class the teachers don't want.

They can barely read or write, let alone do any work. So for the school 
science fair project, they're given the safe and easy option â€“ a six ounce sack 
of flour that they have to care for like a baby.

I found that through most of the book I had turned about four pages without 
really taking anything in; my mind wandering to more interesting things that 
had happened in the day.

I didn't find any of the characters easy to connect with and I thought the 
book was unique. But not the good sort of unique. It was different, sure, but 
it was weird. I'm not really sure how to put it ...

The book was not gripping and I would give it about a 3 out of 10. The plot 
was uninteresting and at no point did I find myself even slightly interested in 
what was happening.
