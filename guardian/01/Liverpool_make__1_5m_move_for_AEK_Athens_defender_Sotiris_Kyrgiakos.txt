Greece defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos has claimed he is set for a move to 
Liverpool fromAEK Athens <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aekathens> - 
however his club say there is no agreement in place.

Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rafael-benitez> has been in the market 
for a centre-back after Sami Hyypia departed the club in the summer, and that 
search has been intensified following injuries to Martin Skrtel and Daniel 
Agger which mean youngster Daniel Ayala may partner Jamie Carragher for 
tonight's visit of Stoke.

Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> are thought to have 
bid £1.5m for the 30-year-old former Rangers player and Kyrgiakos has confirmed 
that contact has been made.

"I would like to inform the fans of AEK that on Monday night I received an 
offer from Liverpool, an offer which I have accepted," he said on his personal 
website.

"I understand this has come at the worst possible time ahead of the crucial 
games for qualification to the Europa League, but the fact that I will play for 
Liverpool is like a qualification in itself for me. I have taken my final 
decision which was accepted by the president and the coach."

AEK have denied that a deal is in place. "At this moment there is no final 
agreement between AEK and Liverpool FC," a club statement said.
