Kenyan police have arrested a British national and two Somali women in a raid 
on a house in an upmarket area of Nairobi which they suspect was being used as 
a recruitment base for the al-Shabaab militant group.

Detectives surrounded the residence in the north of the city at 10.30am on 
Tuesday and took away the suspects in handcuffs.

Gigiri is the main diplomatic quarter in Nairobi and is home to several 
western embassies and the United Nations headquarters in the capital.

 that police confiscated what they described as “training literature and 
books”, which they said may have been used to aid recruitment efforts.

A security guard said the British national had lived at the compound for three 
years and detectives told reporters that he had travelled toSomalia

Kenyan troops have been fighting an al-Shabaab insurgency in the south of 
Somalia for five years as part of a 22,000-strong African Union force seeking 
to uproot the group from its main strongholds.

Al-Shabaab has fought back by staging several large-scale attacks in Kenya, 
including thesiege

attackers – and a massacre
