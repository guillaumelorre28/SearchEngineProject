Lest you forget my original posting about Rebekah Brooks roller-skating 
through the Sun newsroom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jan/06/imagine-rebekah-brooks-roller-skating-through-the-sun-newsroom>
, the Comic Strip show is being screened tomorrow evening (20 January).

Red Top, with Maxine Peake in the Rebekah role, starts at 10pm on Gold 
<http://gold.uktv.co.uk/tv-guide/>. It is, as I previously wrote, a wonderful 
Fleet Street satire, a fantasy set in the 1970s with flairs, moustaches and 
disco music.

Conceived and written by Peter Richardson - with co-writers Pete Richens and 
Brigit Grant - it tells the story of a young girl from the north of England who 
accidentally becomes chief executive of Rupert Murdochâ€™s UK newspaper outfit.

Watch out for cameo performances from Nigel Planer as Murdoch, Harry Enfield 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/harry-enfield> as Ross Kemp, Stephen 
Mangan as Tony Blair, Russell Tovey as Andy Coulson and Eleanor Matsuura as 
Wendi Deng.


There are also starring roles for Johnny Vegas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/johnny-vegas>, Alexei Sayle, Dominic Tighe 
(as a subservient David Cameron) and John Sessions.
