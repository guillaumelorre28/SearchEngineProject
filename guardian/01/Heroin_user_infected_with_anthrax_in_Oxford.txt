A drug user has been taken to hospital with an anthrax infection after 
injecting a suspected contaminated batch of heroin.

The case in Oxford <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/oxford> follows the deaths 
of two people who injected drugs from an anthrax-infected batch in Blackpool in 
August and September.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said it was the 12th confirmed case in 
Europe since early June 
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/2012PressReleases/121102AnthraxinOxford/>
, after one case in Wales, one in Scotland, four in Germany, two in Denmark and 
one in France. It is unclear whether the cases are linked.

It is suspected that the heroin was contaminated with anthrax spores, which 
can survive in the environment for decades.

This year's cases follow an outbreak in 2009 and 2010, which involved 119 
cases in Scotland, five in England and two in Germany.

The bacterial infection can be treated with antibiotics if caught early.

Dr Eamonn O'Moore, director of the HPA's Thames Valley Health 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/health> Protection Unit, said: "In light 
of this recent case in Oxford, we have advised local drug and alcohol action 
teams to talk to their service users who inject drugs about the risk of anthrax 
infection.

"They should seek medical advice quickly in such circumstances generally but 
particularly now because we have concerns that some batches of heroin in 
circulation in Oxfordshire and the wider Thames valley may be contaminated with 
anthrax."
