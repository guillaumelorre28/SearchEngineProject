I stole this idea from my sister-in-law Nicole – she does a delicious roasted 
kale salad, in which the kale is crispy. I have kept it raw, so the secret is 
to make sure it is finely chopped and really well dressed with the vinaigrette. 
This salad can be a meal in itself, or you can serve with roasted fish or 
chicken. You could also add sweet potato.

(Serves 2)
250g kale 
500g cooked beetroot
1 red onion, sliced thinly
30g brazil nuts
15ml red-wine vinegar
80ml olive oil
1 tsp Dijon mustard
Sea salt and milled pepper

Wash the kale, drain and pat it dry before finely slicing it. Discard any 
large stalks.

Chop the cooked beetroot into bite-size pieces and place in a large bowl with 
the kale.

Add the sliced onion and chopped brazil nuts.

Put the vinegar, oil and mustard into a bowl and combine until emulsified.

Mix the dressing through the kale and beetroot and finish with salt and 
freshly milled black pepper.
