Time magazine called Janis Joplin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/janis-joplin> "probably the most powerful 
singer to emerge from the white rock movement", thanks to her recordings both 
solo and with Big Brother and the Holding Company – and her astounding live 
performances. Her lifestyle, though, overwhelmed her talent – she died of a 
heroin overdose. Like Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and, later, Kurt 
Cobain, she was 27 at the time of her death, which prompted the coinage of the 
term "the 27 club" of dead rock stars.
