The Turnbull government has appointed two royal commissioners to head its 
inquiry into juvenile detention and child protection in theNorthern Territory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory> – Margaret 
White, a former justice of the supreme court of Queensland, and the social 
justice commissioner, Mick Gooda.

The move to recalibrate the inquiry – confirmed by the attorney general, 
George Brandis, on Monday –followed the resignation of Brian Martin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/01/nt-juvenile-detention-brian-martin-stands-down-as-royal-commissioner>
 due to perceptions of conflicts of interest and criticism the royal commission 
had been launched with inadequate consultation with Indigenous people.

After confirming the appointments, Brandis told reporters in Brisbane White 
was extremely well qualified to lead the inquiry and Gooda was an “obvious 
candidate for this role”.

“I’ve spoken to the chief minister of the NT, Adam Giles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adam-giles>, who strongly supports 
the course of action that I have outlined and strongly supports these two 
appointments,” Brandis said.

Martin, who was appointed only four days ago, confirmed his intentions at a 
media conference in Canberra on Monday.

Martin told reporters it had become apparent to him, “rightly or wrongly”, in 
the days following the establishment of the royal commission that he lacked the 
confidence of key sections of the Indigenous community.

“As a consequence, the effectiveness of the commission is likely to be 
compromised from the outset,” Martin said.

“I am not prepared to proceed in the face of that risk. This royal commission 
is far too important to undertake that risk and, in the public interest, 
personal considerations must take second place.”

Brian Ross Martin explains why he is stepping down as Northern Territory royal 
commissioner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/aug/01/brian-ross-martin-steps-down-as-northern-territory-royal-commissioner-video>
The Turnbull government has used the opportunity of Martin’s resignation to 
address the intense criticisms of a lack of consultation withIndigenous 
Australians <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/indigenous-australians> 
and concerns that the inquiry would be best headed by someone from outside the 
Territory – two lines of argument that were threatening to undermine the 
integrity of the process.

Over the weekend, the Labor senator Pat Dodson said co-commissioners must be 
appointed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/31/pat-dodson-calls-for-indigenous-royal-commissioners-as-further-abuse-claims-emerge>
 to the royal commission, which will examine child protection and detention, 
following widespread concern about inadequate community consultation.

The Northern Territory chief minister, Adam Giles, was reported to have put 
out a statement on Monday backing the idea of co-commissioners.

Last week, after the broadcast of the Four Corners report that triggered the 
royal commission, Goodacalled on the federal government 
<https://twitter.com/MickGooda/status/757538814168477697> to intervene and sack 
the NT government.

Asked on Monday whether he still felt that way, Gooda said: “We’ll wait and 
see. I think – I said on the Tuesday, you know, was a day of emotions and 
people had all sorts of emotional responses.

“In the clear light of day I probably wouldn’t think that. But at the moment 
I’ve got a job to do,” he said.

Gooda declined to say whether he thought the inquiry should be extended to 
other states. There have been reports that similar instances to those exposed 
in the Don Dale centre in the territory have occurred in Queensland corrections.

“I haven’t turned my mind to the extension of this royal commission, let alone 
the establishment of others,” the social justice commissioner said.

“I think I need to get my feet under the desk, if you like, and see where we 
end up. But at this point in time I’m satisfied with the terms of reference and 
I do the job that I’m asked to do.”

 White said she hoped the handover of leadership at the inquiry would not 
affect the timetable for the royal commission.

“We do hope we will be able to seamlessly proceed with the timetable that had 
been alluded to at the end of last week so that it’s anticipated that we will 
give a directions hearing on 6 September in Darwin and that we will move to 
hearings in Darwin in October and probably in other places as well,” White said.

Speaking in Darwin on Monday, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, praised Martin 
for being “honourable” and putting the commission first.

“[Brian Martin] hasn’t caused any of the difficulties,” Shorten said. “In 
fact, he has helped restore and indeed give new energy to the royal commission 
by his honourable actions.”

“The same can’t be said for Mr Turnbull or Mr Brandis. They rushed the royal 
commission appointment, they failed to talk to affected groups, especially in 
the NT, and this is what happens when you rush and you bungle, you create 
confusion, you create problems and put people into corners,” he said.

“Today’s announcement could have been avoided if Mr Turnbull had simply 
learned one lesson – consult, cooperate, achieve consensus by listening to 
people.”

Shorten was asked whether Gooda’s comments about sacking the NT government in 
the wake of Four Corners could also be construed as a royal commissioner having 
a predisposition or a conflict.

The Labor leader said Gooda had explained his comments. “There is real anger 
at the Giles government. There is real frustration, there is a real sense of 
hurt and pain and I think that if anyone was to speak to people in the NT, 
there would be quite a lot of Mr Gooda’s sentiment coming from different 
quarters.”

The pressure applied by Labor over the weekend helped trigger the process of 
reconfiguration allowed by Martin’s decision to step aside from the royal 
commission, and Brandis sent a signal on Monday that enough should be enough.

“The royal commission is too important to become a political play thing,” 
Brandis said.

“I welcome the strong bipartisan support for the royal commission which was 
offered to me by the shadow attorney general, Mr [Mark] Dreyfus, when we spoke 
last week,” he said. “I trust that that bipartisan support will continue.”

“The government has acted swiftly and decisively to ensure that the 
resignation of Mr Martin will not delay the work of the royal commission. It is 
now for the commissioners to set about that important work and I thank them for 
their willingness to take on this very significant and challenging task.”

Jackie Huggins, the co-chair of the National Congress of Australia’s First 
Peoples, said she was “delighted” with the new appointments.

“I know these two people personally and I know they will bring to the inquiry 
the experience, rigour, and integrity that is required to do this,” Huggins 
told Guardian Australia.

Huggins praised White’s work in Queensland, and noted Gooda had been working 
in the justice field for decades.

“He has been speaking out strongly about law and justice issues in our country 
so I know that Mick will bring a wealth of information, a wealth of solutions, 
I’m sure, around how we actually get this issue addressed and how we tackle 
this in a way that is meaningful.”

She said Gooda and White were the sort of commissioners who should have been 
appointed at the start and praised the gender and racial equity now on the 
inquiry.

Michael Gunner, the leader of the NT’s Labor party, welcomed the new 
appointments and said the party would cooperate fully with the royal commission.

The Law Council of Australia’s president, Stuart Clark, said the appointments 
were a vital step to ensuring the royal commission could advance its critical 
agenda.

“This royal commission is absolutely vital, because of the need to examine, in 
detail, what appears to be a deep cultural and systemic problem within the NT 
juvenile detention system,” Clark said.

“Mr Gooda and Ms White are extremely well qualified to carry out this 
important inquiry, with the necessary independence from the Northern Territory 
government and confidence of the community.”
