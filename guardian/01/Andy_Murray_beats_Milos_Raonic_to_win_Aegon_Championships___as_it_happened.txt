So Andy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> continues to 
observe the time-honoured traditions of British tennis, flirting with disaster 
and taking the entire nation on an emotional roller-coaster ride of fluctuating 
fortunes and near misses.With the crucial difference, of course, that Murray 
wins. Murray always wins – at Queen’s, at least. The trick now will be to go 
one step further than he managed in Melbourne and Paris. Can he claim a second 
Wimbledon title? If Lendl can help him find an answer to the puzzle that is 
Novak Djokovic, he surely can. As for Milos Raonic, he can take heart from a 
wonderful week’s work that brought him within a whisker of the title and marked 
him out as a clear threat for Wimbledon. Speaking of which, exciting things are 
afoot in that part of the world. Lamp-posts are draped in purple and green 
livery adorned with the words “The Championships”; tennis balls are appearing 
in shop windows; courtesy cars are patrolling the streets of Wimbledon Village. 
Not long now. See you in a week’s time! Thanks for reading and don’t forget to 
check out Kevin Mitchell’s match report below.

And so to the mystery that surrounds any Queen’s final – where on earth does 
the winner find the energy to parade around with that huge trophy?Murray copes 
manfully, needless to say – much to the crowd’s delight – although he has had 
plenty of practice, of course.

“I guessed on a few serves to get one of the breaks back and after that I 
gained confidence,” says Murray. “Coming out here to try to win for the fifth 
time I was really motivated … Obviously, this tournament has loads of history, 
it’s a great event [and] the player field every year is extremely strong.”

Asked how it feels to become the first player to win five titles at Queen’s, 
Murray looks to McEnroe and says:“Any time you can do something just a little 
bit better than him it’s an amazing feeling.” Cue much laughter – was that a 
sly dig? – and then a protestation from Murray that he’s well aware the great 
American’s achievements eclipse his own. Of Lendl, who is nowhere to be seen, 
Murray quips: “It was nice of him to stick around for the trophy presentation.”

Raonic speaks to Sue Barker at courtside. “Congratulations to Andy for winning 
this tournament for the fifth time – although I’m sure it’s not nearly as 
special as your first father’s day, so happy father’s day.” Bless. “Hopefully 
we can have a rematch a couple of Sundays from now” – cue huge cheers. “I’m 
feeling pretty good out here, it’s good progress I’ve made this week … 
hopefully I can continue.”

In comfort break news, Adrian Fowell asks – not without good cause – “Doesn’t 
the tour as a whole use ‘comfort break’?” I believe so, Adrian. But for 
heaven’s sake don’t mention it to Andy Tyacke.

So Andy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> is king of 
Queen’s again, his fifth title eclipsing the likes of Emerson, McEnroe and 
Becker, some of the greatest players ever to wield a racket in anger on an 
English grass court.He has never lost a decider in this tranquil pocket of west 
London; if he could say the same of major finals, he would by now be the proud 
owner of 10 grand slam titles. But let’s not dwell on that, let’s just hail 
another remarkable triumph by a truly remarkable tennis player.

Murray wins at Queen's Club for a record fifth time!

Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 6-3 Raonic* (*denotes server)

He’s only gone and done it! A blistering Murray return off a 119mph serve at 
15-15 creates an excited murmur in the crowd, which evolves into a delirious 
cheer when another cracking backhand draws a volleying error to bring up two 
match points. Raonic hits back with two winning overheads, but the very fact 
that Murray is trying to torment his opponent with topspin lobs at this stage 
tells you all you need to know about his confidence levels right now. Another 
heavy backhand return draws a forehand error from Raonic, and it’s a third 
match point. This time there is no mistake from Murray: a dipping return, a 
netted volley from Raonic, and it’s all over. What a performance!

Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 5-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

Murray’s mistakes are almost more notable than his winners at this point. He 
makes a bad one at 30-0, clumping a simple forehand into the net from all of a 
foot away, but makes amends with an ace and a drop shot so good that Raonic 
doesn’t even twitch. The Canadian will serve to stay in the match.

As the skies darken somewhat, Raonic completes a trouble-free hold with a 
gigantic ace. His body language speaks of renewed positivity as he strides back 
to his chair for the change of ends. Can he wrest the initiative from Murray 
again? We’ll soon find out.

Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 3-2 Raonic* (*denotes server)

As Raonic holds again, McEnroe stands and stares intently at his charge. But 
never mind that, because Andy Tyacke has questions of language on his mind. 
“There’s a slight lull as both players take a comfort break,” he writes. 
“Really?????????? Did they go for a sit in an armchair? Do we really need to 
use these awful US baby-talk euphemisms? I presume you mean a lavatory or, if 
more refeened” – by which I’m guessing he means refined – “a toilet break. The 
Guardian is a British newspaper and should use English as its language of 
communication. I expect you’ll tell us that they had their comfort break in the 
rest room next. Yeugh!” Dear me. Sorry, Andy.

Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 3-1 Raonic (*denotes server)

When the dust settles on this match, there will be questions to be asked about 
why Murray only seems to become fully engaged after dropping a set. It happened 
in the second set against Kyle Edmund, it happened against Marin Cilic 
yesterday, and it’s happened once more against Milos Raonic here. But will 
Murray care? Not if he comes through this match, he won’t. As Raonic fails to 
claw back a swinging serve down the centre of the deuce court at 40-15, that’s 
nine of the last 11 games Murray has won. You almost have to feel sorry for the 
Canadian. Almost.

Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 2-1 Raonic* (*denotes server)

As Lendl looks on impassively, the McEnroe brow is furrowed. Raonic holds 
comfortably enough, a graceful backhand volley clinching the game, but the 
sense of inevitability and ruthlessness that punctuated his service games for 
the first two sets has gone.

He’s simply flying, is Murray, and now it’s Raonic’s turn to look flustered 
and berate himself. An ace from the Scot completes a clinical hold, and Murray 
is absolutely pumped.

Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 1-0 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Murray’s intensity is simply irresistible now. He’s bouncing around, 
retrieving every seemingly lost cause, and getting a much better read on the 
Raonic game. It’s all too much for the Canadian, who throws in a costly 
double-fault at 30-15 after being thwarted at the net a couple of points 
earlier. He then goes wide with a forehand to bring up a break point for 
Murray. The first serve goes awry, Murray gets the second in play with a deep 
backhand return, and a 24-shot rally evolves during which the players trade 
blows toe-to-toe. But it’s Murray who gets the upper hand, pulling Raonic wide 
on the forehand before a winning drop shot seals a brilliant break. Incredible!

There’s a slight lull as both players take a comfort break. We all need a 
breather at this point. That was an incredible comeback from Murray, who looked 
down and out at a set and 3-0 down. What has Raonic got left? Can he put the 
disappointment of suffering two successive breaks behind him? Hold on to your 
hats, because we’re about to find out …

Murray wins the second set 6-4 to level the match!

Second set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4 Raonic (*denotes server)

“Let’s go Andy, let’s go,” comes the cry from the stands as Murray walks out 
to serve for the set. And go he does. A big first serve puts him on the front 
foot before Raonic manages to catch him off balance in his forehand corner. But 
Murray strokes a beautiful backhand winner to bring up 30-15, and follows up 
with a fine service winner. Seconds later, Raonic slices into the alley and 
Murray is punching the air in delight. What a turnaround.

Second set: Murray 6-7, 5-4 Raonic* (*denotes server)

There’s no question the Raonic juggernaut is slowing, but he weathers some 
ferocious Murray returning to secure a vital hold. How he needed that.

Second set: Murray* 6-7, 5-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

Would you credit it? Fifty-odd games without dropping serve, and then Raonic 
goes and gets broken twice in succession. If only there were a handy simile 
involving London buses to describe that scenario. Oh well, we’ll just have to 
soldier on without. Speaking of soldiers, Murray is really rolling out the 
heavy ordnance now. A flashing backhand winner, another big forehand and he’s 
not only home and dry on serve, but also one game from the set. Murray is 
playing his best tennis of the week right here.

Second set: Murray 6-7, 4-3 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Another break and Murray is motoring. He takes the first point against serve 
and, after some incredible retrieving, sets himself up for a forehand pass that 
would put him firmly in the frame for another break. He misses, but is Raonic 
unnerved by his opponent’s tenacity? He certainly seems to be, because a 
double-fault and a netted backhand drop volley follow. Suddenly, the man with 
the seemingly impregnable serve is staring down the barrel again at 15-40. 
Raonic saves the first break point with a thunderous delivery down the centre, 
but at 30-40 Murray pulls him out of position on the forehand and the Canadian 
nets. Extraordinary stuff.

Second set: Murray* 6-7, 3-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

The crowd are up for this now and so is Murray, make no mistake. The Scot was 
in full battle mode after that last game and, although he briefly threatens to 
falter here, a booming forehand winner from Raonic carrying the Canadian to 
30-30, Murray sees out the game with a couple of excellent serves. The momentum 
is all with the defending champion.

Second set: Murray 6-7, 2-3 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Murray is back in the hunt! Some belligerent play carries the Scot to 30-30, 
but a 121mph SECOND serve sets up an easy forehand winner. Then, though, the 
gods smile on Murray, who successfully challenges what appeared to be a clean 
winner from Raonic. The decision goes his way, and it’s deuce on the Raonic 
serve for the first time. Murray makes the return, Raonic nets a forehand, and 
suddenly – from nowhere – the Canadian is facing a break point. The first 
serve, predictably, comes down at searing pace, but Murray lunges to his left 
and steers a superb backhand pass beyond the incoming server. What a fighter he 
is. Fantastic stuff.

Second set: Murray* 6-7, 1-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

You don’t win four titles on this court for nothing, and Murray opens his 
second-set account in impressive style with a love game. More importantly, 
perhaps, he seems to have recovered his mental equilibrium. He’ll need to stay 
calm, too, because if he doesn’t conjure a break soon, his challenge will be 
done and dusted.

Second set: Murray 6-7, 0-3 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Awesome stuff from Raonic, who shows no sign of faltering as he seals another 
love hold. McEnroe was up out of his seat and bowing before his charge after 
that last game, but really that scenario should be reversed. The American’s 
tactical influence has clearly given Raonic fresh impetus: he’s playing with 
greater variety, timing his runs into the net well, and varying the pattern of 
his serving brilliantly. Murray has a mountain to climb now.

Second set: Murray 6-7, 0-2 Raonic* (*denotes server)

The alarm bells are screaming now as Murray drops serve for the first time. He 
concedes the opening point with another mistake before some aggressive play 
takes him back to 15-15. A lengthy rally ensues, Raonic pulling his opponent 
hither and thither before moving forward to put away a volley. Another long 
rally is summarily concluded by the Canadian when he rolls a short forehand for 
a winner. 15-40. And then – horror of horrors – Murray receives a time 
violation as he is about to serve. If he went over the allotted period, it must 
have been by seconds. He keeps his cool but loses the game as Raonic finds 
another deep return. Dear me.

Raonic really means business here. With Murray still seething, the Canadian 
wraps up the opening game of the set to love. The Scot needs to steady himself 
sharpish, or this could quickly get away from him.

Raonic wins the first set 7-6 (7-5)!

Murray pounds his racket into his bag repeatedly after Raonic winds up a big 
forehand pass to blast the ball beyond the Scot and claim the first set. He’s 
furious, is Murray. Not sure why, though, because that was a brilliant tiebreak 
by Raonic, who set the tone with some great play at the net on the opening 
point and never looked back.

So Andy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> continues to 
observe the time-honoured traditions of British tennis, flirting with disaster 
and taking the entire nation on an emotional roller-coaster ride of fluctuating 
fortunes and near misses.With the crucial difference, of course, that Murray 
wins. Murray always wins – at Queen’s, at least. The trick now will be to go 
one step further than he managed in Melbourne and Paris. Can he claim a second 
Wimbledon title? If Lendl can help him find an answer to the puzzle that is 
Novak Djokovic, he surely can. As for Milos Raonic, he can take heart from a 
wonderful week’s work that brought him within a whisker of the title and marked 
him out as a clear threat for Wimbledon. Speaking of which, exciting things are 
afoot in that part of the world. Lamp-posts are draped in purple and green 
livery adorned with the words “The Championships”; tennis balls are appearing 
in shop windows; courtesy cars are patrolling the streets of Wimbledon Village. 
Not long now. See you in a week’s time! Thanks for reading and don’t forget to 
check out Kevin Mitchell’s match report below.

Andy Murray beats Milos Raonic to claim record fifth Queen’s crown

And so to the mystery that surrounds any Queen’s final – where on earth does 
the winner find the energy to parade around with that huge trophy?Murray copes 
manfully, needless to say – much to the crowd’s delight – although he has had 
plenty of practice, of course.
 
“I guessed on a few serves to get one of the breaks back and after that I 
gained confidence,” says Murray. “Coming out here to try to win for the fifth 
time I was really motivated … Obviously, this tournament has loads of history, 
it’s a great event [and] the player field every year is extremely strong.”

Asked how it feels to become the first player to win five titles at Queen’s, 
Murray looks to McEnroe and says:“Any time you can do something just a little 
bit better than him it’s an amazing feeling.” Cue much laughter – was that a 
sly dig? – and then a protestation from Murray that he’s well aware the great 
American’s achievements eclipse his own. Of Lendl, who is nowhere to be seen, 
Murray quips: “It was nice of him to stick around for the trophy presentation.”
 
Raonic speaks to Sue Barker at courtside. “Congratulations to Andy for winning 
this tournament for the fifth time – although I’m sure it’s not nearly as 
special as your first father’s day, so happy father’s day.” Bless. “Hopefully 
we can have a rematch a couple of Sundays from now” – cue huge cheers. “I’m 
feeling pretty good out here, it’s good progress I’ve made this week … 
hopefully I can continue.”
 
In comfort break news, Adrian Fowell asks – not without good cause – “Doesn’t 
the tour as a whole use ‘comfort break’?” I believe so, Adrian. But for 
heaven’s sake don’t mention it to Andy Tyacke.
 
So Andy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> is king of 
Queen’s again, his fifth title eclipsing the likes of Emerson, McEnroe and 
Becker, some of the greatest players ever to wield a racket in anger on an 
English grass court.He has never lost a decider in this tranquil pocket of west 
London; if he could say the same of major finals, he would by now be the proud 
owner of 10 grand slam titles. But let’s not dwell on that, let’s just hail 
another remarkable triumph by a truly remarkable tennis player.
 
Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 6-3 Raonic* (*denotes server)

He’s only gone and done it! A blistering Murray return off a 119mph serve at 
15-15 creates an excited murmur in the crowd, which evolves into a delirious 
cheer when another cracking backhand draws a volleying error to bring up two 
match points. Raonic hits back with two winning overheads, but the very fact 
that Murray is trying to torment his opponent with topspin lobs at this stage 
tells you all you need to know about his confidence levels right now. Another 
heavy backhand return draws a forehand error from Raonic, and it’s a third 
match point. This time there is no mistake from Murray: a dipping return, a 
netted volley from Raonic, and it’s all over. What a performance!

Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 5-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

Murray’s mistakes are almost more notable than his winners at this point. He 
makes a bad one at 30-0, clumping a simple forehand into the net from all of a 
foot away, but makes amends with an ace and a drop shot so good that Raonic 
doesn’t even twitch. The Canadian will serve to stay in the match.

As the skies darken somewhat, Raonic completes a trouble-free hold with a 
gigantic ace. His body language speaks of renewed positivity as he strides back 
to his chair for the change of ends. Can he wrest the initiative from Murray 
again? We’ll soon find out.

Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 4-2 Raonic (*denotes server)

Murray races through his service game to move within two games of the match. 
His level in this set, in every department, has been simply exceptional.
 
Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 3-2 Raonic* (*denotes server)

As Raonic holds again, McEnroe stands and stares intently at his charge. But 
never mind that, because Andy Tyacke has questions of language on his mind. 
“There’s a slight lull as both players take a comfort break,” he writes. 
“Really?????????? Did they go for a sit in an armchair? Do we really need to 
use these awful US baby-talk euphemisms? I presume you mean a lavatory or, if 
more refeened” – by which I’m guessing he means refined – “a toilet break. The 
Guardian is a British newspaper and should use English as its language of 
communication. I expect you’ll tell us that they had their comfort break in the 
rest room next. Yeugh!” Dear me. Sorry, Andy.
 
Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 3-1 Raonic (*denotes server)

When the dust settles on this match, there will be questions to be asked about 
why Murray only seems to become fully engaged after dropping a set. It happened 
in the second set against Kyle Edmund, it happened against Marin Cilic 
yesterday, and it’s happened once more against Milos Raonic here. But will 
Murray care? Not if he comes through this match, he won’t. As Raonic fails to 
claw back a swinging serve down the centre of the deuce court at 40-15, that’s 
nine of the last 11 games Murray has won. You almost have to feel sorry for the 
Canadian. Almost.

Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 2-1 Raonic* (*denotes server)

As Lendl looks on impassively, the McEnroe brow is furrowed. Raonic holds 
comfortably enough, a graceful backhand volley clinching the game, but the 
sense of inevitability and ruthlessness that punctuated his service games for 
the first two sets has gone.
 
Third set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4, 2-0 Raonic (*denotes server)

He’s simply flying, is Murray, and now it’s Raonic’s turn to look flustered 
and berate himself. An ace from the Scot completes a clinical hold, and Murray 
is absolutely pumped.



 
Third set: Murray 6-7, 6-4, 1-0 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Murray’s intensity is simply irresistible now. He’s bouncing around, 
retrieving every seemingly lost cause, and getting a much better read on the 
Raonic game. It’s all too much for the Canadian, who throws in a costly 
double-fault at 30-15 after being thwarted at the net a couple of points 
earlier. He then goes wide with a forehand to bring up a break point for 
Murray. The first serve goes awry, Murray gets the second in play with a deep 
backhand return, and a 24-shot rally evolves during which the players trade 
blows toe-to-toe. But it’s Murray who gets the upper hand, pulling Raonic wide 
on the forehand before a winning drop shot seals a brilliant break. Incredible!

There’s a slight lull as both players take a comfort break. We all need a 
breather at this point. That was an incredible comeback from Murray, who looked 
down and out at a set and 3-0 down. What has Raonic got left? Can he put the 
disappointment of suffering two successive breaks behind him? Hold on to your 
hats, because we’re about to find out …
 
Second set: Murray* 6-7, 6-4 Raonic (*denotes server)

“Let’s go Andy, let’s go,” comes the cry from the stands as Murray walks out 
to serve for the set. And go he does. A big first serve puts him on the front 
foot before Raonic manages to catch him off balance in his forehand corner. But 
Murray strokes a beautiful backhand winner to bring up 30-15, and follows up 
with a fine service winner. Seconds later, Raonic slices into the alley and 
Murray is punching the air in delight. What a turnaround.

There’s no question the Raonic juggernaut is slowing, but he weathers some 
ferocious Murray returning to secure a vital hold. How he needed that.
 
Second set: Murray* 6-7, 5-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

Would you credit it? Fifty-odd games without dropping serve, and then Raonic 
goes and gets broken twice in succession. If only there were a handy simile 
involving London buses to describe that scenario. Oh well, we’ll just have to 
soldier on without. Speaking of soldiers, Murray is really rolling out the 
heavy ordnance now. A flashing backhand winner, another big forehand and he’s 
not only home and dry on serve, but also one game from the set. Murray is 
playing his best tennis of the week right here.
 
Second set: Murray 6-7, 4-3 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Another break and Murray is motoring. He takes the first point against serve 
and, after some incredible retrieving, sets himself up for a forehand pass that 
would put him firmly in the frame for another break. He misses, but is Raonic 
unnerved by his opponent’s tenacity? He certainly seems to be, because a 
double-fault and a netted backhand drop volley follow. Suddenly, the man with 
the seemingly impregnable serve is staring down the barrel again at 15-40. 
Raonic saves the first break point with a thunderous delivery down the centre, 
but at 30-40 Murray pulls him out of position on the forehand and the Canadian 
nets. Extraordinary stuff.

Second set: Murray* 6-7, 3-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

The crowd are up for this now and so is Murray, make no mistake. The Scot was 
in full battle mode after that last game and, although he briefly threatens to 
falter here, a booming forehand winner from Raonic carrying the Canadian to 
30-30, Murray sees out the game with a couple of excellent serves. The momentum 
is all with the defending champion.
 
Second set: Murray 6-7, 2-3 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Murray is back in the hunt! Some belligerent play carries the Scot to 30-30, 
but a 121mph SECOND serve sets up an easy forehand winner. Then, though, the 
gods smile on Murray, who successfully challenges what appeared to be a clean 
winner from Raonic. The decision goes his way, and it’s deuce on the Raonic 
serve for the first time. Murray makes the return, Raonic nets a forehand, and 
suddenly – from nowhere – the Canadian is facing a break point. The first 
serve, predictably, comes down at searing pace, but Murray lunges to his left 
and steers a superb backhand pass beyond the incoming server. What a fighter he 
is. Fantastic stuff.
 
Second set: Murray* 6-7, 1-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

You don’t win four titles on this court for nothing, and Murray opens his 
second-set account in impressive style with a love game. More importantly, 
perhaps, he seems to have recovered his mental equilibrium. He’ll need to stay 
calm, too, because if he doesn’t conjure a break soon, his challenge will be 
done and dusted.



 
Second set: Murray 6-7, 0-3 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Awesome stuff from Raonic, who shows no sign of faltering as he seals another 
love hold. McEnroe was up out of his seat and bowing before his charge after 
that last game, but really that scenario should be reversed. The American’s 
tactical influence has clearly given Raonic fresh impetus: he’s playing with 
greater variety, timing his runs into the net well, and varying the pattern of 
his serving brilliantly. Murray has a mountain to climb now.
 
Second set: Murray 6-7, 0-2 Raonic* (*denotes server)

The alarm bells are screaming now as Murray drops serve for the first time. He 
concedes the opening point with another mistake before some aggressive play 
takes him back to 15-15. A lengthy rally ensues, Raonic pulling his opponent 
hither and thither before moving forward to put away a volley. Another long 
rally is summarily concluded by the Canadian when he rolls a short forehand for 
a winner. 15-40. And then – horror of horrors – Murray receives a time 
violation as he is about to serve. If he went over the allotted period, it must 
have been by seconds. He keeps his cool but loses the game as Raonic finds 
another deep return. Dear me.

Second set: Murray 6-7, 0-1 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Raonic really means business here. With Murray still seething, the Canadian 
wraps up the opening game of the set to love. The Scot needs to steady himself 
sharpish, or this could quickly get away from him.

 
Murray pounds his racket into his bag repeatedly after Raonic winds up a big 
forehand pass to blast the ball beyond the Scot and claim the first set. He’s 
furious, is Murray. Not sure why, though, because that was a brilliant tiebreak 
by Raonic, who set the tone with some great play at the net on the opening 
point and never looked back.
