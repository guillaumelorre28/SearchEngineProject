 The Hacker Ethic
 Pekka Himanen
 (Vintage, £7.99)


 That's hacker as enthusiasist, not as computer criminal. This book comes from 
before the dot.com bubble-pop, and before the info-tech faultlines lately gaped 
open, so we are not yet sure how true might be its premises and propositions. 
But they do delight: for by this definition the hacker spirit passionately 
pursues craft and creativity beyond the screen, industrious but undutiful - a J 
S Bach interpretation of the well-tempered life. It's a baroque concept: 
fun-filled but not florid, catholic rather than protestant, and structured 
through communication and harmony. Himanen and contributors are playfully 
learned, and, never incomprehensible. Wow.

 Romanticism and Its Discontents
 Anita Brookner
 (Penguin, £10.99)


 This is about the ethic and practice of Romanticism by French 19th-century 
artists and writers (desolate Delacroix, zealous Zola etc ); but it also 
encapsulates, in its concise opening, the spirit of Romanticism that still 
motivates so many of us: "infinite longing... it is in essence a longing for 
what is missing and an attempt to supply it" - always foredoomed, of course, 
that divine ache. Brookner is an Enlightenment writer, calm and lucid despite 
the turbulence of her subject; we feel she's a natural Mozart woman herself, 
but with a grand sympathy for heroes whose mental music was Beethoven or even 
Wagner.
