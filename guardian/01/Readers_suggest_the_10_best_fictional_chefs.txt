’s blood run cold from across the Atlantic. Deriving a personal satisfaction, 
as opposed to a financial one, from his cannibalistic culinary activities, 
Hannibal is a slick foodie who revels in the taste of human flesh. As 
PhelimONeill writes of his dinners in therecent TV adaptation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jul/15/unpleasant-pretentious-fun-have-you-been-watching-hannibal>

knew the ingredients were fresh”.

Ned (Lee Pace), protagonist of the ABC series Pushing Daisies, works as a 
pie-maker in his restaurant the Pie Hole and also possesses the mysterious 
ability to bring corpses back to life; a special talent which he uses to solve 
cases by interrogating victims temporarily brought back to life as part of a 
financial deal with the private investigator Emerson Cod. Ned shares with Mrs 
Lovett his passion for gastronomy, but not, as one of our readers remarks, her 
dodgy recipes. “Mrs Lovett put unspeakable things in her baking,” writes 
ccmac10, ‘So for pie-makers I much prefer Ned the Piemaker from Pushing 
Daisies.”

Aubrey is a chef and restaurant owner in Mike Leigh’s film Life Is Sweet. 
Aubrey’s French restaurant The Regret Rien, named after Edith Piaf – who, like 
him,probably did have a great deal to regret 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/08/edith-piaf-letters-dimitris-horn>
 – suffers a disastrous opening night. Timothy Spall, a veteran of Leigh’s 
cinema, conveys Aubrey’s sheer entrepreneurial spirit with gusto. And as our 
aptly named reader wjelly remarks, Aubrey has what a great chef can’t do 
without: “a great menu, eg black pudding and camembert soup, boiled bacon 
comsommé, saveloy on a bed of lychees, liver in lager, pork cyst...”.

The clue’s in the name: stevenjameshyde suggests Chef from South Park. The 
cafeteria worker supplies the boys with their lunch staples – usually pizza, 
burgers and milk – and is also something of a ladies’ man, seducing a string of 
female characters. Chef was voiced by soul singer Isaac Hayes until hequit the 
show in 2006 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/15/broadcasting.religion>, after 
taking offence at the programme’s treatment of his religion, Scientology. The 
character was killed off in the episodeThe Return of Chef, using voice clips 
from previous episodes, after suggesting Chef had been brainwashed.
