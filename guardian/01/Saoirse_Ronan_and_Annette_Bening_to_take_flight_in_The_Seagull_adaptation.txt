.

Theatre and film director Michael Mayer, best known for his Tony-winning work 
on the rock musical Spring Awakening, is to take charge of the cameras. The new 
take is based on a script byStephen Karam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/stephen-karam>, a Pulitzer prize finalist 
for his play Sons of the Prophet. Co-starring House of Cards’ Corey Stoll and 
newcomer Billy Howle, it is being touted to potential backers at this week’s 
Cannes film festival, and Mayer hopes to shoot it in upstate New York this 
summer.

Chekhov’s first major play, The Seagull centres on the fading actress Irina 
Nikolayevna Arkadina’s relationship with her son Konstantin, a failing 
playwright in love with a bright, young actress, Nina Mikhailovna Zarechnaya. 
Bening would best fit the part of Irina, with Ronan as Nina, Stoll as famous 
writer Boris Trigorin and Howle as Konstantin.

The Seagull was previously adapted for a poorly-received 1968 film titled The 
Sea Gull, which was directed by Sidney Lumet. Aseparate new adaptation

, titled Relative Insanity and starring David Duchovny and Helen Hunt in the 
leads, was due to relocate Chekhov’s brooding bourgeoisie from a Russian 
country estate to present-day New York City and The Hamptons. The film was due 
to go into production in 2012 but has not yet hit cinemas.
