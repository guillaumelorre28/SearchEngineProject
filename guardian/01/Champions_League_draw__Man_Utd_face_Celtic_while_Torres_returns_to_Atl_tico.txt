For the second time in three seasons, defending champions Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> will face Celtic in 
the group stages of the Champions League. United, who in 2006 beat Celtic 3-2 
at Old Trafford before losing the return 1-0, will also play Villarreal from 
Spain and Aalborg of Denmark in Group E.

Meanwhile Liverpool's reward for scraping through against Standard Li√®ge in 
extra time was the toughest group of all the English sides, withPSV Eindhoven 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/psveindhoven>, Marseille and Fernando 
Torres' former club Atletico Madrid joining them in Group D.

Last season's beaten finalists Chelsea won't be too disappointed with their 
draw. They face Roma, Bordeaux andChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> debutants CFR Cluj of 
Romania in Group A. Arsenal also look like having a straightforward route to 
the knockout stages: they play FC Porto, Fenerbahce and Dynamo Kiev in Group G.

The British teams will be relieved to have avoided Group F - where Olympique 
Lyonnais, Bayern Munich, Steaua Bucharest and Fiorentina face each other - 
while Group H, with contains Real Madrid, Juventus, last season's Uefa Cup 
winnersZenit St Petersburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/zenitstpetersburg> and Bate Borisov, also 
looks to be a tough group.

with beaten finalistsChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>
