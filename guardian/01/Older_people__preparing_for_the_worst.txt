"It would definitely help if the elderly knew more about what to do in 
disasters, as often they do not want to leave their house and their 
belongings," says Sara de Lara, 55. She and her husband, José Rubén, 79, recall 
the night the 2009 flood destroyed their home in Melara. "My husband didn't 
want to leave the house and get out of bed when it happened," she says. "He 
actually pulled the covers over his head!"

According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, older people can be 
particularly vulnerable after natural disasters. Lack of mobility, weakened 
vision and chronic illnesses such as arthritis can make access to support 
difficult. They are sometimes reluctant to leave their homes and so are often 
the last to flee.

Yet, despite only making up 5% of the estimated 6.5m population of El 
Salvador, a surprising number of people over the age of 65 are getting involved 
in disaster management efforts and contributing to the protection of themselves 
and their community.

Miguel Alfaro, 67, is a member of the CPC in San Antonio. He was involved in 
the successful evacuation of the entire community when a sinkhole – a massive 
shift in the soil that led to a mudslide, creating crevices 15 feet deep – 
occurred during a storm in 2011.

"We immediately started going round telling people to evacuate" he says. 
"People already knew us from the Civilian Protection Commission; so when we 
tell them to evacuate they don't hesitate, they just evacuate."
