someone whose life is in limbo. The good that exists in our world and the power 
of the people in it can and does achieve miracles.” I have set up a petition 
calling on the Ministry of Justice to overturn Lauri Love’s extradition order. 
We can at least make our views known about this cruel decision – and try to 
achieve a miracle – rather than just thinking it’s somebody else’s problem. The 
petition is at:

• It is so disappointing that after Saturday’s marvellous Refugees 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees> Welcome march, there has been 
almost no publicity from the BBC or the press – not even from the Guardian. 
Thousands of mainly young people, with colourful banners and placards, 
enthusiastically chanted “Refugees are welcome here”.  Politicians and actors 
added their voices in Parliament Square. These young people are our future, yet 
their voices clearly haven’t reached Theresa May, who is even now preparing to 
speak discouragingly at the UN summit on refugees in New York.

• I too am a lover of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (Reports of my death 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/17/clive-james-mickey-rooney-puck-midsummer-nights-dream-acting>
, Weekend, 17 September). When I am sad I play the DVD. Two weeks ago I went to 
my granddaughter’s wedding in a forest outside Paris, beside the river. The 
weather was very hot and it was magical. It reminded me of that beautiful play. 
I danced even though I’m 86 years old.

• Perhaps some old folk remedies will re-emerge now that the NHS no longer 
offers treatment for a variety of “minor ailments” (G2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/19/varicose-veins-skin-complaints-minor-ailments-nhs-wont-treat-self-help>
, 19 September). I’ve been told that the best cure for a ganglia, for example, 
is to hit it hard with a Bible.

• Please do not interfere with Rufus (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/15/dont-know-anything-become-a-journalist>
, 16 September) It is the only crossword I have any hope of finishing. I can’t 
even get started in all the others.
