It had to happen, I‚Äôm just surprised it took this long. 

The Daily Telegraph has declared open season on asylum seekers 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/federal-election/legacy-asylum-seekers-labor-will-invite-thousands-of-illegals-to-stay/news-story/e4c35e12df52f5e34416d727ae8bdcaa>
.

Or rather, it has declared that Bill Shorten has declared open season for 
people smugglers by apparently laying out the welcome mat, a visual gag 
deployed to great effect on the Tele‚Äôs front page, to asylum seekers.

According to the Tele, Labor will give permanent residency to all 30,000 
people now languishing on temporary protection visas, which the immigration 
minister,Peter Dutton, warned will cause chaos.

Border protection has not really been the vote winner this election that it 
was in 2013. Indeed, the only parties really gaining traction on it are the 
Greens, who oppose Australia‚Äôs offshore detention system as inhumane, and
Pauline Hanson, who wants to ban all Muslims.

So the Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> could 
probably use a little chaos.

As Game of Thrones watchers know: Chaos isn‚Äôt a pit. Chaos is a ladder.

The big picture

First let‚Äôs unpack that story in the Daily Telegraph article, which says Labor 
would give its legacy caseload of 30,000 asylum seekers permanent residency and 
‚Äúfull work rights‚Äù.

Labor‚Äôs policy statement on asylum seekers 
<http://www.alp.org.au/asylumseekers> says it would abolish temporary 
protection visas and ‚Äúcommit to processing people as quickly as possible and 
placing those found to be genuine refugees on permanent protection visas‚Äù, 
which is not quite the same. Moving on.

Reporters Daniel Meers and Simon Benson write:

Immigration minister Peter Dutton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/peter-dutton> last night told the 
Daily Telegraph Labor‚Äôs border security policy was now ‚Äúweak, equivocal and 
constantly changing‚Äù.

The potential for post-election rebellion appears to be far more widespread 
than was ¬≠revealed at the beginning of the campaign, with public records 
confirming a total of 50 candidates or MPs opposing strong border protection.

Border protection was a stronghold of the Abbott government that has been 
adopted wholeheartedly by the Turnbull government, so watch this space today.

Meanwhile, both leaders are out talking about the economy, with the jobless 
figures for May released today.

Labor has announced details of a $68.6m policy to deliver ‚Äúlocal jobs for 
local people‚Äù in 20 ‚Äúcommunities of opportunity‚Äù, which are as yet unnamed 
communities with high rates of disadvantage and unemployment and low levels of 
education.

The program will apparently involve coordinators running jobs expos and 
workplace mentoring to connect unemployed people with training and employment 
in areas of skills shortage. It will also provide a ‚Äúworking communities fund‚Äù 
to address problems preventing employment in that area, such as a lack of 
affordable childcare, poor literacy skills or poor English language skills.

Sticking on jobs, Labor has pledged $100m toward Arrium steelworks in Whyalla, 
South Australia, doubling the SA government‚Äôs commitment of $50m.

And finally, the rise of the Nick Xenophon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/nick-xenophon> Team has caused 
continued rumblings from the major parties.

The latest salvo comes from the ALP national secretary and campaign director, 
George Wright, who wrote a letter to the Australian Election Commission asking 
it to investigate an alleged breach of financial disclosure laws by Xenophon‚Äôs 
now defunct fundraising arm, Support Nick Xenophon.

It apparently sold Xenophon merch online, including stress balls saying ‚ÄúGive 
Nick the Squeeze‚Äù and bags that say ‚ÄúNick is Fully Sick‚Äù.Full details at the

On the campaign trail

Team Turnbull arrived in Sydney yesterday evening, after two days in Perth, and
Malcolm Turnbull joined his wife, Lucy, and the New South Wales premier, Mike 
Baird, at a service at St Andrew‚Äôs Cathedral for the victims of the Orlando 
massacre. He‚Äôll remain in Sydney today to talk about the economy, with a 
suspected guest appearance byScott Morrison.

Bill Shorten, meanwhile, is returning to Adelaide after his latest visit was 
cut short by a need to tour areas of flood damage. This will be his third visit 
to SA of the campaign; his first, you‚Äôll recall, was marked bythat rather 
alarming snog ambush 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/come-on-a-proper-kiss-when-bill-met-margo-20160517-goxba1.html>

The campaign you should be watching

The former independent Lyne MP Rob Oakeshott announced on Friday that he would 
run as an independent for the neighbouring seat of Cowper, and, according to a 
poll commissioned by GetUp!, he‚Äôs in with a shot.

The poll showed Oakeshot‚Äôs primary vote was 28.4% compared with the sitting 
National MPLuke Hartsuyker‚Äôs 39.4%.

My colleague Paul Karp writes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/15/rob-oakeshott-uplifted-after-poll-shows-large-swing-against-nationals>
:

Oakeshott told Guardian Australia his primary vote of 25% in the poll 
suggested the result was ‚Äúabout 50/50 two-candidate preferred‚Äù.

‚ÄúAfter five days of campaigning I‚Äôm really uplifted by that result, it shows a 
13% swing against the Nationals already,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd it also shows a level 
of frustration within the community about local and national politics that is 
going to be expressed at the ballot box.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre wondering why Cowper: Oakeshottt said that while he hadn‚Äôt moved 
since resigning from parliament in 2013, the electorate boundaries had, and he 
no longer lives in Lyne.

And another thing(s)

The Queensland MP Bob Katter has made a campaign ad that even the Liberal 
National party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party> 
senatorIan Macdonald thinks is offensive.

The add in question shows two men, marked as ALP and LNP respectively, putting 
up a ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù sign for Australia. Cut to Katter, who writes a decisive ‚ÄúNOT‚Äù 
on the sign and then blows on a smoking gun. The camera pans up and we see two 
bodies lying some distance away.

Very bold of Bob Katter <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bob-katter>
 to take a pro-murder stance to an election

<https://twitter.com/Rob_Stott/status/742908738902708224> 
Katter released the ad on his official Twitter feed yesterday, three days 
after the Orlando shooting. He told the ABC he thought it was funny and anyway, 
he‚Äôd approved it weeks ago.

Said Macca:

Mr Katter‚Äôs video advertisement seems to encourage murder and gun violence to 
promote his strange views on a serious policy issue.

In other campaign add news, Scott Morrison has released a bizarre shouty music 
mashup attack add alleging the Greens have ‚Äúinfiltrated‚Äù theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party>.

Morrison said it was not an attack campaign but a ‚Äúscare campaign.‚Äù Political 
editorLenore Taylor delicately tore its central premise to shreds here, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/15/election-2016-scott-morrison-coalition-greens-scare-campaign-parody>
 so I‚Äôll leave you with this burn fromBill Shorten:
