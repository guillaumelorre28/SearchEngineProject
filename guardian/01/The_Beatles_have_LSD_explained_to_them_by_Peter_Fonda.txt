There were psychedelic records before the Beatles made Revolver, but it took 
the Beatles to make psychedelia part of the mainstream. John Lennon's curiosity 
about LSD was piqued by a party at the Playboy Mansion when actor Peter Fonda 
tried to describe the drug's effects. "I know what it's like to be dead," he 
said to George Harrison. "You're making me feel like I've never been born," 
interjected Lennon. The encounter formed the basis of She Said, She Said, one 
of the band's first experiments with the new form.
