The winter school holidays are fast approaching, but it’s still not too late 
to book in a last-minute break. There are many places to escape the cold 
weather in the north, or to fully embrace it up in the mountains or the 
countryside. The cooler weather offers a chance to discover some hidden 
treasures across the country and our close neighbours, cheaply and without the 
big crowds.

Here’s our pick of the best, leaving from destinations around Australia. 


Cape Tribulation

Two and half hours from Cairns, Cape Tribulation sees two heritage sites meet: 
the Daintree Rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef. You’ll avoid any family 
fights with the reef and rainforest both in close proximity. You can be 
snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef one day and exploring the forests the 
next. It’s a bit more rugged than the usual beach destinations, but it’s good 
for those that don’t really want a touristy holiday. Isolated accommodation 
among the rainforest will also make it feel like a private getaway.

Return flights from Brisbane to Cairns for two adults, two children from $872 
withTigerAir. <http://www.tigerair.com/au/en/>

Accommodation at Daintree Crocodylus 
<http://www.daintreecrocodylus.com.au/crocodylusvillage/Accom.html)> from $85 
per night for a family room.

Brisbane departure for a Great Barrier Reef Cruise

Setting sail from Brisbane, this cruise ships travels as far north as Port 
Douglas across seven nights, with visits to Airlie Beach, Yorkeys Knob, and 
Willis Island along the way.


There are supervised entertainment programs for the kids while the adults can 
enjoy a range of restaurants and bars, as well as stage shows and roaming 
entertainers. All the meals at the silver-service restaurants are included in 
the ticket.

Daylesford

Originally a gold rush hotspot, Daylesford is now one of Australia’s only spa 
towns. This is for a family that wants a completely relaxing holiday in a quiet 
countryside town. The whole family can indulge in the hot springs, gardens, and 
walks through the forests, and there’s also a chocolate factory for the kids.

 Daylesford is only an hour and a half from Melbourne, and you can stay in 
your own private cottage.

 Lake Daylesford: the perfect place for a winter break. 
Hobart

Don’t let the icy cool weather deter you, Tasmania transforms into a winter 
wonderland during this time of year and there are plenty of indoor activities 
to keep you occupied. Lose yourself in the giant and world-renowned Museum of 
Old and New Art (Mona) – but a word of warning, not all the works are suitable 
viewing for young children – or explore the port town’s historic buildings.


Soaring above the city, Mount Wellington offers a chance to show your children 
some snow, as well as incredible views (on a clear day). If the cold gets to be 
a bit much, venture 45 minutes out of town to the Hastings Cave State Reserve, 
and sit back and relax in thermal streams, which normally sit at 28C. This is 
for a family that wants to fully embrace a real winter holiday and the cold 
weather.

Blue Mountains

The Blue Mountains are a refuge from urban sprawl of Sydney, only an hour 
away. There are a range of hikes leading to towering lookouts, or for a more 
relaxing trip, there’s the world’s steepest railway that takes you down into 
the rainforest of the valley floor. You can also adventure inside the mountains 
in the Jenolan Caves further west. A trip to the Blue Mountains caters for both 
the adventurous family that want to get in touch with nature, and also those 
who want to relax in front of a open fire.

There’s still time to fit in a quick visit to one of our closest and most 
culturally vibrant neighbours during the winter break. It won’t even feel like 
winter over there, with temperatures still regularly climbing above 30C.


There are lots of museums, historical sites and other landmarks for the 
parents to enjoy, and a range of huge aquariums, playgrounds and wildlife to 
keep the kids entertained.


It’s at the pricier end of the spectrum, costing from $4,051 for return 
flights and four nights accommodation at the Grand Pinnacle, package fromWebjet.
