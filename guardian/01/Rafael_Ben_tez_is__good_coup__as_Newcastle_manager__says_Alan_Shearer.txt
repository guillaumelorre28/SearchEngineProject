Newcastle, who sacked Steve McClaren

 just a few hours before appointing the Spaniard as his successor, are one 
point adrift of safety as the season enters its closing stages.

Yet while Shearer accepts that Benítez faces the toughest task of his 
managerial career, he believesthe former Real Madrid manager

 has what it takes to succeed.

Shearer told BBC Sport: “I think it’s a good coup for Newcastle. I’m 
surprised, when you consider how much success he’s had and the clubs he’s been 
at.

“What’s different about this appointment is that all the other managers that 
have been appointed under Mike Ashley [the club’s owner] have been in a 
position of weakness.

“[They have] not being able to name their terms, they’ve had to put up with a 
transfer system that hasn’t benefited the club or themselves, and other things.

“Whereas Rafa can come in, he can put down exactly what he wants, he’s not a 
head coach, he’s a manager, he can have the transfer system – both incomings 
and outgoings – and he can name all that before coming in.”

Shearer, 45, took on a similar challenge in April 2009

 with Newcastle sat rock bottom of the Premier League. Buthe was unable to 
muster enough of a response in his eight-game tenure to save the club

from relegation.

When asked whether Benítez had taken on the biggest test of his career, 
Shearer said: “Yes, to put it bluntly. It’s a very tough challenge for him, 
he’s never been in a relegation battle before. He’s always managed top players 
and been very successful at doing that, but I think it’s an excellent 
appointment.”

Shearer – who scored a club-record 206 goals during a 10-year playing career 
at St James’ Park – was not surprised to see McClaren depart. “I don’t think he 
can complain about what’s happened because for the vast majority of this season 
Newcastle have been in the bottom three,” he said. “They’ve been big spenders, 
so it’s been a disaster really, from start to finish.

“When you look at the way he has been treated for the past four or five days 
it is not a surprise, it’s a difficult situation for him.”
