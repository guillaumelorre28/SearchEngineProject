South Africa, hosts of the 2010 World Cup, were eliminated without a point or 
a goal to their name last night when they lost 1-0 to Zambia yesterday. Chris 
Katongo, who plays his club football in South Africa with Jomo Cosmos, scored 
the only goal with a quarter of an hour remaining. Zambia, like Bafana Bafana 
unable to progress whatever the result, looked the more likely to score and the 
breakthrough arrive in the 75th minute when Clive Hachilensa whipped in a cross 
and Pierre Issa, once of Watford, appeared to duck out of a header allowing 
Katongo to prod the ball in from close range.

Guinea took top place in Group C with a 3-0 win over the defending champions 
Tunisia. The two teams had already booked places in the next phase and both 
coaches opted to make changes, with the new-look Guinea dominating throughout. 
They recorded their victory thanks to goals from Ousmane Bangoura, Pascal 
Feindouno and Kaba Diawara while Tunisia had Issam Mardassi sent off for a foul 
with 10 minutes to go.

Bangoura put Guinea in front in the 16th minute when he picked up a return 
pass and drilled it into the far corner. Their second arrived in the 70th 
minute when the substitute Feindouno shrugged off his marker and placed a low 
shot into the corner from the edge of the box. Then, in injury-time, Feindouno 
provided Diawara, the former Arsenal and West Ham forward, with the easiest of 
finishes.
