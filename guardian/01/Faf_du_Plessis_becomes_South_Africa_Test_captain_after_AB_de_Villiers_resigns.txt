AB de Villiers <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ab-de-villiers> has 
relinquished the South African Test captaincy in order to focus on getting back 
to full fitness, with Faf du Plessis named as his successor.

De Villiers took up the mantle following Hashim Amla’s resignation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/06/hashim-amla-resigns-captain-south-africa-second-test-england>
 midway through the England series in January this year but the dynamic 
right-hander has led the Proteas in just two Tests.

A persistent elbow injury, which required surgery, ruled De Villiers out of 
the series against New Zealand andAustralia

Lanka visit South Africa, he believes Du Plessis should succeed him as 
full‑time captain and theCricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket>

De Villiers said: “The interests of the team must always outweigh the 
interests of any individual, including me. It was a fantastic honour for me to 
be asked to captain the Test side but I have missed two series and I am still 
in doubt for the upcoming series against Sri Lanka.

“Following the squad’s outstanding performances in Australia, it is clearly in 
the greater interests of the team that Faf du Plessis should be confirmed as 
the permanent Test captain.”

Lorgat said: “It is no surprise that the CSA Board has confirmed Faf 
du Plessis as the Test captain to take over from AB.”

De Villiers’ injury kept him out of the 1-0 win against the Kiwis while he was 
also absent for the surprise 2-1 win in Australia and is slated to miss the 
three-match series against Sri Lanka, which gets under way in Port Elizabeth on 
Boxing Day.

Dr Mohammed Moosajee, the Proteas team manager, said De Villiers, who remains 
captain of the one-day side, may be fit for the 50-over series between the 
teams.

“AB’s left elbow is much improved but is still regaining the last few degrees 
of straightening. Fitness to play requires a full range of elbow movement and 
this may take another three to four weeks to achieve. He will be unavailable 
for the Test series against Sri Lanka and will target a return for the ODI 
series starting at the end of January.”
