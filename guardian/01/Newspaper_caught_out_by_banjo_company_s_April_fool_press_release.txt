Journalists at the daily newspaper serving Norwich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/norwich>, the Eastern Daily Press (EDP), have 
red faces after being caught out by an April fool's joke.

Eight days on from 1 April, the paper published a business supplement page 
lead about a 50-metre banjo statue being built in the city to rival Gateshead's 
Angel of the North.

There were several details, such as the location and the involvement of 
Anthony Gormley and Anish Kapoor. But it was a spoof dreamed up by a business 
calledThe Great British Banjo Company <http://thegreatbritishbanjocompany.com/>.

Its managing director, Simon Middleton, is quoted by HoldTheFrontPage 
<http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2014/news/regional-daily-apologises-after-printing-april-1-pr-spoof/>
 as saying he sent a press release which he thought was "so absurd" it would 
never be used.

It concluded: "We hope that this fabulous erection will be unveiled later this 
summer." Middleton said: "I thought that would have given it away."

But the quote that caught my eye came from the EDP's business editor, Shaun 
Lowthorpe, who said: "We were hoaxed by a normally reliable source."

By which he obviously means the company itself, which just happens to have 
been selected as one of theEDP's Future50 firms 
<http://www.norfolk-future50.co.uk/class-of-2013/the-great-british-banjo-company/>
.

So a press release, without any reporting follow-up, is considered to be a 
reliable source, eh?
