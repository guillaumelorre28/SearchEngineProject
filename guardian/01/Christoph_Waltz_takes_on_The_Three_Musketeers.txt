Christoph Waltz's Oscar-winning turn as Nazi colonel Hans Landa in Quentin 
Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds looks to have catapulted him to the top of the 
Hollywood villains list. The Austrian actor, already down to play the Green 
Hornet's arch-nemesis in Michel Gondry's movie, has been cast as Cardinal 
Richelieu in Paul WS Anderson's forthcoming3D 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/3d> version of The Three Musketeers.

Also joining the movie, which is set to shoot in September, is Logan Lerman of 
Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief fame. He will play 
D'Artagnan, the young man who leaves home with the hope of joining the king of 
France's personal guard in Alexandre Dumas's classic 17th century-set adventure.

The musketeers themselves – Porthos, Athos and Aramis – will be played by The 
Book of Eli's Ray Stevenson, Clash of the Titans'Luke Evans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/luke-evans> and Robin Hood's Matthew 
Macfadyen. Danish former Bond villain Mads Mikkelsen has signed to play 
Rochefort, while femme fatale Milady De Winter will be portrayed by Milla 
Jovovich, Anderson's wife.

The film-maker is perhaps best known for his Resident Evil films, the series 
based on the bestselling video games, in which Jovovich played the 
zombie-killing heroine. A separate Three Musketeers project is being put 
together by Warner Bros, with The Bourne Identity's Doug Liman set to direct.
