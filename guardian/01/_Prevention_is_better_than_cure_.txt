Although access to reproductive health services is better in Tanzania's 
cities, Halib, who is from Dar es Salaam, says fear of their parents finding 
out prevents young people using these services. "This is a real-life story for 
me. I became pregnant when I was still at secondary school and 20-years-old. It 
ended in miscarriage â€“ I was young and wasn't eating enough," she says.

So do cases such as Halib's indicate there might be significant underreporting 
of unsafe abortion, which is not only illegal in Tanzania but would also expose 
young girls as being sexually active?

Halib now uses family planning and has been on the contraceptive pill for the 
past six months, but keeps it a secret. When her mother found her pills, she 
denied she was using them and said they came from a demonstration at school. 
She avoids health facilities because they ask too many "discouraging 
questions", and buys the pill from a pharmacy, but still worries people she 
knows will one day see her asking for family planning and gossip about it.

Although NGOs offered life-skills lessons at Halib's school, it was never 
obligatory to attend. "I saw it as a problem that other young people had. It is 
only now that I know prevention is better than cure," Halib says. Now finished 
at secondary school, she is studying for a qualification in social work. More 
education seminars are needed and health facilities need to be more friendly to 
young people, she says. Most of the information she has about contraception 
comes from magazines. She says: "Girls lack education and do not know when they 
can become pregnant."
