The Independent <https://www.theguardian.com/media/theindependent>, Mirror and 
both of Richard Demond’s titles, the Express and Daily Star, suffered sharp 
falls in daily traffic in February, as most of the UK’s press saw declines in 
online visitors.

The decline follows a surge in digital readership between December – 
traditionally a weak month due to holidays – and January during which coverage 
of the deaths of David Bowie and Alan Rickman will have attracted international 
readers.

Only the Sun, which dropped its paywall at the end of November, and the 
Guardian recorded increases in daily average visitors during the month, 
according to the latest Audit Bureau of Circulations figures published on 
Thursday.

All the major national newspaper sites experienced year-on-year growth except 
Mail Online <https://www.theguardian.com/media/mail-online>, which was down 
slightly by 2.2% but is still by far the largest site with an average of 14.4m 
unique browsers a day.

The Independent’s fall in average unique readers will be especially concerning 
as the paper is moving to a digital only future when it scraps its print 
editions this month. On Wednesday the independent launched a new subscription 
app costing £12.99.

Meanwhile the picture in print remains bleak, with the vast majority of 
paid-for national newspapers recording declines, led by the Sun on Sunday whose 
circulation fell by just over 5%.

The Daily Star and Daily Express 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailyexpress>, which have cut prices 
aggressively since last year, recorded small increases in sales, as did the 
Daily Telegraph, though the latter’s increase can be attributed to a rise in 
multiple copy sales known as bulks. The free Evening Standard and Metro also 
recorded small increases in circulation.
