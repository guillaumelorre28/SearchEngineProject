The Church of Scientology <https://www.theguardian.com/world/scientology>, the 
subject of a scathing new film from Enron and Wikileaks documentarian Alex 
Gibney, has intensified its campaign to combat what it calls ‘false 
information’ in the documentary.

A special report published on the Scientology website Freedom seeks to 
discredit Gibney’s film Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, which
premiered at Sundance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/sundance-2015-review-going-clear-scientology-documentary-alex-gibney>
 this week. A new Twitter account,Freedom Media Ethics 
<https://twitter.com/FreedomEthics>, has been set up to promote the site.

In the film, based on Lawrence’s Wright’s muckraking book of the same name, 
Gibney talks to defectors from the church, including Crash director Paul 
Haggis. He explores the history of the religion from its founder L Ron Hubbard 
through to current leader David Miscavige, who is accused during the film of 
intimidating, beating and imprisoning insubordinate followers; high-profile 
followers like Tom Cruise also have their involvement raked over.

 The film team review Going Clear 
The Church is now distancing itself from the ex-members who feature in 
Gibney’s film. “Wright and Gibney cherry-picked expelled, discredited former 
Scientologists who would help them advance their propaganda,” the website 
reads. “The one-sided result is as dishonest as Gibney’s sources.”

They lambast Gibney’s choice of Haggis as a contributor, saying Haggis hadn’t 
been involved in the religion for decades leading up to his departure from it, 
and that “all he did was read falsehoods on a blog by anti-Scientology zealot 
Marty Rathbun”.A long article 
<http://www.freedommag.org/hbo/white-papers/documentary-sources.html> on the 
site is devoted to individually discrediting Gibney’s sources. The Church 
claims it tried to get in touch with Gibney and HBO regarding his sources, but 
they were rebuffed; Gibney meanwhilehas said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/sundance-2015-review-going-clear-scientology-documentary-alex-gibney>
 that the Church resisted his invitation for comment.

On Twitter meanwhile, the Church is trying to drum up a viral campaign against 
the film, comparing it to Rolling Stone’s article about rape at the University 
of Virginia, which was shown to have discrepancies and inaccuracies. It links 
to a New York Times advertisement it took out earlier in the month entitled “Is 
Alex Gibney’s Upcoming HBO ‘Documentary’ a Rolling Stone/UVA Redux?”

Going Clear will screen on US network HBO later in the year.
