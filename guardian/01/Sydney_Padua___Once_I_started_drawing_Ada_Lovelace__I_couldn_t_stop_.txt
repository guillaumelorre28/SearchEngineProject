More about the book

This is an utter joy, but also, to hazard a semi-educated opinion, 
mathematically sound. The 19th century was when mathematics started getting 
weird, and the idea that a machine could have an emergent intelligence began to 
take root. Babbage and Lovelace were, in a sense, ahead of their time; Padua 
brings them into ours. She is also honest enough to raise the question of 
whether Lovelace’s contributions and reputation have not been inflated by a 
desire to squeeze a woman into mathematical history; and the way she answers 
this question is extremely plausible. For Padua has done her research: she has 
teased out the connections between Babbage, Lovelace and what would seem to be 
the whole of Victorian culture and society – and done so in a way that appears 
almost effortless on the page, her light, easy graphic style an excellent 
vehicle not only for deep and complex thought, but for excellent, and sometimes 
excellently corny, jokes. This is a book to reread, not just read.– Nicholas 
Lezard
