 in what police called a road rage incident has surrendered to federal and 
local authorities, the US Marshals Service said Friday.

Gary Eugene Holmes, 33, was taken into custody without incident on Thursday, 
in connection with the shooting death last week of Acen King, according to 
Joshua Kaplan, a senior inspector for the US Marshals Service in Little Rock.

Holmes was being held in the Pulaski County jail without bond on preliminary 
charges of capital murder and committing a terroristic act.

Police said Acen was on a shopping trip with his grandmother when he was 
struck by gunfire. The boy’s grandmother, Kim King-Macon, told authorities she 
had stopped at a stop sign in the pouring rain when a man honked his horn, got 
out of his car and fired a gun.

King-Macon said she did not realize her grandson had been struck by gunfire 
until she arrived at the shopping center, about 10 miles away.

She saw Acen slumped over in his seat, she said. In 911 recordings released by 
police, a woman can be heard screaming: “Acen has been shot! Oh my God!”

Little Rock police contacted a fugitive task force that includes the US 
Marshals Service, seeking assistance in finding Holmes, Kaplan said. 
Authorities reached out to family members who arranged Holmes’ surrender. The 
FBI and the city of Little Rock offered a $40,000 reward in the case.

“This case went to the forefront,” Kaplan said. “This was the priority for the 
Marshals Service. Everything else was set aside and this went to the top of the 
list.”

Holmes was scheduled for a video arraignment on Friday morning. Court records 
did not list an attorney who could speak on his behalf.
