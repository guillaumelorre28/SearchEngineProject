Andy Flower <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-flower> confirmed he would 
continue as England's team director but warned "more pain" was in prospect as 
the team was revamped following their Ashes whitewash by Australia.

Flower told a news conference he was angry following the 5-0 Test series 
defeat. "I'm glad Alastair [Cook] is as well. So he should be. This has been a 
bad loss for the England cricket side and as part of our review we'll be 
looking at playing personnel and support staff and making sure we've got the 
right people on board for the future.

"We have had a lot of good times. This was not a good time for any of us 
involved with theEngland cricket team 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-cricket-team>. I like to feel pride 
about the way we go about things. I don't feel pride in the way we played this 
Test series.

"This will be a new start and so it should be. It does feel like the end of 
some type of era and there will be some sort of new start for the England 
cricket side and we might have to take a little more pain before we have 
sustained success again," said Flower.

"I'm proud of my involvement with England cricket and I'm very proud of the 
results over the how many years we've all been working together.

"I think it's important that we review this logically and learn from some of 
the mistakes we've made and ensure that we get English cricket moving in the 
right direction again.

"We've got a little time to think about what we're going to do with the Test 
side."
