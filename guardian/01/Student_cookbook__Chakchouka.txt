Cooking eggs with tomatoes and chillies is popular all over North Africa, the 
eastern Mediterranean and the Basque country, but this particular version 
originated in Tunisia. The sauce is easy but takes a while to cook, so why not 
double the quantity and use the other half to make a great casserole by adding 
some chicken or extra veg such as courgettes, aubergines or chickpeas to it.

Serves: 2-4
Cooking time: 35 mins

3 tbsp olive oil
1 medium to large onion, peeled and sliced
3 small or 2 medium peppers, quartered, seeded and sliced
2-3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
1½ tsp ground cumin
¼-½ tsp hot pimentón, paprika or chilli powder
2 tbsp coriander, chopped (optional)
1 x 400g can chopped tomatoes – or 400g fresh tomatoes, skinned and 1 tbsp 
tomato paste
Salt and pepper
4 eggs
Pitta bread and feta to serve 
Large frying pan preferably with a lid or some foil

Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the onion and peppers and cook for about 
10-15 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute or two then add 
the cumin and pimentón, paprika or chilli powder and coriander, and cook for a 
minute more. Tip in the tomatoes, stir and leave over a low heat for 10-15 
minutes until the sauce is thick and jammy. Check the seasoning, adding salt 
and pepper to taste. Make 4 hollows in the surface with a tablespoon then crack 
an egg into each hollow. Cover the pan with a lid or foil and cook until the 
egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny. Serve with warm pitta and 
some crumbled feta and chopped coriander sprinkled over the top.
