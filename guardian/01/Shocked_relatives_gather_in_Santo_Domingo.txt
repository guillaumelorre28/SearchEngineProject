 Relatives of passengers aboard American Airlines flight 587 crowded Santo 
Domingo's airport today, sobbing and grasping each other after hearing that the 
flight bound for the Dominican Republic had crashed shortly after takeoff.
"Oh my God" said Miriam Fajardo after being told that her sister, Norma Lilian 
Baloi, and three nephews were aboard the flight bound for Santo Domingo's Las
Americas <https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas> international airport. "I 
hadn't seen them in eight years. Now they're gone."

The jet crashed in a residential neighbourhood five miles from Kennedy airport 
in New York, the authorities said. There was no immediate word on deaths or 
injuries but aviation officials said 246 passengers and nine crew were on board.

"I woke up early just to greet them," said Melida Reinoso who had gone to the 
airport to meet her husband and son. "Why did this happen?"

The flight was due to arrive at 12.51pm local time (16.51pm GMT). 

"Not the child, please not the child" said Germania Brito who was waiting for 
her sister Mariana Flores, her husband John and their two-year-old son Isaias. 
"May God help us all."

Bill Schumann of the US Federal Aviation Administration said there was no 
immediate indication of what caused the crash, which came two months after 
terrorists in two hijacked airliners brought down the World Trade Centre.

All New York metropolitan area airports - Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark, New 
Jersey - were closed after the crash, which took place in the Rockaway section 
of Queens. All bridges and tunnels into the city were closed except to 
emergency vehicles and the United Nations was partially locked down.
