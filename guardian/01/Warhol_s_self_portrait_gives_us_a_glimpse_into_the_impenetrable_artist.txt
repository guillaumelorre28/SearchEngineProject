Mirror, mirror

This 1981 Polaroid is like a hall of mirrors, reflecting and distorting pop 
culture icons. UnmistakableAndy Warhol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol> collides with his 
best-known subject, Marilyn Monroe. She’s suggested by her most basic tokens – 
blonde hair and red lips – adapted by countless imitators, including, in a way, 
Warhol himself with his own signature silvery hairpiece.

Roll play

In the 70s, Warhol began using a Polaroid camera to deliver thousands of 
instant portraits. Typically, these were source material for his flat, 
impenetrable screenprints – but as with his penchant for role-play – they tell 
their own stories, too.

Show, don’t tell

This shot, along with others in dress up, was taken while he created three 
slots for Saturday Night Live, including one about death – an increasing 
obsession in his final decade. Like the makeup on his face, the photo both 
amplifies and conceals.

Is it me you’re looking for?

The artist hardly seems disguised, though. The mouth is tense, the eyes 
haunting, the face gaunt. This could be intentional: other self portraits from 
the time seem to tackle ageing and anxiety head-on. He was nothing if not 
knowing.
