Aston University yesterday announced a collaboration with the Australian 
pharmaceutical manufacturing company Mayne Pharma to run the first dedicated 
medical manufacturing clean room in the West Midlands.

The Birmingham-based university's Business Partnership Unit set up the 
agreement, which aims to produce specialist cancer and other drugs in aseptic 
facilities in order to support the preparation of pharmaceuticals with a short 
shelf life.

The agreement ensures the 10-year production of drugs at the clean room - an 
ultra clean, sterile and controlled environment for pharmaceutical manufacture, 
research and teaching. It will provide a complete specialist environment to 
support the development of new medicines.

Its rooms are temperature and humidity controlled to allow the aseptic 
production, manipulation and reconstitution of a variety of medical products 
(including chemotherapy drugs usually used in the treatment of cancer and for 
premature babies) that cannot be sterilised commercially.

Guppy Dhariwal, the director of finance and business services at Aston 
University, said: "[This agreement] will not only create new jobs in the region 
but it will, to the best of our knowledge, be the first manufacturing unit of 
its type that brings together high-quality university research with advanced 
pharmaceutical manufacturing techniques."

 Aston University, which has the only pharmacy school in the region, is 
expected to benefit from this new partnership through research and teaching in 
pharmacy. However, Paul Burkwood from the university, stressed that while the 
agreement would "hugely benefit the local community", the university would not 
benefit financially.
