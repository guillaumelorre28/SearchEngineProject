Gabe Hoffman has started legal proceedings against the Oscar-nominated 
film-maker, claiming that she didn’t fulfil her end of the deal. An Open Secret 
focuses on paedophilia in the film industry and the effect that it has had on 
various child performers.

Hoffman’s Esponda Productions has now initiated proceedings against Berg, with 
a letter that alleges she didn’t deliver the film on the required date and that 
it was in a state that required others to refine various elements.

He also claims that she failed to get the proper release forms from some of 
the interviewees and this error almost caused the film to miss its initial 
premiere at last year’s Doc NYC.

“Esponda Prods can confirm that its legal counsel has initiated the 
arbitration process against Amy Berg/Disarming Films, for what we believe 
represent numerous material breaches of contract,” Esponda toldthe Hollywood 
Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/an-open-secret-producer-seeks-815939>. 
“Given recent media coverage of Amy Berg’sprior declines of dozens of media 
requests to promote An Open Secret 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/31/hollywood-child-abuse-doc-amy-berg-an-open-secret>
, it should come as no surprise that one such arbitration claim regards Ms 
Berg’s failure to make reasonable best efforts to promote the film.”

Despite making headlines prior to its release, An Open Secret failed to 
attract an audience and didn’t receive the expansion that would have followed a 
more promising financial start.

Berg and her company Disarming Films have yet to comment.
