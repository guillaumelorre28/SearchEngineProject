A retired soldier has escaped a murder attempt after a gun attack on his south 
Armagh <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/armagh> home, police confirmed today.

The ex-Ulster Defence Regiment member was alone at his house in the Markethill 
area when at least three shots were fired around a quarter past nine last night.

A Police Service of Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> spokesman said one bullet went 
through a window in the front porch of the house during the shooting. The PSNI 
spokesman added that officers have cordoned off the scene.

Ulster Unionist assembly member Danny Kennedy condemned the attack and said it 
highlighted again the need for former members of the security forces to be 
allowed to retain personal protection weapons.

The area has been a focal point of dissident republican activity in recent 
months. Last month anti-peace process republicans left a car bomb outside a 
PSNI station in nearby Newtownhamilton.

Willie Frazer, from the victims' pressure group Families Acting for Innocent 
Relatives, said he was convinced that this latest attack was the work of 
republican dissidents.

"The police are playing down how high the threat is in areas like Tyrone and 
here in south Armagh. We had a policeman in here in our office today who was 
told he is under threat. The threat has never been as high and other police 
officers both serving and ex-members are being told to leave the area because 
their lives are at risk."
