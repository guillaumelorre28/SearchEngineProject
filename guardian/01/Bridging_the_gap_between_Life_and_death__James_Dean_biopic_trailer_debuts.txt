 Watch the Life trailer 

The trailer shows us Pattinson’s attempts to convince his boss at Magnum photo 
agency (Joel Edgerton) that Dean is a future star – the Life photographs were 
taken before the release of the actor’s 1955 breakthrough in East of Eden. Ben 
Kingsley, as the legendarily tough Warner Bros studio head Jack Warner, tells 
Dean that he needs to follow the rules if he wants to be famous.

The footage is intended to revive a project that failed to impress critics at 
the Berlin film festival earlier this year. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshawcalled 
the biopic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/09/berlin-2015-life-review-anton-corbijn-james-dean>
 “worryingly and ironically lifeless”, adding: “It’s a laborious, lugubrious 
movie maintained at a somnolent cool-jazz tempo – a waxworky piece of American 
icon worship featuring a sympathetic but mannered performance from Dane DeHaan 
impersonating James Dean ... This is a movie about photographs and photography, 
a subject about which Corbijn knows perhaps more than any movie director 
working. But the subject arguably made him self-conscious. At any rate, the 
film has the inert stasis of a photo spread.”

Dean died in a car crash in September 1955 while travelling at a reported 
85mph in his new Porsche 550 Spyder. At the time, cinemagoers knew him only for 
East of Eden, though the actor subsequently became better known for Rebel 
Without a Cause when it was released a few months later. The Life magazine 
photographs taken by Stock formed an important part of the star’s legacy.

Corbijn is known for his own iconic late 70s images of Joy Division, whose 
singer Ian Curtis also died at a young age. The Dutchman, 60, rose to fame as a 
film-maker in 2007 (after a career spent mostly working on music videos) with 
the biopicControl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/may/18/cannes2007.cannesfilmfestival1>, 
which borrowed the famous look of his own early pictures of the band to paint a 
taciturn, monochrome picture of the final years of Curtis’s life. Life is 
released in the UK on 25 September, timing that usually suggests a bid for 
awards-season success.
