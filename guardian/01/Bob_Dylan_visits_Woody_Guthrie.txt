In September 1960, Bob Dylan <https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan> 
borrowed a copy of Woody Guthrie's autobiography Bound for Glory from a college 
classmate and became obsessed. Written with the encouragement of Alan Lomax and 
published in 1943, it rendered its protagonist an almost mythical figure. Dylan 
started mimicking his hero's speech patterns and even told the crowd at the 
Cafe Wha? when he arrived in New York for the first time the following January: 
"I been travellin' around the country, followin' in Woody Guthrie's footsteps."

The "dust bowl troubadour" – author of this This Land is Your Land, whose 
guitar bore the legend "this machine kills fascists" – had himself almost 
reached the end of the road: he was now in his fourth year at the Greystone 
Park Psychiatric hospital in New Jersey, suffering from Huntingdon's disease, 
which finally led to his death in 1967. But Dylan hunted him out there, and the 
two men met – Guthrie apparently giving Dylan a card after their first meeting 
saying: "I ain't dead yet." Dylan wrote, and played to his idol, a new piece of 
his own called Song to Woody. It met with the older man's approval and was one 
of only two original compositions that made Dylan's 1962 debut.
