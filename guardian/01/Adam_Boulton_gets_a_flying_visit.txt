Viewers of Sky News may be familiar with Adam Boulton spluttering a tad while 
live on air. But on Tuesday it wasn’tAlastair Campbell that had the veteran 
reporter going red in the face 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/may/10/adam-boulton-alastair-campbell>
, but a fly that had decided to end it all byshooting down Boulton’s throat 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS5uAqV4c2s>. While reporting from Downing 
Street on the cabinet reshuffle, Boulton pauses (quite dramatically, Monkey 
thinks) and assumes a look you’d probably associate with him if he was reading 
Campbell’s memoirs. Dermot Murnaghan asks if he’d like to take a wee break, but 
the i reports that the hardy hack brushed off his brush with nature and 
soldiered on.
