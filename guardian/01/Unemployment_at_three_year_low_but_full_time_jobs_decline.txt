Australia’s unemployment rate has fallen to a three-year low after the number 
of people in work rose a greater than expected 26,200 in July.

The dollar rose strongly to US77.13c, up from 76.72c on Wednesday, in a sign 
of renewed market confidence in theAustralian economy

But the headline unemployment figure of 5.72% – the lowest in almost three 
years – masked the growing trend towards part-time working as the economy 
transitions from the investment-driven mining boom to a service-focused base.

Full-time employment actually fell by 45,400 jobs in July, while the number of 
part-time jobs was up by 71,600. The participation rate, which refers to the 
number of people either employed or actively looking for work, was flat at 
64.9%.

The data also shows that 72,000 new jobs were created in the first seven 
months of 2016, compared with more than 150,000 in the same period last year. 
Full-time job creation has gone into reverse in that time by almost 65,000 
compared with jobs growth of almost 90,000 in the same period last year.

, also noted a slowdown in new jobs being advertised earlier this year, adding 
that the uncertainty caused by the lengthy federal election campaign could have 
had a dampening effect on hiring.

“The softer results across the labour market mirror other indicators across 
the economy, including retail sales,” he said. “It’s pretty clear that the 
sluggish first half of 2016 resulted in employers managing their major cost 
base (employees) more carefully.

“The hope would be that now the election is out of the way consumers and 
businesses will go back to spending, investing and hiring – particularly given 
the ultra-low interest rates on offer and significant improvements in the 
household budget.”

In Western Australia, where the jobless rate of 6.3% is the second highest in 
the country behind South Australia, employment minister Michaelia Cash tried to 
put some positive spin on the growth in part-time jobs. “I’m not going to 
demonise part-time employment. I’m going to support it and applaud it because 
it does represent a good choice for so many people.”

Labor’s employment spokesman Brendan O’Connor said almost one in 10 
Australians were looking for more work but could not find it.
