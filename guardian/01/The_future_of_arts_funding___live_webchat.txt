Why should we fund the arts? That was the question playwright and writer David 
Edgar posed in afeature for the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jan/05/david-edgar-why-fund-the-arts> 
in 2012. As fellow playwright Fin Kennedy revealed in his recent Local 
Government Associationconference speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/mar/06/local-councils-unsung-heroes-of-the-arts-council-england>
, 2012 was a year in which the government’s biggest cuts to Arts Council 
England were taking hold, along with swingeing cuts from some local authorities.

At the time, Edgar reasoned that the most compelling argument for funding the 
arts was not factual but counterfactual:

The cuts which start biting in April will have major and still unpredictable 
effects on arts provision in England … A failure to win the argument for 
continued public funding, even at reduced levels, would lead to the closure of 
the great majority of currently funded arts organisations, especially outside 
London.

The argument that Edgar spoke of in 2012 still rages. Five decades on from 
Jennie Lee’s white paper,A Policy for the Arts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/feb/23/jennie-lee-policy-arts-white-paper-funding>
, the sector still fights for policy and funding changes that would, as Lee 
argued, allow arts and culture to occupy a central place in everyday British 
life – for young and old.

Recent evidence-based reports, such as the Warwick Commission’s document 
<http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/research/warwickcommission/futureculture/finalreport/warwick_commission_report_2015.pdf>
 on the Future of Cultural Value andthe trio of studies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/oct/10/arts-funding-imbalance-hard-facts-report>
 from GPS Culture, have highlighted the good, the bad and the ugly when it 
comes to arts funding, but what next?

In concluding their two year self-funded research programme, the GPS Culture 
team – Christopher Gordon, David Powell and Peter Stark – wrote about the need 
for anew, more flexible and responsive structure <http://www.gpsculture.co.uk/> 
of funding programmes, because the current models of arts funding do not engage 
with the realities of artists’ practice or the needs of emerging companies.

There are better ways, they wrote. “What might they be?”

That’s what we want to find out in our next webchat on the future of funding 
in arts and culture. What would a post-grants world look like? What are the 
alternative and new models of funding that will truly benefit the sector in the 
long-term? What about crowdfunding?

Join us and an expert panel to answer these questions and more from 12-2pm GMT 
on Wednesday 18 March.
