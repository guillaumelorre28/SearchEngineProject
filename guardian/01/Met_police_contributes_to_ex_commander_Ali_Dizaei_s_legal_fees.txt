Scotland Yard said on Thursday it had paid money to disgraced former commander 
Ali Dizaei <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ali-dizaei> as a contribution to his 
legal fees to settle an outstanding employment tribunal.

The force said it had not paid compensation to Dizaei, who was dismissed from 
the force after being convicted in February 2012 of using his powers as a 
senior officer to frame a man, in a row over money.

The force said the money had been paid "to avoid costly litigation" and that 
an employment tribunal was due to hold a two-month hearing early in 2014 into 
Dizaei's claims he was treated unfairly by theMetropolitan police 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/metropolitan-police>. It would not reveal how 
much money was paid.

Dizaei was convicted after a jury decided unanimously that he was lying over a 
clash with a man outside a westLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> 
restaurant in July 2008.

The settlement of Dizaei's employment claim was reached by the Met and the 
mayor's office for policing and crime.

In a statement the Met said: "The MPS and MOPAC have a responsibility for 
public funds and for this reason out of court negotiations formed part of the 
consideration in order to avoid costly litigation. The agreement does not 
include the payment of any compensation however a contribution has been made 
towards Mr Dizaei's legal costs. We will not be revealing the amount."

The statement added the settlement did not stop any attempt to "seek 
forfeiture of part of his pension".

Dizaei was a vocal critic of the Met on race and a controversial figure.

In July 2008 Dizaei clashed with Waad al-Baghdadi, who claimed the police 
commander owed him Â£600 for a website he had designed. Dizaei then arrested 
Baghdadi, and claimed to have been assaulted.
