At weekends, the vibrant, crowded streets of Kowloon intensify in Mong Kok to 
a point where the footfall outpaces London’s rush hour. In the heat and high 
humidity, it occasionally seems difficult to breathe. Weekdays are busy, too. 
By rights, the markets here should be extinct, gone the way of rickshaws and 
shophouses thanks to gentrification, air-conditioned malls and the internet. 
Instead, they thrive.

Two years ago, Mong Kok made international news when the “umbrella revolution” 
arrived 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/12/guardian-view-on-hong-kong-beijing-crisis-not-over>
, student-led occupations and protests aimed at bringing the city to a 
standstill. Weeks of stand-off followed, then violence erupted as police 
clashed not only with the students, but traders and triad gangsters frustrated 
by gridlocked traffic and political deadlock. Today, despite supermarkets 
eclipsing many of the food stalls, hordes of Hongkongers and visitors still 
descend on this Kowloon district in search of a bargain.

 Browsing In’s Point toys. 
The modern Mong Kok marketplace is above ground, forced upwards into the 
area’s tenement buildings by increased rents. Hong Kong’s property boom isn’t 
just at the top end (the world’s most expensive street, Pollock’s Path, is less 
than five miles away), so many stallholders now lease space in cheaper, upper 
floors. Anonymous doorways can lead to a variety of curiosity shops.

The two floors that make up In’s Point are crammed with new and used toy 
collectibles; acres of lego, game characters and movie merchandise, stacked 
floor to ceiling, in clear perspex stalls. Masses of Iron Man masks, retro 
money-eating monsters, Batmen and Supermen. Some stalls are sublet, divided 
into smaller perspex cubes, where amateur collectors display and sell on their 
fantasy trove to the likeminded. Many are online, such astokyostation.com.hk

A 200-yard stretch at the southern end of Fa Yuen Street is rammed with every 
sneaker, plimsoll, running shoe design ever made: Nike Air Max, Converse 
Wedges, Supra Skytops, Vans or those silver-brogued trainers you’ve been 
dreaming of are here, leaving JD Sports on the starting block. New products 
arrive the instant they’re launched, anything considered five minutes ago is 
shunted to the back. Older styles are heavily discounted (50% is common) in 
outlets likeSMS Crew <https://www.facebook.com/supermadsneakers> (“Super Mad 
Sneakers”) andDahood <http://www.dahood.asia/>. There are no fakes, partly 
because the manufacturers themselves are now jostling for shop space.

 Fa Yuen Street Market. Photograph: Stefan Mokrzecki/Getty Images 
The northern end of the street has stalls and shops piled high with pants and 
bras, trousers and tops, bags, accessories and myriad leopard-skin mobile phone 
covers. Shoes in small stores, such as Red Bee, start at HK$29 (about £3). 
Silvered leather is clearly a thing right now.

It’s all mixed up with kitchen gadgets, exotic vegetables, a small bakery for 
fresh mooncakes, and one stall loudly demonstrating the rich variety of karaoke 
microphones available today. The corner at Mongkok Road houses a covered wet 
market, where mongers eschew ice in favour of compartmentalised counters 
holding enough shallow water for fish to wriggle energetically until purchased.

 Ladies Market in Mong Kok. Photograph: Alamy 
Once the flagship thoroughfare, brassily boasting fashions knock-offs, 
handbags and watches. There are still clothes – Chinese old-lady-style silk 
dresses and wide-leg culottes – but the fakes are hidden from view in response 
to the law. No shortage of verbal offers (“Copywatch! Copywatch!”) but only the 
occasional stallholder is foolhardy enough to display any glittering 
contraband. One stall had counterfeit canvas artworks of Yue Minjun, China’s 
best-known contemporary painter, whose grinning self-portraits realise millions 
at auction: after a few seconds haggling, the asking price of HK$300 (about 
£30) tumbled to HK$120 (£12). Mens’ “Ralph Lauren” polo shirts are four for 
HK$100 (£10).

There’s jade (a separate jade market is well known for selling fakes), mobile 
phone accessories, collectibles and leather goods. It’s not all tat, by any 
means. If you really do want to bring back souvenir mahjong sets, or decorative 
chopsticks, they’re cheaper here than the tourist shops in Central. In the 
evening it gets very busy – and be prepared for robust argument over prices.

 The Goldfish Market. Photograph: Alamy 
There’s no other market street like this anywhere, certainly not in the west. 
Several blocks of tiny shops display dozens of water-filled plastic pouches in 
their doorways, holding all manner of brightly coloured fish, on sale for 
pennies. They’re interspersed with pet shops, with small dogs in the windows. 
Others showcase miniature turtles and tortoises, large insects and small 
kittens. Sacks of pet food, boxes and cages spill out higgledy-piggledy onto 
the pavement. Inside, miniature menageries sell rodents, insects, more puppies, 
rabbits and yet more kittens. In the Harbour Koi Centre (no 174), a tank of 
giant koi carp were priced at HK$2,000 (£200) each. Gifts for the dedicated 
aquarist include underwater Chinese pagodas, bonsai trees, wrecked junks and 
replicas of SpongeBob SquarePants.

 Woks outside a kitchen shop in Shanghai Street. Photograph: Alamy 
The southern end is where to go for kitchen equipment: woks and chopsticks, 
steamer baskets and bowls, porcelain ladles and all manner of other gadgets. 
Man Kee at No 342 has beautifully crafted chopping boards. You may also be 
interested in catering equipment, knives and machetes (or possibly not).

Further north, (numbers 600 to 626) is a row of 10 scruffy looking 
“shophouses”, which date from the 1920s and are Grade I listed, a reminder to 
modern Hongkongers in high-rise towers of a recent past, when tenants would 
mostly live and work in tiny rented apartments above narrow shops.

At 481, a store window is filled with what appears to be a large display of 
bright yellow Cheesy Wotsits but is, in fact, fish maw, dried swim bladders 
which are the buoyancy controllers of large fish. Rich in collagen and gelatin, 
maw is feted in China as a healthy ingredient for soups and stews, and is 
reputed to be the secret of shining, healthy skin. Shelves groan with large 
jars of other fresh and dried health supplements; abalone, ginseng, goji 
berries, sea cucumbers, mandarin peel and clipped-off bull tails, which are 
apparently a gentleman’s aid …

English is not spoken and although prices start at a few pounds for each item, 
they climb steeply, according to age and quality, peaking at several hundred 
pounds a kilo. (Across the bay at Sheung Wan there’s a dedicated market, “Dried 
Seafood Street”, and, elsewhere, a profitable illegal trade in maw from 
endangered species.)

This is half a mile of cheap blooms and plants with large numbers of orchids 
and bonsai trees – the clue’s in the name. The pavements are crammed with 
greenery, the air heavily scented. It’s a welcome oasis in the midst of Mong 
Kok’s overcrowded thoroughfares. At the centre is Brighten, a three-storey, 
air-conditioned supermarket of dried-flower sprays for every occasion, 
Christmas decorations (from August), mid-autumn festival bouquets, giant paper 
rabbits and silk flowers aplenty.

The adjacent shops on Prince Edward Road West are equally interesting. Zen in 
5 Seasons produces its own healthy elixirs (schisandra and momordica fruits, 
self-heal spike tea; honeysuckle, Chinese wolfberry and chrysanthemum tea). 
Next door, Natural Cha Cha has unusually sublime indoor/outdoor ceramics and
objets, and Farm Direct is a healthy chain of shops specialising in 
pesticide-free, hydroponically grown fruit and veg, sold either unadulterated 
or fashioned into lettuce noodles or kale spaghetti. Next door is Maria’s, a 
home bakery with a fine line in delicious, not quite so healthy, soft and 
fluffy mini cheesecakes plus Fong’s egg cake (on sale every day from 3pm).

 Birds in cages hanging at the Bird Garden and Market in Yuen Po Street. 
Photograph: Getty Images 
At the eastern end of the flower market can be heard the twittering of small 
birds – hundreds of them. The commercial side does nothing to alleviate 
concerns about caging birds: lots of small birds temporarily housed in very 
small, yellow, plastic cages are not a pretty sight. There’s bird food for 
sale, including bags of live locusts, which one stallholder has to extract from 
a large cage by hand, an act which owes more to the bushtucker trials of I’m a 
Celebrity … than avian or insect husbandry.

Adjacent to this is the garden (bird-garden.hk <http://www.bird-garden.hk/>), 
where elderly men bring their tiny winged companions in delicate cages, to sit 
and listen in contemplation. Away from the crowds and the traffic roar, in the 
shade of the trees, the garden offers respite, a rare moment to consider the 
most pleasurable tweets in Hong Kong – without a smartphone in sight.
