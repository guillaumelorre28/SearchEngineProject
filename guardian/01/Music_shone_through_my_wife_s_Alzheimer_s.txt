Laura Barton’s description of Hannah Peel’s relationship with her gran through 
music (Waking moments

, G2, 23 November) brought back so many memories of my wife’s struggle with 
Alzheimer’s. Denise died last year having struggled with Alzheimer’s for five 
years. She had been a music teacher and church organist in her early life but, 
even though I was able to care for her at home until the end, her memory and 
recognition failed early on in the disease. However, even when she slept most 
of the time, hymns would sometimes bring a smile to her lips, not least the 
weekly Songs of Praise on a Sunday afternoon. Such was the awakening that she 
would join in with most hymns and was word perfect. As the final credits rolled 
Denise would close her eyes and return to her abyss of darkness.
