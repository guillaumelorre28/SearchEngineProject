Alanis Morissette 
<http://www.viralvideochart.com/youtube/alanis_morissette_my_humps_video?id=W91sqAs-_-g>
 covering the Black Eyed Peas: Quite the oddest cover I've heard for a while, 
or at least sinceTori Amos 
<http://www.last.fm/music/Tori+Amos/_/Raining+Blood(Slayer+cover)> covered 
Slayer's Raining Blood. She manages to demonstrate the really supremely facile 
lyrics of what I'd argue is the single worst song of the past decade, and also 
shows that "proper" piano playing in a ballad-stylee can't even save it. I 
don't know why it should, but point well made, anyway.

It wouldn't be Easter without some fluffy animals ( I almost wrote "fluffers" 
then for some reason, but I think that's something else...) so all hail the
hand-holding otters 
<http://www.viralvideochart.com/youtube/otters_holding_hands?id=epUk3T2Kfno> at 
number two in this week's viral video chart. This is the general chart, so 
there''s a aright old mix in here and more than a little nostalgia as a few old 
favourites re-emerge.

The otters are just too cute. Hang around for the reprise.

I know we've seen it before and it's very, very easy for those nasty 
journalists to do, but there's a bit ofUS-bashing at number 12 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJuNgBkloFE> by some cheeky scamps down under.

Picking between them is like choosing between children, but I do like the guy 
that says with absolute confidence that California is part of the axis of evil, 
and the one that thinks "Muslim" is the main religion of Israel. And then 
there's the guy that says Tony Blair is an actor. So not so stupid after all...
