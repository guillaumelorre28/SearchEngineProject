Actor Alec Baldwin <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alec-baldwin> was 
arrested Tuesday – and then, in his inimitable way, told the world about it.

Baldwin, 56, was issued two summonses and arrested after he allegedly rode his 
bike the wrong direction down New York City’s Fifth Avenue and, then, an NYPD 
detectivetold Mashable 
<http://mashable.com/2014/05/13/alec-baldwin-arrested-nyc/>, “became a little 
belligerent with officers”.


The actor, a Tony and Oscar nominee, allegedly refused to provide his 
identification to the officers, which prompted them to arrest him and take him 
to a nearby precinct, according to the Associated Press.


Apparently upset that he was arrested, Baldwin tweeted the arresting officer’s 
name and badge number, and then lambasted New York City.


“New York City is a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for 
revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign,” Baldwintweeted

were “once again” outside his home, and that they’d scared his daughter.
