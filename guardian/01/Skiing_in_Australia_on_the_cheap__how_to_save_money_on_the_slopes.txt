When I was a child of maybe 10 years old I vividly remember having a 
calamitous stack while skiing at an Australian ski resort and losing my left 
ski down a mountainside.

The thing that stays with me was having to face my mum and dad back at the ski 
lodge to explain why I had returned to the lodge with a single ski.

At the time I didn’t even think about the expense it would have incurred if 
we’d had to pay for a replacement set of skis (it was eventually found), but as 
an adult I marvel at how my parents ever afforded to take us four boys away to 
the snow every year on a skiing holiday.


After all, everyone knows skiing in Australia is an expensive pastime – 
sometimes even considered as elitist sport. Over the years since I’ve continued 
my ski holidays, but I’ve worked out a few tricks to keep costs down in what is 
often considered to be one of the most expensive ski destinations in the world.


Plan ahead and save

The best way to save serious dollars on your ski trip is to come prepared. 
I’ve found that ski clothes including waterproof jackets, gloves, goggles and 
scarves are often for sale in op shops in more upmarket suburbs like Toorak in 
Melbourne or Chatswood in Sydney.


In fact, these stores often also carry skis and boots, so shop around and see 
what you can find. This will save you the expense of hiring these goods on the 
mountain where prices are a premium. Recently at secondhand shops in Melbourne, 
I got a Gore-Tex jacket for $15, gloves for $5, and I’ve seen skis sold for 
$40. Aldi also has an annual stock of ski gear at low prices.

 Ski kits are expensive – so why not shop for them in secondhand stores?

If you can’t find what you’re looking for secondhand, consider also hiring 
your gear before you leave for your trip – you’ll find everything is way 
cheaper off the mountain.


Nathan Fenton, online and marketing officer for Falls Creek resort 
<http://www.fallscreek.com.au/>, says if you plan to visit the snowfields more 
than once in a season you can also save a lot on lift passes and resort entry 
by purchasing a season pass during discount periods.


“A Falls Creek Season permit (access to the slopes and carpark) costs just 
$290 during the early bird sale period, which is around the same price as a 
six-day pass on the gate. The ‘hero pass’ is also one of the best deals in the 
country, giving season-long ski lift access to both Falls Creek and Mount 
Hotham in 2015 for under $750 in its sale period,” he says.


Scope out the best deals

You don’t need to limit yourself to skiing at premium resorts such as 
Perisher, Falls Creek or Mount Buller.


Other resorts like Mount Baw Baw <http://mountbawbaw.com.au/> and Thredbo  
<http://www.thredbo.com.au/?gclid=CKqKiLay8sUCFa3MtAodrDoAZw>offer much cheaper 
lift tickets and accommodation options and often still provide excellent skiing 
opportunities, depending on the amount of snow in any given season.


Thredbo, for example, is offering 20% off lift tickets and gear rental if 
organised seven days in advance. Thredbo is also the only ski resort in 
Australia with a YHA hostel where rates start at around $60 a night.


Nadia Fadel, who runs the Thredbo YHA 
<https://www.yha.com.au/hostels/nsw/snowy-mountains/thredbo/>, says one of the 
big advantages of staying in a communal hostel is that you cook your own meals. 
The YHA is located within the Thredbo Resort and “only a few minutes from the 
Kosciuszko express chairlift, which means many of our guests choose to wander 
back to the hostel and make use of the communal facilities for lunch and a 
break in the middle of their day,” says Fadel.

 Skiing in Australia can be very expensive if you don’t plan ahead. 
Sleep off the mountain

While there is nothing quite like the feeling of being able to ski home to 
your hostel at the end of the day, there’s no doubt that finding alternative 
accommodation off the mountain is a much more affordable way to go. 
All-inclusive trips also allow you to plan everything upfront so you can remain 
within budget.

You can book an all-inclusive self-drive ski weekend at the Jindabyne Sports 
and Recreation Camp 
<http://www.dsr.nsw.gov.au/familycamps/program.asp?Code=2377> that covers 
accommodation, ski gear hire, park entry and lift tickets. Prices are $601 for 
the entire weekend or $252 for meals and accommodation only. These deals are 
only available on specific weekends and must be booked in advance.


According to Steve Manning, centre manager of the Jindabyne Sports and 
Recreation Centre, the all-inclusive option such as self-drive ski weekends 
that include accommodation, meals, ski hire, lift tickets, lessons and park 
entry is the best value available in the ski fields.

“Skiing in the low season is a less expensive way to visit the snowfields. The 
ski resorts have also spent quite a bit of money in snow-making so there’s 
usually excellent snow conditions at both ends of the season,” he says.

You don’t need to ski every day

Lift tickets will be your biggest expense on a ski holiday, and there is no 
way to avoid being slugged with day-ticket prices of up to $130 a day. But you 
don’t need to go skiing all day, every day to have a great holiday.

 There are plenty of other activities available these days in Australian ski 
resorts – from cross-country skiing in the Bogong high plains, to tobogganing 
tracks, to breathtaking walks around the national parks, or even just sitting 
in front of the fire at the ski lodge with a good book and a steaming mug of 
hot chocolate.
