Kerber had never before gone past the fourth round in Melbourne but a stirring 
display against Azarenka, who many had tipped to win the title, now puts her 
one victory away from the final.

“I can’t actually describe it in words,” Kerber said. “I was 0-6 [against 
Azarenka] before I came on court and I was just saying to myself, ‘just play 
like you play in practice, just go for it and believe you can beat her’. I’m so 
happy I beat her for the first time.”

The German raced into a 4-0 lead in the first set and while Azarenka brought 
it back to 4-3, she regained her composure to serve out when the Belarusian hit 
a backhand long.

The match was quickly flipped on its head in the second, however, when 
Azarenka stormed 5-2 clear but Kerber came back, saving five set points on her 
way to levelling at 5-5.

The contest had looked destined for a decider but Kerber now had the momentum 
and she won the next two games in a row to seal victory in one hour and 45 
minutes.

“I was more aggressive than when it was 2-5,” Kerber said. “I was just saying 
to myself: ‘Forget the score, go for it and play the best you can play today’. 
I was not thinking about the score.

“At match point I had a little bit more in my mind but it’s just an amazing 
feeling to be in the semi-finals.”
