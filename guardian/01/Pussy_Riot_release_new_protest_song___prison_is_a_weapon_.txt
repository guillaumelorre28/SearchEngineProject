It has been a torrid few months for Russia’s embattled general prosecutor Yuri 
Chaika. In December he was the subject of a video made by opposition leader 
Alexei Navalny, whichaccused his family of mafia ties and gross corruption 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/alexei-navalny-yuri-chaika>.

Now he is on the receiving end of biting satire doled out by the feminist punk 
collectivePussy Riot <https://www.theguardian.com/music/pussy-riot>.

The band’s latest pop video, released on Wednesday, is a black pastiche of 
Russia’s criminal justice system, featuring torture, hooded prisoners in nooses 
and a framed official portrait of the president, Vladimir Putin.

Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova plays the role of Chaika, backed up by 
dancers in blue prosecutors’ uniforms. A golden loaf of bread and a Lenin 
memorial also feature.

Navalny’s original video, which attracted more than five million views, 
alleged that Chaika’s sons Artem and Igor had built up a massive business 
empire using thier father’s network of regional prosecutors to crush rival 
companies.

that the Chaikas own a home in Switzerland and a luxury hotel in Greece, among 
other properties.Selective weapon’

The latest song from Pussy Riot pokes fun at Chaika’s patriotism with the 
lines “I love Russia/I’m a patriot/But I could live in Switzerland as well”.

The lyrics go on to suggest that the Kremlin uses criminal prosecutions as a 
selective weapon – prosecuting their enemies and dropping charges for their 
“homies”.

Tolokonnikova said the video was a response to the way the government considers
Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> an instrument to get rich. 
“[The state] doesn’t care about the standard of living of Russian citizens. Nor 
about education, the environment or about the development of science or 
industry,” she said.

Instead, the elite raid the country and then go abroad to spend their loot, 
she added.

The video was shot in three different locations across Moscow: a kitsch fort 
above the city’s Ismailovsky market; an abandoned and unheated Soviet-era 
palace of culture; and a disused jail.

Tolokonnikova said it was easy to get hold of the uniforms, adding that Putin 
had been right when he said you could buy them at any corner shop. “The only 
problem was the size,” she said. “They were six sizes too big for us. 
Apparently, prosecutors like to eat.”

Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina spent 21 months 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/23/freed-pussy-riot-amnesty-prison-putin-humiliation>
 in jail following an anti-Putin punk protest inside Moscow’s Christ the 
Saviour cathedral in 2012.

Alyokhina doesn’t appear in the latest video because the pair no longer work 
together creatively as Pussy Riot, Tolokonnikova said. They continue to 
collaborate on a website,MediaZona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/09/post-soviet-states-new-east-network-guardian-welcome>
, which highlights the legal system and conditions inside Russia’s prison.

The English language version of Navalny’s video came out last month and was 
screened on Tuesday before a group of British MPs.

Chaika has denied the allegations against him in the video, calling them a 
“hatchet job” and an attempt by an outside power to smear him.


As for Chaika the song, Pussy Riot say that “any resemblance to actual events 
or persons isn’t accidental, but deliberate”.
