Every Picture Tells a Story had been intended to kill time while Rod Stewart's 
main job, as singer of the Faces, was on hold between albums. Instead, he 
crafted an album that was manifestly superior to anything the Faces managed, 
spearheaded by Maggie May, a song originally released as a B-side but so 
immediately popular it was soon switched to the A. The single and album made 
him the first artist ever to top both main charts on both sides of the Atlantic 
at the same time.
