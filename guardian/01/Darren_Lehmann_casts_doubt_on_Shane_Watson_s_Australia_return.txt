Shane Watson’s return to the Australia team for the second Test against South 
Africa is in doubt after impressive performances from Alex Doolan and Shaun 
Marsh.

While Mitchell Johnson’s devastation of the South African batting line-up

 grabbed much of the attention, two new faces in the Australia side – Marsh and 
Doolan – scored 308 runs between them in the Test.

“They were both very good. We are just going to have to see what the wicket’s 
like, whether we need that extra bowling option,” the Australia coach, Darren 
Lehmann, said. “It’s always very hard to fit him [Watson] in if you’re winning. 
We don’t like to change the side too much, but if he’s fit and ready to go 
[Watson missed the first Test through injury] we’ll have to wait and see.”

Doolan was impressive in dealing with one of the best attacks in the world, 
although he admitted he had felt under pressure. “I can’t put my finger on any 
certain point where I felt comfortable at all. If it wasn’t Dale Steyn then it 
was Morne Morkel bowling at you, or Vernon Philander,” Doolan said. “These guys 
are relentless. It’s never easy going out there at any stage. It’s probably the 
most uncomfortable I’ve felt in an innings consistently, because there was just 
no let-up.”

Australia enjoyed an extra rest day after wrapping up the first Test on day 
four, and will depart Johannesburg on Monday.
