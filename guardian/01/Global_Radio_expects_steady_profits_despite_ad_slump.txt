Global Radio <https://www.theguardian.com/media/globalradio>, the owner of 
radio stations including Classic FM and Capital, has said that it expects to 
hold underlying operating profits flat for the 12 months to the end of March, 
despite a near 20% slump in advertising revenues over the same period.

The Global group chief executive, Ashley Tabor, told today's Times 
<http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article6269455.ece>
 that the company was forecasting that underlying operating profits for the 12 
months to the end of March 2009 would be steady year on year at about £31m.

Tabor added that the UK radio advertising market had fallen by 15% to 20% year 
on year in the same 12-month period.

The UK's largest commercial radio company is privately owned and will not file 
full results for its last financial year to Companies House for some time.

Global Radio filed accounts for the year ending March 2008 to Companies House 
last week, showing revenues increased year on year on a like-for-like basis 
from £193m to £200.6m.

Underlying operating profits rose from £13.3m to £16.1m on a like-for-like 
basis. The company reported a statutory operating loss of £66.5m, up from 
£14.4m.

However, assessing Global Radio's like-for-like performance for the period is 
complicated because Chrysalis Radio was acquired in July 2007 for £173m and 
GCap Media was acquired for £375m in June last year.

On the assumption that Global Radio had owned both businesses for the year to 
the end of March 2008, revenues would have been £269m and underlying earnings 
£31m.

Global Radio is selling a number of its Midlands radio stations for about 
£38.5m to Bauer.
