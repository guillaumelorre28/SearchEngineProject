Tony Abbott is forcing his conscience on the Liberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> and the Australian 
people, says the opposition leader, Bill Shorten.

Thousands attended a marriage equality rally in Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> where they heard Shorten 
reiterate his promise to make same-sex marriage marriage legal if Labor wins 
the election due next year.

“Within 100 days, I will introduce a law to have marriage equality and we will 
get it through this time,” Shorten said on Saturday.

Shorten said the prime minister had given into extreme rightwing voices in his 
party and denied his MPs the chance to vote with their conscience.

“He said he believes in a conscience vote,” Shorten said. “What he didn’t tell 
Australians is he believes in his own conscience and he will force everyone to 
agree with his conscience.”

The Greens MP Adam Bandt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adam-bandt> said Abbott should get 
out of the way and Australia could have marriage equality by the end of the 
year.

“I think Tony Abbott <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tony-abbott> 
has decided to side with a minority in the Australian community who have a loud 
voice but doesn’t speak for the loving majority,” he said.
