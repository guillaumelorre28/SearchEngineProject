Innocent Smoke, born in the shadow of Malawi’s biggest tobacco factory in 2005 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/21/hearafrica05.development9>, is 
one of those rare African lads who love football but who have never watched it 
on television or even heard of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Now he is 
fighting for his sight – a battle that may determine the rest of his life.

Nine years ago, Innocent’s family moved from a small farming community on the 
outskirts of the burgeoning capital, Lilongwe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/19/africa-children-malawi-innocent-smoke>
, to try their hand growing maize and tobacco in the rolling hills near the 
remote village of Simulemba, north of Kasungu, where land is good and still 
cheap.

With money from a redundancy, Innocent’s father, Boy, made 4,000 bricks by 
hand and built a two-bedroom house. Together, the family has laboured to open 
up four acres of land to farm. This year, the rains were bad and they harvested 
just 50 bags of maize instead of the 100 they hoped for, and cropped only four 
bales ofBurley tobacco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/17/outlook.development1>. 

“Perhaps it was climate change,” says Boy, “but in the past five years we have 
had only one good harvest.”

The Smokes’ early enthusiasm for farming has gone. Now, chastened by only two 
years with good rains, the family of nine plans to sell up, or rent the house 
out and return to Area 25 in Lilongwe, where Boy – perhaps optimistically – 
believes he can triple his money by building another house.

Lenita, Innocent’s mother, is also keen to leave. The children will have more 
of a chance in life in the city, she says. Lenita hopes to open a tailoring 
shop to make shirts and dresses. She has been trained, she says, but needs a 
machine.

Innocent spends his days playing football with friends like Abat, Kenneth and 
James. In common with other boys, he also helps his father to weed and harvest 
maize and tobacco in the fields. He walks a mile to collect water for the 
family every day, and further to get to school or the health clinic.

So far, Innocent has little idea of the world beyond the village of Simulemba 
and the trading post. “Once a week I see a bit of television but, because we 
have to pay 50 kwacha [9 cents], it is not often. I have never seen football on 
television,” he says.

But he has seen enough to know what he wants to do. “I was watching television 
and we saw a big aeroplane. I would like to be a pilot. Or a doctor,” he says.

For the moment, “Inno”, as the family calls him, is a sensitive country boy 
with all the advantages of a safe outdoor life, but with the disadvantages that 
come from living in a remote area ofMalawi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/malawi>, far from decent health services, 
transport and good schools.

His primary schooling has been basic, if not rudimentary. The teachers are not 
all qualified, the classes are big and the children have few textbooks or 
materials like pens and pencils to work with.

But for three years Innocent did well. “I like school. In my first year I was 
fourth in the class. I can read Chichewa but I can’t really speak English yet,” 
he says.

Then, last year, Innocent started to get headaches and pains in his eyes, 
keeping him away from school for weeks at a time. He fell behind and has had to 
repeat year three.

He was diagnosed at a local clinic with the early stages of trachoma, a 
painful eye condition that his parents know will slowly attack his eyelids and 
then his veins and muscles, inevitably blinding him over a period of 10 years 
if he does not get the right treatment. He has been given drops but so far he 
has not responded, says Lenita. “At night I am in pain,” he says.

To have any chance, Innocent’s parents have been told they must get him to a 
specialist clinic at the central hospital in Lilongwe. Because the condition 
has been caught early, hopefully he will not need surgery and the ointments and 
eyedrops should be enough to save his sight. But it will cost the family nearly 
$5 to see a specialist, a sum beyond what they can afford.

The next five years will determine whether Innocent moves to the city or 
remains in the country, gets an education or is effectively condemned to 
working the fields. They may also determine whether or not he ever sees Messi 
and Ronaldo or watches a game of football on television.
