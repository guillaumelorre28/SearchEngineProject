Axa <https://www.theguardian.com/business/axa> has launched a €2bn (£1.78bn) 
rights issue to fund an expansion drive in Asia.

The French insurer announced the cash call this morning, but promptly suffered 
an early setback when its first takeover target – its own Asian operations – 
rejected the advances.

Under the rights issue, Axa is offering new shares at €11.90, almost a third 
less than last Friday's closing price of €16.88.

News of the rights issue came as Axa teamed up with Australian rival AMP to 
buy out Axa Asia Pacific for A$11bn (£6bn). The deal would see AMP take control 
of the Australia and New Zealand assets while Axa would hold on to the Asian 
Pacific operations, but it was immediately rebuffed.

It is Axa's second attempt to buy back the Asian business, in which it 
currently owns a 54% stake.

"Through the rights issue, our shareholders will be able to participate in the 
positive prospects offered by the acquisition opportunities arising from the 
current market environment", said Henri de Castries, Axa chairman.

Shares in Axa Asia Pacific jumped by a third to A$5.70 as investors speculated 
that Axa would come back with a higher offer.

Axa recently announced a fall in third-quarter revenues and has taken a number 
of cost-cutting measures to streamline its businesses.In the UK, it is cutting 
350 jobs

save £150m over the next three years.
