Forget about that unfortunate BBC Christmas trail 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediamonkeyblog/2011/nov/25/bbc-nightmare-before-christmas>
, this is what you need to get you into the festive spirit. It'sAdam Buxton's 
take on Christmas telly ads 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtspNJIZUIs&feature=youtu.be>. It made us cry 
even more than that John Lewis one. Altogether now … "All of the famous people 
coming out to sell you stuff, please give them all your money because times are 
getting tough …" Merry Christmas to you too,Dr Buckles
