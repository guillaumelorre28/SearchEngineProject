Serves 2-3 
4 chicken thighs
4 carrots
2 leeks
1 stick celery
Olive oil
2 sprigs of thyme
2 cloves of garlic, crushed
100ml chicken stock
100ml double cream
200g pre-rolled puff pastry
Milk to glaze

Dice the chicken thighs into large pieces. Peel the carrots, then wash and 
slice them. Wash and slice the leeks and celery.

In a saute pan heat a touch of oil, then add the chicken. Do this in two 
batches so they cook evenly, unless you have a big pan. Season and add the 
thyme and garlic, saute for three minutes then remove from the pan.

In the same pan, add the sliced carrots and celery and cook for five minutes 
until they start to soften, then add the leeks. Cook for a further three 
minutes until the leeks start to wilt.

Add the vegetables to the chicken and place the mix into an 8in pie dish with 
the cream and chicken stock. Allow to cool.

Cover the dish with a lid of puff pastry, glaze with the milk and cook in the 
oven for 20 minutes at 180C/gasÂ mark 4 until the pastry is ready.
