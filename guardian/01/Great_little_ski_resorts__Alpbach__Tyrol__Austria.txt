So, where?
This small Tyrolean village sits at just under 1,000m at the bottom of a long 
valley of the same name, overlooked by the 1,899m Gratlspitz mountain. Since 
the arrival in 2012 of an eight-person gondola linking the Alpbach side of the 
resort with the Wildschönau valley, Alpbach has become part of theSki Juwel area
 <http://www.alpbachtal.at/en>, which incorporates the resorts of Reith, Oberau 
and Niederau, whose 145km of runs make it one of the largest areas in the Tyrol.

Why try it? 
Amid the timber-clad chalets and dark green spruce trees, you may come across 
a plaque announcing that you are entering the most beautiful village in Austria 
– and it’s spot on. Farmhouses dot the slopes, for this is a working village of 
more than 100 farms, and you might end your ski run next to a pile of fresh 
manure or find that your ski instructor works as a dairy farmer in summer.

In the 1970s, the village introduced laws requiring that every new building be 
constructed in traditional stone-and-wood style. And that’s a clue as to why 
most people come here – the relaxed pace and great scenery. Skiers tend to get 
up the mountain by 9am, have lunch at about noon and head off the slopes at 
about 3pm.

Loyalty to Alpbach is very high: it’s the resort of choice for generations of 
a small number of British skiers. One veteran said: “I’ve been coming here 
every year for 27 years. It’s friendly, it’s welcoming, and you get great food 
and skiing. Why would I want to go anywhere else?”

Mountain lowdown
There are three gondolas: the Pöglbahn and Wiedersbergerhornbahn for the 
Alpbachtal side, and the gondola up to the Schatzberg, the highest peak on the 
Wildschönau side at 1,898m. Lifts are fast with short queues, and pistes are 
well-marked and generally quiet. And once you get up the mountain, there’s a 
diversity of options: there are steeper slopes on the Alpbachtal side and the 
more cruisey Wildshönau side is good for leisurely afternoons, with nursery 
slopes, jump parks and cross-country routes. The pistes at Reith are floodlit 
three times a week.

The area is best suited to intermediate skiers. Some of the 78km of reds are 
fantastic, offering descents of almost 1km from peak to valley floor. But 
skiers should bear in mind that what’s classed as a red on the Alpbachtal side 
is considered a black across the valley. There’s a handful of black runs (18km 
in total) under the Wiedersbergerhorn. Book skiing or snowboarding lessons with
Skischule Alpbach <http://skischule-alpbach.at/>. A good place to hire 
equipment isConny’s <http://www.connys.at/> in the village.

And apart from skiing? 
There’s about 70km of walking tracks, including a panoramic trail along both 
sides of the valley, passing waterfalls, woods and farmhouses.

Après any good? 
You won’t be dancing on tabletops, but Alpbach’s après ski is lively enough 
<http://www.ultimate-ski.com/ski-resorts/austria/tirol/alpbach/bars-restaurants.aspx>
. Head off the slopes to bars such as Umbrella Six orJoe’s Salettl 
<http://www.joes-salettl.at/>, or to friendly village bars like Post Alm 
<http://www.postalm-alpbach.at/> or the Jakober 
<http://www.gasthof-jakober.at/en/restaurant/> Irish pub, which have live music 
evenings, orWaschkuchl <https://www.facebook.com/waschkuchl.bar> for Wednesday 
karaoke.

Where to eat
Restaurants in the village are affordable. Böglalm 
<https://www.facebook.com/Boeglalm> is a cosy mountain hut famous for its 
spit-roasted chicken that you have to order 24 hours in advance andGröstl, an 
Austrian hash of beef or bacon fried in a huge iron pan with herbs and 
potatoes. Higher up,Hornboden <http://www.hornboden.at/hbneu/index.php> has a 
panoramic sun terrace and, on the Schatzberg side, popularGipfö Hit 
<http://www.gipfoehit.at/> serves traditional Tyrolean dishes such as Knödel (
spinach dumplings),Käsespätzle (cheesy noodles), and Germknödel, a sweet yeast 
dumpling. Walk up the mountain behind Alpbach to the Zottahof restaurant for
Kaiserschmarrn – torn strips of sweet omelette served with stewed fruit and 
washed down with fresh farm milk. It’s a rustic meal that sums up Alpbach’s 
retro charm.
