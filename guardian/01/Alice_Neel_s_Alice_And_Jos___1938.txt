Him and her



In this pastel drawing, the great American portraitist Alice Neel depicts 
herself in bed with then-boyfriend José Santiago, a Puerto Rican 
singer-guitarist she met in Greenwich Village.

Dead pretty

The influence of Egon Schiele’s gothic sexuality and sinuous line is writ 
large: Neel’s a fiery-haired waif while Santiago’s spiky limbs and big quiff 
echo the Austrian expressionist’s self-portraits.

Early days

Schiele’s rotten beauty is in place. Yet Neel is yet to develop the 
warts-and-all candour she later showed in works such as her depiction of a 
half-nudeAndy Warhol <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol>.

The space between us

With their eyes closed, the lovers are distant from each other, and us. They 
might be paper cut-outs, brought haphazardly together. This detachment is 
typical of Neel’s pictures of José who, whether strumming his guitar or 
post-coitus, remains impenetrable.

Neighbourhood watch

After meeting José, Neel ditched the bohemianism of the Village for Spanish 
Harlem. The portraits she made of her neighbours there proved a major 
breakthrough.
