This book starts off with Mel, whose best friends are books. She prefers books 
to people and has never actually had a friend and never felt the need of one. 
Well, you could call her anti-social.

She never wanted to show Imogen, the new girl, around and actually have to 
talk to her. But her teacher chose her, since he wanted her to socialise.

After being with her for a while Mel actually liked her but found something 
strange about Imogen, and had the urge to find out what fairytale gift or curse 
she had.

I think Mel is a determined person and would do anything to find what she 
needs but on the other hand, Imogen was a secretive, quiet girl who had a world 
of her own.

I think the story of the book was interesting, and actually very realistic.
Because the author has written a unique yet simple book, I recommend all ages 
to read it.
