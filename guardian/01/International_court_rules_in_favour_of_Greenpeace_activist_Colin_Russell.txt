Greenpeace <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace> ship is feeling 
vindicated after an international court ruled in his favour.

Colin Russell was held in a Russian prison after the Dutch-flagged Arctic

2013 and the 30 Greenpeace activists and journalists were detained.

The permanent court of arbitration has found “the Netherlands is entitled to 
compensation with interest for material damage to the Arctic Sunrise”, the 
Hague-based body said in a statement on Monday.

It is unclear if the crew is also entitled to compensation.

“I said all along I haven’t done anything wrong,” Russell said on Tuesday.

He and the rest of the “dirty, old, bloody hippies running round trying to 
protest” Arctic oil drilling spent two months in jail before being given 
amnesty.

“I suffered a little bit; I’m still recovering in a way,” he said.
“It’s still pretty fresh in my mind, and I’ve also said on the international 
stage I’m vindicated, but inRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> 
it’s still written down that I was given amnesty for a crime I didn’t commit.”

Emma Gibson, of Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said the protest against the 
Russian state-owned oil giant Gazprom took place well outside Russia’s 
territorial waters.

“This ruling shows that governments cannot act with impunity against groups 
like Greenpeace, and against civil society,” Gibson said.

The activists – who became known as the “Arctic 30” – were initially accused 
of piracy, a charge later changed to hooliganism, and detained for two months, 
before being bailed and then benefiting from a Kremlin-backed amnesty.

“Governments are not elected to go out and be the police, the armed guards of 
the fossil fuel industry,”  Russell said.

Russia did not take part in the arbitration hearing.
