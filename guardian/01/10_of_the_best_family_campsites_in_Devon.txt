Caffyns Farm, Lynton

A Cool Camping favourite, Caffyns Farm is a relaxed, rule-free, 
pitch-wherever-you-fancy site. A campfire culture is encouraged and made even 
more magical as you're surrounded by expansive countryside and views out over 
the Bristol Channel. Campers are free to wander over any of the 150 acres of 
farmland, which is some of the flattest in this undulating area of Exmoor – all 
the better for pitching. It's an irresistible spot for kids who are hooked on 
riding and beach days, too, with pony trekking right from the farm's own 
stables and walks down to the stunning beach down at Lee Bay.

Devon Yurt, Kelly, near Lifton
 Devon Yurt, Kelly, near Lifton 
Yurt life on the edge of Dartmoor comes with a sleigh bed under the stars, a 
wood-fired bath with a view and a ride-on tractor for budding farmers. It's the 
little things that make this place special: the fire ready-prepared, freshly 
laid eggs for breakfast, the veg and herb garden and home-baked rainy-day 
cakes. After all, how many campsites have you stayed in where rain is something 
you actually look forward to?

Runnage Farm, Postbridge, near Yelverton
 Runnage Farm, Postbridge, near Yelverton 
Runnage Farm is in the heart of the rolling Dartmoor moorland. There are no 
pitches or hook-ups, just two fields next to the river, where campers are free 
to do as they please. Kids can enjoy running around in this magical wilderness, 
playing Poohsticks in the river, looking at the horses and splashing about in 
the stream before settling down to toast marshmallows over the campfire. Any 
grown-ups who were feeling slightly frazzled can unwind to the tranquil sounds 
of rural peace and calming, flowing water. Be aware that kids need to be 
supervised because of the stream and small lake.

Highfield Farm, Topsham
 Highfield Farm, Topsham 
Pitch up in this organic farm's large, flat camping field and you'll enjoy a 
vista of the vale that stretches all the way to the far Blackdown Hills. The 
Cool Camping: Kids guide highlights the great half-mile nature trail that means 
you can take in the River Clyst without ever having to leave the farm. A 
two-acre organic kitchen garden behind the campsite means you don't have to 
leave the farm to buy raspberries, asparagus, strawberries, squash and much 
more besides when in season. The fields are full of barley or traditional 
British breeds of cattle. And when you do venture out, a short walk will take 
you to the River Exe, whose mud flats play host to more birds than you can 
shake a stork at.
• Clyst Road, 01392 876388, highfieldfarm.org <http://www.highfieldfarm.org/>. 
Two adults £8-£10, £1 for each extra person. Open all year

 Coombe View Farm, Branscombe, near Seaton 
This relaxed site consists of a sloping field with lovely views over a 
patchwork of greens and, to your left, you can see the sea. It's an 
understated, quiet place that emanates a traditional, rural vibe. When not at 
the beach, you can take a trip to Sidmouth to pet donkeys and enjoy the 
picturesque countryside around theDonkey Sanctuary 
<http://www.thedonkeysanctuary.org.uk/>; spend a day at Pecorama 
<http://www.pecorama.info/> to marvel at their toy trains; or head underground 
atBeer Quarry Caves <http://www.beerquarrycaves.co.uk/>. And when the sun goes 
down, the village'sMason's Arms <http://www.masonsarms.co.uk/> pub is just the 
spot for lashings of ginger beer beside the roaring log fire.

Cloud Farm, Oare, nr Brendon
 Cloud Farm, Oare, nr Brendon 
Sitting pretty in its own self-contained hamlet surrounded by the purple haze 
of the famed Doone Valley, Cloud Farm's campsite occupies a prize riverside 
setting alongside Badgworthy Water. Kids spend hours in the river, spotting 
fish, skimming stones and even managing a little doggy-paddle in the deeper 
pools. Parents are happy to just lounge about on the banks in the summer 
sunshine and marvel at the valley's walls of gold and green flecked with 
unmistakable Exmoor heather.

Roadford Lake, Okehampton
 Photograph: Alamy 
This site is dedicated to watery pursuits – hardly surprising given its 
situation, right on the shore of a lake stretching across nearly 730 acres of 
mid-Devon. There are boatloads of opportunities for campers to immerse 
themselves in outdoor activities – either on the water in kayaks, canoes, 
dinghies, and whizzing about on water skis; or around the water's edge with 
walks, cycling and bridleways.

Craft and equipment can be hired or campers can bring their own. Private 
tuition and taster courses are also on offer at the friendly on-site centre.

The site has about 100 pitches, but they're spread across a number of small 
fields broken up by tall hedges to give them a more intimate feel. Aim for the 
field next to the lake, which offers a fantastic panorama across the water.
• 01409 211507, swlakestrust.org.uk/leisure-activities/camping/roadford-lake 
<http://www.swlakestrust.org.uk/leisure-activities/camping/roadford-lake>. Two 
adults £13-£15, children £3-£4, under-5s free. Open March-October

Trill Farm, Axminster
 Trill Farm, Axminster, Devon 
Set right on the border of Dorset and east Devon, this family-friendly farm is 
on a mission to teach sustainable living skills to the world. The Trill Trust 
was set up as a charity by Romy Fraser, the founder of Neal's Yard Remedies, 
and only accepts large groups. If you can get together with a couple of other 
families, and you're all prepared to look after yourselves camping-wise (the 
staff are more concerned with the farm than campers) – and if (last codicil) 
there is space – then you will be very welcome.

The campsite itself has a central firepit, and you can pick your own food from 
the sizeable vegetable gardens. You're free to explore and to help out anywhere 
you like, from feeding the animals and cider-making to collecting eggs.

There are also courses in subjects as esoteric as identifying bat calls or 
sustainable waste water treatment and of course, yoga. Not your usual holiday 
for sure. But that's probably why it's so attractive.
• Musbury, 01297 631113, trillfarm.co.uk <http://trillfarm.co.uk/>. Groups of 
10 or more only, adults £6, under-16s £3, under-3s free. Open July-September

The Wood Life, Kenn
 Wood Life tent, Devon 
A safari-style tent in a clearing in a secluded wood in a secret location, 
somewhere in Devon … and all of it to yourself. Pitched on a wooden deck, with 
a picturebook chestnut fence out front, it is the very image of tranquillity. 
There are armchairs, a sofa and a wood-burning stove in the kitchen – but you 
can cook outside on the open fire too.

Kids will love the treehouse and swing. In late April and May, the floor of 
the wood is carpeted with bluebells, and if you're patient, you might just spot 
badgers, foxes, deer, plus a wide range of birds from woodpeckers to owls. 
Beyond the trees there is a lot to do and see, with Exeter a mere five-mile 
drive away, but you probably won't want to budge, as you sink into the simple 
life.
• 01392 832509, thewoodlife.org <http://thewoodlife.org/>. Sleeps six, from 
£395 for a three-night break (not available in peak season), to £1,150 for a 
week. Open April-October

Mount Folly Farm, Bigbury

A refreshing antidote to the all-singing, all-dancing "holiday parks" that 
monopolise huge swaths of the West Country with their regimented ranks of 
caravans, clubhouses and swimming pools, Mount Folly is a working farm offering 
low-key, rustic camping.

What it lacks in frills, it more than makes up for in location, in an area of 
outstanding natural beauty with staggering coastal views over Bigbury bay. It's 
just 100m from theSouth West Coast Path <http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/>, 
and a 10-minute walk will take you to the sandy beach at Bigbury-on-Sea, which 
is popular with surfers. At low tide you can walk across the causeway to Burgh 
Island and enjoy a Devon cream tea at the imposingart deco hotel 
<http://www.burghisland.com/about_us_1.html>, which was a popular haunt of 
Agatha Christie. At high tide the "sea tractor" ferries visitors to and fro.
• 01548 810267, bigburyholidays.co.uk <http://bigburyholidays.co.uk/>. Adults 
£5, children 10-15 £2.50, minimum pitch cost £10. Open all year
