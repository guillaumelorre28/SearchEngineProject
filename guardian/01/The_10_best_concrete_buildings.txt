possibly by Apollodorus of Damascus, c126 AD

The ancient Romans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/23/10-best-ancient-romans-mary-beard>
 didn’t have reinforced concrete (that is, strengthened with steel) but they 
had concrete, and used it to such heart-stopping effect on the Pantheon that no 
one has really been able to match it since. The true moment of genius is the 
way in which, after a certain amount of harrumphing withCorinthian columns 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/10/identify-roman-orders-architecture>
 and marble decoration at its lower levels, the design resolves itself into the 
pure circular oculus at its top, unglazed, which causes a beam of light to rake 
around the interior like an internalised sun.

Le Corbusier, 1952

Concrete has the ability to be primitive and technological, massive and 
levitating, to combine the properties of steel with those of mud.Le Corbusier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/apr/30/le-corbusier-the-man-the-modernist-the-nudist-in-pictures>
 knew how to run the gamut of its expressive range better than anyone. He used 
it as the medium for translating his fascinations both with aeroplanes and 
other modern machines and with ancient landscapes and temples. His Unité 
d’Habitation, a massive apartment building in Marseille, is both a liner 
floated to its site from the nearby Mediterranean and a chunk of the 
surrounding mountains, rectangularised, ark andArarat

Félix Candela 
<https://www.architecture.com/WhatsOn/September2015/TheShellBuilder.aspx>, 1958

Many architects and engineers have exploited the ability of reinforced 
concrete to produce structures of exceptional apparent lightness which, despite 
being made of a form of masonry, hardly seem to touch the ground. Quite a few 
have used arches and vaults in the form of parabolas, which direct the 
structural forces inside the material with particular efficiency, which makes 
the structure lighter still. Félix Candela was one of the earliest and best to 
pursue these ideas. The anti-gravity effects of the Los Manantiales restaurant 
were particularly magical.

 Bank of London and South America, Buenos Aires… ‘creates both enclosure and 
openness’. 
4 | Bank of London and South America, Buenos Aires

Clorindo Testa, 1966

 The Italian-Argentinian architect Clorindo Testa 
<http://www.architectural-review.com/rethink/clorindo-testa-1923-2013/8647159.fullarticle>
 wasn’t particularly interested in getting concrete to look light, at least 
from the outside, instead heaving it out of the ground into an extraordinary 
structure that has something of a dinosaur’s skeleton. Yet it still manages to 
achieve a civilised rapport with the neo-classical facades around it. It also 
forms a perforated carapace that filters sunlight to the interior and creates 
both enclosure and openness. It unexpectedly ends up having some of the 
qualities of a Japanese screen, if with considerable added tonnage.

Anatole de Baudot, 1904 (interior)

A slightly gauche attempt to realise the principles of gothic architecture in 
reinforced concrete but at the same time endearing and heroic. The church was 
sufficiently ahead of its time that building codes hadn’t caught up, which 
meant construction had to be delayed while a demolition order was removed. De 
Baudot didn’t quite work out that you can achieve gothic lightness of 
construction without gothic details such as pointed arches and vaults. Auguste 
Perret would later do this with the radiantNotre Dame du Raincy 
<https://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/france/raincy/perret.html>, but 
Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre makes the list by virtue of being a pioneer.

, 1986 (sports towers)

 A swimming pool, indoor football pitches and other sports courts are stacked 
up in the fattest of this group of three towers; changing rooms are in another, 
linked by dynamic bridges, which transforms the normally humdrum movement from 
cubicle to playing zone into urban theatre. The third, cylindrical, tower 
stores water. Knowing that a change of political wind could blow away socially 
minded projects like this, Bo Bardi made it fortress-like: a citadel of 
liberty, it was called. Thewindow openings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/25/the-10-best-windows>, which 
seem punched out by a caveman, are amazing.

is one of the less declamatory and more subtle contemporary architects, which 
makes this moment of theatre all the more striking. He takes a sheet of 
concrete and drops it like a pocket handkerchief between two rectangular 
blocks. The special properties of reinforced concrete, in particular its 
abilities to hang as well as vault, and achieve high strengths with minimal 
thickness, are used to the full. A classic of making design look effortless, 
when the engineering and construction that goes into it is anything but.

images, selected by the artistThomas Ruff

, on to the material. The same images were also printed on horizontal bands of 
glass, set flush with the concrete, which by day gives the library’s simple 
oblong shape an apparently homogeneous surface. By night the transparent parts 
light up and the solid parts don’t, which creates an opposite impression.

Marcel Breuer, 1961

A rare error in the smooth-running 10 best machine allows a late entry, a 
church by the Bauhaus alumnus Marcel Breuer deep in the midwest that makes many 
tonnes of concrete into mineral origami. I am indebted to a reader, Rolf 
Erikson, for pointing this project out. Fans of Louis Kahn clamouring for his 
inclusion won’t be pleased, though. Kahn was indeed magnificent and it was a 
tough call to leave him out. But the Breuer is more concrete-y.

substance, and where the traces of the timber moulds of its concrete give it 
the feeling of an unusually exalted wooden shack.
