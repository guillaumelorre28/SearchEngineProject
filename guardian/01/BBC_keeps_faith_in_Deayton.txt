The BBC has signalled its faith in the presenter Angus Deayton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/angus-deayton>, pressing ahead with 
plans to screen his traditional Christmas Before They Were Famous show.

The pre-recorded show will be his first appearance on TV since lost his job as 
host of satirical show Have I Got News for You. It was filmed a couple of weeks 
ago, after the scandals were revealed in tabloid newspapers.

The move demonstrates that the BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> 
retains some faith in Deayton's acceptability as a TV presenter after removing 
him from HIGNFY when jokes about his private life threatened to take over the 
programme.

But it has not yet been decided whether to give the celebrity clips show its 
traditional peak time Christmas Day slot, according to a BBC spokeswoman.

"The show has already been recorded and will be going out at some time over 
the Christmas period. It is not always broadcast on Christmas Day," she said.

The BBC also confirmed that HIGNFY had a secure future with the corporation 
and will have a new permanent presenter for the next series.

Two new series of the show, which stars Paul Merton and Ian Hislop, have been 
commissioned from Hat Trick Productions, added the BBC spokeswoman.

"We do plan to appoint a permanent presenter. Hat Trick will draw up a 
shortlist when this series ends (on December 20) and then in consultation with 
the BBC someone will be appointed before the next series starts in the spring," 
she said.

There had been speculation the BBC would continue rotating guest presenters - 
such as John Sergeant, Boris Johnson and Anne Robinson - instead of appointing 
a permanent successor to Deayton, who earned Â£50,000 an episode.
