British officials have held peace talks with the 4x100m squad in a bid to end 
the acrimony between some sprinters affecting the chances of relay gold in the
Commonwealth Games <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/commonwealth-games> and 
European Championships.

The problems between the two training groups – one coached by Rana Reider and 
the other by Steve Fudge – were laid bare by world indoor 60m champion, Richard 
Kilty,who admitted on Friday that relations were "not friendly" and there had 
been "a clash of egos"

 that spilled over at their shared training camp in Loughborough and at the UK 
Indoor Championships in Sheffield.

Officials declined to comment directly on the rumours that two athletes had 
wrestled each other in the warm-up area at the UK Indoor Championships but a 
spokeswoman insisted that all parties had been already brought together and the 
situation had been resolved.

Meanwhile, the Paralympic T44 gold medallist Jonnie Peacock, who trains with 
Fudge's group at Loughborough, insisted that his coach "had the best three 
sprinters in the UK in James Dasaolu,Adam Gemili 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-gemili> and Chris Clarke".

"We always keep ourselves to ourselves," he added. "We are down our end of the 
track. We never provoked anything."
