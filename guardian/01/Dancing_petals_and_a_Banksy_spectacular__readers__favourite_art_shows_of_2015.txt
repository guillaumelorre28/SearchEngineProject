A Victorian Obsession 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/13/london-house-host-billionaire-private-collection-victorian-art>
Leighton House, London

A wonderful collection of the best of Victorian art, brought over from the US 
and staged in the home of one of the best of Victorian painters.Raymond Burt 


Beautiful paintings that made me cry! Now when does a painting ever make a 
person weep? :)Juliette Hettema 

An interesting exhibition in fantastic surroundings. Not only for your eyes 
and ears, but your nose, too! Extraordinary indeed.Eva Hedberg-Borenstein 

A beautiful, uniquely displayed exhibition – especially the room of the 
scented roses. I went three times.Rosemary Wilmot 

I particularly enjoyed the Pérez Simón collection, as I discovered the work of 
Lawrence Alma-Tadema and the impressiveThe Roses of Heliogabalus 
<https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/museums/leightonhousemuseum/avictorianobsession/background/exhibitionhighlights.aspx>
, with the vivid petals dancing in the air. Although his work can seem quite 
academic and classical, I thought the way he approached the topics of his 
paintings and how he connected the spectator with his art were extremely well 
done.Matthieu Beignet

Amazing paintings shown in an atmospheric setting. This exhibition was so 
wonderful that I travelled from the Midlands to see it.Susan Lupton

A truly stupendous exhibition, grappling with hugely pertinent issues – free 
speech, the surveillance state and cultural history. As the UK fosters an 
increasingly close relationship with China, we need to be clear about the 
nature of our new bedfellows. I was particularly struck by the young Chinese 
people at the exhibition – there were quite a few of them when I visited, and 
they were enthralled. This is something they would never see in China, and it 
was clearly something they connected to and considered important.Johanna K 
Reades

Such a powerful, moving experience, with wonderful concepts beautifully 
realised. It was a creative and effective indictment of a state’s abuse of the 
individual and the community. This is contemporary art at its very, very best, 
as far as I am concerned.Kyria Conner 

I chose to see the Ai Weiwei exhibition because his art was interesting. Then 
I found out the story behind it, which gives it more power and emotion. It 
makes you realise how powerful art is when it begins to look like the only 
thing the Chinese government can do toAi Weiwei 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei> is ignore him – as 
anything they do directly to him makes him more powerful because of his art. K

This gets my vote because the exhibition had art, fashion, music, design and 
creativity, incorporated multimedia and was incredibly displayed. I had no idea 
how innovative and cutting edge Alexander McQueen’s fashion shows were, or his 
dark side, which was evident in some of his designs. I came away from the show 
enlightened and totally blown away. Brilliant!Bozenna Borzyskowska

 Mornington Crescent, 1965, by Frank Auerbach. 
I went to art college in 1957. My main subject was painting, and I discovered 
the work of Francis Bacon and Frank Auerbach – eureka moments. So it is not 
surprising that I rate this exhibition the bestsince Bacon in 2008
