Nigeria left-back Taye Taiwo scored with a stunning free-kick in the 85th 
minute to give the Super Eagles a 1-0 win over Ghana in their opening African 
Nations Cup match.

Taiwo, who was close with a similar effort in the first half of the Group D 
match, blasted a left-foot effort into the bottom corner from around 30 metres 
just as the game appeared to be petering out into a draw.

Both teams hit the post in an even and entertaining match in which Ghana 
became the third of the continent's five World Cup finalists to lose their 
first game, alongside Togo and Angola. The Black Stars missed an excellent 
chance in the 70th minute when forward Matthew Amoah headed wide from six 
metres.
