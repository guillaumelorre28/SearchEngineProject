Australia faces air transport chaos after ash from Chile's Cordón Caulle 
volcano shut the country's busiest airports.

Thousands of travellers were stranded after Qantas cancelled all domestic 
flights in and out of Sydney,Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> and Canberra on Tuesday 
afternoon, until at least Thursday. International flights have also been 
affected, with all Qantas planes due to land on Wednesday diverted or delayed 
until Thursday.

Virgin has also cancelled flights out of Sydney and Melbourne until further 
notice. "The ash plume is at a very low level and we're not comfortable flying 
at those levels," said Virgin Australia spokeswoman Danielle Keighery.

The ash cloud from the volcano is circling Earth for a second time, after last 
weekdelaying about 700 flights across Australia and New Zealand

Passengers have been using whatever means possible to get to their 
destinations. Extra bus services have been put on, while three men paid a taxi 
driver A$1,200 (£770) to drive them for 10 hours from Melbourne to Sydney.

The bureau of meteorology's volcanic ash advisory centre says the plume has 
travelled more than 2,500 miles (4,000km) in the past 24 hours and is "clearly 
visible on satellite imagery". It is hovering at between 5 and 8 miles.

Hundreds of thousands of passengers have been disrupted across the country, 
according to Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority. "When you take out 
major centres like Sydney and Melbourne, the knock-on effects of that are huge 
and that's unfortunate, but safety has to come first," said its spokesman, 
Peter Gibson.
