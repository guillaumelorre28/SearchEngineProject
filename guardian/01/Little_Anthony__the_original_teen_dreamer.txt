"The first time I heard Little Anthony and the Imperials was back in the late 
50s, when I listened to American Forces Network, the radio station for US bases 
in Britain. I lived in the Midlands and there were big American bases there, so 
my mum and dad mixed with GIs and they'd bring us records from their jukeboxes 
too. Little Anthony and the Imperials seemed fantastic. I liked Frankie Lymon 
and the Teenagers, and they were a more modern version of that.

"I have every Little Anthony single. They seemed exotic. You can't imagine the 
impact of hearing them at that time.They were so different from what else I was 
listening to – Marty Wilde, Cliff Richard – it was almost like listening to the 
Sex Pistols for the first time. Their records were more down to earth than 
English records, which were still flowery and prim and proper.Theytalked about 
relationships <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAVWiT8whgk> in a way that a kid 
related to more than 'We're all going on a summer holiday'. The name Little 
Anthony and the Imperials sounded cool, sounded real. And it was cool to like 
American things in the late 50s.

"Kylie sang Tears on my Pillow, and it's a great song, naive but truthful. The 
songs stand up. They were written about teenagers from a specific place and 
time. That's what I tried to create in the 80s because I felt there was a 
generation of kids not being catered to, musically.I wanted to emulate those 
doo-wop songs, because they spoke to me."
