Just as the Glastonbury festival doesn't actually take place in Glastonbury, 
Woodstock didn't happen inWoodstock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/woodstock>, either. The festival in Bethel, 
New York, took its name from a small town 43 miles away, where musicians such 
as Bob Dylan, the Band and Van Morrison began to congregate in the late 60s, 
as hippies left the cities.

The idea was to stage an Aquarian gathering of the tribes. The reality 
involved semi-amateur promoters, ticketless hordes, rain, mud, no toilets, an 
outbreak of hepatitis and food shortages. On the scale of one to Altamont, of 
course, the carnage at Woodstock was small beer. As the acrid notes of Jimi 
Hendrix's deconstruction of the Star Spangled Banner faded, and the sun rose 
and the dust cleared, the lows were swiftly forgotten. Half a million people 
managed to enjoy an impressive cross-section of the bands of the era and go 
skinny dipping in a lake without anyone, seemingly, even having their best 
purple flares nicked. The financial reality? Warner Brothers bailed out the 
documentary of the festival, which in turn bailed out the organisers, who ended 
up $1.4m (£865,000) in debt.
