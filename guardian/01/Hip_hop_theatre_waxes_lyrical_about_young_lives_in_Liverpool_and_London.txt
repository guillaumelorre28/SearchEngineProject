Theatre’s lack of diversity is no secret. But how can we create a level 
playing field in an age of austerity, when internships go unpaid, arts and 
drama are often sidelined in education and, in certain cases, young people must 
pay for the privilege of auditioning at drama school?

It sometimes feels like we are in a cul-de sac in terms of the stories that 
are being told and who tells them, and the new theatre forms that are nurtured. 
One way to get out of it is to invest in youth theatre and young people as 
artists – and perhaps, in the process, develop new forms of theatre.

I am passionate about youth theatre as a training ground. I was lucky enough 
to be part ofLiverpool Everyman’s youth theatre 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyman_and_Playhouse_Youth_Theatre> in the 
1980s. A mash-up of ravers, Smiths quiffs, goths and misfits, we didn’t have to 
audition and we didn’t pay, and we valued it more than anything. Together, we 
were a true reflection of the city and its stories and struggles. It was a time 
of protest, we were the poll tax generation, and the political plays on the 
theatre’s main stage influenced us. We thought we could change the world.

The Everyman was the first rung on the ladder for me. I soon left Liverpool 
and learned my craft as an actor with companies that had diversity at their 
heart:Red Ladder <http://www.redladder.co.uk/>, Graeae <http://www.graeae.org/>,
Cardboard Citizens <http://cardboardcitizens.org.uk/>, Contact 
<http://contactmcr.com/>, Theatre Royal Stratford East 
<http://www.stratfordeast.com/> and Breaking Cycles.

Ten years ago, inspired by the creative and political ambitions of these 
companies, I came back home to Liverpool and set up my own theatre company,20 
Stories High <http://www.20storieshigh.org.uk/>, with my partner Julia Samuels. 
It’s a theatre company for 13 to 25-year-olds which is on a mission to make 
work that is socially inclusive and accessible. We believe that everybody’s got 
a story to tell – and their own way of telling it.

 Behind the scenes of The Broke’n’Beat Collective 
We realised that a lot of young people feel theatre and drama are alien to 
them. Our plan was simple. We put up signs in shop windows asking young people 
if they were interested in rapping, singing, breakdancing and drama. We soon 
found 30 young emerging or fully fledged artists keen to create something new 
and express themselves. Three weeks in, they realised that what we were making 
was a new kind of theatre, and they were hooked.

When making theatre based on young people’s experiences, we often start with 
the same questions: what’s good and what’s hard about being a young person in 
your community? The answers constantly change and yet feel universal. We have 
made plays about compulsory purchase orders, sexuality and religion, knife 
crime, abortion, racist attacks and parents with addictions. These topics 
reflect the challenges faced by the young people we work with, and we want to 
raise awareness of their experiences while using humour and offering hope. We 
also work in partnership with youth services and a support worker, to help with 
the multitude of issues that young people seek help for.

It was always our mission to be a megaphone for young people’s stories. 
However, one thing that took us by surprise was young people’s energetic 
commitment to playing with form. We began to introduce puppetry into our 
hip-hop theatre, and after 10 years of development, this new form has fully 
blossomed and can be seen in our latest production, The Broke’n’Beat 
Collective, a co-production with the London-basedTheatre Rites 
<http://www.theatre-rites.co.uk/>, co-written and co-directed by me and Sue 
Buckmaster.

The Broke'n'Beat Collective review – teen dramas told with puppets and poetry

 We share the stories of young people we have worked with in Liverpool and 
London – the common themes being exam pressure, unemployment, not having enough 
money and feeling isolated. Two vastly different cities were connected by the 
voices and opinions of their young people. The research for the production was 
begun just before the last general election, and within both groups there was 
fierce debate about the political system. Many of the young artists felt
completely disenfranchised <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/voterapathy> 
and there was a complete lack of faith in the democratic system, but there were 
also many who had been inspired byJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> and were keen to fight 
back.

So how could we tell these stories in a way that would attract what is 
traditionally the most cynical audience? How could we offer something new? Many 
young people know about hip-hop, dance and beatboxing. Not many have seen these 
forms fused with puppetry.

While I was looking at stories, Sue looked at the objects in the rehearsal 
room: a hoody, a notebook full of lyrics, a cardboard dance mat and a boombox. 
These became the puppets that would tell the stories. The hood became Omar, a 
young man who was fed up of being seen as nothing but a hoodrat. The paper 
became Paper Girl, a young woman who has suffered abuse and finds solace in a 
pair of scissors when she self harms. The cardboard became Jack in the Box, a 
teenage father deciding which way to go, and the boombox became a giant art toy 
having an internal political debate with himself.

Not everybody understands it, but that’s OK. The majority of the young people 
who have watched it see themselves represented on the stage – and in a 
completely different way. And they want to get involved not only in our hip-hop 
theatre workshops, but also puppetry.

It all goes back to participation. If we subsidise and invest in culturally 
and socially diverse young people as theatre participants, makers and 
audiences, then we might just be able to reverse the reactionary, risk-averse 
trend that is narrowing the voices that are heard, the faces that are seen, the 
forms that are experienced and the spectrum of audiences who are coming to 
theatres.
