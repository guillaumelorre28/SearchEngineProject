Elena Baltacha <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/elena-baltacha>, the British 
No1, scored her second victory of the WTA season by coming from a set and a 
break down to beat Arantxa Rus of the Netherlands 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the first 
round of the BNP Paribas Masters in Indian Wells. The Scot, ranked No62 in the 
world, came from a break down in the final set and will next play the No14 
seed, Julia Goerges of Germany.

However, Anne Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong>, 
the British No2, suffered a disappointing defeat to Switzerland's Timea 
Bacsinszky. She lost 6-4, 2-6, 7-5 to an opponent who was playing only her 
second tour match in 12 months. The 22-year-old had suffered a foot injury 
which led to her tumbling from the top 50 to No335.

Bacsinszky showed no ill effects in a match lasting two hours 19 minutes and 
notable for 14 breaks of serve, holding her nerve in the deciding set to see 
off her 28-year-old opponent.
