 Andy Duncan has moved back closer to media. The former chief executive of 
Channel 4 will be helping with the numbers at Camelot after the lottery 
operator appointed Duncan in a new role as UK managing director. Long-time 
Camelot boss Dianne Thompson described Duncan as an "instinctive marketer" – 
that'd be the17 years at Unilever 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/16/andy-duncan-channel-4> which 
included mastering the art of "yellow fats" marketing for products such as I 
Can't Believe It's Not Butter – with "undoubted flair". The flair in question 
is probably not a reference to his decision tosport jeans and a polo shirt

 to defend Big Brother over the Shilpa Shetty racism row. "Under Andy's 
leadership Camelot will contrinue to deliver responsible and sustainable growth 
for the National Lottery," she added. The good news is that with Camelot's 
"all-time high" ticket sales of £5.8bn in the year to 31 March and monopoly in 
the marketplace there is almost no chance of a Channel 4-style 
multi-hundred-million pound funding gap looming on the balance sheet. Go easy 
on the lobbying Andy this time around.
