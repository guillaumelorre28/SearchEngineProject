Wonderful to hear from you, Sheherazad.

To answer your questions:

We hope for an hour-long interview, in the first days of December if possible.

The interview will be broadcast across ABC News platforms – including World 
News, Good Morning America, This Week, ABC Radio, a full edition of Nightline, 
and full-length treatment across the digital space (for ABC News this now 
includes Yahoo as well –which means you can reach as many as 100 million 
people. ABC News and Yahoo recently joined forces – which is another reason why 
so many people now bring their interviews to us).

The exact dates/times for all these broadcasts depends on when the interview 
is done. When it was scheduled for November 13 we had planned to begin the 
broadcasts on our return to New York two days later (would have been today, 
actually), along with release of the full interview.

Once again, if you have any follow-up questions you can call me anytime.

All the best and please be in touch.

Tom
