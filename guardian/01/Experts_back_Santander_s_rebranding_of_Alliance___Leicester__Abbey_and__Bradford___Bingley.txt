Replacing Bradford & Bingley's dis­tinctive bowler hat logo with a Santander 
coffee cup may not play well in Yorkshire, but experts say most consumers will 
be ­relaxed about the change.

The Spanish bank's other high street names, Abbey and Alliance & Leicester, 
will also trade as Santander, but they are no longer powerful brands in their 
own right. Stephen Cheliotis, chief executive at the Centre for Brand Analysis, 
points out that none featured in the latest Superbrands ­survey, which ranks 
the top 500 UK brands.

The move will cost around £12m, but save far more in the long term, ­making it 
easier and cheaper for Santander to roll out global advertising campaigns.

The same commercial logic lies behind other name changes in different 
industries. Hence the household cleaning product Jif became Cif and Marathon 
chocolate bars became Snickers in the UK.

But corporate hubris has prompted some disastrous rebranding decisions, most 
famously when British Airways retained its name but removed its Union Jack logo 
from tailfins.

The Royal Mail's decision to rename itself Consignia was roundly criticised, 
and was quickly reversed. So too was ­auditing firm PricewaterhouseCooper's 
announcement that its consultancy arm would be named after the least ­favourite 
day of the week – Monday.

Accountancy group Arthur Andersen became Accenture months after its role in 
the Enron ­scandal ­damaged its good name beyond repair and it has since 
prospered, but ­commercial considerations are not always the overriding factor.

"There is an element of ego in all this," Cheliotis said. "I'm sure some of 
the head ­honchos in Spain want to be able to get off a plane anywhere in the 
world and see their logo."
