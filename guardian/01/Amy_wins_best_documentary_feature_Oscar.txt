Amy, Asif Kapadia’s tribute to the jazz and pop singer Amy Winehouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse>, has won the Oscar for best 
documentary feature.

Kapadia’s film examines how Winehouse’s addictions to alcohol and drugs 
intensified in fame’s glare, culminating in her death from alcohol poisoning in 
2011. It was the favourite to win from early on in the awards race, and won the 
top documentary prizes at a clutch of ceremonies, including the Baftas and 
Producers Guild Awards.

Amy, which is the UK’s highest grossing non-fiction film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/06/amy-winehouse-documentary-breaks-records-box-office>
, marks Kapadia’s first Oscar win, from his first nomination. His previous 
film, Senna, about the Brazilian Formula One racing driver, controversially
didn’t make the 2012 shortlist

One person who won’t be celebrating Kapadia’s win is Amy’s father, Mitch. He 
has called Kapadia’s film“a one dimensional, miserable and misleading portrayal 
of Amy” <https://twitter.com/mitchwinehouse/status/698982127061360641>, and has 
contested the film’s portrayal of him exploiting her talent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/01/mitch-winehouse-interview-amy-documentary-film>
. Kapadia and his team have said the film is a fair representation that they 
got of Amy from conducting more than 100 interviews with friends and family.
