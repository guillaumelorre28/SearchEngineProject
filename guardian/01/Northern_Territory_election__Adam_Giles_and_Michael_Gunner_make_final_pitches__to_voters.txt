The Northern Territory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory> is expected to 
see a dramatic change in government on Saturday as voters head to the polls.

Polls opened on Saturday morning but more than a third of eligible voters had 
already cast their ballot. Those living in remote areas had been visited by the 
electoral commission over recent weeks. Others, including the opposition 
leader, Michael Gunner, had taken advantage of short queues at one of the NT’s 
no-excuse-necessary early polling stations.

The two leaders made final pitches in the NT News on Saturday, and Gunner’s 
message called for voters to support Labor’s “positive plans” to restore trust, 
invest in children and grow the economy.

“Over the last four years Territorians have been let down by their 
parliament,” he said. He pledged greater transparency and consultation from a 
Labor government.

On Friday Gunner said would not be drawn on how confident he was personally. 
He said he would work with independents if Labor was forced to form a minority 
government.

The chief minister, Adam Giles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/adam-giles>, told readers the 
choice for voters was “clear”.

“With the future of the Northern Territory at stake who do you trust to manage 
the economy through the great challenges that lie ahead?”

He said Labor was taking the “tired approach” of “more debt, higher deficits 
and increased spending”.

A Labor government will have to find more than $223m in savings to cover all 
its commitments, compared with the CLP’s $21m, but Treasury analysis found both 
parties would reduce net debt – Labor by $18.8m and the CLP by $35.77m – and 
that Labor would deliver a bigger surplus than the CLP by 2020.

Giles repeated past concessions that the CLP government “has not always looked 
pretty” but said mistakes are more likely when enacting difficult change and 
reform.

Giles, expected to vote in his home seat of Braitling, told ABC radio on 
Friday morning he was confident of holding both his seat and government. He 
said the CLP was the only party with an economic plan and that a Labor 
government would guarantee a recession.

The former Labor leader and now independent Delia Lawrie voted early on 
Saturday in Karama and told media it was an opportunity to vote out “the worst 
ever” government in NT history.

The deputy chief minister, Peter Styles, said his government had delivered, 
and people were concerned about jobs. He said when constituents in his suburban 
Darwin seat of Sanderson expressed unhappiness with the government’s disunity 
he asked them to look at what the party had delivered.

“Sure there has been some issues, and some of those people are now going out 
of politics, some of them didn’t get preselected, so they’re going,” he said.

Kezia Purick, the parliamentary speaker who quit the CLP last year, was 
confident of retaining Goyder and said she had faced no backlash for becoming 
an independent.

“People are still cranky at the CLP selling public assests for what they 
believe is no serious reason,” she told Guardian Australia at Bees Creek.

She said planning issues and poor consultation, particularly by the minister, 
David Tollner, were behind rural voter dissatisfaction with the CLP.

“People aren’t naturally inclined out this way to vote for Labor.”

The CLP won office in 2012 with 16 seats but by Saturday a series of scandals 
and resignations had reduced them to a minority government of 12, facing off 
against seven Labor MLAs and six independents.


Predictions for Saturday’s vote only look worse. The NT News’ most recent poll 
<http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/poll-points-to-independents-day-for-nt-election/news-story/18f29496266567dc33e393781b5bd3df>
 reportedly found a two-party preferred vote of 32% compared with Labor’s 64%.

Estimates from pundits and journalists range between one retained seat for the 
CLP up to about eight or nine. Most predictions are for around four or five 
independents, including incumbents Kezia Purick (ex-CLP), Robyn Lambley 
(ex-CLP), Delia Lawrie (ex-Labor), and Gerry Wood.

Law academic and former Labor MLA Ken Parish told Guardian Australia 
Territorians were sick of the disfunction and disunity, in the same way 
national voters felt after federal Labor’s Rudd and Gillard years. But not 
everything was a foregone conclusion because this was such a “unique” election.

There are a lot of unknowns: boundaries have changed and it is the first year 
voters will have optional preferential voting, plus the protection of a 100m 
exclusion zone around booths, preventing parties from campaigning or handing 
out how-to-vote cards.

“It’s really difficult to predict and anyone who tries to do so with purported 
confidence is gilding the lily, and that’s because of the combination of 
optional preferential voting and the ban on handing out how-to-votes within 
100m means that, at least within urban seats, I’m expecting we’ll see something 
close to first past the post.”

Parish said incumbency wasn’t the big advantage it used to be but he 
tentatively predicted CLP members Giles, Bess Price, Willem Westra Van Holthe 
and maybe Lia Finocchiaro and Gary Higgins would keep their seats, and that 
outgoing attorney general John Elferink’s replacement in Port Darwin might also 
be successful.
