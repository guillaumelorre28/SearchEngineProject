Borderline Gallery

Relatively new on the scene, Borderline has already done well to carve out a 
niche for itself with a handful of shows that elicit more of a house party 
vibe, with loud music and cheap drinks, than a typical opening. For example … a 
curated show dubbed "Infoxicated" had flasks designed by more than 50 local 
artists, and another featured painted-over vinyl albums. There are also pop-up 
events such as the summer block parties and artist markets in between.

Living Walls

Founded in 2009 by Monica Campana and Black Li Rudi Migliozzi, non-profit 
organisation Living Walls has worked with academics and city officials to make 
huge strides in turning Atlanta's nondescript public walls and abandoned 
buildings into canvases for local and international street artists and 
muralists.Artist ROA's <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROA_%28artist%29> 
sprawling alligator painting near the 5 Points Marta station,Sam Parker 
<http://sparkerartist.com/>'s cosmic mural on the corner of Randolph and Irwin 
streets and Trek Matthews' geometric fox rendition at 154 Carroll Street are 
just a few popular pieces. Its annual conferences serve to celebrate street art 
by bringing together artists for panels, workshops, screenings, exhibits and 
more - their first conference, in 2012, also served as the first all-female 
street art conference in the world.

Elevate

Culture driving commerce: that's the idea behind Elevate, a project from the 
mayor's office of cultural affairs, which once a year takes over an area of 
downtown for a week and through murals, installations, pop-up galleries and 
performances provides a facelift for unnoticed parts of a neighbourhood. 
Admission is always free and different topics are explored each year (2013's 
theme was dubbed Transit: Time, People and Places), with participation by both 
local and international artists. Plus, in the spirit of Atlanta's progressive 
public transportation initiatives, works can be viewed through Elevate-hosted 
walking, transit and bike tours. Check out past public projects in Old Fourth 
Ward on Edgewood and Auburn Avenues.

The Mammal Gallery

One of the main driving forces behind this recently-opened music venue and art 
space was to bring a colourful burst of life to South Broad, a neighbourhood 
with a lot of unharnessed potential. Officially open since last autumn, Mammal 
is run by Chris Yonker (a member of local bandHello Ocho 
<http://helloocho.bandcamp.com/>) and Brian Egan, who both live in the 
three-storey space, its exterior splashed with murals from mayor-backed arts 
initiative Elevate (see above). In addition to live music and art openings, the 
duo plan to host open-mic nights, film screenings, and video game tournaments.

No event in the city showcases the resurgence of the do-it-yourself art 
movement quite like the Atlanta Zine Fest (AZF). Conceived by Amanda Mills and 
Tracy Soo-Ming, AZF is presented by creative organisationMASS Collective 
<http://masscollective.org/> and the Atlanta Zine Library 
<http://cargocollective.com/atlantazinelibrary>, and aims to be an

vendors' handmade art and media, hear guest speakers and take part in DIY 
workshops. The second annual AZF, slated for summer 2014, will feature panels 
on zine archiving and counterculture, as well as workshops on wood-blocking, 
zine binding, and layouts. In the meantime, browse the Atlanta Zine Library

Art on the BeltLine
 An installation by Never Satisfied on the Belt Line, Atlanta 
It isn't easy to get Atlantans to agree on much but one thing they can find 
accord on is the positive impact of theAtlanta BeltLine 
<http://beltline.org/about/the-atlanta-beltline-project/atlanta-beltline-overview/>
 - the revitalisation of the historic railroad corridor - in making 
neighbourhoods more accessible and creating green spaces. Now, with the 
addition of Art on the BeltLine, this 22-mile stretch of multi-use trails has 
its own artistic element to boot, with a mix of temporary and year-round public 
works that can be viewed on various routes, from the south-east and south-west 
corridors to the Eastside Trail. Take a stroll, and be on the lookout for 
sculptures fromJD Koth <http://www.jdkoth.com/>, murals from Hense 
<http://hensethename.com/> and Brandon Sadler and even posts painted as 
larger-than-life crayons by Santiago Menendez Gil.
