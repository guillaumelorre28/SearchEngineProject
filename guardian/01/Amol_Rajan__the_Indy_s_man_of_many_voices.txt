Amol Rajan has been appointed editor of the Independent's newly-merged comment 
and Indy Voices desks 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/feb/07/nuj-independent-comment-desk>. The 
appointment means Rajan, who doubles up as an adviser to boss Evgeny Lebedev, 
now owns a list of job titles longer than your arm. HisTwitter biography 
<https://twitter.com/amolrajan> reads: "Editor @indyvoices; DepEd 
@independent.co.uk; Adviser @mrevgenylebedev; Columnist: Evening Standard; 
Trustee @ProspexTweets; Reggae nut; Author #Twirlymen". Nice work if you can 
get it.
