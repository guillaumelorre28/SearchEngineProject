Anne Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> has been 
knocked out of the Budapest Grand Prix in the first round by the fourth seed 
Klara Zakopalova.

The world No75, from London, had chances to spring a surprise but let a set 
point slip in the first set and was eventually beaten 7-6, 3-6, 6-2 in two 
hours 38 minutes.

With Zakopalova, who is from the Czech Republic, serving at 3-5 in the first 
set, Keothavong missed a break-point opportunity and was then broken for the 
fourth time as a see-saw set went to a tie-break.

She led 2-1 with a mini-break only to drop three points in succession and lose 
the tie-break 7-3 and the set in an hour and four minutes.

The second set saw Keothavong level the match, two breaks of serve setting up 
a 6-3 success.

She was broken in the fourth game of the decider and though she immediately 
hit back, that was to be the last game she won as two more breaks carried 
Zakopalova to victory.
