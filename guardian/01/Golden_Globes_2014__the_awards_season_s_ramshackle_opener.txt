On Sunday evening the millionaire celebrities of the entertainment industry 
gather for theGolden Globes <https://www.theguardian.com/film/golden-globes> 
awards at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles, where JFK reputedly once 
slept with Marilyn Monroe. There on the menu they shall find 125 cases of 
champagne, a gold-themed dinner that climaxes in a "gusto mango" dessert and a 
harrowing historical drama about human bondage, torture and institutionalised 
racism. In the course of its choppy 71 year history, the Globes have never been 
shy about mixing their ingredients.

12 Years a Slave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156376/12-years-a-slave>, a true-life 
tragedy from the British director Steve McQueen, is the bookies' favourite to 
claim the crowning film drama prize, typically seen as a crucial stepping stone 
to eventual glory at the Academy awards. But the Globes' role as an Oscar 
bellwether goes hand in hand with its reputation as the ramshackle honkytonk of 
the awards circuit - a chaotic, boozy circus with ideas above its station. Or, 
as three-time host Ricky Gervais once put it: "The Golden Globes are just like 
the Oscars - except without all that esteem." In keeping with that mischievous 
spirit, this year's eventwill be hosted, for the second time, by the comedians 
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jan/14/tina-fey-amy-poehler-golden-globes-video>
.

Where the Oscars and Baftas are decided by approximately 6,000 registered 
voters, the Globes are parcelled out by fewer than 100 entertainment 
journalists, all members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. But in 
recent years the voting process has been tainted by allegations of both mild 
corruption and galloping bad taste. Critics argued that the critically panned 
2010 Johnny Depp thrillerThe Tourist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137987/tourist> only bagged its three 
Globe nominations after the film's distributor, Sony Pictures,flew HFPA members 
out for an all-expenses paid trip to Las Vegas 
<http://www.ifc.com/fix/2010/12/bribe-golden-globes>. "The Golden Globes are 
voted on by about 80 Eurotrash," claims the veteran Canadian film critic Jim 
Slotek. "Some [of whom are] clearly deranged."

For the fans, however, it is this very irreverence and rambunctiousness that 
make the Globes unique. In Gervais's opinion, "The Golden Globes are to the 
Oscars what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton. Bit louder, bit trashier, bit 
drunker. And more easily bought." Earlier this week, Leonardo DiCaprio - 
nominated for his performance in Martin Scorsese'sThe Wolf of Wall Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155767/wolf-of-wall-street> - claimed 
that he sees the Globes as "a lot more relaxed and a lot more fun" than the 
Academy awards that follow.

The Globes also differ from the Oscars in splitting the ceremony between film 
and TV awards and in dividing the nominated pictures into separate drama and 
"comedy/musical" camps. But, even here, the decisions have taken the pundits by 
surprise. This year, for instance, Alexander Payne'sNebraska 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155224/nebraska> - a bleak 
black-and-white drama about a doomed dreamer in recession-hit America - finds 
itself bracketed in the comedy/musical section. Elsewhere, Stephen Frears's odd 
couple caperPhilomena <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156219/philomena> 
is nominated as a drama alongside 12 Years a Slave.

This decision, at least, has pleased the British comic Steve Coogan, 
Philomena's producer, co-writer and star. "I never envisaged Philomena as a 
comedy, because it's about a serious topic,"Coogan told the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/08/steve-coogan-philomena-bafta-nominations>
. In the UK, Coogan added, he remains pigeonholed as a purely comic actor. "One 
of the advantages about now being well known in the US is that there aren't 
those preconceptions."

It remains to be seen whether Philomena can upset the applecart still further 
by challenging the dominance of 12 Years a Slave and David O Russell's crime 
thrillerAmerican Hustle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156243/american-hustle>, both of which 
have seven nominations. But when the jokes are flying and the champagne is 
flowing, the Golden Globes can be an enjoyably unpredictable affair. Voters 
have grown accustomed to confusing comedies with dramas, and triumph with 
disaster, and treating those impostors just the same.
