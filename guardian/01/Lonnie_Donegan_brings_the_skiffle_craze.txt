Country <https://www.theguardian.com/music/country> blues groups in the 
pre-war American south were sometimes described as skiffle acts, but it was 
Glasgow-born Lonnie Donegan who popularised the idea of making music with 
improvised instruments such as a washboard and tea-chest bass in the mid-50s. 
The first song he recorded in this style? Leadbelly's Rock Island Line. It was 
the first debut record to go gold in the UK, hit the top 10 in the US, and had 
a huge influence on a new generation of artists, including John Lennon.
