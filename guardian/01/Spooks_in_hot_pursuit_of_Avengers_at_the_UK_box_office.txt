The winner

Winning the top spot for a third week in a row, Avengers: Age of Ultron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/21/avengers-age-of-ultron-review-film-joss-whedon-exhilarating>
 dominated a comparatively weak frame, with no major Hollywood blockbusters 
arriving to offer decent competition for the Marvel franchise picture. Warm 
weather for much of the weekend helped pushed grosses down across the board.

After 18 days, Age of Ultron stands at an impressive £40.35m. At the same 
stage,The Avengers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/26/avengers-assemble-review> had 
reached a similar £40.28m. In 2012, that film went on to sustain impressively, 
adding another £11.5m by the end of its run. With a 59% drop from the previous 
frame, Age of Ultron fell harder than any other film in the top 10, and does 
not look set for a similarly powerful run, probably falling shy of £50m 
lifetime. Age of Ultron faces direct competition for action audiences on 15 
May, withMad Max: Fury Road

 The Avengers Age of Ultron - video review 
The new arrival No 1

Among new releases, one of the hardest outcomes to predict was Spooks: The 
Greater Good 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/spooks-the-greater-good-kit-harington-review>
. Spooks has a defined fanbase, who watched the BBC series in big numbers from 
2002-11, but would it convert into a paying audience at the cinema? It was easy 
to be sceptical about a film that didn’t appear to have the resources to 
compete with the mega-budgets of Jason Bourne or James Bond. As for cast, the 
addition of Kit Harington positions the film for the attention of Game of 
Thrones fans, but the actor is pretty unproven at the theatrical box office.
Pompeii 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/01/pompeii-review-roman-vesuvius> 
didn’t exactly get his film career off to a strong start, and he was hardly the 
best thing in first world war dramaTestament of Youth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/testament-of-youth-review-vera-brittain>
.

Considering all of the above, Spooks: The Greater Good’s makers Pinewood 
Pictures should be mighty pleased with a debut of just over £1m, from 418 
cinemas, including previews of £14,000. The number isn’t setting records for a 
British spy thriller, or a TV spinoff, but it’s a solid result and more than 
many were predicting.

 Spooks: The Greater Good – video review 
Pinewood Pictures said: “Spooks fans truly loved the show, and it seemed 
recent enough that they hadn’t lost the love, but long enough ago that they 
were dying to see it come back.”

The new arrival No 2

Another new release that presented a difficult-to-guess outcome was The Age of 
Adaline 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/the-age-of-adaline-review-blake-lively-harrison-ford>
, starringBlake Lively 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/lostinshowbiz/2015/apr/16/blake-lively-truffle-covered-nipples-trounced-gwyneth-paltrow>
 and Game of Thrones’ Michiel Huisman. The film is a romantic drama about a 
woman who never physically ages beyond her 20s, creating ample jeopardy for her 
human relationships. The premise is reminiscent ofA New York Winter’s Tale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/20/new-york-winters-tale-review>, 
which audiences roundly rejected last year, despite a cast including Colin 
Farrell, Russell Crowe and Will Smith. And there was no evidence that audiences 
are keen to see Lively in a lead role – or Huisman, for that matter.

<http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7UzSekc0LoQ&media=>
Reviews of The Age of Adaline were mixed; it scored a 51/100 rating at 
MetaCritic. However, audiences are more appreciative, awarding it a 7.4/10 
rating at IMDb. At the UK box office, the film began with £570,000 from 368 
cinemas – not a number that will see champagne corks popping, but not bad given 
the distribution challenges.

The Age of Adaline landed a couple places higher in the chart than Big Game 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/12/big-game-review-sparky-samuel-l-jackson-romp-dads>
, an action adventure about a Finnish teenage boy helping the US president 
(Samuel L Jackson) when Air Force One is shot down near his campsite. The 
audience for the film was always hard to imagine, so the achieved result – 
£476,000, plus £60,000 in previews, from 350 cinemas – is also not too 
disastrous.

 Far from the Madding Crowd - video review 
Enjoying the gentlest drop (42%) from the previous weekend of any film in the 
top 10 is Thomas Vinterberg’sFar from the Madding Crowd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/02/far-from-the-madding-crowd-review-carey-mulligan-shines-in-hardy-perennial>
, starring Carey Mulligan, Matthias Schoenaerts, Michael Sheen and Tom 
Sturridge. The film held well on Friday and Saturday, then wilted in the Sunday 
sunshine. After 10 days, the Thomas Hardy adaptation has grossed a decent 
£3.59m. If the run continues, and the film achieves similar success in 
Anglophile foreign territories, expect producers to look with renewed interest 
at the Hardy canon.

The disappointment

Given a release on a moderately tight 126 prints, you might expect Chris Rock’s
Top Five 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/top-five-review-chris-rock-rosario-dawson>
 to achieve a fairly decent screen average. But an opening weekend gross of 
less than £65,000 yields a poor average of £513. In the US, the film has earned 
a lifetime total of $25m. The equivalent result for the UK would be £2.5m, a 
number that Top Five is not going to achieve. In fact, a 10th of that figure, 
£250,000, would be a more realistic target.

 Top Five - video review 
Following its weak debut the previous weekend, Monsters: Dark Continent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/30/monsters-dark-continent-film-review>
 suffered a predictably brutal fall, dropping by more than 90% in terms of box 
office, on a drastically reduced screen count. The film’s backers will hope to 
make up some ground when the title goes to DVD and video on demand, snagging 
audiences that enjoyed Gareth Edwards’ originalMonsters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/02/monsters-review> in 2010.

The future

Since the middle of March, takings have been pretty consistently up on the 
equivalent sessions a year ago, and in recent weeks markedly so. Now, thanks to 
the paucity of strong new releases, box office has tumbled, down 34% on the 
equivalent frame from 2014, when a previews-boostedBad Neighbours 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/02/bad-neighbours-review-zac-efron-seth-rogen>
 secured the top spot with a whopping £8.45m.

 Rebel Wilson and Elizabeth Banks on Pitch Perfect 2 - video interview 
However, a recovery looks imminent, thanks to the arrival this weekend of Mad 
Max: Fury Road, which will hope to win audiences that never saw a Mad Max film 
in cinemas as well as an older generation nostalgic for the leather-jacketed 
road warrior and post-apocalyptic vehicular mayhem. Mad Max will not have the 
market to itself, however. Pitch Perfect 2 is likely to open bigger thanits
