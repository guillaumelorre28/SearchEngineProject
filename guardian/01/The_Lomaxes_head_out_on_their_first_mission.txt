One hot July day in 1933, a Ford sedan turned off Louisiana's Highway 66 to 
the gates of the notorious Angola state penitentiary. The car was carrying 
folklorist John Lomax and his 18-year-old son Alan – both crucial and 
controversial figures in the history of American roots music – as well as a 
143kg portable recording machine paid for by the Library of Congress that could 
only be accommodated by ripping out the back seat. Inside, they recorded 
12-string guitar player Huddie Ledbetter, who was serving time for attempted 
homicide. The pair were dumbstruck by his singing and playing, and when the 
48-year-old Leadbelly (as all knew him) was released a year later, he became 
Lomax Sr's driver and assistant. He would perform on northern lecture tours, 
but quickly the strain on the relationship told. In New York, Leadbelly skipped 
out of his hotel to visit the Cotton Club (where he met Cab Calloway), and he 
started singing songs by the likes of Jimmie Rodgers. Lomax considered this 
corruption and, illustrating a tension that has perhaps always existed in the 
field, wrote: "We (Alan and I) are distressed at his beginning tendency to show 
off in his songs and talk ... as this tendency grows he will lose his charm and 
become only an ordinary ... Harlem nigger."
