There's a corollary, of course, to the images of faces that obsess us in art. 
Another image that we can't keep out of our paintings, or out of our minds. 
Because what's left when the face is gone? What's so much worse than a face and 
yet so inevitable thatwe can't stay away from thinking about it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/jul/06/1>? After every rise there is

not to. Her manager told her not to dignify it with a response. But she thought 
she knew just a little bit better. "When they see my face," she said, "then 
they'll know."

It was a cosy show, Good Evening: that one that looks like it's filmed in your 
grandma's front room, all doilies and lace chair-backs. She'd taken something 
before she went on, that was her first mistake. She was too hyper for the show, 
she came across as strange. And that was before they brought out the big 
surprise.

Afterwards we all thought: how could we not have seen that they'd do that? How 
could we not have thought that they'd bring out Terry Mulligrent, neatly 
coiffed and dressed in a suit, ready to embrace his long-lost darling baby 
girl? We should have known that'd happen.

But we couldn't have known that she'd react as she did. No quiet acquiescence, 
no graceful acknowledgement. When he tried to hug her she pushed him away, 
snarling. When he told her he loved her, with the simpering host looking on, 
she told him to piss off.

That image of her face, feral and confused, made all the front covers.
