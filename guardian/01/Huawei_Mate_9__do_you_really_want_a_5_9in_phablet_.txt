Huawei’s new smartphone has a massive 5.9in screen. But just how big do you 
really want your smartphone to be?


Phablets <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/phablets> – smartphones with 
screen sizes over 5.5in – have become more and more popular, showing a trend 
migration from their Asian origins to the US and Europe. Even Apple, famous for 
smaller smartphones, launched a phablet in 2014 with the iPhone 6 Plus. But few 
phablets have stretched their screens beyond 5.7in.

The new €699 (£621) Huawei Mate 9 has a 5.9in full HD display, dual cameras on 
the back, is 7.9mm thick and runs the company’s latest version of its customised
Android <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android> 7.0 Nougat called 
Emotion UI 5. It also has Huawei’s latest processor, which the company claims 
is 20% more powerful than its previous generation and more powerful in 
multi-core operations than Apple, Samsung or Qualcomm’s latest processors.

But the question remains whether buyers in the US and Europe want such a large 
screen. Previous iterations of the Mate line have not been sold en masse in 
stores, meaning the Mate 9 is the first of Huawei’s super-sized phablets to 
officially roll out in the UK.

With the failure of Samsung’s Note 7 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/galaxy-note-7>, which was expected to 
be the big seller in the phablet category, Huawei and others have an 
opportunity to fill the gap. While others have concentrated on the smaller end 
of the phablet scale, withGoogle’s Pixel XL having a 5.5in screen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/27/google-pixel-xl-review-phablet-price-smartphone-camera-android-71-nougat>
, Huawei has attempted to address poor battery life and the slowing down of 
phones over time.

To do that, the Mate 9 has a large 4,000mAh battery that’s about 500mAh larger 
than most mainstream phablets, including the Pixel XL, along with a 
learning-based system, which runs locally on the phone and detects usage 
patterns, preparing apps that are normally used at certain times of the day to 
launch faster without impacting battery life or performance.

Huawei <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/huawei> claims the system will 
also be able to run maintenance routines overnight, clear out the cruft and 
keep the phone running like new two years down the line. Compared with previous 
versions of the company’s software, it is expected to run 80% faster after a 
year.

The Mate 9’s large battery also has Huawei’s new fast-charging system, which 
like OnePlus’s Dash Charge, moves some of the electronics required to safely 
charge a battery at high voltage into the charger. The company claims that the 
new charge system will be able to reach 58% battery capacity in 30 minutes, 
with a full charge in 90 minutes.

“Battery management research and development is performed in house, and given 
recent developments we’ve upped research and development spend to make sure 
nothing similar can happen. We spend a year qualifying and testing components 
such as batteries both internally and externally before going on sale,” said Ed 
Gemmell, Huawei’s consumer business group director of communications.

Tablet sales, along with PC sales, are shrinking, as more people use their 
smartphone as their primary computing device. But whether European and US 
consumers will take to such a large smartphone remains to be seen.

A limited edition Mate 9 Porsche Design variant, with a smaller 5.5in quad HD 
curved screen and similar specifications will also be available in the UK and 
EU costing €1,395 (£1,238), but not in the US.
