, G2, 15 December). I always ask myself two questions: is it just because we

• Regarding the speculation on WH Auden’s scrotum, it wasn’t David Hockney who 
used the phrase (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/18/why-embrace-hygge-when-you-can-lozzerk>
, 19 December). It came about after he and Jim Dine had been drawing Auden’s 
portrait. As they left, Dine turned to Hockney and said: “I wonder what his 
balls are like?” Alan Bennett made the same misattribution, and when I wrote to 
him about it he sent a reply which began: “Thank you for your letter about 
Auden’s balls”.

it.

• Gus Pennington suggests Buckfast Abbey should review its business model in 
relation to its charitable status (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/16/buckfast-malt-extract-and-antisocial-daleks>
, 17 December). While they’re at it, how about changing its name to the more 
appropriate Fastbuck Abbey?
