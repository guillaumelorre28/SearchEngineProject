Andy Warhol – Empire (1964) 
<http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=89507>

The most charismatic of New York skyscrapers is the solitary star of Warhol's 
film, which lingers with unapologetic monotony for eight hours and five minutes 
on the majesty of the Empire State Building. It is best viewed not as a 
narrative film (that would drive you mad) but as if it were a painting. As 
such, it is full of love for Manhattan's lofty architecture.

night (1904) by Edward Steichen. Photograph: Alamy 
Skyscrapers were very new when Edward J Steichen took this photograph of 
Manhattan's Flatiron building. The wedge-shaped tower looms romantically in the 
evening mist, an image not so much of soaraway modernism but of the city as a 
place of poignant mystery and beauty.

Matthew Barney – Cremaster 3 (2002) <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0321781/>

The Chrysler building is the scene of mythic happenings and strange hocus 
pocus in the central film from Matthew Barney's Cremaster cycle. This art-deco 
tower with its metallic spire is one of the most beguiling of all skyscrapers. 
In Barney's film, a demolition derby takes place in its lobby and a masonic 
ritual is going on up on the top floor. Probably pretty much what used to 
happen there in the old days.

George Bellows – New York (1911)

By 1911, New York City was already turning into a mountainous modern 
wonderland with canyons and cliff faces of construction. George Bellows 
portrays modern city life as a drama defined by tough grandiose architecture.

Georgia O'Keeffe – The Radiator Building (1927) 
<http://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/georgia-o-keeffe/radiator-building.jpg>

Georgia O'Keeffe is celebrated for sensual paintings of natural forms, but 
here it is the city electric that lights up her imagination. The Radiator 
building in New York shines out excitement and promise, because the night 
belongs to lovers – and high-rises.

Antoni Gaudí – Hotel Attraction (1908)

 Tower of the psyche ... Antoni Gaudi's sectional drawing for his proposed 
360m-high hotel in New York, Hotel Attraction. The hotel was proposed for the 
same site as the World Trade Centre but was never built 
The great Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/antoni-gaudi>, whose buildings in 
Barcelona offer an alternative vision of modern architecture as an organic, 
gothic, surrealist profusion of form, dreamed of building a skyscraper in New 
York. Surviving drawings of the designs for his unbuilt Hotel Attraction reveal 
a subversive structure with the anthill eccentricity of his Sagrada Família: a 
tapering tower of the psyche.

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe – Friedrichstrasse Skyscraper Project (1921)

The darkly expressive drawings that Mies van der Rohe produced in his attempt 
to build a skyscraper at the heart of Weimar Berlin reveal the sublime vision 
at the heart of modern vertical architecture. Crystalline and authoritative, he 
created a geometric cathedral, an icy citadel imposing order on the city below. 
In fact it would be in New York that Mies van der Rohe achieved his "perfect" 
skyscraper: the immaculate, sleek and classical Seagram building.

Alfred Stieglitz – The City of Ambition (1910) 
<http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A5664&page_number=24&template_id=1&sort_order=1>

New York, New York is rising up in this evocative photograph by Stieglitz, as 
high-rises define the city's sense of itself as a competitive, dog-eat-dog 
metropolis. Yet many of his images dwell on less glamorous urban realities: 
immigrants arriving in steerage at the docks and the poor huddled masses 
dwarfed by buildings.

Raymond Hood – Terminal City (1929) 
<http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?t=152655>
 'Poem of towers' … Raymond Hood's 1929 drawings for the proposed Terminal 
City, in Chicago 
This never-built design for a massive new skyscraper quarter in Chicago is a 
vision of the modern city as a shadowed poem of towers; of glass and concrete 
dwarfing the people. Yet designs can be deceptive. Raymond Hood's masterpiece, 
the Rockefeller Centre, is the very definition of a complex that manages – 
paradoxically – to be both staggering in height and human in scale. Hood showed 
that modern urban architecture, even as it soars, can create a warmth and 
community on the plazas it defines.

Marcel Duchamp – The Woolworth Building as a Readymade (1916)

Duchamp claimed as his own. Photograph: Detroit Publishing Company/Corbis 
When Marcel Duchamp arrived in New York its skyline was already a colossal 
modern fact. Thedeftly ironic artist 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/07/marcel-duchamp-artist-a-z-dictionary>
 who had invented the "readymade" by fixing a bicycle wheel to a stool in 1913 
promptly claimed the Woolworth building as a readymade. In fact, this 
skyscraper emulates medieval architecture – it has gargoyles in its lobby. 
Duchamp saw its true modernity behind the gothic touches. In 1917, he would 
create a more portable "architectural" readymade: the porcelain urinal he named 
Fountain.
