I was staying in Paris during the Bastille Day celebrations this summer. My 
friend Matt and I and a girl from our hostel decided to have a picnic in the 
Jardin du Luxembourg - the quietest place you can imagine, usually. At a 
certain point we needed to use the bathrooms and so I flagged down a passerby 
to ask him where they were. He told me in the kind of French that you don't 
learn in school that I could go to the toilet wherever I wanted, and if the 
cops had a problem with that, then they knew where they could go...

Needless to say, he was incredibly drunk, and attached himself to our little 
group like a leech. He was so obnoxious that after about half an hour I asked 
him politely to leave.

He didn't want to. He took off his jacket and started throwing punches at me. 
My friend Matt tried to intervene and was rewarded by a couple of kicks in the 
leg. Luckily, the police arrived and managed to subdue and handcuff our 
attacker, but not before he'd attacked five of their officers as well.

The police then advised me to lodge a complaint, so I spent the next few hours 
at the commissioner's giving a (literally) blow-by-blow testimony of what had 
happened. Then I had to go to the hospital, despite being perfectly healthy, 
just to get the medical documentation to accompany my complaint. There I 
encountered someone being brought in with a broken and bleeding nose and 
someone who appeared to have a bullet hole in their stomach.

That was the worst day of my holiday. It got better after that, thankfully.
