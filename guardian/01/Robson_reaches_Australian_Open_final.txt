Britian's Laura Robson reached her second junior slam final at the Australian 
Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australianopen>, having won the 
Wimbledon title last year, when she defeated Thailand's Noppawan 
Lertcheewakarn, the top seed, 6-4,6-3.

A cool front dropped the temperature by around 10c, allowing the match to be 
played in the open during the late afternoon here. Robson had beaten the Thai, 
nicknamed Nok, or the bird, in the Wimbledon final, though there were signs of 
nerves at the beginning of the match.

Robson, seeded No 5, was struggling with both her normally dominant 
left-handed serve and forehand, although once she discovered her rhythm she 
quickly took control. The Thai, 17-years-old, and two years older than Robson, 
had good ground-strokes, and was the ITF No 1 last year, but the British 
teenager was much more aggressive. She now plays the Russian, Ksenia Pervak, 
who defeated Ana Bogdan 6-1,6-3. Pervak had beaten Britain's Heather Watson in 
the quarter-finals.

In the second set Robson, striking the ball beautifully went 5-2 up before 
briefly faltering, though the result was never in doubt.
