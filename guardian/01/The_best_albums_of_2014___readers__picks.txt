It’s been just over five months since The War on Drugs’ Lost in the Dream was 
declared our readers’ favourite album 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jul/03/the-10-best-albums-of-2014-so-far>
 of the year, and Philadelphia’s finest looked all set to secure another top 
spot – before four blokes from Birkenhead beat them into second place with a 
surprise charge. Surreal rock satirists Half Man Half Biscuit were your runaway 
favourites in this year’s poll, securing a huge proportion of the votes. Thank 
you to the hundreds of readers who sent in their submissions along with brief 
explanations for each choice. In a year with so much interesting music, from 
long-awaited returns to thrilling newer acts, picking just one record had to be 
tough. Now get stuck in:

“Witty and intelligent takes on everyday life that leave you humming the 
unlikeliest of tunes.”AdrianGray

“Still producing lyrics like no others. Still making me smile.” RRRich

“Acerbic wit, rousing guitar riffs and songs on the obscure, peppered with pop 
culture references that can seem throwaway on a first listen but that have 
depth. National treasures – there, I said it.”stargazerhelen

What we said: Well, nothing. But we sang their praises in 2012

 The War on Drugs – Red Eyes 
“Springsteen meets Lou Reed with a smattering of Dire Straits – what’s not to 
like?”wildone

“A really polished and emotional album. It’s been on repeat since it came out 
and I’m still not getting bored of it.”NickT

“If anyone had told me that a mashup of Bruce Springsteen and Kraftwerk would 
be my album of the year I’d have laughed at them.”sometimeflaneur

What we said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/13/the-war-on-drugs-lost-in-the-dream-review>
: “These are impassioned songs, but they steer clear of Springsteen’s bombast 
or lighters-aloft choruses.”

 St Vincent – Digital Witness 
“Any artist who can insert the mundane nature of masturbating into a song 
without batting an eyelid must be special.”modhabobo

“Great varied but coherent collection of songs. All catchy and strange and 
wonderful.”manybothans

“A heady combination of perfect songwriting, performance and production. As 
immediately thrilling on the first listen as it remains on the 50th. More than 
just album of the year,St Vincent <https://www.theguardian.com/music/st-vincent>
 is one of the albums of the decade.”Octobadger

What we said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/13/st-vincent-st-vincent-review>: “
St Vincent’s 40 minutes offer an embarrassment of fantastic songs.”

 Run the Jewels – Blockbuster Night Part 1 
“First year I’ve ever gone for a hip-hop album as a ‘best of the year’. It’s 
tuneful, aggressive and relevant. I cannot stop listening to it.”
heavyplantcrossing

“It hits hard, it’s tight as hell, and inserts truth into the hip-hop industry 
with El-P’s production and Killer Mike’s usual powerful verses.”Joey

“More brilliant work from El-P and Killer Mike. Aggressive, political, 
obscene, funny. The soundtrack for the shame of Ferguson.”afwpeeps

What we said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/06/run-the-jewels-2-review>: “Their 
style is … a fusion – of El-P’s abrasive, experimental New York styling with 
Mike’s smooth, almost laconic, Atlanta flow.”

 La Roux – Kiss and Not Tell

depth.”JD1994

“A truly unique album this year. The depth of rhythms and the beaming melodies 
really stood out.”Deb B

“A near-perfect album that grows the more you listen. Every song could be a 
single, on a beautiful album that transports you to a tropical island and 
leaves you feeling warm inside. Plus, the songs sound even better live!”Sarah

What we said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/17/la-roux-trouble-in-paradise-review>
: “It sounds airy and confident and effortless.”

 Royal Blood – Figure it Out 
“Freshest-sounding new rock band since the Arctic Monkeys.” Adeshr

“A unique and individual sound that opened up everyone’s eyes to how good rock 
music can be, when performed properly. There is no song on the album that isn’t 
good.”Megan

“For giving us all a whole new perspective on rock and sounding as if there 
are four of them were there are only two. New sound.”Joe

What we said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/21/royal-blood-album-review>: “It’s 
heavy and hefty enough to crown them kings of the commercial rock scene.”

 Slow Club – Everything is New 
“A band growing into something bigger and more beautiful with every album. 
Heartbreaking lyrics and voices come together to make something very very 
special.”drgsfb

“The horns, the strings and that voice … Also worthwhile because its lack of 
twee appeared to incense a significant portion of their fan base.”mooncrooks

“It’s a brilliant collection of beautifully crafted, heartfelt songs. Rebecca 
and Charles’s vocals are both amazing and the album has a classic sound while 
still being true to Slow Club.”R5D4

What we said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/10/slow-club-complete-surrender-review>
: “This new sense of ambition is crucial for a once-whimsical band.”

 Aphex Twin – minipops 67 [120.2][source field mix] 
“The return of one of the biggest names in electronic music, after a long 
hiatus, it blows out of the water everything else in the genre released this 
year.”Bussunda

“A towering achievement to return after 13 years doing other things and still 
sound unmistakably like the Aphex we know and love, and yet utterly current.”
stewi

“Electronic music that entertains and astounds. Genius at work.” Brendan

What we said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/18/aphex-twin-syro-review-brain-bending-richard-d-james>

completely different planet to almost anything else that’s been released over 
the last decade and a half.”

Thomas

:“Beautiful, but subtle, cloudy and elusive, Everyday Robots certainly isn’t 
the album it’s purported to be.”
