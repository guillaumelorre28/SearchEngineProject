The page is estimated at £70,000 to £110,000 and is considered especially 
valuable as it features a discussion between Holmes and Dr Watson.

It is one of the few surviving pages from the original manuscript, as most 
were lost or stolen when they were distributed to bookshops as a publicity 
stunt.

The sale also features a handwritten copy of one of the last Sherlock Holmes 
mysteries, The Problem of Thor Bridge, which is expected to be sold for up to 
£250,000, and a manuscript of one ofConan Doyle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/22/biography.arthurconandoyle>’s 
romantic historical novels, Rodney Stone: a Reminiscence of the Ring.
