Folks, we’re going to call it a day now. But don’t forget that if you are 
awake at 01.00 AEDT (14.00 GMT), then CERN physicistJon Butterworth will be here
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/04/relativity-quantum-mechanics-universe-physicists>
, trying to answer all your questions again!

What a day! Katie Mack did an amazing job explaining the ins and outs of what 
she described 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2016/feb/12/gravitational-waves-an-astrophysicist-answers-your-questions-live?page=with:block-56bd36fee4b0d007e4723c76#block-56bd36fee4b0d007e4723c76>
 as a bigger discovery than the Higgs boson. She reassured us that 
gravitational wavesweren’t going to hurt anyone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2016/feb/12/gravitational-waves-an-astrophysicist-answers-your-questions-live?page=with:block-56bd3589e4b0d159b0b67568#block-56bd3589e4b0d159b0b67568>
 and that – coincidence or not – there wasdefinitely no conspiracy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2016/feb/12/gravitational-waves-an-astrophysicist-answers-your-questions-live?page=with:block-56bd2e0de4b0b9a8ab2f1fa3#block-56bd2e0de4b0b9a8ab2f1fa3>
 behind the discovery.

Katie explained that they’re a whole new window into the universe, allowing us 
to study the veryfabric of reality 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2016/feb/12/gravitational-waves-an-astrophysicist-answers-your-questions-live#comment-68512043>
, and that although it turned out Einstein was right – and they do travel at 
the speed of light –it wasn’t necessarily so 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2016/feb/12/gravitational-waves-an-astrophysicist-answers-your-questions-live?page=with:block-56bd3ebde4b080c5d0ebd95c#block-56bd3ebde4b080c5d0ebd95c>
.

Thanks again to everyone for all the fabulous questions and, of course, to 
Katie Mack for spending so much time lending us her expertise.

Assuming conservation of energy, what is 'lost' when a body emits 
gravitational waves? Is a body losing mass to emit the gravitational wave 
energy? Or does this phenonimina only apply to bodies orbiting one another 
which lose orbital angular momentum as they emit gravitational waves and so 
spiral in to another in a form of orbital decay?

The short answer is “yes”! Mass was lost when the two black holes collapsed. 
One of the black holes was 36 times the mass of our sun and the other was 29 
times its mass. When they collapsed, the resulting black hole was only 62 solar 
masses. That means that a mass three times the mass of the sun was lost!

That mass was turned into energy, which caused the ripples in spacetime – 
gravitational waves – that LIGO detected 1.3 billion years later.

A massive thanks to Dr Katie Mack from the University of Melbourne for 
answering all our questions. We’ve had to let her get back to her life (which 
I’m guessing means talking about this stuff with other people!)

In about 11 hours time (14:00GMT), CERN physicist Jon Butterworth will be 
doing something very similar!

There’s been lots of amazing questions. Some of them have been very complex!

One such complex question, which quite a few people have asked, is whether 
this discovery could help physicists get closer to squaring our two best 
theories in physics, which currently conflict with each other.

Quantum mechanics (which is roughly about very small things) and general 
relativity (roughly about very big things!) are both superbly accurate.

But they conflict with each other. They can’t both be right. So physicists 
have been trying to break them both for decades but they always come out of 
tests unscathed. You can read all about that here:

Relativity v quantum mechanics – the battle for the universe

<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/04/relativity-quantum-mechanics-universe-physicists>
Katie says studying gravitational waves could potentially help unify the two 
theories.

“I think that’s definitely a possibility,” she says. The trick to solving the 
problem could be to observe how gravity works in very extreme environments – 
which is exactly what LIGO just did when it observed the gravity wave:

That’s difficult to study otherwise, and so it gives us a lot more information 
about how gravity works outside of our everyday experience of it.

We are already pretty sure that general relativity has to break down somewhere 
because it doesn’t play nicely with quantum mechanics... So far, everything 
we’ve seen is completely consistent with general relativity, but the more we 
learn about it from experiments like LIGO the better idea we’ll have of where 
the edges of the theory might be.

Here’s another question about how we might be able to use the discovery in 
technology.
 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15887618> Barbara Lucas  
<https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15887618> 12 February 2016 
2:05am <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/68512206> 
Kate, is there some conceivable way we could "run" a machine on gravity waves 
the same way we "run" machines on electrical waves right now?

Katie says she’s not quite sure how a machine running on gravitational work 
would work. But then again, it’s not impossible, she says:

So far all we’ve been able to get a gravitational wave to do for us is move a 
mirror suspended in an extremely well seismically isolated vacuum by a tiny 
fraction of the diameter of a proton. And it took decades of planning and 
construction to be able to do that.

But, in a sense, that little mirror wiggle was a machine running on 
gravitational waves! It’s conceivable that we could someday find a way to 
extract the energy from gravitational waves to do something useful, but it’s 
hard to imagine a scenario in which some other energy source wouldn’t be more 
efficient.

Thanks so much for your thoughtful (and in some cases very informed!) 
questions in comments – we’ve done our best to put as many as we can to Katie, 
and apologies to those of you who didn’t get a response.

Obviously, a text Q&A isn’t the best way of digging deep into “spacetime”, but 
the enormity of this discovery means we’ll be publishing more on it in the days 
and weeks to come.

So we’ll be wrapping up soon. But I think there’s time for maybe two more 
questions before we let Katie get back to her life!

Let’s take a bit of a step back. There are lots of advanced questions in the 
comments, which we’ll try to get to. But someone just asked: “Remind me again 
what spacetime is?”

That seems pretty important since remember, gravity waves are ripples in it.

So here’s what Katie said:

Spacetime is what we call the combination of the three dimensions of space and 
one dimension of time. It’s not a “stuff” exactly, but it sometimes behaves 
that way, stretching and curving and bending in response to the way mass is 
distributed in the Universe.

Relativity says that we need to treat time like it’s a dimension, similar to 
space, because of how we travel through it. And it turns out that when you have 
a big mass somewhere, it not only warps space, but also changes how things 
around it experience time. Time moves more slowly when you’re close to a 
massive object, for example.

So mathematically it makes sense to link up space and time together as one 
thing – spacetime – that gets warped by mass and energy. It’s a bit hard to 
conceptualize, I’m afraid!

My colleague Elle Hunt is getting into this. She wants to know if 
gravitational waves might help the search for extraterrestrial life.

Katie’s response was roughly “maybe”:

I don’t see a way for gravitational waves to directly help us find 
extraterrestrial life, but it could tell us more about how black holes and 
stars form and die, which could in turn tell us about the kinds of conditions 
some alien planet might on average expect.

For example, it can tell us more about the rate of gamma-ray bursts in the 
Universe, and gamma-ray bursts are the sorts of things that an alien planet 
probably should stay away from if it wants to harbour life.

And then Katie had another thought:

If you want to get REALLY sci-fi about it, you can imagine some super-advanced 
civilisation manipulating massive objects in a way that could let them modulate 
gravitational waves to carry a message.

But in general it would be a lot easier to just send radio waves.

How fast do the ripples in spacetime travel? Is it faster than the speed of 
light?

A few people answered saying “the speed of light”. And they’re right. But 
Katie explains that it wasn’t necessarily so:

According to Einstein’s theory, gravitational waves travel at exactly the 
speed of light. And, in fact, in this observation, one of the things that the 
scientists were testing was exactly that. In some alternatives to general 
relativity, gravity can travel at different speeds for different frequencies of 
gravitational waves. LIGO didn’t see that at all – as far as we can tell so 
far, it looks like Einstein was right about the speed of gravity too!

How do they know that this particular gravitational wave they detected is from 
a specific event that happened a billion years ago, billions of light years 
away?

Katie says there’s lots of information you can get from the “chirp” signal of 
the black hole colliding.

Oh– and if you haven’t heard the sound, here it is. Physicists took the wave 
they detected and interpreted it as a sound:

Katie says this sound lets physicists figure out where the wave came from:

We can compare the waveform to simulated ones we get from numerical relativity 
calculations (solving Einstein’s equations in a supercomputer) and figure out 
how the distance to the black hole changes the shape. If we know the distance, 
we also know how long ago it happened, because we know the speed of light, so 
we can figure out how long the signal has been travelling toward us.

My colleague here in the Guardian Australia office, Elle Hunt, is wondering 
how this will help her. (She’s mostly joking.)

Katie got a little upset with this: “IT GIVES YOU A NEW WINDOW ON THE 
UNIVERSE, ELLE!”

(We’re doing this over instant messaging, so the capitals are all hers.)

She collected herself to explain:

Okay so in all seriousness your day to day life will not change now that 
astronomers can WATCH BLACK HOLES COLLIDING and study the details of the VERY 
FABRIC OF REALITY.

You can safely ignore it if you want to, but omg really it’s going to be 
amazing. We are going to learn so much, we are going to have a MUCH deeper 
understanding of the Universe and how it changes over time, and we’re going to 
be able to directly observe incredible violent events millions of light years 
away. It’s mind boggling. So maybe that’s it.

Maybe your mind will be boggled, and you’ll experience the cosmic vertigo that 
I feel every time I think about what’s out there, and how immense it is. Maybe 
you’ll be humbled, or inspired, or just awed. Gravitational waves will not cure 
cancer, but studying them can help us better understand areas of physics that 
might someday connect to new treatments, just like studying antimatter has led 
to PET scans, and observational methods used in astronomy are often applied to 
improvements in medical imaging.

Gravitational waves are not going to be powering cars any time soon, but 
general relativity is already part of GPS. And the development of the LIGO 
experiment has been a massive effort in developing new ways of using lasers and 
new materials science, which will have all sorts of applications and are 
probably already improving lives. We don’t know yet all the ways this kind of 
work will affect our lives, but it’s a good bet we’ll find some amazing ones.

Why is this a big deal?

A lot of people are saying that the discovery of gravitational waves opens a 
new window on the Universe. Katie confirms that that is completely true and not 
even a bit of an exaggeration. It could have implications for theories of 
gravity as well as our understanding of black holes, stars and entire galaxies, 
she says:


It’s an entirely new way of looking at the cosmos, using an entirely new way 
of seeing (or “hearing” if you prefer that analogy, keeping in mind that it’s 
not exact). We’ll be able to study things that we would never be able to see in 
any kind of detail or perhaps even at all. We’ll be able to watch as black 
holes (and galaxies) merge and grow, throughout an incredibly huge volume of 
the Universe. We can test theories of gravity, find out how black holes spin, 
learn about the formation of stars and their deaths.

It’s an immense treasure trove of information and I can’t wait to see what it 
will tell us.

A bigger deal than the Higgs boson

Twitter user John Stetson asks Katie to put the gravitational waves discovery 
in the context of other recent scientific breakthroughs. How might it change 
how we think about physics in future?
John Stetson (@ruiduarte16) 
@guardian <https://twitter.com/guardian> @mikeyslezak 
<https://twitter.com/MikeySlezak> how many doors does this discovery open to 
the future of physics? Can you compare it with recent science big-deals?
 <https://twitter.com/ruiduarte16/status/697935263482384384> February 12, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/ruiduarte16/status/697935263482384384> 
In Katie’s informed opinion, it’s a bigger deal than the detection of the 
Higgs boson – “because it gives us more stuff to do and more opportunities to 
discover new things”:

It’s probably on par with the discovery of dark energy, though in that case, 
we really weren’t expecting dark energy at all. In this case, we knew pretty 
well that gravitational waves existed, but we couldn’t detect them and thus use 
them to study the cosmos.

Now we can.

Could gravitational waves be dangerous?

Thankfully, Katie says no. They’re actually “really, really fantastically 
weak”:

We had to build a system that could measure a change in length of a thousandth 
the diameter of a proton just to be able to detect this signal at all. And all 
gravitational waves do is stretch and squeeze things a tiny, tiny bit – so I 
don’t see a way for them to harm us.

If something was massive enough and close enough to produce an even slightly 
non-tiny gravitational wave effect, then it would probably obliterate us from 
whatever it was doing to make that wave.

Uhh... phew!

Guardian Australia’s Walkley-winning marsupial correspondent First Dog On The 
Moon is wondering whether it is a conspiracy?! (Of course he is.)

It’s not a conspiracy, but people on Twitter have asked similar questions 
about whether it was a coincidence that as soon as the LIGO machine (a “tube 
with a laser shooting through it”... broadly) was turned on, it detected a 
massive gravitational wave in action.
Keith Brewster (@k_brewster) 
@guardian <https://twitter.com/guardian> @MikeySlezak 
<https://twitter.com/MikeySlezak> Was it purely coincidence they captured the 
merger of these black holes? Seems so improbable.
 <https://twitter.com/k_brewster/status/697934483241242624> February 12, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/k_brewster/status/697934483241242624> 
Here’s First Dog’s question in full (caps original...):


As I understand it, these two black holes crashed into each other a billion 
years ago, a gazillion miles away in space – and the resulting gravity waves 
have been hurtling toward us ever since.

Is the arrival of these waves like a one off event? Or is it like the ocean – 
a constant rippling sort of thing?

Because if it is a one-off event it is a pretty amazing coincidence that all 
these scientists decided to flick the switch on the LIGO machine JUST IN TIME 
FOR THESE GRAVITY WAVES FROM A BILLION YEARS AGO TO ARRIVE ON EARTH.

THAT IS EVEN MORE OF AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE THAN PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING EVER!

Or have these waves just been pootling through here the whole time – and if 
they have, how can we then get the distinct “sound” of the two black holes 
colliding?

Katie says: They crashed into each other about a billion years ago and yeah, 
really far away (depending on how you measure it, somewhere around a billion 
light years away). And yeah, the waves have been coming toward us ever since 
(“gravitational waves”, not “gravity waves”, as it happens).

It’s a one-off for that PARTICULAR binary system — the two black holes have 
merged now and they’re done. But there are LOTS of systems like this around the 
Universe, and probably many more also happening right now. And if there’s a 
binary system that hasn’t yet merged, that’s sending us a kind of constant 
rippling.

I guess it’s a coincidence for this particular system, but we’ve missed all 
the other black hole mergers that have happened since the beginning of time – 
and there are lots more happening that hopefully we’ll now see.

In short: the Universe has been buzzing away with all this gravitational 
radiation forever and we’ve been completely unable to perceive it until now.

A lot of people on Twitter are asking whether the discovery helps in any way 
with time travel?

Katie says – sadly – no:

All we’re doing here is listening to the disturbances in spacetime caused by 
massive objects (like black holes) far away. We still don’t have any way to 
manipulate spacetime ourselves (except, you know, by curving it very very 
slightly by piling up rocks or something). Even if we could manipulate 
spacetime easily, it’s not at all clear that time travel wouldn’t be completely 
ruled out by some as-yet unknown physical law.

Basically, you’d have to loop spacetime around itself in some complicated way 
and then travel through that loop and it’s so far beyond what we can even 
conceive of ever doing, even theorists think it may not be possible in 
principle.

It’s important to remember that spacetime is the sort of background in which 
everything happens, and it can be curved and stretched and squeezed and stuff, 
but that stretching and squeezing never reverses time. It can slow it down or 
speed it up, but that’s about it.

, they’re detecting tiny changes in the size of spacetime itself. But how can 
you measure that?

I mean, let’s say I try to measure the size of something with a ruler. If 
spacetime itself shrinks, both the thing I’m measuringand the ruler itself will 
shrink – so according to my ruler, it wouldn’t have changed size.

Here’s what Katie said:

Great question! To measure it we rely on another of Einstein’s great insights 
– that the speed of light is constant NO MATTER WHAT. That means that when you 
shoot a laser through a 4km tube (which is what the LIGO machine does) and that 
tube gets a little bit longer because spacetime is stretching, light just keeps 
on at its usual speed and so takes a little longer to get to the end.

So with LIGO, it’s set up so that the laser light going through each arm comes 
together at the middle and matches up perfectly (to cancel out), but when a 
gravitational wave comes through, one arm gets a little longer and the other a 
little shorter.

So the light takes a little longer to get down one arm than the other, and 
that messes up the perfect alignment at the middle, so you can see that the 
perfect cancellation has been lost. Assuming nothing else moved the mirrors, 
it’s a sign spacetime itself changed shape!

Here’s a great question from a Twitter correspondent to get us started.
msatonienne (@msatonienne) 
@guardian <https://twitter.com/guardian> @MikeySlezak 
<https://twitter.com/MikeySlezak> what is the substance of the wave? I.e., what 
is it that's moving?
 <https://twitter.com/msatonienne/status/697940087796080640> February 12, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/msatonienne/status/697940087796080640> 
Katie: Spacetime! The fabric of the Universe. Einstein’s big insight was that 
space and time are both tied in together in this sort of single concept called 
spacetime, and it can curve and stretch and squeeze... What we feel as gravity 
is just how we experience the curvature of spacetime around massive objects. 
Gravitational waves are fluctuations of curvature in spacetime.

Michael: Hang on. “Fluctuations of curvature in spacetime”?

Katie: Yeah, so when you’re close to something massive, spacetime curves in 
toward that mass (usual visual analogy: a bowling ball making a dent in a 
rubber sheet – though you have to imagine that in a higher dimension!).

As a result, the paths of other masses and even of light get diverted a bit 
toward that mass, because the spacetime they’re travelling through is bent.

A gravitational wave is when spacetime ripples happen – the curvature of empty 
space gets disturbed because of the mass accelerating in some way nearby 
sending ripples through the space around it.

It’s kind of like if you put a bowling ball on a trampoline and then bounce it 
up and down – it sends little wobbles of disturbance out.

Introducing astrophysicist Dr Katie Mack

Michael Slezak

So, physicists have announced the discovery of gravitational waves.

You’ve heard they’re “ripples in the fabric of spacetime”. You’ve heard they 
were a prediction of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. You 
probably even know the waves that were detected were created when two massive 
black holes circled each other and violently collapsed. You can read all about 
the discoveryhere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century>
, and we’ve already answered a few questionshere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/09/gravitational-waves-everything-you-need-to-know>
.

But we know you’re still brimming with questions! So here we have Dr Katie Mack
 <http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~kmack/>, an astrophysicist from the University 
of Melbourne. She’s on hand to answer Everything You Wanted To Know About 
Gravitational Waves But Were Too Afraid To Ask.

No question is too basic! Hit us up in the comments and I’ll put them to 
Katie, who will do her best to bring you up to speed.

One commenter asked:

Assuming conservation of energy, what is 'lost' when a body emits 
gravitational waves? Is a body losing mass to emit the gravitational wave 
energy? Or does this phenonimina only apply to bodies orbiting one another 
which lose orbital angular momentum as they emit gravitational waves and so 
spiral in to another in a form of orbital decay?

The short answer is “yes”! Mass was lost when the two black holes collapsed. 
One of the black holes was 36 times the mass of our sun and the other was 29 
times its mass. When they collapsed, the resulting black hole was only 62 solar 
masses. That means that a mass three times the mass of the sun was lost!

That mass was turned into energy, which caused the ripples in spacetime – 
gravitational waves – that LIGO detected 1.3 billion years later.
 
A massive thanks to Dr Katie Mack from the University of Melbourne for 
answering all our questions. We’ve had to let her get back to her life (which 
I’m guessing means talking about this stuff with other people!)

In about 11 hours time (14:00GMT), CERN physicist Jon Butterworth will be 
doing something very similar!

But before we wrap up here, there are a couple of questions from the comments 
and Twitter that I’ll be able to help you out with. So stay with me a little 
longer!
 
There’s been lots of amazing questions. Some of them have been very complex!

One such complex question, which quite a few people have asked, is whether 
this discovery could help physicists get closer to squaring our two best 
theories in physics, which currently conflict with each other.

Quantum mechanics (which is roughly about very small things) and general 
relativity (roughly about very big things!) are both superbly accurate.

But they conflict with each other. They can’t both be right. So physicists 
have been trying to break them both for decades but they always come out of 
tests unscathed. You can read all about that here:

Relativity v quantum mechanics – the battle for the universe
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/04/relativity-quantum-mechanics-universe-physicists>
Katie says studying gravitational waves could potentially help unify the two 
theories.

“I think that’s definitely a possibility,” she says. The trick to solving the 
problem could be to observe how gravity works in very extreme environments – 
which is exactly what LIGO just did when it observed the gravity wave:

That’s difficult to study otherwise, and so it gives us a lot more information 
about how gravity works outside of our everyday experience of it.

We are already pretty sure that general relativity has to break down somewhere 
because it doesn’t play nicely with quantum mechanics... So far, everything 
we’ve seen is completely consistent with general relativity, but the more we 
learn about it from experiments like LIGO the better idea we’ll have of where 
the edges of the theory might be.
 
Here’s another question about how we might be able to use the discovery in 
technology.
 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15887618> Barbara Lucas  
<https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15887618> 12 February 2016 
2:05am <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/68512206> 
Kate, is there some conceivable way we could "run" a machine on gravity waves 
the same way we "run" machines on electrical waves right now?

Katie says she’s not quite sure how a machine running on gravitational work 
would work. But then again, it’s not impossible, she says:

So far all we’ve been able to get a gravitational wave to do for us is move a 
mirror suspended in an extremely well seismically isolated vacuum by a tiny 
fraction of the diameter of a proton. And it took decades of planning and 
construction to be able to do that.

But, in a sense, that little mirror wiggle was a machine running on 
gravitational waves! It’s conceivable that we could someday find a way to 
extract the energy from gravitational waves to do something useful, but it’s 
hard to imagine a scenario in which some other energy source wouldn’t be more 
efficient.
 
Thanks so much for your thoughtful (and in some cases very informed!) 
questions in comments – we’ve done our best to put as many as we can to Katie, 
and apologies to those of you who didn’t get a response.

Obviously, a text Q&A isn’t the best way of digging deep into “spacetime”, but 
the enormity of this discovery means we’ll be publishing more on it in the days 
and weeks to come.

So we’ll be wrapping up soon. But I think there’s time for maybe two more 
questions before we let Katie get back to her life!
 
Let’s take a bit of a step back. There are lots of advanced questions in the 
comments, which we’ll try to get to. But someone just asked: “Remind me again 
what spacetime is?”

That seems pretty important since remember, gravity waves are ripples in it.

So here’s what Katie said:

Spacetime is what we call the combination of the three dimensions of space and 
one dimension of time. It’s not a “stuff” exactly, but it sometimes behaves 
that way, stretching and curving and bending in response to the way mass is 
distributed in the Universe.

Relativity says that we need to treat time like it’s a dimension, similar to 
space, because of how we travel through it. And it turns out that when you have 
a big mass somewhere, it not only warps space, but also changes how things 
around it experience time. Time moves more slowly when you’re close to a 
massive object, for example.

So mathematically it makes sense to link up space and time together as one 
thing – spacetime – that gets warped by mass and energy. It’s a bit hard to 
conceptualize, I’m afraid!
 
My colleague Elle Hunt is getting into this. She wants to know if 
gravitational waves might help the search for extraterrestrial life.

Katie’s response was roughly “maybe”:

I don’t see a way for gravitational waves to directly help us find 
extraterrestrial life, but it could tell us more about how black holes and 
stars form and die, which could in turn tell us about the kinds of conditions 
some alien planet might on average expect.

For example, it can tell us more about the rate of gamma-ray bursts in the 
Universe, and gamma-ray bursts are the sorts of things that an alien planet 
probably should stay away from if it wants to harbour life.

And then Katie had another thought:

If you want to get REALLY sci-fi about it, you can imagine some super-advanced 
civilisation manipulating massive objects in a way that could let them modulate 
gravitational waves to carry a message.

But in general it would be a lot easier to just send radio waves.
 
A few people in the comments asked this:

1:28am <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/68511115> 
How fast do the ripples in spacetime travel? Is it faster than the speed of 
light?

A few people answered saying “the speed of light”. And they’re right. But 
Katie explains that it wasn’t necessarily so:

According to Einstein’s theory, gravitational waves travel at exactly the 
speed of light. And, in fact, in this observation, one of the things that the 
scientists were testing was exactly that. In some alternatives to general 
relativity, gravity can travel at different speeds for different frequencies of 
gravitational waves. LIGO didn’t see that at all – as far as we can tell so 
far, it looks like Einstein was right about the speed of gravity too!
 
(By the way, make sure you hit the refresh button every now-and-again. Our 
auto-refresh function isn’t working properly.)

We’ve got a great question from a reader in the comments:

 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12831394> nath2099  
<https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12831394> 12 February 2016 
1:30am <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/68511192> 
How do they know that this particular gravitational wave they detected is from 
a specific event that happened a billion years ago, billions of light years 
away?

Katie says there’s lots of information you can get from the “chirp” signal of 
the black hole colliding.

Oh– and if you haven’t heard the sound, here it is. Physicists took the wave 
they detected and interpreted it as a sound:

Katie says this sound lets physicists figure out where the wave came from:

We can compare the waveform to simulated ones we get from numerical relativity 
calculations (solving Einstein’s equations in a supercomputer) and figure out 
how the distance to the black hole changes the shape. If we know the distance, 
we also know how long ago it happened, because we know the speed of light, so 
we can figure out how long the signal has been travelling toward us.
 
My colleague here in the Guardian Australia office, Elle Hunt, is wondering 
how this will help her. (She’s mostly joking.)

Katie got a little upset with this: “IT GIVES YOU A NEW WINDOW ON THE 
UNIVERSE, ELLE!”

(We’re doing this over instant messaging, so the capitals are all hers.)

She collected herself to explain:

Okay so in all seriousness your day to day life will not change now that 
astronomers can WATCH BLACK HOLES COLLIDING and study the details of the VERY 
FABRIC OF REALITY.

You can safely ignore it if you want to, but omg really it’s going to be 
amazing. We are going to learn so much, we are going to have a MUCH deeper 
understanding of the Universe and how it changes over time, and we’re going to 
be able to directly observe incredible violent events millions of light years 
away. It’s mind boggling. So maybe that’s it.

Maybe your mind will be boggled, and you’ll experience the cosmic vertigo that 
I feel every time I think about what’s out there, and how immense it is. Maybe 
you’ll be humbled, or inspired, or just awed. Gravitational waves will not cure 
cancer, but studying them can help us better understand areas of physics that 
might someday connect to new treatments, just like studying antimatter has led 
to PET scans, and observational methods used in astronomy are often applied to 
improvements in medical imaging.

Gravitational waves are not going to be powering cars any time soon, but 
general relativity is already part of GPS. And the development of the LIGO 
experiment has been a massive effort in developing new ways of using lasers and 
new materials science, which will have all sorts of applications and are 
probably already improving lives. We don’t know yet all the ways this kind of 
work will affect our lives, but it’s a good bet we’ll find some amazing ones.
 
A lot of people are saying that the discovery of gravitational waves opens a 
new window on the Universe. Katie confirms that that is completely true and not 
even a bit of an exaggeration. It could have implications for theories of 
gravity as well as our understanding of black holes, stars and entire galaxies, 
she says:


It’s an entirely new way of looking at the cosmos, using an entirely new way 
of seeing (or “hearing” if you prefer that analogy, keeping in mind that it’s 
not exact). We’ll be able to study things that we would never be able to see in 
any kind of detail or perhaps even at all. We’ll be able to watch as black 
holes (and galaxies) merge and grow, throughout an incredibly huge volume of 
the Universe. We can test theories of gravity, find out how black holes spin, 
learn about the formation of stars and their deaths.

It’s an immense treasure trove of information and I can’t wait to see what it 
will tell us.
 
Twitter user John Stetson asks Katie to put the gravitational waves discovery 
in the context of other recent scientific breakthroughs. How might it change 
how we think about physics in future?

<https://twitter.com/MikeySlezak> how many doors does this discovery open to 
the future of physics? Can you compare it with recent science big-deals?

In Katie’s informed opinion, it’s a bigger deal than the detection of the 
Higgs boson – “because it gives us more stuff to do and more opportunities to 
discover new things”:

It’s probably on par with the discovery of dark energy, though in that case, 
we really weren’t expecting dark energy at all. In this case, we knew pretty 
well that gravitational waves existed, but we couldn’t detect them and thus use 
them to study the cosmos.

Now we can.
 
Could gravitational waves be dangerous?

Thankfully, Katie says no. They’re actually “really, really fantastically 
weak”:

We had to build a system that could measure a change in length of a thousandth 
the diameter of a proton just to be able to detect this signal at all. And all 
gravitational waves do is stretch and squeeze things a tiny, tiny bit – so I 
don’t see a way for them to harm us.

If something was massive enough and close enough to produce an even slightly 
non-tiny gravitational wave effect, then it would probably obliterate us from 
whatever it was doing to make that wave.

Uhh... phew!
 
Guardian Australia’s Walkley-winning marsupial correspondent First Dog On The 
Moon is wondering whether it is a conspiracy?! (Of course he is.)

It’s not a conspiracy, but people on Twitter have asked similar questions 
about whether it was a coincidence that as soon as the LIGO machine (a “tube 
with a laser shooting through it”... broadly) was turned on, it detected a 
massive gravitational wave in action.
Keith Brewster (@k_brewster) 
@guardian <https://twitter.com/guardian> @MikeySlezak 
<https://twitter.com/MikeySlezak> Was it purely coincidence they captured the 
merger of these black holes? Seems so improbable.

<https://twitter.com/k_brewster/status/697934483241242624> 
Here’s First Dog’s question in full (caps original...):


As I understand it, these two black holes crashed into each other a billion 
years ago, a gazillion miles away in space – and the resulting gravity waves 
have been hurtling toward us ever since.

Is the arrival of these waves like a one off event? Or is it like the ocean – 
a constant rippling sort of thing?

Because if it is a one-off event it is a pretty amazing coincidence that all 
these scientists decided to flick the switch on the LIGO machine JUST IN TIME 
FOR THESE GRAVITY WAVES FROM A BILLION YEARS AGO TO ARRIVE ON EARTH.

THAT IS EVEN MORE OF AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE THAN PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING EVER!

Or have these waves just been pootling through here the whole time – and if 
they have, how can we then get the distinct “sound” of the two black holes 
colliding?

Katie says: They crashed into each other about a billion years ago and yeah, 
really far away (depending on how you measure it, somewhere around a billion 
light years away). And yeah, the waves have been coming toward us ever since 
(“gravitational waves”, not “gravity waves”, as it happens).

It’s a one-off for that PARTICULAR binary system — the two black holes have 
merged now and they’re done. But there are LOTS of systems like this around the 
Universe, and probably many more also happening right now. And if there’s a 
binary system that hasn’t yet merged, that’s sending us a kind of constant 
rippling.

I guess it’s a coincidence for this particular system, but we’ve missed all 
the other black hole mergers that have happened since the beginning of time – 
and there are lots more happening that hopefully we’ll now see.

In short: the Universe has been buzzing away with all this gravitational 
radiation forever and we’ve been completely unable to perceive it until now.
 
A lot of people on Twitter are asking whether the discovery helps in any way 
with time travel?

Katie says – sadly – no:

All we’re doing here is listening to the disturbances in spacetime caused by 
massive objects (like black holes) far away. We still don’t have any way to 
manipulate spacetime ourselves (except, you know, by curving it very very 
slightly by piling up rocks or something). Even if we could manipulate 
spacetime easily, it’s not at all clear that time travel wouldn’t be completely 
ruled out by some as-yet unknown physical law.

Basically, you’d have to loop spacetime around itself in some complicated way 
and then travel through that loop and it’s so far beyond what we can even 
conceive of ever doing, even theorists think it may not be possible in 
principle.

It’s important to remember that spacetime is the sort of background in which 
everything happens, and it can be curved and stretched and squeezed and stuff, 
but that stretching and squeezing never reverses time. It can slow it down or 
speed it up, but that’s about it.
 
You guys will have to excuse me while I get my nerd on here for a second. This 
is something I’ve been wondering...

So as Katie just explained 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2016/feb/12/gravitational-waves-an-astrophysicist-answers-your-questions-live?page=with:block-56bd29ebe4b0bef6d53d3a72#block-56bd29ebe4b0bef6d53d3a72>
, they’re detecting tiny changes in the size of spacetime itself. But how can 
you measure that?

I mean, let’s say I try to measure the size of something with a ruler. If 
spacetime itself shrinks, both the thing I’m measuringand the ruler itself will 
shrink – so according to my ruler, it wouldn’t have changed size.

Here’s what Katie said:

Great question! To measure it we rely on another of Einstein’s great insights 
– that the speed of light is constant NO MATTER WHAT. That means that when you 
shoot a laser through a 4km tube (which is what the LIGO machine does) and that 
tube gets a little bit longer because spacetime is stretching, light just keeps 
on at its usual speed and so takes a little longer to get to the end.

So with LIGO, it’s set up so that the laser light going through each arm comes 
together at the middle and matches up perfectly (to cancel out), but when a 
gravitational wave comes through, one arm gets a little longer and the other a 
little shorter.

So the light takes a little longer to get down one arm than the other, and 
that messes up the perfect alignment at the middle, so you can see that the 
perfect cancellation has been lost. Assuming nothing else moved the mirrors, 
it’s a sign spacetime itself changed shape!
 
Here’s a great question from a Twitter correspondent to get us started.
msatonienne (@msatonienne) 
@guardian <https://twitter.com/guardian> @MikeySlezak 
<https://twitter.com/MikeySlezak> what is the substance of the wave? I.e., what 
is it that's moving?

<https://twitter.com/msatonienne/status/697940087796080640> 
Katie: Spacetime! The fabric of the Universe. Einstein’s big insight was that 
space and time are both tied in together in this sort of single concept called 
spacetime, and it can curve and stretch and squeeze... What we feel as gravity 
is just how we experience the curvature of spacetime around massive objects. 
Gravitational waves are fluctuations of curvature in spacetime.

Michael: Hang on. “Fluctuations of curvature in spacetime”?

Katie: Yeah, so when you’re close to something massive, spacetime curves in 
toward that mass (usual visual analogy: a bowling ball making a dent in a 
rubber sheet – though you have to imagine that in a higher dimension!).

As a result, the paths of other masses and even of light get diverted a bit 
toward that mass, because the spacetime they’re travelling through is bent.

A gravitational wave is when spacetime ripples happen – the curvature of empty 
space gets disturbed because of the mass accelerating in some way nearby 
sending ripples through the space around it.

It’s kind of like if you put a bowling ball on a trampoline and then bounce it 
up and down – it sends little wobbles of disturbance out.
 
So, physicists have announced the discovery of gravitational waves.

You’ve heard they’re “ripples in the fabric of spacetime”. You’ve heard they 
were a prediction of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. You 
probably even know the waves that were detected were created when two massive 
black holes circled each other and violently collapsed. You can read all about 
the discoveryhere

, and we’ve already answered a few questionshere

But we know you’re still brimming with questions! So here we have Dr Katie Mack
 <http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~kmack/>, an astrophysicist from the University 
of Melbourne. She’s on hand to answer Everything You Wanted To Know About 
Gravitational Waves But Were Too Afraid To Ask.
