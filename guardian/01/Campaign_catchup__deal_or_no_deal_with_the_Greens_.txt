With polls suggesting a tight contest, could we be heading towards another 
minority parliament?

The Greens seem happy to fan that analysis, with Adam Bandt, the MP for 
Melbourne, telling Radio National the party would be open to forming a “stable 
progressive government” with Labor.

Labor and Liberals accuse each other of collaborating with Greens

But he said Labor seemed to be of the mind that it either governed alone, or 
not at all, which he said was a “a pig-headed approach”.

Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, certainly indicated that was still the 
party’s endgame: “We are playing to win,”she said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/10/australian-election-2016-warning-over-aaa-rating-as-greens-back-labor-in-hung-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-5731080ae4b0af04cb8898cc#block-5731080ae4b0af04cb8898cc>
, “not playing to be part of a coalition government. Every seat we lose to the 
Greens makes it more likely we’ll have Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister.”

And later, in Townsville, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, quoted The Castle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/apr/04/the-castle-rewatching-classic-australian-films>
 in his out-of-hand dismissal of the idea – yep, telling Bandt he was 
“dreaming”.

As Guardian Australia’s Bridie Jabour noted in today’s election blog 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/10/australian-election-2016-warning-over-aaa-rating-as-greens-back-labor-in-hung-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-57310353e4b07f53f216b141#block-57310353e4b07f53f216b141>
, even entertaining the idea ofpotential alliances and preference deals 
presents the government with the opportunity for a scare campaign. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/10/labor-liberals-greens-asylum-policy>

Sure enough, Malcolm Turnbull later asked voters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/10/australian-election-2016-warning-over-aaa-rating-as-greens-back-labor-in-hung-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-57313d9fe4b002f4e7ed87cc#block-57313d9fe4b002f4e7ed87cc>
 to “consider what it would be like if we have the same old Labor with the same 
old deal with the Greens”.

This won’t be the last we hear of the possibility of a Labor-Greens 
government, no matter how keen Labor, at least, are to strike the idea from our 
minds.

The two major parties continued their campaigns along the lines established 
yesterday, which is broadly to say, businesses (with some robots) versus 
schools (and Indigenous issues).

Country matters

Turnbull’s day began at the Mitre 10 hardware store in Forde. Branch owner Ian 
Gill was in favour of the tax cut the Coalition has to offer, telling Guardian 
Australia’s political editorLenore Taylor he’d use it either to employ more 
people or make more profit. On how this latter point would assist jobs and 
growth,Turnbull said it was 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/10/australian-election-2016-warning-over-aaa-rating-as-greens-back-labor-in-hung-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-57314018e4b07f53f216b176#block-57314018e4b07f53f216b176>
 “well understood ... that if you reduce the level of business taxes ... you 
will see more investment”.

Turnbull continued to beat the drum of jobs, growth and technology, speaking 
with enthusiasm about robots andlooking positively gleefully 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/10/australian-election-2016-warning-over-aaa-rating-as-greens-back-labor-in-hung-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-57314273e4b002f4e7ed87d2#block-57314273e4b002f4e7ed87d2>
 at an “acetabulum reamer” at a Brisbane hospital.

He said he could “see the spirit” of the government’s national economic plan 
(“the confidence, the optimism, the determination to get ahead” – that national 
economic plan sure sounds like a winner, doesn’t it?) all around him in
Queensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland>.

And once again, Shorten’s day began at a state school, this time in 
Townsville. It seems the setting is symbolic of what Labor believes the 
Liberals have forgotten (“The best way you demonstrate your bona fides is by 
... prioritising the proper funding of schools”).

Campaigning in north Queensland set him apart, he said, “because I will be a 
prime minister, if elected, who governs for all Australia, not just the cities 
of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane”.

Labor’s education spokeswoman, Kate Ellis, directly invoked the contrast with 
theCoalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition>, saying 
that Turnbull “may want to talk about youth and jobs but ... you don’t care 
about youth and jobs if you don’t care about an adequately supported, quality 
education system”.

But Labor was distracted from its desired talking point by questions over its 
boat policy, prompted by both the Daily Telegraph’s reporting of tensions in 
the ranks and the appearance of protesterscalling on them to 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/10/australian-election-2016-warning-over-aaa-rating-as-greens-back-labor-in-hung-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-5731430ae4b07f53f216b178#block-5731430ae4b07f53f216b178>
 “let them stay” at Shorten’s appearance alongside Herbert candidateCathy 
O’Toole.

The Liberal party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> 
took the opportunity to riff on Labor’s “100 positive policies” campaign while 
simultaneously capitalising on its reputation for being stronger on border 
protection.

Super-troopers 

The conservative thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs is gearing up to 
run an aggressive public campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/10/institute-of-public-affairs-plans-aggressive-superannuation-campaign>
 against the Turnbull government’s superannuation changes. Its members are 
furious at the super reforms revealed inScott Morrison’s budget, and met this 
morning to discuss how to formally oppose them.


Central to the issue is whether capping lifetime contributions to super and 
limiting the amount of super balances which can earn tax-free income are 
retrospective changes.

The government has insisted that’s not the case, with trade minister Steve 
Ciobo telling ABC News Radio this morning there was nothing retrospective about 
increasing a tax from zero to 15%.

But IPA executive director John Roskam told Guardian Australia the 
government’s proposed super changes had become an “absolute firestorm” among
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> supporters and 
IPA members, and the government’s claim that the changes were not retrospective 
had made people “even more angry”.

The simple question that polarised the Q&A panel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/may/10/the-simple-question-that-polarised-the-qa-panel-video>
: ‘If you lift my tax-free threshold, that changes my life,’ he said. ‘That 
means that I get to say to my little girls, “Daddy’s not broke this weekend. We 
can go to the pictures.” Rich people don’t even notice their tax-free threshold 
lift. Why don’t I get it? Why do they get it?’ 
Self-described Aussie battler Duncan Storrar is being hailed as a hero of the
