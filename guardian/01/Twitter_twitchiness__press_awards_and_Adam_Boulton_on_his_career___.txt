Media Society: Adam Boulton in conversation with Phil Harding

For a quarter of a century as the political editor of Sky News, Adam Boulton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/adam-boulton> was at the heart of British 
political debates and controversies.

Since Sky's launch in 1989, he has interviewed five prime ministers and 
covered five general elections. In 2010, he hosted the second of the historic 
televised debates between the three party leaders. He has won the Royal 
Television Society's coveted judge's award.

He has also been involved in some famous clashes: Gordon Brown walked out on 
him and, in the aftermath of the 2010 election, he lost his cool on air with
Alastair Campbell <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alastaircampbell>.

In his previous job, as political editor of TV-am, he was punched by Denis 
Healey during the 1987 election campaign.

Now, on the verge of relinquishing his political editorship and fronting a new 
evening show forSky News <https://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-news>, he has 
agreed to be grilled by former BBC executive Phil Harding.

The Media Society event is on 28 May, at the Adam Street Private Members Club, 
from 6.30pm until 8pm. To book a place go toEventbrite
