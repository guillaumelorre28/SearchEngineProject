The winner

Brad Pitt confirmed his enduring box-office power with a No 1 opening for 
Fury, grossing just under £2m over the three-day weekend period, plus £698,000 
in previews. A relatively straightforward second world war film about a 
five-man US tank crew, Fury didn’t necessarily offer an irresistible must-see 
hook, nor is it based on a particular real-life event that might have helped 
win it extra attention. But on-balance positive reviews (a 64/100 score at 
Metacritic) plus publicity generated by Pitt’sred-carpet appearance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/oct/20/fury-brad-pitt-shia-labeouf-bfi-london-film-festival-closing-night-in-pictures>
 at the London film festival will have helped.

Although different in tone, a comparison might be made with The Monuments Men, 
directed by and starring Pitt’s friend George Clooney. The starry art-rescue 
flick debuted earlier this year with £1.62m, on its way to £6.3m. With £2.69m 
already,Fury <https://www.theguardian.com/film/fury> looks on course to exceed 
that total. Pitt’s biggest UK opening weekend to date was delivered last year 
by World War Z, with £4.54m. The zombie-virus film is Pitt’s biggest hit 
globally, with £334m at cinemas.

Given the long delay between filming (late spring 2012) and release, 
expectations were suitably modest for Serena, a Depression-era drama starring 
Bradley Cooper andJennifer Lawrence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jennifer-lawrence>. Even so, a UK debut in 
lowly 19th place, with a dismal £95,000 from 185 screens, still qualifies as 
disappointing. Silver Linings Playbook, which likewise paired Cooper and 
Lawrence in lead roles, debuted in November 2012 with £1.25m, including 
£292,000 in previews. Just over a year later, the first weekend of wide play 
saw American Hustle (significant supporting parts for the actors) deliver 
£3.47m, including £1.11m in previews.

One lesson to be learned – or reinforced – from Serena is that it’s hard to 
market a period film without support from critics, especially if it’s not based 
on a familiar literary property or historical character. It’s fair to assume 
that Ron Rash’s novel is not so widely read in the UK, while the premise – the 
travails of two married North Carolina timber merchants in the 1930s – whispers 
minority appeal. Despite the presence of two marketable names in the lead roles,
Serena <https://www.theguardian.com/film/serena> suggested itself as a film 
that was always going to be highly execution-dependent, meaning director 
Susanne Bier had to deliver a fully achieved film to have any chance at all. 
It’s a risk that seems not to have paid off, at least for the film’s backers 
and distribution partners.

Landing three places above Serena, but with a screen average that’s actually a 
tad lower,This is Where I Leave You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/this-is-where-i-leave-you-review-tina-fey>
 is a similar disappointment. The family dramedy is not short of recognizable 
names in the cast – notably Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Adam Driver, Rose Byrne – 
but lacked a major box-office star. The film grossed £109,000 from 222 cinemas.

Counter-programmed as an alternative to Fury’s wartime action, Love, Rosie, 
adapted from Cecelia Ahern’s Where Rainbows End, landed rather softly in ninth 
place, with £373,000 plus £110,000 in previews. That’s way, way down on the 
debut of PS I Love You, likewise adapted from an Ahern novel. That one began in 
January 2008 with £1.79m, on its way to a very handy £10.65m. The half-term 
holiday may see an uptick this week for Love, Rosie, although the 15 
certificate would put it out of bounds to younger teens. The film currently 
enjoys a 7.5/10 IMDb user rating, suggesting that the audience has so far been 
largely satisfied. Rentrak’s UK box-office reports include takings in Ireland, 
where you’d expect Love, Rosie to be doing well – Ahern is a local author, and 
the book (if less certainly the geographically ambiguous film) is set largely 
in Dublin.

With the October half-term holiday starting last Friday, it’s no surprise to 
see a number of family films scrapping in the top 10. Among new entries, 
animationThe Book of Life <https://www.theguardian.com/film/book-of-life> did 
best, grossing a decent £981,000. Fox, which distributes internationally for 
DreamWorks Animation and has its own Blue Sky Studios (Ice Age etc), didn’t 
have the benefit of a recognisable animation brand for this title, instead 
trading on the cachet of producer Guillermo Del Toro.

Disney expanded its live-action family flick Alexander and the Terrible, 
Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alexander-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day>
 to all parts of the UK, with middling results (see chart). Neither of these 
titles proved much of a match for Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, 
convincingly the top attraction for families in its second week of play, and 
now with a 12-day cume of £7.89m. The Maze Runner, tucked behind The Book of 
Life in fifth place, is chugging along nicely, and has now reached £5.86m.

The Diwali festival is traditionally a good time to release a Hindi film, and 
Happy New Year, starring Shah Rukh Khan, delivered one of the best openings for 
a Bollywood film so far this year. With £568,000 from 100 cinemas, including 
£50,000 in previews, the action-comedy delivered an impressive screen average 
of £5,682. Within this market, Happy New Year has been eclipsed in 2014 only by 
Bang Bang, although that film’s £602,000 debut included a bigger proportion of 
previews, totaling just under £100,000.

Tamil title Kaththi, starring Vijay Chandrasekar, presented more serious 
subject matter, and also did well, achieving a £4,047 average (See “Other 
openers” chart).

With Fury, The Book of Life, Serena, This Is Where I Leave You 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/this-is-where-i-leave-you> and Love, Rosie 
landing collectively on more than 1,700 screens, and Disney’s Alexander… 
expanding to 450-plus locations, it was potentially tough for other fresh 
titles to be heard above the din. Going out into a more focused 147 cinemas, 
Aussie horror The Babadook did an encouraging £348,000, buoyed by warm reviews. 
The film may have done even better, had Annabelle not been proving so resilient 
in its third week of release (see chart below).

Polish hit Bogowie targeted the UK’s large Polish population, and grossed a 
handy £91,000 from 22 cinemas. The value of having an under-served and 
motivated audience can be seen in contrast to the result forJimi: All Is By My 
Side <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jimi-all-is-by-my-side>, which took less 
than a third of the Bogowie tally (£24,000) from a similar number of cinemas 
(29).

In its second weekend of play, Northern Soul fell 66%, although that hefty 
drop is perhaps understandable given that the opening weekend was boosted by 
venues holding one-off showings, and many of these locations were not 
continuing to play the title. The film grossed £97,000 from 76 cinemas in its 
second frame, bringing the 10-day cume to a nifty £507,000. The similarly 
themed SoulBoy grossed £101,000 over its entire run in 2010, and Northern Soul 
has already achieved quintuple that number. One factor in the softening 
box-office may be the arrival last Monday of Northern Soul on DVD; the film is 
currently No 3 in the Amazon DVD and Blu-ray chart, behind Mrs Brown’s Boys 
D’Movie and Maleficent.

With £17.06m to date, Gone Girl <https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl> 
has recently overtaken the likes of Bruno, Django Unchained and Basic Instinct 
to win sixth place in the all-time UK chart for 18-certificate titles. It will 
very soon overtake fifth-placed The Silence of the Lambs (£17.12m), leaving it 
behind just The Wolf of Wall Street (£22.70m), Hannibal (£21.58m), American 
Beauty (£21.39m) and Seven (£19.52m).

Despite the profusion of new releases that arrived for the half-term holiday, 
no current title is really energising the market, and box office is down 15% 
from the previous frame and 12% below the equivalent session from 2013, when 
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 ruled the roost. Thus ends the four-week 
run when box office ran ahead of the year-ago equivalent period. In two weeks’ 
time, Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar arrives. In the meantime, cinemas will 
have to content themselves this week with Jake Gyllenhaal in the justly 
regarded Nightcrawler; genre title Ouija; Daniel Radcliffe in Horns; and Mike 
Leigh’s much-anticipated Mr Turner.
