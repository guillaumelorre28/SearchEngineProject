Stardust's Music Sounds Better With You might crystallise just a few moments 
of euphoric clubbing for some. Nevertheless, for us Frenchies, it was what 
brought French music back into the game.

Despite cult followings abroad for the likes of Serge Gainsbourg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/serge-gainsbourg>, MC Solaar or Jean-Michel 
Jarre, not many French musicians have made the international charts. Not 
because there's a lack of enthusiasm for innovation from the French, but 
because the language barrier was difficult to overcome in an Anglo-dominant 
music world (Abba or A-ha would have never met the same success if they sang in 
Swedish or Norwegian).

Groundbreaking 1980s French indie acts such as Taxi Girl and Jacno remained 
the pride of few clued-up music lovers.

A simple twist of fate sowed the seeds for the French electronic music boom. 
Following the crackdown on illegal raves in the UK circa 1990, promoters such 
as Spiral Tribe exported their free parties to the rest of Europe and 
especially to France. DJLaurent Garnier <http://www.laurentgarnier.com/> 
started playing house music from Chicago and Detroit to eager French crowds. A 
crew of emerging DJ/producers such asEtienne De Crécy 
<http://soundcloud.com/etienne-de-crecy>, Philippe Zdar (later of Motorbass and 
Cassius), DJ Gregory, Shazz and Kid Loco starting making techno music, inspired 
by their roots in rock, hip-hop, funk, disco and jazz.

In the mid-90s, downtempo acts such as Air, La Funk Mob and St Germain 
triggered interest outside of the country. When Music Sounds Better With You – 
a collaboration between Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter and his friends Alain 
Braxe and Benjamin Diamond – hit the charts in 1998 and sold two million 
singles, the world finally started to take French pop seriously. Albums by Air,
Daft Punk <https://www.theguardian.com/music/daft-punk>, Cassius and Phoenix 
all contributed to putting French music back on the map again.

This first wave inspired a second generation of French beatmakers in the 
noughties, from the electroclash ofMiss Kittin <http://www.misskittin.com> and 
the Hacker to the dark minimal sounds ofIvan Smagghe 
<http://afewthingsfromivansmagghe.blogspot.co.uk> (originally part of the group 
Black Strobe) and the banging beats of Justice, DJ Mehdi, Kavinsky, Mr Oizo 
(who scored another UK number one with Flat Beat) and Para One: the beats get 
harder, louder and punkier but the pop element remains.

Now, a third generation of exciting young French producers are taking the 
genre to another level.Surkin <http://soundcloud.com/surkin>, Bobmo 
<http://soundcloud.com/bobmo>, Brodinski <http://www.brodinski.net>, 
Gesaffelstein <http://www.gesaffelstein.com> and the Club Cheval  
<http://www.clubcheval.net>collective are originally from all areas of France 
but have congregated in Paris. Thanks to the power of the internet and nurtured 
by French labels such as Ed Banger, Because, Citizen, Kitsuné, Sound Pellegrino 
and Record Maker, this innovative young generation have been able to release 
their records around the world. Madeon, a 17-year-old DJ/producer from the 
north of France, became widely popular last year thanks to a live mash-up on 
YouTube where he mixed 39 different tracks into one song called Pop Culture. As 
a result, he played at Coachella festival this year and toured with Swedish 
House Mafia.

At the mainstream end of the spectrum, David Guetta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/david-guetta>, Bob Sinclar and Martin 
Solveig have fed commercial dance music to the world with chart-topping club 
hits and bling collaborations with American pop stars. Even a notorious St 
Tropez nightclub owner called Jean Roch got to produce a track with Snoop Dogg 
and Paris Hilton. No one saw that coming.

Outside the dance music scene, the international success of indie-pop bands 
M83 and Phoenix – who won the Grammy for best alternative act in 2010 – has 
opened up a path for bands like Housse de Racket, theShoes 
<http://soundcloud.com/the-shoes>, The Dø  <http://thedomusic.com>and Pony Pony 
Run Run. Also on the rise areWoodkid <http://www.yoannlemoine.com/woodkid> – 
the dark electronica alias of pop video director Yoanne Lemoine – andGeneral 
Elektriks <http://www.general-elektriks.com>, an electronic pop solo project by 
Quannum-affiliated producer Hervé Salters. They have all made the decision of 
singing in English to conquer a more international market.

Meanwhile, in the vein of la chanson française, a traditional form of music 
where words usually overpower the melodies, artists such as Katerine, Alister 
and Lecop modernise the genre and reinvent a new way to play with the language. 
They make pop music sound good in French.

Hip-hop arrived in France in the early 1980s with the growing underground 
popularity of American graffiti culture and a vastly popular TV show called HIP 
HOP. Acts of the 1990s such as NTM, IAM, Assassin, Little MC,Ministère AMER 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minist%C3%A8re_AMER>, Les Sages Poètes de la Rue, 
113 and MC Solaar are the foundation of today's French hip-hop scene. As a 
reaction to the commercial hip-hop played on French radio these days, a crew of 
rappers includingOxmo <http://www.oxmo.net> Puccino, Dr Jazz and SI – mostly 
second generation immigrants growing up on the outskirts of Paris – release 
more organic productions qualified as "old school".

Young white rapper OrelSan <http://www.orelsan7th.com>, born in Normandy, is 
another name to watch. After releasing polemical single Sale Pute (dirty whore) 
in 2009, on which he directs his verbal venom at an ex-girlfriend who cheated 
on him, the rapper sparked a small political earthquake dividing the 
conservative parties and freedom-of-speech defenders. It's about time: French 
music is not just about love and roses.

Live act to watch – Housse de Racket <http://www.houssederacket.com/>


Parisian pop-rock duo who put on a great live show. Their last album Alesia 
was produced by Philip Zdar of Cassius.

DJ to watch – Breakbot <http://soundcloud.com/breakcloud>

Signed to Ed Banger, this DJ/producer can transform a dancefloor with 
everything from old disco tunes to banging techno.

Venue to watch – La Cigale <http://www.lacigale.fr/en/>

Modernised by Phillipe Starck in the 1980s, this fin de siècle concert hall 
has played host to everyone from Prince to Red Hot Chili Peppers to Justice.

Club to watch – Social Club <http://www.parissocialclub.com/> 

Home of the Paris bloggerati, expect to hear banging techno and electro from 
the likes of Para One, Breakbot and the Club Cheval collective.

Hangout to watch – Le Sans Souci  
<http://www.parisbouge.com/bar/paris/715/sans-souci>

A great dive café where you can hear alternative rock, new wave and pop. No 
big-name DJs, just good music. Always packed.
