Dropped in any new town in the US, I know where to buy heroin, crack or 
marijuana in a few minutes: near the McDonald’s in the poorest section of town.

That isn’t to say drugs don’t cut across all economic strata, that addiction 
can’t affix itself to almost anyone, anywhere. It can. But the larger reality 
is poorer neighborhoods are far more affected by addiction; theuse of and trade 
in illegal drugs is higher 
<http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13030313>, more open 
and visible <https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/usa/Rcedrg00-05.htm>, and treated 
as a crime not a tragedy. 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/30/white-people-are-more-likely-to-deal-drugs-but-black-people-are-more-likely-to-get-arrested-for-it/>

This isn’t a statement about the character of the people who live there, but 
about the character of the neighborhood they live in: the lack of opportunities 
it offers, how aggressively and unfairly it is policed, and the failure of 
institutions within them. As a result illegal drugs, and the violence around 
them, have sadly become a “normal” part of the community.

This is also not a statement about the residents: the majority do not use 
drugs. Yet a lot of those who do are visible and aggressive, with the 
accompanying violence upsetting and unfairly defining the neighborhood.

The area surrounding the intersection of Bailey and Genesee in the east side 
of Buffalo is like that. It has a poverty rate four times the national average, 
and the impact of drugs is in your face. The intersection contains a 
McDonald’s, a Chinese take-out and a liquor store, and entering any of them 
means being immediately approached by people asking for money.

 Jennifer by the McDonald’s in East Buffalo. Photograph: Chris Arnade 
Jennifer (her name has been changed) was the first to ask me for $2, before I 
could leave my car in the McDonald’s parking lot. “For food. I don’t use drugs 
now. I have though, just weed but not crack. Not today though.” She said this 
with an urgency that defied her words. I offered to buy her a Big Mac, but she 
said she didn’t eat such things, and changed her reason for needing the money 
to getting a bus.

I asked to see her arms. As she rolled up her sleeves revealing track marks, 
she laughed, “You must be a cop?”

She smiled after I told her I wasn’t, “Well then you a minister or a drug 
counselor, otherwise you wouldn’t be about here. Or maybe you want to buy 
something.”

I explained I didn’t need anything, I was writing about drugs. I gave her the 
$2. After posing for a picture and giving an interview, she crossed the street 
to a group of young men standing in front of a corner store, bought a small 
package from them, walked down the street and climbed into an abandoned home.

 Buffalo’s population was cut in half within 60 years. Photograph: Chris Arnade 
The next person to ask for money as I crossed the parking lot was Anthony (his 
name has been changed), who was precise in his intentions for the money: “For 
drugs.” He told me how he started using them at 17, first cocaine and then 
crack, and how he has spent the last 40 years shifting between the streets, 
jail, and group homes. He uses the McDonald’s bathroom to wash up in, “when the 
nasty store manager who runs me out isn’t there.”

The neighborhood around the intersection has been hit particularly hard as 
Buffalo’s population was cut in half from 580,000 in 1950 to 258,000 now. It is 
sparsely populated with closely spaced homes, many unfilled (42% of homes are 
vacant <http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ny/buffalo/bailey-doat/>), or vacant 
lots emptied of prior homes, reminders of its busy past.

Then, it housed people who worked in steel mills (Lackawanna Steel Co the 
largest), auto plants, and other factories. Those are gone now: the jobs moved 
overseas, down south, or the industry bankrupt by technology. The factories 
haven’t been replaced and new jobs haven’t come. Empty fields behind barbed 
wire have taken their place.

The resulting vacuum has brought joblessness, poverty and drugs. There are 
dealers openly slinging on about one-fifth of the corners. There are needles 
and empty liquor bottles clustered along the worn paths snaking across vacant 
lots. There are folks such as Anthony and Jennifer asking for money outside and 
inside of most every business.

Economic pain and drugs have defined the neighborhood, which has further 
distanced the residents from traditional opportunities – like education and 
jobs.

As Robert J Sampson writes in his sociological study of Chicago, Great 
American City 
<http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo5514383.html>: 
“Neighborhoods are not merely settings in which individuals act out the dramas 
produced by preset scripts … but are important determinants of quantity and 
quality of human behavior in their own right.”

We know family matters, we know friends matter, yet neighborhoods matter 
almost equally. They have a character affecting the lives of those who live 
there; they have personalities that influence residents and determine who 
chooses to be a resident.

Chris Arnade 
In this part of Buffalo, residents see dealers on the corner, see folks living 
on the streets shooting up in empty lots, have to navigate a scrum of users 
looking for money to get into the McDonald’s. They hear shots at night, and 
then have to walk past homemade memorials of candles and liquor bottles for 
neighbors killed. They themselves have an almost even chance of having an aunt 
or uncle or step-dad or brother in jail, or in rehab, or in addiction or 
battling addiction.

It means when they are stressed, depressed, or coping with a trauma – and with 
poverty often comes depression, abuse, or ill health – turning to drugs is too 
easy. It is an ugly feedback loop of joblessness, hopelessness and trauma that 
provides fertile grounds for illegal drugs.

Amplifying this is a national drug policy that treats addiction amongst the 
wealthy as a tragedy, and amongst the poor as a crime. The result is the 
disproportionate arrest and incarceration of those in poverty, especially 
African Americans, who are more likely to get arrested, more likely to face 
charges, and more likely to get jail time than wealthier users. It can turn a 
youthful mistake or a bad period into a lifetime stigma, and it further 
decreases the chances of getting a job, increasing the hopelessness.

The neighborhood isn’t only caught in an ugly cycle of poverty and drugs, it 
also draws users to it. Group homes for mental illness, methadone clinics, 
rehabilitation centers and homeless shelters are all there because wealthier 
neighborhoods refuse them.

John is a constant around the Buffalo neighborhood, weaving through the 
streets, shouting profanities (and then apologizing). He lives in a home nearby 
because of his disability (Tourette syndrome), where he gets a monthly 
allowance. He came here 15 years ago from a small town 40 miles from Buffalo, 
drawn by the ease of getting crack, and stayed because of the shelter. Now he 
only drinks “high gravity liquor to feel low gravity”.

When he is able, he waits outside the McDonald’s to collect money. “I get 
money from old folks. They understand my situation. Some used to be like me but 
now they go to church. The younger kids just beat me up.”

 Grady Thompkins would love to buy a place in the neighborhood. Photograph: 
Chris Arnade 
I found Grady Thompkins, 56, standing in an empty field eyeing a vacant home. 
“I would love to get this place in shape, but nobody gonna give me a job, or 
lend me any money, with my record.” When I asked him how big his police record 
was, he stretched his arms as far as they could go and smiled, “THIS BIG! I 
spent 30 years in a Georgia jail, just left two years ago.”

He did time for dealing and using drugs, and for the violence that unfolded 
around that. “I got some assaults on my record, but nothing that nobody didn’t 
have coming to them for playing the game we played.” He came to Buffalo to be 
with family, and chose this neighborhood because “this place understands me, 
understands my past. Nobody gonna get up in my face or judge me for having done 
what I did.”

For residents who were present before factories left, not getting depressed 
and caught up in drugs has been hard.

 Derek Anderson’s family was one of the first African Americans to move in the 
neighborhoods. Photograph: Chris Arnade 
Derek Anderson, 51, moved into the neighborhood when he was five. His family 
was one of the first African Americans to move in, surrounded then by mostly 
Polish neighbors.

His parents moved to Buffalo from the south for jobs, and to escape the 
racism. They found jobs but they also found racism, “Nobody would let us black 
kids play basketball. They put up large signs on the courts saying, ‘Nigger go 
home’. If we crossed certain streets, over into Schiller Park for instance, we 
were beat up.”

His dad worked at the Chevy plant nearby, but as Derek approached working age 
the jobs were fewer and fewer. They are completely gone now.

“Everybody used to be able to get their dads’ jobs. They were handed down like 
an old heirloom, but when I got my turn there was nothing to hand down.”
He turned to dealing drugs for a stretch, something he admits without a pause. 
“Oh yeah, I got caught up in that stuff, everyone did. Dealt crack and 
marijuana, but put that way behind me.”
Now he drives tractor-trailers and fork lifts. His friend Kevin, when I asked 
about drugs, laughed with a knowing smile, “I did some stuff, but who hasn’t 
around here. Not now though.”

Everyone I met was open about their or relatives past involvement with drugs. 
I heard it despite being a stranger and despite them knowing I would write 
about it. There is no embarrassment, and why should there be? It is their 
reality and it is a reality for almost anyone who lives in or surrounding by 
poverty.

Plenty of residents don’t and haven’t used drugs. They have office jobs, and 
try to stay above the fray. You see their homes nuzzled next to abandoned 
houses. Porches with Christmas decorations, lawn furniture, and toys next to 
porches behind police tape and tagged with “NO GAS” signs.

The sociologist Orlando Patterson has noted 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/opinion/sunday/the-real-problem-with-americas-inner-cities.html?_r=1>
, contrary to stereotypes, that most who live in these neighborhoods are, 
“law-abiding, God-fearing and often socially conservative …. Their youth share 
their parents’ values, expend considerable social energy avoiding the violence 
around them and consume far fewer drugs than their white working- and 
middle-class counterparts, despite their disproportionate arrest and 
incarceration rates.”

Yet you don’t see those residents out much. They spend their time inside 
trying to keep their children in school, church and away from the drugs. Their 
hopes and desires aren’t any different from folks in wealthy neighborhoods; 
just the hurdles they have to overcome are greater.

 Katie Hall and her son: ‘We don’t go out much, certainly not at night.’ 
Photograph: Chris Arnade 
Katie Hall is one of those mothers. She has six kids, her oldest is 31 and her 
youngest, Mikel, is six. “We don’t go out much, certainly not at night. Crime 
is just too bad and there are too many shootings. Everybody who is out is 
either doing violence, selling drugs, or a walking zombie from drugs.”

She is trying to get out of the neighborhood, but can’t afford any other 
place. “I dropped out of high school when I got pregnant with my first child at 
15. I am limited in what I can do. Still, I try my best to keep my kids in 
school and away from violence.”
The violence they fear is real – the number of murders and violent assaults in 
Buffalo is four times the national average 
<https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/crimestats>, with most of the crimes 
clustered nearby, making the rate around the McDonald’s far worse. The violence 
often involves drugs, although few in the community ever say that, preferring 
euphemisms like “street life” or “gang activity”.

You see it in the popup memorials scattered about, collections of votive 
candles, liquor bottles, pictures and small tokens to the person killed.

Curtis Smith was killed on his 29th birthday 
<http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/east-side/man-shot-to-death-at-his-own-birthday-party-on-box-avenue-20150723>
. His memorial is centered on a telephone pole next to the playground the party 
was held in. Five months later colored goodbyes are still chalked in the road.

His friend Trigger, who walking by, was friendly but terse. “He was killed, on 
his birthday, for jealousy. He had a bit of money. I miss him every day.”

The newspaper report never mentioned 
<http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/east-side/man-shot-to-death-at-his-own-birthday-party-on-box-avenue-20150723>
 drugs, using street euphemism instead:

Buffalo homicide detectives say the shooting might have been gang-related, 
though Smith’s family members insist he walked away from street life several 
years ago to focus on his children and a career as a party promoter. And while 
there are believed to be many witnesses, police on Thursday said they have 
received “zero cooperation”.

An older neighbor, who demanded we speak inside away from prying eyes, was 
more blunt. “Running the streets, flashing money he got legally and illegally. 
You do that, someone gonna get cross. Kids escalate things.”

Me: “Was it about drugs?”

Him: “What do you mean about drugs? Sure he used and dealt a bit, but everyone 
has done that once or twice.”


Dmitri was standing on an empty corner early Sunday morning, near a memorial 
of clustered Hennessy bottles.
Me: “You know the story behind the memorial?”

Dmitri: “My Uncle TJ. Got killed. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

Me: “My condolences.”

Dmitri: “No worry man. Things happen out here. You just happy to wake up alive 
each morning.”


The violent death of young men doesn’t just fill the streets with memorials, 
it fills the memories of those who live there, always lurking beneath the 
surface of any conversation. When I speak to mothers, expecting stories of 
violent deaths, I shy away from asking about their children.

Sheri, 54, told me her story without me asking. I was photographing a colorful 
house in an otherwise drab street. Two men, standing in the shadows, ran out to

The men turned to me: “Why you around here with that camera? Get out of here. 
We don’t know you. You could be a rapist. Leave or else we gonna make you 
regret.”
Sheri rolled down the street, raising her voice at the men in a firm but 
resigned manner. “What you two doing acting all foolish. You usually got smiles 
for everyone, but now you acting like fools. Leave this man alone, and get on 
with your lives.”

She placed her wheelchair between the men and myself, and turned to me as they 
walked away. “Don’t worry about them. They moved in here a few months ago, they 
usually don’t cause trouble.”

Sheri, 54, grew up on the block. Her dad worked for Harrison Radiator

, before the plant closed. “Most who still live here are good, own their own 
home, but most of the homes are gone. This street used to be filled with kids 
playing. Then the homes fell vacant, and the only people who moved in here are 
like those two, drug dealers or kids who use drugs.”

“They remind me of my only child. He was killed when he was 16. You know, I 
miss him every day, but I feel sorrier for the mother of the boy who killed 
him. She has to go every Sunday to prison and see her child locked up. He still 
alive, but he is dead.”
