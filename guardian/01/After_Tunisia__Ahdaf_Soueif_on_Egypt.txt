Change has already happened. What the long term will look like we can't tell. 
But the feeling in the country is altered. The feeling is, to steal Mr Obama's 
catch-phrase: "Yes, we can!" This is a revolution of the young, with the old 
playing a supporting role. They organised it via Facebook and in virtual 
meetings. And when they went down into the streets they saw how many they were 
and how varied. Jean Genet, describing the "Palestinian revolution", said that 
the atmosphere was like Paris in '68 but with good humour and courtesy. This is 
what it feels like here. These high spirits and this feeling of empowerment – 
we've not had this for a very long time. This is change.
