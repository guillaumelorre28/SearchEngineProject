What is the most famous painting in the world? Easy. The Mona Lisa. Not 
Constable's The Hay Wain, not Van Gogh's Sunflowers, not Hokusai's The Great 
Wave, not any of Turner's seascapes or Monet's ponds and lilies. When we think 
of the archetypal painting, the one all of us can identify from infancy, it's a 
woman's face, faintly smiling.

Pierre de Corlay called her "the very essence of femininity", Walter Pater 
said that she is "what in the ways of a thousand years man had come to desire." 
Freud saw in the Mona Lisa an image of the woman's face which is the first we 
all learn to seek out: the enigmatic mother. Perhaps he was right. For a baby, 
the face of the mother is the most important image in the world. And we were 
all babies once.

I thought of this as I began to see Vic's image more and more after the band 
broke up. Her face, over and over. Alone, she was bigger than the three of them 
had been together. Her first two solo songs were massive hits. And there was 
her face, again and again. Page 17 of Metro: "How to get the Vic look" with 
makeup tips. A cosmetics company asked her to be their face.

What is it that we're looking for when we want to find that female face, to 
stare at it, to recreate it

? Perhaps we don't even know ourselves.

I thought I'd work on a painting of her; she was amused, flattered. At first I 
asked her to sit for it but she was too jittery, couldn't sit still. And soon 
she was too busy.
