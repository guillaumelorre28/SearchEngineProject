The Australia batsman David Warner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/david-warner> has been fined by the 
International Cricket Council after questioning how South Africa worked on the 
ball during last week's second Test at Port Elizabeth.

The tourists were 126 without loss and then lost all 10 second-innings wickets 
for just 90 tolose by 231 runs

 as Dale Steyn produced a hostile spell of reverse swing to take four for 55.

That led Warner to question the actions of South Africa, and in particular AB 
de Villiers, with the New South Wales opener telling Sky Sports Radio: "We were 
actually questioning whether or not AB de Villiers would get the ball in his 
hand and, with his glove, wipe the rough side every ball. That's another thing 
we have to try to bring up with the umpires."

Now the ICC has responded, fining Warner 15% of his match fee after he pleaded 
guilty to a charge of making inappropriate comments.

"Warner was found to have breached Article 2.1.7 of the ICC code of conduct 
for players and player support personnel, which relates to public criticism of, 
or inappropriate comment in relation to an incident occurring in an 
international match or any player, player support personnel, match official or 
team participating in any international match," read an ICC statement.

"It was disrespectful for David to publicly denigrate an opponent when 
commenting on a match-related incident, and imply that a South African player 
was engaging in sharp practice," said Roshan Mahanama of the Emirates elite 
panel of ICC match referees.

"I'm sure David will be careful when making public comments in future."
