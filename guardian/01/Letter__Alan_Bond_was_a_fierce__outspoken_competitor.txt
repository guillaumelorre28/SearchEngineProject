Alan Bond <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/05/alan-bond>, 
or Bondy, as he was universally known to sailors, was a man who let nothing 
stand in his way. From his early competitive sailing on the Swan river to the 
beginnings of his international challenges, he was a fierce, outspoken 
competitor and to say that he mellowed would be a massive overstatement.

Only Bondy could front up to the elite of the New York Yacht Club with a 
canary yellow challenger for the America’s Cup, as he did in 1974 with Southern 
Cross, and then exploit the accepted nationality rule three years later when he 
introduced a Californian match-racing tactician into the crew of Australia, and 
had the New Yorkers running wild.

His final challenge for the cup further exploited the rules and in doing so 
with Australia II, Bondy broke a 132-year stranglehold – the longest tenure in 
sporting history – to take the America’s Cup home with him to Fremantle and 
give rein to a new competition for the oldest continuously contested trophy in 
sport.

Bondy had more than his fair share of ups and downs in all areas of his life – 
commercial and personal – but once he had accepted a friend, he never lost 
them. Throughout the world, Bondy will be sadly missed by his many friends.
