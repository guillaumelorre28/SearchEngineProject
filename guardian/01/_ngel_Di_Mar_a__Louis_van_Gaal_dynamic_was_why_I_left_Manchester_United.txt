Ángel di María has admitted he had a difficult relationship with Louis van 
Gaal and that was the prime reason he left Manchester United forParis 
Saint-Germain <https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain> in the 
summer.

Van Gaal signed Di María from Real Madrid in August 2014 for a British 
transfer record £59.7m but the Argentinian struggled to adapt to the Dutchman’s 
playing style and he also had off-field problems,eventually joining PSG for 
£44.3m

. The latter includedhaving his rented home broken into

 when Di María and family were present.

But not seeing eye-to-eye with Van Gaal proved to be the defining factor in Di 
María’s departure. “I didn’t get on very well with the coach, so I think the 
decision to join Paris was the best solution” he toldLe Parisien

. “After [the break-in] it wasn’t reasonable to stay. My family wasn’t happy. 
My daughter was suffering. So it was important to leave.

“Honestly, we were not happy. At the beginning, we were a little. But then 
things became complicated. Life in England was a bit difficult. It is not easy 
for a South American. Some people get on fine, and for others it is harder to 
adapt.”

United not being in the European Cup was also a disappointment. “Last season 
was tough for me. I didn’t play much and it was difficult watching the 
Champions League on television, when I had won it the season before with 
Madrid,” Di María said.

“From the little I have seen, our life here in France resembles more the life 
we led in Spain or Portugal. And at the moment we are 100% satisfied.”
