After recently flying home from holiday I opted to stay in London with a 
friend. Overnight, our luggage was stolen from our car parked outside, even 
though there were no obvious signs of entry. We reported it to the police, who 
issued an incident number.

When I rang Aviva <https://www.theguardian.com/business/avivabusiness>, with 
whom we have our travel, home and car insurance, we were told that none of the 
three policies would cover us for the £1,000-plus loss.

I stupidly did not take up the extra option of covering luggage on the travel 
insurance, so fair enough there. I’ve been told our car insurance policy won’t 
pay out because there was no visible sign of entry. Our home cover doesn’t 
cover us either. You have to wonder what the point of insurance is.SP, Bridport

Your letter highlights the need to read insurance documents closely and 
consider for what you are buying insurance. You shouldn’t beat yourself up 
about not adding luggage to the travel policy because they rarely cover luggage 
when you are in your home country. And if you had claimed on your car policy, 
Aviva would only have paid out a maximum £150 – as per the terms of the policy 
– and it would have probably hiked your premiums as a result.

The best way to cover contents outside the home is to add this to your home 
insurance policy. This typically costs around £28 a year, and will sometimes 
include bicycles too.
