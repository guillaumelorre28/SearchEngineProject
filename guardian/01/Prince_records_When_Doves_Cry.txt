Suddenly Michael Jackson had competition. The lead single from Prince's 
self-mythologising album and film project Purple Rain added further weight to 
the notion that he was, arguably, the more naturally talented ofÂ the two.

The last song delivered for the album and movie project, but the first single, 
When Doves Cry was No 1 in the US for five weeks, its lyrics a Freudian drama 
that mixed parental and relationship troubles, drawn from his own upbringing.
Prince <https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince> was named after his father's 
own stage persona, and when his parents split up he became determined to better 
his dad on piano. Such was the fuel that drove him to record an album that 
knocked Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA off the top of the charts.

Purple Rain had another, unintended consequence. Having bought the album as a 
present for her 12-year-old daughter, Tipper Gore, wife of Al, was horrified by 
the lyrics to Darling Nikki. Gore then embarked on a crusade against all things 
mucky in pop, founding the Parents Music Resource in 1985, the pressure group 
whose lobbying resulted in warning stickers plastered on the front of offending 
CDs.
