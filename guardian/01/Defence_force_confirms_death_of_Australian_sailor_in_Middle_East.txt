regret” it can confirm the death of a sailor deployed in Operation Manitou on 
HMAS Darwin.

“The ship was in Muscat, Oman <https://www.theguardian.com/world/oman> on a 
scheduled port visit and the sailor was on shore leave in the city when he was

it said.

“Defence is providing support to the sailor’s shipmates and family and asks 
that media respect the family’s privacy at this difficult time.”


The defence force said its investigative service is assisting local 
authorities with investigations and “as such it is not appropriate to provide 
further details at this time”.

“Defence extends its deepest sympathy to the sailor’s family and friends.”
