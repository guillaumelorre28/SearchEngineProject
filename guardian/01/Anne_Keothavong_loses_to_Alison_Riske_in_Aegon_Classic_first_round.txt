The British No5, Anne Keothavong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong>, bowed out of the Aegon 
Classic in the first round on Monday with a 7-5, 6-2 defeat to the American 
qualifier Alison Riske.

Keothavong, handed a wild card for the event at Edgbaston Priory Club in 
Birmingham, was broken six times in the course of the 92-minute match as she 
lost to an opponent ranked 44 places higher in the world rankings.

The seeds Hsieh Su-wei and Ayumi Morita were early casualties on the opening 
day as they were beaten by Jamie Hampton and Alison Van Uytvanck respectively. 
Hampton eased past the No10 seed Hsieh 6-2, 6-3 while Belgium's Van Uytvanck 
needed just 49 minutes to beat the 11th-seeded Morita of Japan 6-4, 6-0.

There were no such problems for the former Wimbledon semi-finalist Tsvetana 
Pironkova, who beat Lauren Davis of the United States 6-2, 6-1. Other early 
winners included the Croatians Mirjana Lucic-Baroni and Ajla Tomljanovic, the 
American Madison Keys and Vesna Dolonc of Serbia.
