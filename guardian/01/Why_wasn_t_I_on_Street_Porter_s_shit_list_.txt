I have to admit I was disappointed not to have been on Janet Street-Porter's 
revenge shit-list, having been one of her fiercest critics when she was 
foolishly made editor of theIndependent on Sunday in 1999.

Mind you, she has had plenty of detractors down the years, so maybe she was 
spoiled for choice.

For the record, as she revealed in the Daily Mail last week 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1322974/Oh-I-glory-grudge-Theres-I-love-getting-back.html>
, the list includesAA Gill, Jeremy Clarkson, Rod Liddle, the entire cast of 
Gardeners' World, Richard Ingrams, museum director Neil MacGregor, Julian Barnes
, the blessedMarina Hyde and Kelvin MacKenzie.

Kelvin hits back in his Sun column today, referring to Street-Porter as 
"Shergar's only living relative", which is illustrated with aPrivate Eye-style 
picture of the pair.

I can't wait for Gill's response. Perhaps it will come should he review 
Street-Porter'sChannel 4 programme this Sunday, The Genius Of British Art.
