The 2000 Olympic gold medallist Audley Harrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/audley-harrison> has announced his 
retirement from boxing.

Harrison became the first British fighter to win an Olympic gold medal in the 
super-heavyweight division when he was victorious in Sydney but he has 
flattered to deceive in the paid ranks.

While he challenged for a world title, two first-round knockout defeats – the 
latest of which cameagainst Deontay Wilder  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/27/audley-harrison-crumbles-defeat-70-seconds>
over the weekend – in recent months have convinced the 41-year-old to end his 
career. His professional record stands at 31 wins and seven losses.

In a statement on his website 
<http://www.audleyharrison.com/index.php/audley-statement-im-retiring/#more-891>
 entitled "I'm Retiring", he said: "There are only so many times you can fall 
before it becomes foolhardy to continue. I've fallen a lot, but winning the 
heavyweight title was a destination I really wanted to get to. Coming back from 
adversity has been synonymous with my life.

"I've done well to turn my life around, but sadly my dream to be a legitimate 
world champion will be unrealised.

"I believed if I was mentally and physically right, I could figure these young 
guns out. Saturday was my final chance to prove it. The thing that pulled me up 
was pride, so I wanted a chance to continue and go out on my shield. It was not 
to be …"

After the Olympics, Harrison signed a two-year, 10-fight deal worth £1m with 
the BBC which drew a welter of criticism and earned him the nickname "Fraudley" 
when he proceeded to fight a succession of journeymen.

His first four opponents comprised a private eye, a plastics factory worker, a 
part-time nightclub bouncer and a former publican who ran a car park near 
Bristol airport.
