Alisher Usmanov <https://www.theguardian.com/business/alisher-usmanov> has 
given his first meaningful response to Stan Kroenke's takeover of Arsenal by 
raising his bid for the remaining shares in the club to £14,000 each.

The Uzbek businessman has spent £2.15m on Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> shares over the past week, 
taking his stake in the club to 27.37%. However, with the American's control of 
almost 64% of the shares confirmed last week, Usmanov's actions have been 
little more than a token gesture that cannot alter the ownership of the club.

Usmanov will nonetheless hope that Kroenke will not be able to increase his 
stake beyond its current level. The Russian's purchase offer is also a message 
to the 8.66% of independent shareholders who remain that he would like them 
either to retain their interest or to sell to his Red & White investment 
vehicle.

Last month Usmanov said: "I'm not going to sell. Arsenal can't do without me."
