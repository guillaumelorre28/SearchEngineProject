 in Northern Ireland over the weekend.

The three were Brian Anthony Sheridan, 34 and from Blackwatertown, 35-year-old 
Brian Francis Cavlan from Dungannon and Dominic Edward Dymes, who is 39 and 
from Castleblaney in the Irish Republic.

The men were charged with having firearms, preparing for acts of terrorism and 
having articles likely to be of use to terrorists.

A detective sergeant for the Police Service of Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> told the court that when 
questioned, all three said the weapons, which were found in a car, were to be 
buried and not used.

All three refused to stand in the dock when ordered to do so by the 
magistrate. They claimed they had been on their way to bury the weapons which 
the security forces discovered in southArmagh

All were remanded in custody to appear in court again next month.
