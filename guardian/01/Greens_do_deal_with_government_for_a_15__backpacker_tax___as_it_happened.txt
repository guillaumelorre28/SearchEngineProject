Night-time politics

 * The backpacker bills have moved to the Senate now. While Labor’s Penny Wong 
is speaking against the Coalition-Greens compromise, the bills are set to pass 
with 30 Coalition votes and nine Green votes. The bills set the backpacker tax 
rate at 15% with a 65% superannuation tax rate on departure and $100m towards 
Landcare. The deal will save the government less than it had planned in the 
budget and less than the 13% rate would have delivered. But Landcare is the big 
winner.

 * Richard Di Natale praised it as a good deal, Barnaby Joyce commended the 
Greens for their good works. Malcolm Turnbull praised the Greens, One Nation 
and Nick Xenophon for their good works. And we all shuffled off into a parallel 
universe.

 * And the backpacker tax, in its various iterations, took up most of the day.

 * At the beginning of the day, protestors hit the parliament for a second day 
in a peaceful protest, unfurling a banner on the front of the building. It 
spurred on the Speaker, Tony Smith, to pass the new security measures through 
the House. 
Thanks for everything, readers, to the brains trust Katharine Murphy, Paul 
Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Mike Bowers.

See you next year – barring blow-ups – and Merry Christmas.

Good night.

Now the backpacker superannuation tax rate bill has passed the lower house at 
a rate of 65%.

The two backpacker bills will now return to the Senate, amended and are 
expected to pass the Senate tonight – all things being equal.

Labor senator is playing for LOLs in the senate. He says he really wants to 
likeRichard Di Natale but he keeps making these deals with the Coalition. He 
doesn’t blame theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> - they want the deal - 
but the Greens are supposed to be centre left.

A feel like a burnt lover, Mr President.

Penny Wong is teasing Liberal senater Jonathon Duniam and senator Nick McKim – 
both from Tasmania and not overly fond of each other. 

We could senator Duniam and senator McKim in a picture together maybe with a 
love heart around it – brothers in arms.

Richard Di Natale supports the change in hours to get the backpacker tax bills 
through.

George Brandis accuses Labor of delaying the Senate chamber because they are 
upset at the deal done on the backpacker tax.

Labor are grumpy, he says.

Penny Wong answers:

It’s probably his last sitting day, so he’s probably feeling a little 
sensitive.

On the extra cost of Landcare, Malcolm Turnbull has a newfound love.

It really is a great investment. It supports so many groups across the 
country, so many volunteer groups, and we’re very pleased to be able to do 
that. Extremely pleased, actually. And as far as the overall – the deal on the 
tax – as you’ve heard from the treasurer, this is a saving, but of course it 
does preserve for all time that 15% rate.

Dennis Atkin asks: Isn’t it embarrassing to have the party of Black Jack McEwen
 rescued by inner-city Greens?

Look, I think that, once more, politics is about getting things through and 
what I think is important for my people, for people in regional areas, is 
they’re going to get their fruit picked, they are going to get cash coming in, 
that money is going to go into the towns.

Scott Morrison: 70% of something is better than 100% of nothing

Scott Morrison is asked: you’ve given up on your savings?

We’ll achieve over 70% of the revenues that were set out in the budget. And in 
the 45th parliament, it’s about getting things done, and you’ve heard me say 
often and the prime minister, that 80% of something is better than 100% of 
nothing. Well, today it’s 70% of something rather than 100% of nothing.

 * The backpacker bills have moved to the Senate now. While Labor’s Penny Wong 
is speaking against the Coalition-Greens compromise, the bills are set to pass 
with 30 Coalition votes and nine Green votes. The bills set the backpacker tax 
rate at 15% with a 65% superannuation tax rate on departure and $100m towards 
Landcare. The deal will save the government less than it had planned in the 
budget and less than the 13% rate would have delivered. But Landcare is the big 
winner.

 * Richard Di Natale praised it as a good deal, Barnaby Joyce commended the 
Greens for their good works. Malcolm Turnbull praised the Greens, One Nation 
and Nick Xenophon for their good works. And we all shuffled off into a parallel 
universe.

 * And the backpacker tax, in its various iterations, took up most of the day.

 * At the beginning of the day, protestors hit the parliament for a second day 
in a peaceful protest, unfurling a banner on the front of the building. It 
spurred on the Speaker, Tony Smith, to pass the new security measures through 
the House. 
Thanks for everything, readers, to the brains trust Katharine Murphy, Paul 
Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Mike Bowers.

See you next year – barring blow-ups – and Merry Christmas.

Good night. 
 
Now the backpacker superannuation tax rate bill has passed the lower house at 
a rate of 65%.

The two backpacker bills will now return to the Senate, amended and are 
expected to pass the Senate tonight – all things being equal.

Labor senator is playing for LOLs in the senate. He says he really wants to 
likeRichard Di Natale but he keeps making these deals with the Coalition. He 
doesn’t blame theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> - they want the deal - 
but the Greens are supposed to be centre left.

A feel like a burnt lover, Mr President.

Wow. The ego. Would have cost budget less to support @AustralianLabor

achieved a better deal.

Penny Wong is teasing Liberal senater Jonathon Duniam and senator Nick McKim – 
both from Tasmania and not overly fond of each other. 

We could senator Duniam and senator McKim in a picture together maybe with a 
love heart around it – brothers in arms.

Richard Di Natale supports the change in hours to get the backpacker tax bills 
through.
 
George Brandis accuses Labor of delaying the Senate chamber because they are 
upset at the deal done on the backpacker tax.

Labor are grumpy, he says.

Penny Wong answers:

It’s probably his last sitting day, so he’s probably feeling a little 
sensitive.
 
The Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> Senate 
leader,George Brandis, is now trying to vary the business of the Senate to 
allow for the backpacker bills.
 
Christmas cheer.

On the extra cost of Landcare, Malcolm Turnbull has a newfound love.

It really is a great investment. It supports so many groups across the 
country, so many volunteer groups, and we’re very pleased to be able to do 
that. Extremely pleased, actually. And as far as the overall – the deal on the 
tax – as you’ve heard from the treasurer, this is a saving, but of course it 
does preserve for all time that 15% rate.
