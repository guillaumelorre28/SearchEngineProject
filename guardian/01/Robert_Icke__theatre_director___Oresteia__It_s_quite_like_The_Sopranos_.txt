Do you have a theatrical background?
No, my mum’s a teacher and my dad’s a tax inspector.

What turned you on to directing?
It was seeing Kenneth Branagh as Richard III 
<http://www.branaghcompendium.com/richard3.html>, directed by Michael Grandage 
at Sheffield. I was 14 and my dad dragged me away from my PlayStation. It was a 
proper Damascene conversion - really electric. There was no language barrier. I 
wrote to Michael Grandage and asked him how he did that stuff. He said: if you 
come and see me I’ll try to tell you. This was before I’d ever been near a 
proper rehearsal room. He gave me all this advice, which I scribbled down and 
have been living by ever since.

Didn’t you direct at a theatre in Stockton-Tees while you were still at school?
That’s where I learnt to do it. It was a very depressed area. You weren’t 
allowed to be boring: the audience there would just have left. I remember the 
first performance ofA Midsummer Night’s Dream when Bottom came on in a donkey’s 
head with these amazing false teeth made by a local dentist. The audience 
didn’t know the story. They gasped with laughter. You heard them saying 
“Fucking hell!” That has never really left me. You don’t want to waste time 
being reverential: you want people to have a real rollercoaster.

Your productions often throw uncertainty on the truth.
One of the joys of Shakespeare and the Greeks is that you don’t have to make a 
single closed-down interpretative decision. That’s characteristic of all great 
drama. There’s always a possibility that the Macbeths might not kill theking. 
The human mind is full of ambiguity. You don’t really know what you’re going to 
do until the moment you’re doing it. When Nora leaves at the end ofA Doll’s 
House, you think: what the hell happens next? Does she turn around after 30 
seconds? At the end ofThe Shining – I love Stanley Kubrick – all your literal 
versions of what might be going on are spread out in front of you like a 
smorgasbord.

Adaptation as like using a foreign plug. You have to find the adaptor which 
will let the electricity of now flow

And in Oresteia?
The whole point of the drama is that you see both sides. It does not condemn 
anyone. You say I’d hate to be Agamemnon, and I don’t know what I’d do. And I’d 
hate to be Clytemnestra, and I don’t know what I’d do. You love your family and 
you love your wife and your country and your soldiers. And you are being made 
to choose who, what and where you love, and that is horrible.

Did you always have a cast in mind?
Lia Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/22/blood-oresteia-aeschylus-tragedy-almeida-globe-home-theatre>
 is the only person I could think of who would be able to do both extremes of 
Clytemnestra, who could believably be a good and loving mother of small 
children, and also someone who could drag the body of her husband across the 
floor in a tarpaulin as she killed him. I asked her to pencil the date in 
before I’d finished the play.

How hard was it to write your adaptation?
I have a bit of Greek so I could stagger my way through. I feel you have be 
100 per cent faithful not to the letter of the original but to the impulse that 
motors the whole thing forward. In my head, the play is quite likeThe Sopranos. 
I think of adaptation as like using a foreign plug. You are in a country where 
your hairdryer won’t work when you plug it straight in. You have to find the 
adaptor which will let the electricity of now flow into the old thing and make 
it function. That’s the long job.
