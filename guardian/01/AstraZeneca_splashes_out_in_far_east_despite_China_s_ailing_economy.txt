AstraZeneca <https://www.theguardian.com/business/astrazeneca> is splashing 
out hundreds of millions of pounds on buying the lung drug portfolio of Japan’s 
Takeda and deepening its presence in China, despite the country’s recent 
slowdown.

The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker wants to create a new global hub for drug 
development in China alongside those in the UK and Sweden, with up to 50 
scientists based in Shanghai and Wuxi City.China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> is AstraZeneca’s second-biggest 
market by sales after the US, and one of its fastest growing areas.

Britain’s second-largest pharmaceutical company has struck a strategic 
alliance with Chinese biologics firm WuXi AppTec to produce innovative
biological drugs

 (proteins or living cells that are derived from human or animal genes) in the 
country. AstraZeneca has the option to acquire WuXi AppTec’s biologics factory 
in Wuxi City for $100m (£66m) and will invest $50m to build another site 
alongside it.


The alliance builds on a joint venture between the two companies to develop 
and sell MEDI5117, a biological treatment for autoimmune and inflammatory 
diseases, in China.

AstraZeneca plans further investments totalling hundreds of millions of 
dollars developing and making drugs in China over the next few years. Its China 
headquarters are in Shanghai and it now employs more than 11,000 people in the 
country, after entering in 1993. It has factories in Wuxi and Taizhou and an 
innovation centre in Shanghai, which is focused on developing treatments 
tailored to Asian patients.

AstraZeneca’s push into China comes despite the country’s economic slowdown, 
which hasaffected the pharmaceutical market, through restrictions on the use of 
antibacterial drugs at hospitals

on health insurance payouts. At the same time, Beijing’s crackdown on 
corruption led to a damaging scandal anda record 3bn yuan (£312m) fine for 
rival British firm GlaxoSmithKline

.

Separately, AstraZeneca has agreed to buy Takeda’s core respiratory division 
for $575m, which will give it the global rights to a key lung drug, sold as 
Daliresp in the US and Daxas in other countries, for the treatment of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. AstraZeneca has been marketing the drug in the 
US since buying those rights early this year.

The latest deals come after a string of other acquisitions and alliances, 
along with disposals, aimed at helping AstraZeneca return to sales growth in 
2017 and meet its long-term ambitious sales targets. It is battling to replace 
lost revenues as its biggest selling drugs come off patent, such as cholesterol 
pill Crestor next year. When the board fended off a £69.4bn takeover bid from 
New York rival Pfizer in May last year, chief executivePascal Soriot pledged to 
raise annual sales by 75% to $45bn by 2023
