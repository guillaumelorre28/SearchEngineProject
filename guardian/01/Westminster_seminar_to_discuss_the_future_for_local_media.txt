Whither local media? It’s the question that publishers, editors and 
journalists are asking all the time (I’m not certain about the public though).

Anyway, it’s a subject due to be tackled next spring at a Westminster Media 
Forum seminar, “The future for local media: ownership, revenue models and 
policy priorities.”

Among the speakers will be Nigel Dacre, a director of Notts TV who chairs the 
Local TV <https://www.theguardian.com/media/local-tv> Network, and Jeff Henry, 
chief executive of the Norwich-based publisher, Archant. It will be chaired by 
Torin Douglas, former BBC media correspondent and now a visiting professor at 
Bedfordshire university.

Expect also to hear from Geraldine Allinson of the KM Group; Steven Barnett of 
Westminster university; Joanne Butcher who runs the National Council for the 
Training of Journalists; and a speaker fromNational Union of Journalists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/nationalunionofjournalists>, not yet 
identified, but hopefully its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet.

It will take place on the morning of 21 April 2015. To book, go here
