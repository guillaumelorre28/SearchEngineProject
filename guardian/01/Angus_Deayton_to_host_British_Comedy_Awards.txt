hosting one of TV's toughest gigs, and now we're thrilled that he has."

Night, Hell's Kitchen and Comedy Sketchbook.

lewd messages left on Andrew Sachs' answerphone during the recording of Russell 
Brand's Radio 2 show.

However, both Ross and Brand are in the running to win awards on December 6.
