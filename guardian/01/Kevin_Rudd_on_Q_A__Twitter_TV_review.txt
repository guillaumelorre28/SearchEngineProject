If you can't do #qanda <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23qanda&src=hash> in the 
week before the election, with 750,000+ pre-poll votes in, and so far ahead in 
the polls, when CAN you, Tony?

"You and Tony Abbott seem like almost the same person" says young voter to 
Kevin Rudd. Audience reacts. Ouch.#qanda

Mmmm. A hostile mood here at #qanda 
<https://twitter.com/search?q=%23qanda&src=hash>. The PM has reflexively begun 
to interrogate himself. Probably prudent.

Mr Rudd: How about a "fair go" for universities & not cutting university 
funding. Unis are doing it tough enough as it is.#qanda

Access to affordable childcare is a major factor in determining a women's 
ability to return to work. Not paid maternity leave#qanda

#qanda <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23qanda&src=hash> Isn't it interesting 
that those speaking up who do the caring - teachers, single parents & now a 
nurse - are all low paid women.

Indigenous policy not worthy of #qanda

Tonight's #qanda <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23qanda&src=hash> findings: 
Australians know no other pronouns than 'me' or 'I', want more money when they 
have lots and can't be positive.

This is the most impressive Rudd has been in entire campaign: feisty, 
eloquent, surprisingly human. Won't change the outcome though.#qanda
