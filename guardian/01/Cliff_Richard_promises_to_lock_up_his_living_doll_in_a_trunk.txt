Cliff was the UK's first rock star but within a year of his first hit with 
Move It, he was joined by a new band, the Drifters (later the Shadows), to 
record a version of the Lionel Bart number, Living Doll. It marked the arrival 
of a softer sound and a more family-friendly image, and sold more than a 
million copies. It was the first of Richard's 14 No 1s. (And in 1986, it 
returned to the top, inÂ a memorable version recorded with the Young Ones.)
