This has been a sensational year for fruit and berries. It's easy to hurl 
superlatives around, but apple and plum trees are weighed down with fruit, and 
raspberries have come into a second round of fruiting with big, juicy berries. 
In fact, all the fruits and berries are bursting with a stunning crop this 
autumn, with exceptional flavour, and it's all thanks to the weather.

The bitterly cold winter that froze the country back in late November and 
December was great news for orchards and berry bushes. These fruit plants need 
a decent bout of cold in the winter to trigger their growth the following 
season. In recent decades there has been a problem with such mild winters that 
our fruit plants weren't getting sufficient rest over winter to produce a good 
harvest the following season. Almost all the UK's fruit suffered, from 
blackcurrants to plums. The lack of cold was serious enough for blackcurrant 
growers to import New Zealand bushes capable of withstanding mild winters.

The cold winter was followed by the long hot spring, with record-breaking 
temperatures that made for a tremendous burst of growth and flowering. And just 
as the drought looked as if it would damage the fruits, the rains arrived in 
the nick of time and revived the young fruits. Even though the summer was 
dogged by showers and grey skies, the fruit continued to grow plump and sweet, 
much of it ripening weeks earlier than usual.
