My friends told me I'd been spending too much time with Vic. And it was true. 
Mr Matadides told me I couldn't take any more time off. And he was right. I 
hadn't painted, I hadn't worked, I'd hardly seen anyone else. And as far as she 
was concerned we were still just friends.

So I backed off, just for a while. I stopped returning her calls so quickly. 
When she offered to fly me out to Barcelona, I said I couldn't. When she wanted 
me to close the gallery in the middle of the day to come for lunch, I told her 
I had to work.

But it didn't last long. She telephoned me one night in tears, I could hardly 
understand her through the crying. I was at a restaurant with some friends but 
I stepped out into the cold night to listen to her sobbing. She couldn't make 
me understand what was wrong. She kept asking me to come to her. And so I did.

"It's everything," she said when I saw her. "Every stupid thing, everything 
that's ever happened, do you ever feel that? Just what is the point? What is 
the point of any of it?"
"Everyone feels that," I said. 
She looked up at me. Her eyes were focusing and defocusing, her face muzzy and 
confused.
"Then why does anyone carry on?" she said. "Why the hell do we carry on?

I hugged her tightly and said:
"We need to get you some help, honey."
She nodded, gulping into my shoulder.
