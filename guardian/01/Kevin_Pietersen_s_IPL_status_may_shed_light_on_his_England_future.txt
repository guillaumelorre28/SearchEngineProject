Kevin Pietersen's Indian Premier League status is set to be clarified on 
Friday as debate continues to rage over his future as an England player.

Pietersen's interest in the lucrative Twenty20 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/twenty20> tournament frequently strained 
relations with the England and Wales Cricket Board, although central contracts 
now contain leeway for IPL participation, with a cut-off this year of 13 May.

England may now prefer their leading players to shun the competition in favour 
of county cricket, however, after the Ashes humiliation. On Friday,IPL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ipl> franchises will announce their retained 
list for the forthcoming campaign. Pietersen is affiliated with the Delhi 
Daredevils, and if they choose to extend the relationship, he could miss five 
County Championship fixtures for the Brown Caps, which could cause further 
conflict.

Should, on the other hand, Pietersen's name be absent from the retained list 
it would open up the intriguing possibility of the 104-Test veteran withdrawing 
from the subsequent player auction and making a very public case for a place in 
England's summer Test plans.

On paper, that would seem an outside bet â€“ particularly given Pietersen's 
indifference to the domestic game since making his Test debut in 2005.

But he has always been aware of the prestige attached to the highest form of 
the game and on Wednesday made a point of tweeting his commitment to regaining 
the Ashes urn in 2015.

Avoiding the IPL for a season would doubtless cause him a financial hit but 
would underline that commitment better than any amount of social networking. 
His county employers, meanwhile, will be monitoring developments with interest.

Pietersen's Surrey contract is linked directly to his ECB deal, automatically 
renewing when he re-signs and expiring when he does not.
