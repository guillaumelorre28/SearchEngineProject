A clip from the film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/may/07/asif-kapadia-amy-winehouse-documentary-clip-video>
It marks her second posthumous Grammy: she shared a best pop duo/group 
performance with Tony Bennett in 2012 for the song Body & Soul. Winehouse died 
of alcohol poisoning in 2011, aged 27.

Winehouse won five Grammys <https://www.theguardian.com/music/grammys> in 2008 
for best new artist, song of the year, best female pop vocal performance, best 
pop vocal album and record of the year.

Winehouse’s success at the 2008 ceremony plays a pivotal part in Kapadia’s 
film. She’s seen performing via satellite for the awards show from London, as 
she was denied a US visa at the time to attend the Grammys live in person. It 
gives rise to one of the film’s saddest moments, when a friend recalls that 
Winehouse told her on the evening, “This is so boring without drugs.”

Amy is up for this year’s best feature documentary Oscar.
