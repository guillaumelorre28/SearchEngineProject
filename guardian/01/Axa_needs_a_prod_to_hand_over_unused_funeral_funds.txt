Last September my sister's partner of 27 years passed away. He had been paying 
into an Axa funeral policy for two years. Axa told her that the funeral 
expenses of £2,092 had been paid direct to the funeral director and that £1,588 
was still available for funeral costs. As there were no more she requested the 
balance be paid into her partner's estate.Axa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/axa> said as they were not married and he 
had died without making a will she needed a letter of probate to claim the 
money but, because they were not married, she cannot get this.AM, Redcar 

Given a nudge, Axa has found a fair solution to the problem. It is sending 
your sister an indemnity form saying she will reimburse anyone who turns up 
with a legal claim to the money. Axa will pay her £1,588 immediately she signs 
it.
