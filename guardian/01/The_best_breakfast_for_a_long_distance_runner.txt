I'm a long-distance runner: have you any thoughts about good breakfasts or 
snacks that will keep me going? I've been trying to drink the green, powdered 
"superfood" spirulina, but it tastes vile!Dave Jelley, North Yorkshire

When looking for sustained energy for long bouts of exercise, you want foods 
that will digest over a longer period of time. Blitzing your fruits into a 
smoothie will break up all the insoluble fibre and speed up its absorption, 
whereas bacon and egg with some fresh fruit will sustain you for hours and give 
you the full complement of fats, proteins and carbohydrates that you need.

A great advantage of long-distance running is you can eat really well without 
worrying too much about weight gain. That said, because your body is 
continually repairing itself, you need vitamins and minerals, plus the basic 
proteins, fats and carbs.

A breakfast of wholemeal toast and creamed spinach, topped with a couple of 
poached eggs, will fuel you all morning, whether you're going running or 
recovering after a run the day before.

A great snack alternative is hot chocolate: not the sugary and often tasteless 
variety available on the high street, but a simple blend of warm milk and 
top-quality cooking chocolate – generally anything around 70% cocoa solids. You 
need roughly 30g of chocolate per cup of milk – bring the milk to just below 
boiling and whisk in the chocolate. There is a little sugar to give you that 
initial boost, but not enough to play havoc with your insulin levels. Then you 
have the fat and protein in the milk to help fuel and repair you for a couple 
of hours, as well.

In short, I'd forget the weird and wonderful and make the most of all those 
delicious foods us mere mortals should be eschewing as we watch our waistlines.
