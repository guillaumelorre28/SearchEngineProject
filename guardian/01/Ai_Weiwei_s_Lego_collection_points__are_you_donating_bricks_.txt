Chinese artist Ai Weiwei <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei> 
has set up his first Lego brick collection point – a parked red car – in 
Beijing, after being inundated with offers of donations from supporters. Are 
you hoping to donate bricks? Tell us where and why.

Danish toy company Lego refused Ai’s bulk order of bricks for a new artwork 
about free speech for anAndy Warhol/Ai Weiwei exhibition 
<http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/exhibition/andy-warhol-ai-wei-wei/> at the National 
Gallery of Victoria in Australia in December, because of its political content.

Social media users were quick to support Ai offering their own bricks to the 
artist and setting up #legoforaiweiwei. As offers of bricks began to pour in, 
Ai vowed to use the donations,tweeting to the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/25/artist-ai-weiwei-accept-offers-lego-around-world>
 “yes, I will find a way to accept”.

Ai announced in an Instagram post on Monday, alongside a photograph of a red 
car sunroof, that he would now create “a new work to defend freedom of speech 
and political art.”

Ai has not disclosed the details of the piece he intended to make for the 
Australian show, but it is expected to be a version of a piece he first made 
for the prison island of Alcatraz last year. The piece used thousands of the 
plastic bricks to make floor mosaic portraits of prisoners of conscience and 
political activists, including Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and Nelson 
Mandela.
