Can you suggest any exciting and quick-to-make winter warmers of a vegan 
nature that aren't vegetable stew or variations on the same?

Sweet potatoes are a starch that I have loved since childhood so I'd like to 
suggest a sweet potato lasagne with leeks and spiced tomato sauce. The 
difference here is that the pasta is replaced with thin slices of sweet potato. 
The great thing about this staple is that it receives other flavours 
graciously: spicy, herby or hot – they can take it.

To make the tomato sauce, sweat a tablespoon each of chopped onion, carrot and 
celery with a clove of garlic in a tablespoon of olive oil. Add a pinch of salt 
to allow the vegetables to sweat without burning. As the veg begins to sweat, 
add a good pinch each of ground coriander, cumin and turmeric. When the veg is 
soft, add a tin of good quality chopped tomatoes. Bring to the boil, check for 
seasoning and simmer for 15 minutes before blitzing in the liquidiser and 
passing through a fine sieve.

Slice two medium leeks lengthwise. Chop the halves into 3cm lengths, then 
finely chop an onion. Gently stew the leek and onion in a little oil with a 
teaspoon of fresh thyme until tender. Season to taste.

Peel two medium sweet potatoes and slice them into ½cm-thin discs on a 
mandolin slicer. Cook on the griddle until almost soft. Layer the ingredients 
in a dish and finish with a dollop of spiced tomato sauce on top. Serve with a 
leafy salad and (vegan) garlic bread.
