It has been called the "Big Bang" of country music. Ralph S Peer, the producer 
who had supervised the recording of Mamie Smith's Crazy Blues, travelled to 
Bristol, a town straddling the Tennessee-Virginia border, in the summer of 
1927. Employing newfangled electronic microphones, he recorded for the first 
time both the Carter Family and the more raucous Jimmie Rodgers (as well as 
hillbilly singers such as Ernest V Stoneman) â€“ the acts that set the template 
for so much country music that followed.
