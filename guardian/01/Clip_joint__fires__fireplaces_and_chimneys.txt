What could be more atmospheric than setting fire to a load of coal and wood in 
your front room? Fireplaces can offer film-makers a handy means of creating 
ambiance, and can be useful storytelling props, even when there's no fire in 
the hearth.

Here are five film scenes involving fires, fireplaces and chimneys – can you 
think of any others? Let us know in the comment thread below.


1. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

Potter film, and promptly goes in the wrong direction.

2. Gone With the Wind <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrhNPS4nbmQ>


A suitable fiery first meeting for Scarlett and Rhett – she nearly brains him 
by lobbing a vase at the fireplace he's skulking in front of.

We don't actually see a fireplace in this scene, but we do get one of the 
grimmest chimney-related Christmas stories ever committed to film.
