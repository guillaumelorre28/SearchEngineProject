I've never really got Bruckner; live performances have often left me slightly 
cold, perhaps even a bit bored, wondering what all the fuss was about. (Though 
Tom Service's recent article 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/oct/06/anton-bruckner> on the composer is 
an enormous help.) Not so last night, when Claudio Abbado – a wisp of a man 
now, frail; only his enormous eminence preventing me from mentioning how much 
he resembles Montgomery Burns in the Simpsons – conducted the symphony with the 
Lucerne Festival Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

The boldness of the almost inaudible, yet utterly precise pianissimos. The 
sheer skill of the playing, that made a phrase begun on the flute and ended on 
the horn come as if from the same artist's breath. And Abbado's sheer grip on 
the structure, in which Bruckner uses traditional forms (sonata, minuet, fugues 
etc) and brilliantly both grows and destabilises, undermines them. Enough of me 
wittering: you must simplylisten again on Radio 3

; this with the added bonus of Tom Service speaking in the interval. It was one 
of the concerts of my life.
