The Sports Journalists' Association <http://www.sportsjournalists.co.uk/> 
(SJA) is expecting many sporting stars to attend its 62nd annual British sports 
awards lunch on 8 December.

Several servicemen and women will also be there because the SJA is supporting 
theTickets for Troops <http://www.ticketsfortroops.org.uk/> charity.

The event, which is being staged in London at The Brewery 
<http://www.thebrewery.co.uk/>, will be hosted by the SJA's president, Michael 
Parkinson, and presented by Jim Rosenthal and John Inverdale.

Among the contenders for the SJA's awards are golfer Graeme McDowell and his 
Ryder Cup team mates; Olympic skeleton bob gold medal winnerAmy Williams; 
diving tyroTom Daley; gymnastics world champion Beth Tweddle; spin bowler 
Graeme Swann; top jockey AP McCoy; swimmer Rebecca Adlington; and heptathlete 
Jessica Ennis.

The winners are chosen by the vote of SJA members who witness at first hand 
the achievements of sporting figures. That's why the awards have retained their 
credibility since they were first inaugurated in 1948.

Tickets for the three-course lunch plus wine (naturally) are still available. 
They're £80 plus VAT for SJA members; and a table of 10 booked by non-SJA 
members can be had for £1,200, plus VAT.
