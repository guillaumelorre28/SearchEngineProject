"It was confusing because I knew I wanted to help people. But at the same time 
there was fear. I was afraid." This was how Marcos Menjivao, 20, felt when a 
landslide savaged Chalatenango, El Salvador, in May 2010.

Yet despite being torn between duty and fear, Menjivao, along with 30 other 
young people, rescued about 80 individuals who were trapped on the other side 
of a muddy swamp.

"At the time of the rescue, a lot of people did not know why they were there," 
says Menjivao jokingly. "They just met other people and said: 'Where are you 
going?' 'We are going to rescue people' they said. 'I don't know what I'm going 
to do, but I'm coming too.'"

In the end, it seemed as if they did know what to do. Battering against the 
rocks and debris in water that ran high up to their waists, the rescuers used a 
rope to carry the people to safety. Menjivao accredits the successful rescue 
operation to the extensive training the community had received from Plan 
International over the years.

The youths' achievements were quickly noticed up by the National Commission 
for Civil Protection, and they were awarded a medal for their bravery.

"We never thought we would be rewarded for doing something that we thought was 
our duty to do," says Menjivao staring at the medal in his palm. "I am touched 
that our efforts were recognised."
