No one could deny that the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> semi-final against Tomas 
Berdych was tense but it wasn’t just Andy Murray who was putting his heart into 
the affair.

The Scot is no stranger to outbursts on court 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/02/andy-murray-wimbledon-grigor-dimitrov>
 but on this occasion his fiancee Kim Sears got in on the act at Melbourne Park 
with what appeared to be a lot of effing and jeffing in the direction of 
Murray’s Czech opponent.

Those at courtside thought that the words appeared to be “have that you flash 
fuck”

.

It certainly excited the attention of Twitter with the former British No1 Anne 
Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> among those 
retweeting the vine and adding the perhaps appropriate comment: “f****** 
hilarious!”

Murray defended her after the match, saying: “In the heat of the moment you 
can say stuff that you regret.”

It is not the first time player’s other halves have got carried away with the 
action. In November the Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka was 
apparently called a “cry baby” by Roger Federer’s wife Mirkaafter he appeared 
to indicate she was disrupting his concentration by talking too loudly

O2 Arena.
