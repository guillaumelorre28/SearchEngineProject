The Argentina winger arrived in Doha, where the French club’s owners are 
based, from South America on Sunday for talks with PSG officials before the 
medical. He will be presented by his new club at a press conference in Paris at 
5.30pm BST on Thursday.

Di María, 27, joined United from Real Madrid for a British record £59.7m fee a 
year ago but after a promising start to life with Louis van Gaal’s team, his 
form deserted him and he started only one of United’s final 10 games of last 
season.

In February his family were the victims of an attempted burglary

 at his home in Cheshire, when three men used scaffolding poles to smash patio 
doors before fleeing empty-handed when an alarm went off.

The French champions initially offered £28.5m (€40m) for Di María but that was 
rejected by United. His transfer could accelerate Van Gaal’s moves to sign 
Pedro from Barcelona, with reports in Spain suggesting the winger will be 
allowed to leave if a bid of €25m (£17.5m) is received.

Van Gaal has already bolstered his midfield for the new season with the 
signings of Memphis Depay, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin and 
is expected to secure the winger Ashley Young to a new contract, though it 
appears his principal target Sergio Ramos will be staying at Real Madrid.
