Q My uncle moved into a care home on the Isle of Wight late last year because 
he was unable to look after himself properly (he is now 95). He put his house 
on the market straight away but was unable to sell it until around March or 
April. He had lived in the house since about 1976. He is now being told he has 
to pay capital gains tax (CGT). This seems incredible to me. Can you please 
enlighten me?MA

A You should point whomever is telling your uncle that he is liable for CGT on 
the gain made on his home of 35 years in the direction ofHM Revenue & Customs 
(HMRC) Help Sheet 283 Private Residence Relief (pdf) 
<http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/helpsheets/hs283.pdf>. This clearly states that where a 
house has been someone's only or main residence throughout their ownership of 
the home, any gain made on it is exempt from CGT. The fact that your uncle 
wasn't able to sell until 2012 doesn't affect the CGT exemption as he has three 
years between moving out of the home in which to sell and he is clearly well 
within that time frame.
