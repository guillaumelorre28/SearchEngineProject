A fancy dessert to make for friends. It's simple to put together, not full of 
cream as tarts are wont to be, and the lemon curd offsets the richness of the 
hazelnuts and sweetness of the juicy raspberries. If you can't 
find raspberries, use figs in their place.

Serves 6

125g margarine
75g ground hazelnuts
75g plain flour
25g icing sugar
75g reduced-sugar lemon curd
Two punnets fresh, or 500g frozen raspberries, thawed
20cm tart tin

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4. Put the margarine, hazelnuts, flour and 
sugar in a food processor and whizz together until it forms a dough. If you 
don't have a food processor, rub the mix between your fingers and thumbs to 
make the dough. If you need to bind the dough, add a touch of water, but don't 
let it become sticky.

2. Line the base and sides of the tart tin by pressing the pastry into place 
with your fingers. If it feels too sticky to press into the tin, chill 
the dough in the freezer for 5 minutes beforehand.

3. Throw some baking beans into the tin and bake blind for 30 minutes until 
the pastry is golden brown.

4. Fill the tart with the lemon curd and artfully arrange the raspberries 
on top. Serve while it's still warm to catch it at its most delicious.
