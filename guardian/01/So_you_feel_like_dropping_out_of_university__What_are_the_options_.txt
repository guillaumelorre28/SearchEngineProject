A few days before I was due to return to university for my first-year exams, I 
decided not to. At the time, I felt like I was living in a solitary hell.

I’ve always struggled with my mental health, and this only worsened once I 
went to university. I lost my support network of family and friends and failed 
to find a new one. I went from being an extroverted, happy person with a love 
for my subjects to being completely withdrawn, spending days at a time in my 
room without leaving.

I wasn’t the only one: nearly one in 10 students fail to complete their 
degree, according to the Complete University Guide. It may be the course, the 
costs, the city, or the pressure – and leaving can be the best choice. But it’s 
worth considering your other options first.


Speaking up


Despite realising that things weren’t right at university, I tried to ignore 
it. I ended up festering in my own head-space. I wish I had told someone as 
soon as I felt low, but the pressure I felt at the time made it seem impossible.

Acknowledging that you aren’t enjoying yourself can be hard, but sometimes 
it’s necessary. There will usually be a variety of support services on offer –
as there were at Warwick <http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/mentalhealth/>, 
where I was studying – but they can’t help unless you say something.

You can find support at your university’s mental health and wellbeing 
services, advice services, or the university chaplaincy. Your campus might also 
have its ownNightline <http://nightline.ac.uk/> branch. There’s no shame in 
using them, even if your problems don’t seem “serious”.


Societies and clubs


Make sure you focus on the aspects of university life that you do enjoy, such 
as a sports club or a society. My experience with my university newspaper, for 
example, was a brilliant one. The other student journalists were welcoming and 
supportive, and I soon found a love for writing.

But during my second term, I found that I wasn’t writing as much, or attending 
any meetings. The insidious nature of my depression made me withdraw from my 
favourite activity, which turned into a vicious cycle. If you decide not to 
drop out, my advice would be to focus on your favourite pastime – it really can 
help.

A change of scene


If you do choose to leave, it’s worth considering a different university 
before quitting higher education altogether. You can use this opportunity to 
make sure you’re certain that it’s the right choice for you – right down to the 
details. Would you prefer to live in a bustling city, for instance, or a 
secluded campus?

Loren, who left her campus-based university, says: “I left because I didn’t 
like the course, the area I lived in wasn’t particularly nice, and there was no 
nightlife. I didn’t make very many friends because my campus wasn’t the uni’s 
main campus, so there weren’t many people around.” She is now in her first year 
at Southampton where she is living more centrally and is much happier.

Should you switch to another university?

Time out

Another option is to take medical leave, as one student, who prefers to remain 
anonymous, is currently doing: “I was too ill and unsafe to stay at university. 
It was really difficult to leave because I had such a strong friendship group. 
The university had good support and helped sort everything out for my 
suspension.

“I’ve now got a full-time job to earn some money before I go back in February. 
The medical leave has definitely given me the time and space to work on getting 
better.”

And if you find yourself having doubts while applying for university, you can 
always have a gap year through deferred entry, which would let you have a year 
off without worrying about obtaining a university place.
