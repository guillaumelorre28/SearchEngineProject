The blockbuster

Like The Walk last week, Crimson Peak is another mid-range-budgeted, polished 
studio film whose box-office swan-dive is tough to account for. The sumptuous 
production design and visuals came through loud and clear in captivating 
trailers; the film’s artistic and literary wellsprings have been professorially 
conveyed by director Guillermo del Toro on his new (and genuinely interesting)
Twitter feed <https://twitter.com/realgdt?lang=en-gb>; the reviews have been 
appreciative, mostly. But its $12.8m US debut 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/19/us-box-office-goosebumps-bridge-of-spies-crimson-peak>
 is truly disappointing – well beaten to the top spot by kids’ spooker 
Goosebumps ($23.5m) and way off the pace set for horror this year by M Night 
Shyamalan’s The Visit ($25.7m) in September. Critically, Crimson Peak is not 
part of the low-budget brigade that now dominates the horror field, but an 
expensive $55m jewel-case of a film that looks to be a rare misjudgement by 
Universal in an otherwise outstanding 2015.

 Crimson Peak – Guardian video review 
Crimson Peak review – evil springs from a psychosexually rich soil of horror

Del Toro has gone to great pains in interviews to stress that Crimson Peak is 
not pure horror, but rather a gothic romance. And with a 60% female audience, 
that notion seems to have connected to some extent. But Universal, bigging 
things up with a Stephen King endorsement and emphasising the ambience and the 
haunted-house aspects in thefull theatrical trailers 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oquZifON8Eg>, disagreed about the best way of 
selling Crimson Peak. So why didn’t it pierce through more effectively – surely 
the intention all along with Del Toro changing up the Spanish of Pan’s 
Labyrinth and his other arthouse chillers thus far for mainstream-friendly 
English? It is certainly miles away from the grainy, technologically fixated 
Paranormal Activity idiom that has been horror’s default setting since the late 
noughties, but that’s not a watertight explanation. Fellow slow-burn Victorian 
ghost story Woman in Black opened well in 2012 ($20.8m) on its way to a 
respectable $127.7m worldwide. But then it had Daniel Radcliffe fresh off Harry 
Potter; sharply talented and rising prospects though they are, Mia Wasikowska, 
Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain don’t have the same fanbases. Perhaps the 
lack of stars and concerted competition from The Martian and Spielberg’s Bridge 
of Spies for the upscale audience who might have been tempted by the film’s 
antique look combined to squeeze Crimson Peak.


It’s a blow for Del Toro, not only his worst wide opening since 1997’s Mimic, 
but more sadly a failure to resurrect a beloved but delapidated gothic form to 
wider relevancy. One glimmer of hope: internationally, it seems to be opening 
comparably to Woman in Black in many places. Russia (WIB: $1.8m; Crimson: 
$2.5m), Germany (WIB: $766K; Crimson: $864K) and Australia (WIB: $388K; 
Crimson: $608K) are all up. If Crimson Peak’s aristocratic verve can translate 
into solid word of mouth in the runup to Halloween, it might earn enough abroad 
for a reprieve.


The little guy

Hollywood doesn’t have a monopoly on good IP. Just outside this week’s top 10 
– taking $10m from 10 territories, says Rentrak – is French indie outfit Onyx’s 
adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s 1943 children’s classicLe Petit Prince 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince>. That you probably haven’t 
heard of it shows that Hollywood does have a monopoly on big-scale 
distribution. Starting with its French release on 29 July, it’s been rolled out 
quietly a country at a time, changing hands each time; hardly the deafening 
fanfare a US major would have given such a hallowed and visually iconic piece 
of culture on its first film treatment. Paramount handled distribution in 
France, and its specialist arm Vantage will take care of business for an as-yet 
undated US release. But the piecemeal approach, almost as demure as the prince 
himself, is risky because the film has serious costs to recoup: $80m,one of the 
highest European budgets ever 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_non-English-language_films>
. Presumably the mix of CGI and stop-motion techniques (the film blends 
Saint-Exupéry’s story with a modern plotline), as well as 3D and differing 
voice casts (including Vincent Cassel and Marion Cotillard in the French 
version, and James Franco and Rachel McAdams in the English-language one) took 
their toll.


Lacking unified Hollywood marketing has sometimes resulted in potential-rich 
French blockbusters, like the live-action Asterix franchise, not travelling as 
far as they should. But StudioCanal, masterminding the core European 
territories, managed to create some noise with its fine Paddington adaptation 
last year, ultimately pushing it to $259.5m worldwide. Le Petit Prince should 
be aiming somewhere close – and needs to with that budget. It’s currently 
labouring around $40m worldwide, but just scooped a $10.9m debut (according to 
some estimates) in China – better than Paddington ($7.4m). Separate 
distributors, though, means starting from scratch in every country to come: 
Mexico (6 Nov), Japan (21 Nov), Germany (10 Dec), South Korea (23 Dec), Russia 
(24 Dec).


The away game

Ant-Man was flirting with underwhelmitude by Marvel’s standards, but a $43.2m 
bow this weekend in China – the studio’s second highest behind Avengers: Age of 
Ultron – puts it well on the way to $500m. Having passed Captain America: The 
First Avenger and Thor on the scorecard, with a strong overseas showing (60.7%) 
for a character with almost zero pre-awareness, and the company’s thriftiest 
(if you can call $130m thrifty) effort so far,Ant-Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ant-man> is now a certified success.

 The film team review Ant-Man 
Chinese hits going the other way have unfortunately tended to register 
ant-sized grosses, but there are signs of progress on that score, too. Though 
you do have to observe at high magnification. Back in 2012, the huge indie 
smash Lost in Thailand took a miserable $57K on its stint in the States; the 
sequel has done $1.2m and counting, respectable for a foreign-language film in 
the notoriously subtitle-hating market. An even better bellweather is that 
time-travel comedyGoodbye Mr Loser <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwx31XWno54>
 – like Lost in Thailand, an indie dark horse at the Chinese box office – has 
also managed $912K in the US.China Lion <https://www.facebook.com/chinalionfilm>
 andAsia Releasing <http://variety.com/t/asia-releasing/>, the main conduits 
for Chinese cinema into the country, are obviously rapidly getting better at 
shepherding far-east box-office buzz over into the west. The $5m-$10m grosses 
Bollywood films sometimes muster in the States are the next step up.

Aside from Le Petit Prince, two new non-Hollywood contenders. In 15th place 
globally was French comedyLes Nouvelles Aventures d’Aladin 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dho779iL7M>, a mouthy, beur-accented ride 
into Arabian Nights territory that, with $5.4m, seems to have tapped into local 
comedy star Kev Adams’ teen fanbase. Also from Pathé, but handled by Fox in its 
initial UK engagement, was the Sarah Gavron-directed, Abi Morgan-scripted
Suffragette <https://www.theguardian.com/film/suffragette>. With Carey Mulligan 
playing a fictional composite of the many working-class women who struggled for 
enfranchisement in the early 20th century, $4.5m – 18th spot on the global 
chart – is her best debut so far; ahead of $2.5m for Far from the Madding Crowd 
and $656K for An Education. A bristling support cast (Meryl Streep, Helena 
Bonham-Carter, Romola Garai, Ben Whishaw) surely gave it a leg-up.

Vin Diesel forges ahead with his twin ambitions to both shoehorn his love of 
D&D roleplay into cinemas and find himself a franchise vehicle not dependent on 
heavy alliteration of the letter “F”. Distributor Summit will be hoping that 
$90m actionerThe Last Witch Hunter <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuG2JUgs_8>
 does better than 2004’s sci-fi fantasy love-in The Chronicles of Riddick 
($115.8m), the last time Diesel let his personal pastimes stray on to a film 
set; the new one heads out initially in the US, UK and a random-looking 
scattering of 15 or so territories across most continents. Meanwhile, the sixth 
and (they say) final Paranormal Activity, The Ghost Dimension, is poised to 
embarrass Crimson Peak on a wide rollout across 40 countries, mostly in Europe 
and Latin America for starters. Even if it doesn’t, a typically tight $10m 
Blumhouse budget virtually guarantees profit. And strutting into the gun sights 
for a solo date in the UK is Daniel Craig’s 007, ahead of the global shakedown 
the following week. Spectre has the unenviable task of keeping pace with its 
predecessor, Skyfall, whose $1.1bn worldwide was nearly double any previous 
Bond film. Perhaps, judging by the insane barrage of pre-release product 
placement, Sony have concluded the worldwide box office is not enough.
