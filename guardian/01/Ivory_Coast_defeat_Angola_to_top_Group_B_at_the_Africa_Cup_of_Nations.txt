A second-string Ivory Coast beat Angola 2-0 in their final group game at the 
Africa Cup of Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> 
to finish top of Group B with a 100% record.

The result meant that Angola <https://www.theguardian.com/football/angola>, 
who started the day in second place on four points and needed a win to progress 
to the quarter-finals, were eliminated by Sudan's 2-1 defeat of Burkina Faso – 
the first time Sudan have reached the last eight for 42 years.

Emmanuel Eboué scored in the 32nd minute and Wilfried Bony was handed a tap-in 
for the second after a defensive mix-up by Angola after an hour.

Ivory Coast <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ivorycoast>, who made nine 
changes from their win against Burkina Faso, will play the co-hosts Equatorial 
Guinea in the last eight and Sudan will play Zambia.

Angola's frustration boiled over after the match when around 20 riot police 
from the country entered the interview area outside the dressing-rooms to stop 
reporters asking questions of the players. One Angolan journalist said they had 
been threatened with reprisals on their return home if they showed television 
footage or reported the incident.
