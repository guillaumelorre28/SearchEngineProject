 A video shows Ariana Grande licking the doughnuts. 
Grande also faced a backlash for what she said in the video: “I hate 
Americans. I hate America.” Sheissued a statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/08/ariana-grande-donut-i-hate-america-video>
 apologizing for her actions but also claiming that she was upset by childhood 
obesity levels in the US at the time, andreleased a video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/10/ariana-grande-doughnut-video-apology>
 two days later entitled Sorry Babes to apologize once more.

In the video, the pop singer and actor said she should have focused on 
apologizing in her statement, rather than “preaching about my issues with the 
food industry”. She said she was “so disgusted” with herself and that the video 
was “such a rude awakening”.

Public health officials from Riverside County investigated the doughnut shop 
and it has been given a B score.
