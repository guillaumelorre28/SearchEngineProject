Exhibition of the week


Masters of the Everyday: Dutch Artists in the Age of Vermeer
Dutch art of the 17th century has a cool allure for modern eyes. The reality 
of it is so absorbing, the apparent use of optical instruments so precocious. 
But perhaps most of all, we recognise a world comparable with our own in these 
scenes of middle class domesticity. This exhibition includes the Queen’s two 
majestic Vermeers as well as works by Gerrit Dou, Gabriël Metsu, Jan Steen and 
Pieter de Hooch in a silent, subtle encounter with the art of ordinariness.
• Queen’s Gallery 
<https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/the-queens-gallery-buckingham-palace>
, Buckingham Palace, London, until 14 February.

Samuel van Hoogstraten – A Peepshow with Views of the Interior of a Dutch 
House (c 1655-60)
This delightful optical toy is the only object of its kind in the National 
Gallery. Peering through a circular aperture you see inside a Dutch 
17th-century house, with furniture, floors and windows all seemingly solid and 
real. It is a magical 3D illusion. There’s even a dog looking back at you.
