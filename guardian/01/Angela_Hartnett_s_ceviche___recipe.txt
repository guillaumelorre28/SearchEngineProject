Ceviche is a lovely fresh dish that is a perfect way to celebrate the end of 
the long winter. Diego, my Argentinian head chef at Murano, makes this lovely 
version for our menu. The key here is getting the freshest fish possible. It 
works equally well with scallops or sea bass, and if you fancy a bit more of 
a citrus kick, add orange segments.

(Serves two)
4 fillets of sea bream
4 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp fresh chillies, finely chopped
1 medium lime, juice and rind reserved
½ tsp ginger, grated
1 tbsp coriander, chopped
Freshly milled salt and pepper
2 spring onions, chopped

Ask your fishmonger to remove the skin and pin bones from the sea bream. Slice 
the fish at an angle into chunks 5mm thick and place on a large flat tray.

Mix the oil, chilli, ginger, lime juice and zest together, and season with 
salt and pepper.

Combine with the spring onions and the fish, place on a serving dish and allow 
to marinade for a couple of minutes.

Garnish with the chopped coriander and serve immediately with a green salad 
and toasted sourdough bread.

• This article was amended on 15 April 2013. The original suggested cutting 
the fish into chunks 50mm, rather than 5mm, thick. This has been corrected.
