Night time politics

We might finish up there, with the ABCC debate going on in the Senate and the 
country of origin bill in the House. It has been quite a day.

 * The Coalition backed down on the 19% backpacker tax, accepting a 15% 
compromise after steadfastly refusing any compromise since the last backdown in 
September this year. The government introduced new bills rather than amend the 
old ones and we expect they will get to the Senate by Wednesday. Barnaby Joyce 
said it was a win for the Nats because it was Labor’s tax, except that it 
wasn’t – it was introduced in the 2015 budget.

 * Joyce also said his decision to move the APVMA to his electorate was the 
right thing to do and was entirely coincidental that it was in Armidale.

 * George Brandis explained some of the details of the Bell litigation to the 
Senate, except the bit which explained why he implemented the legal direction 
to the solicitor general, forcing him to seek approval from Brandis before he 
gave advice to government departments. Brandis did explain that Joe Hockey was 
the one having a conversation with the WA government – a conversation that 
Brandis did not know about. (Hark! Do I hear a bus?) Penny Wong said Brandis 
should explain himself properly. Turnbull told question time he did not know 
the details of any verbal directions between the AG and the SG. He had 
obviously not sought to ask. Which is a worry.

Thanks to the brains trust Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Katharine Murphy. 


Mike Bowers, your pictures were tops.

See you on the morrow.

Goodnight.

New backpacker bills introduced into the house

The Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has 
introduced new bills for the latest backpacker tax rate of 15% and the $5 
increase in the passenger movement charge (PMC). These bills will likely be 
debated tomorrow and then go to the Senate on Wednesday though I have given up 
making bold predictions.

Both bills had previously passed the house and the Senate albeit with 
amendments.

What is it with goats?

The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, was asked about Labor’s 457 visa 
crackdown.The Daily Tele had a story 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/457-visas-labors-fryin-fryout-staff/news-story/def4870dea71de1c61a43fca2199c2ff>
 this morning about a deal done between fast food chains and the former Labor 
government.


The flood of foreign visas during oppposition leader Bill Shorten’s time as 
workplace minister 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/samantha-maiden-visa-posturing-gives-no-credit-to-shorten/news-story/0f560e577a09f236fcfc7d4b9185208e>
in the Gillard government also extended the program to 650 so-called 
professions including union officials andgoat herders.

The revelations will come as an embarrassment for an opposition leader who has 
sought to whip up a foreign worker backlash 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/foreign-workers-get-less-time-to-job-hunt-under-457-visa-changes/news-story/343169098bea70d57e4eb48c6a4b9e61>
 in the wake of the Trump victory in the US by claiming he wanted to crack down 
on 457s.

In one of the little-known labour agreements approved by Labor in 2012, 
McDonald’s was given sponsor rights to bring in 285 foreign workers. Hungry 
Jack’s hired at least 74 people on 457s, KFC brought in 88 foreign workers, 
while other lesser-known fast food outlets hired 32.

Dutton:

This is a leader of the opposition who says one thing outside of this chamber 
and a very different thing inside of this chamber. The leader of the opposition 
is here saying he wants to introduce a bill in relation to 457 visas ... When 
he was the employment minister, a minister in the Gillard and Rudd governments, 
he did the complete opposite. Can you imagine the surprise this morning when 
this leader of the opposition woke up to this headline in the Daily Telegraph: 
“Do you want lies with that?”

The government is, of course, narrowing the occupations allowed to come in 
under 457s. They are cracking down on 457s while at the same time as 
criticising Labor for cracking down.

Barnaby Joyce: APVMA move to my own seat coincidental

I did not hear the question but presume it is about moving the pesticides 
agency to Tamworth.

He says the Nats are very proud of its decentralisation policy.

Joyce says the NSW Labor government moved the minerals department to Maitland 
to one of its seats.

Of the APVMA move (announced during the election campaign when he was 
challenged by Tony Windsor), Joyce says:

It’s coincidental it’s in the seat of New England. It is absolutely a proper 
fit.

What’s your message to farmers today who are furious the way the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has handled this issue 
over the past 18 months?

Barnaby Joyce:

I’d say to farmers right from the word go we were the ones who brought $40m on 
the table to resolve the issue. Not the Labor party. We stated quite clearly we 
would resolve this issue. Not the Labor party.The Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> were the ones who 
brought about this rate in the first place.

This is not true.

This rate was brought in at the 2015 Abbott/Hockey budget.

There is a flock of Nats in the Senate courtyard speaking on backpackers.

Barnaby Joyce speaks first and then Fiona Nash. They are justifying the policy 
twists and turns, including the final landing spot.Nash says:

Politics is the art of what’s possible and we now have a 15% rate. It’s a very 
sensible outcome. It’s a good outcome. Compromise is reality in this parliament.

We might finish up there, with the ABCC debate going on in the Senate and the 
country of origin bill in the House. It has been quite a day.

 * The Coalition backed down on the 19% backpacker tax, accepting a 15% 
compromise after steadfastly refusing any compromise since the last backdown in 
September this year. The government introduced new bills rather than amend the 
old ones and we expect they will get to the Senate by Wednesday. Barnaby Joyce 
said it was a win for the Nats because it was Labor’s tax, except that it 
wasn’t – it was introduced in the 2015 budget.

 * Joyce also said his decision to move the APVMA to his electorate was the 
right thing to do and was entirely coincidental that it was in Armidale.

 * George Brandis explained some of the details of the Bell litigation to the 
Senate, except the bit which explained why he implemented the legal direction 
to the solicitor general, forcing him to seek approval from Brandis before he 
gave advice to government departments. Brandis did explain that Joe Hockey was 
the one having a conversation with the WA government – a conversation that 
Brandis did not know about. (Hark! Do I hear a bus?) Penny Wong said Brandis 
should explain himself properly. Turnbull told question time he did not know 
the details of any verbal directions between the AG and the SG. He had 
obviously not sought to ask. Which is a worry.

Thanks to the brains trust Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Katharine Murphy. 


Mike Bowers, your pictures were tops.

See you on the morrow.

Goodnight.
 
The Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has 
introduced new bills for the latest backpacker tax rate of 15% and the $5 
increase in the passenger movement charge (PMC). These bills will likely be 
debated tomorrow and then go to the Senate on Wednesday though I have given up 
making bold predictions.

Both bills had previously passed the house and the Senate albeit with 
amendments.

What is it with goats?

The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, was asked about Labor’s 457 visa 
crackdown.The Daily Tele had a story 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/457-visas-labors-fryin-fryout-staff/news-story/def4870dea71de1c61a43fca2199c2ff>
 this morning about a deal done between fast food chains and the former Labor 
government.


The flood of foreign visas during oppposition leader Bill Shorten’s time as 
workplace minister 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/samantha-maiden-visa-posturing-gives-no-credit-to-shorten/news-story/0f560e577a09f236fcfc7d4b9185208e>
in the Gillard government also extended the program to 650 so-called 
professions including union officials andgoat herders.

The revelations will come as an embarrassment for an opposition leader who has 
sought to whip up a foreign worker backlash 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/foreign-workers-get-less-time-to-job-hunt-under-457-visa-changes/news-story/343169098bea70d57e4eb48c6a4b9e61>
 in the wake of the Trump victory in the US by claiming he wanted to crack down 
on 457s.

In one of the little-known labour agreements approved by Labor in 2012, 
McDonald’s was given sponsor rights to bring in 285 foreign workers. Hungry 
Jack’s hired at least 74 people on 457s, KFC brought in 88 foreign workers, 
while other lesser-known fast food outlets hired 32.

Dutton:

This is a leader of the opposition who says one thing outside of this chamber 
and a very different thing inside of this chamber. The leader of the opposition 
is here saying he wants to introduce a bill in relation to 457 visas ... When 
he was the employment minister, a minister in the Gillard and Rudd governments, 
he did the complete opposite. Can you imagine the surprise this morning when 
this leader of the opposition woke up to this headline in the Daily Telegraph: 
“Do you want lies with that?”

The government is, of course, narrowing the occupations allowed to come in 
under 457s. They are cracking down on 457s while at the same time as 
criticising Labor for cracking down.
 
I did not hear the question but presume it is about moving the pesticides 
agency to Tamworth.

He says the Nats are very proud of its decentralisation policy.

Joyce says the NSW Labor government moved the minerals department to Maitland 
to one of its seats.

Of the APVMA move (announced during the election campaign when he was 
challenged by Tony Windsor), Joyce says:

It’s coincidental it’s in the seat of New England. It is absolutely a proper 
fit.
 
What’s your message to farmers today who are furious the way the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has handled this issue 
over the past 18 months?

Barnaby Joyce:

I’d say to farmers right from the word go we were the ones who brought $40m on 
the table to resolve the issue. Not the Labor party. We stated quite clearly we 
would resolve this issue. Not the Labor party.The Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> were the ones who 
brought about this rate in the first place.

This is not true.

This rate was brought in at the 2015 Abbott/Hockey budget.
 
There is a flock of Nats in the Senate courtyard speaking on backpackers.

Barnaby Joyce speaks first and then Fiona Nash. They are justifying the policy 
twists and turns, including the final landing spot.Nash says:

Politics is the art of what’s possible and we now have a 15% rate. It’s a very 
sensible outcome. It’s a good outcome. Compromise is reality in this parliament.
