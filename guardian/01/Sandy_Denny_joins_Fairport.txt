The catalyst for Fairports' transmutation from Dylan covers band to founders 
of English folk rock, Denny brought to the group a soaring voice and the riches 
of traditional song. Nottamun Town and A Sailor's Life appeared in 1968, along 
with Denny's own Who Knows Where the Time Goes, before 1969's visionary Liege & 
Lief remade folk for a new generation.

Lush, melodic and led by Denny's dramatic vocals, Liege & Lief captured the 
eeriness of antique ballads such as Reynardine and renewed the quest for a 
Blakean Albion on Come All Ye. Denny soon left for Fotheringay and a solo 
career, en route duetting memorably with Robert Plant on The Battle of 
Evermore, Led Zeppelin's Tolkien tribute. Zep were just one act influenced by 
Liege & Lief; the album became the template for electric folkies onwards, from 
Steeleye Span to Oysterband to Seth Lakeman. As important as its stylistic tics 
– Richard Thompson's rolling guitar lines, Dave Swarbrick's fiddle – was that 
it established rock as belonging to the country as well as the city. Fairport 
mutated into the noble institution it remains; Denny, dead at 31, has proved 
irreplaceable.
