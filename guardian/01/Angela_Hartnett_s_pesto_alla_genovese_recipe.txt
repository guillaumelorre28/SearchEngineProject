This is my version of the classic dish pesto alla genovese, which came about 
as a way to use up leftover rocket and nuts in the larder. It's a lovely light 
summer dish that goes nicely with a fresh green salad.

(Serves four)
350g spaghetti
1 clove garlic, roughly chopped
75g roasted peanuts
75ml olive oil
100g basil, washed
Small bunch rocket, washed
50g parmesan

Place a pan of water on the stove to boil, with a pinch of salt.

Add the pasta, stirring after a minute to ensure it doesn't stick together, 
then cook until al dente, as instructed on the packet.

Put the garlic, nuts and oil into a blender and mix before adding the rocket 
and basil.

Blend everything together – the mixture does not need to be smooth, but it 
should be nice and loose.

Put it into a bowl and leave to one side until ready to use.

Drain the cooked spaghetti, return to the pan and stir the pesto through until 
it is thoroughly combined.

Finish with fresh black pepper and parmesan and serve with a green salad.
