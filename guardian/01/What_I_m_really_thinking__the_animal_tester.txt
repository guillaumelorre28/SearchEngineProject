When my sister found out my research involved animal testing, she was more 
than a little surprised. At school, I was the one phoning up the deodorant 
company to find out if their products containedCFCs 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon>. I was the one fighting the 
plight of the fox almost to the point of tears in our classroom debates.

The brown mice I work with are really cute. The first time I had to kill one, 
by dislocating its neck, my hands shook so much my supervisor had to take over. 
He’d warned me beforehand – apparently it happens to nearly everyone. Three 
years down the line, I’m still experimenting: looking into how the brains of 
these mice work and how that relates to human brains.

I don’t hide what I do. Feel free to ask me about it in the pub. It’s 
important for everyone to think about where medicine comes from and how we 
carry out research. It does upset me when people blindly repost pictures of 
mistreated animals supposedly undergoing animal testing. The animal testing 
laws in the UK are the most stringent in the world. I’ve had to justify the 
point of my research, the numbers of animals and techniques I’m using, numerous 
times in grant applications, on licence forms and to inspectors in person. That 
part actually helps with the emotional and ethical introspection. It’s a 
difficult thing to come to terms with, but if you have taken almost any 
medicine, you will have felt the benefits of animal testing.

Once, an animal died in surgery before I’d had a chance to get any useful 
results. That was the first time I felt that a life had been wasted. I cried.
