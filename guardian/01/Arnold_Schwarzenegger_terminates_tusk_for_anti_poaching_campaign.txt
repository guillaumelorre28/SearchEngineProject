The all-action movie star and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/arnold-schwarzenegger> has lent his weight to 
a campaign against ivory poaching by blowing up an elephant tusk on camera.

The Wildlife Conservation Society’s ‘96 elephants campaign’ 
<https://www.96elephants.org/> aims to draw attention to the daily death toll 
of the majestic animals.

In the video, a T-shirt wearing Schwarzenegger says: “Hey, stop killing 96 
elephants every day just because of this ivory. Lets get rid of the demand once 
and for all.” He then presses a detonator, exploding a tusk.

More than 42 tonnes of illegal ivory have been destroyed so far this year in 
China, the Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Thailand, United 
Arab Emirates, and the US.

But the WCS fears that a House interior appropriations bill could roll back 
current US regulations and thwart efforts by the Fish andWildlife 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife> Service to curtail the 
illegal trade.

 John Calvelli, the WCS’s campaign director said: “We are extremely grateful 
Arnold Schwarzenegger has joined the 96 Elephants campaign, and we are hopeful 
that his global following of fans will become allies to stop the killing, stop 
the trafficking and stop the demand of ivory.”
