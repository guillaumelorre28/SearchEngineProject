First-choice striker Tomi Juric has been ruled out of the Socceroos’ World Cup 
qualifier against Thailand after scans confirmed the extent of his knee injury. 
He will be replaced by China-based standby Apo Giannou, who is on his way to 
Bangkok for the 15 November clash.

Juric limped off the field eight minutes into his match for Swiss outfit FC 
Luzern on Sunday with suspected ligament damage.

“We have had confirmation from the medical staff at Luzern that Tomi has 
suffered a knee injury that will rule him out of the match against Thailand,”
Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> coach Ange 
Postecoglou said.

“Over the last 18 months we have worked hard to ensure we have depth and we 
have full faith in Apo to join the squad and get the job done.”

The news is another injury blow for Australia after foot problems ruled out 
midfielder Massimo Luongo and back-up goalkeeper Mitch Langera for the game in 
Bangkok, which marks the halfway point of the Socceroos’ final stage on the 
road to Russia 2018.

Luke Brattan has been called up to replace Luongo after he was cut from 
Postecoglou’s extended 30-man squad last week, while Swansea City keeper Mark 
Birighitti steps in for Langera.

Second from six teams in Group B and between leaders Saudi Arabia and Japan, 
Australia need three points against last-placed Thailand to stay in the hunt 
for automatic qualification as one of the top two sides.
