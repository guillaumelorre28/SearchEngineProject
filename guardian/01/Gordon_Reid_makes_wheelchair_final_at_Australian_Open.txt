The 24-year-old Scot beat Argentina’s Gustavo Fernández 6-3, 6-7, 9-7 in a 
match lasting three hours and 13 minutes to become the first Briton to reach a 
grand slam men’s singles wheelchair final.

British Tennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> tweeted: 
“Sensational from @GordonReid91 to reach his first grand slam final at the 
#AusOpen beating Fernandez 6-3, 6-7, 9-7!”

Reid’s compatriot Murray will take on Milos Raonic

 in the men’s semi-finals on Friday morning but there was disappointment for 
Konta who was beaten 7-5, 6-2 by Angelique Kerber.

“I’m absolutely thrilled to make my first grand slam singles final after 
winning my first two doubles titles last year. This is what you’re doing it 
for, this is what you play tennis for so I’ve just gone out there and enjoyed 
it,” said Reid, who will play the world No4 Joachim Gérard of Belgium in 
Saturday’s final.

“I just couldn’t believe it really at the end, I’d had two match points 
already and been a little bit tentative with them so I told myself just to go 
for it and if you miss it you miss it, but I couldn’t believe it. It was such a 
hard match and I was so tired after it, it was exhausting.”

More good cheer was provided for Scotland when Jamie Murray made the men’s 
doubles final

 in partnership with Bruno Soares, outclassing the Frenchmen Adrian Mannarino 
and Lucas Pouille 6-3, 6-1.

They meet the unseeded pairing of Daniel Nestor and the Radek Stepanek who 
beat the 16th seeds Pablo Cuevas and Marcel Granollers.
