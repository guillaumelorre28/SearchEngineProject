“The aim is to ramp up public awareness and the awareness of governments to 
the fact that we are under threat from a meteor strike,” May told me during a 
visit, “It’s been made light of, and we’ve seen some great films, like Bruce 
Willis saving the day, but it is a very serious threat.”

rate of Near Earth Objects.

“This is a catastrophe that could be averted,” he said.
