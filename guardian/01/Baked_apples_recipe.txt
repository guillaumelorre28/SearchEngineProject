A classic – perhaps the definitive – cold weather pudding. You could also add 
chopped pieces of your favourite dried fruits to the stuffing, from apricots to 
prunes, making this the tastiest way to use up all the bits and bobs at the 
back of the kitchen cupboard.

Serves 4

4 large eating apples
A handful of blackberries
A handful of cranberries
30g chopped pecans
25g oats
½ tsp cinnamon
150ml unsweetened apple juice

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4. Slice off the tops of the apples. 
Remove the cores with a corer or sharp knife, then leave the apples to one side.

2. Mix all the ingredients together except the apple juice. Arrange the apples 
in an ovenproof dish and spoon the stuffing into the centre of each one.

3. Pour an equal amount of apple juice over each apple, then leave the rest of 
the juice in the base of the dish.

4. Bake for 35-45 minutes until the apples are soft. Spoon the juice over the 
apples a couple of times while they're cooking.
