Singer Alesha Dixon is leaving BBC1's Strictly Come Dancing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing> to join the 
judging panel of Britain's Got Talent on ITV1.

Dixon said she will be joining Simon Cowell when he returns to BGT's judging 
panel this year. Dixon, 33, who has spent three years judging dancers on 
Strictly, will now sit alongside David Walliams and Amanda Holden, who is 
returning to the show for its sixth series.

A statement on Dixon's website on Monday said: "Alesha has decided not to 
return to Strictly Come Dancing after a successful three-series run and will 
instead be joining theBritain's Got Talent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/britains-got-talent> panel."

She added: "After three incredible years on the Strictly Come Dancing judging 
panel I have decided that it is time to move on.

"Strictly Come Dancing will always hold a special place in my heart as it has 
been such an amazing experience, both as a winning competitor and as a judge.

"I would like to say a big thank you to everyone involved in the show, the 
production team, my fellow judges, and a very special thank you to the fans for 
their support."

A spokeswoman for the BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> said: 
"Alesha has had three very successful series and we wish her well for the 
future.

"We are now looking forward to announcing our new panel in due course."

She added that any new judges were unlikely to be announced until the summer.

Before becoming a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing in 2007, Dixon was best 
known as a member of singing group Mis-Teeq.

But after winning the dance show, it was announced in 2009 that she would 
replace Arlene Phillips on the judging panel.

The singer received criticism as the BBC was accused of ageism by trading in 
the professional dancer for Dixon â€“ who had only won the show as a celebrity 
contestant two years earlier.
