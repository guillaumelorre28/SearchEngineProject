British air passengers heading for New York today will face severe disruption 
to their transatlantic journeys after American Airlines flight 587, an Airbus 
A300, crashed into the borough of Queens. New York's JFK, Newark International 
and La Guardia airports have all been closed in the wake of the crash, as well 
the city's bridges and tunnels, except to emergency vehicles.

British Airways (BA) were considering ordering their four New York-bound 
planes back to London or diverting them to other North American destinations. 
"We are assessing the situation," a BA spokesman told PA News.

BA, together with many other carriers, had to divert flights when all American 
airspace was shut after the September 11 attacks. Thousands of passengers were 
diverted to Gander in Newfoundland and Halifax in Nova Scotia. Planes that were 
less than half way to their destinations returned to London.

A spokesperson for Heathrow said: "In the light of today's events in New York, 
Heathrow is closely monitoring developments. There is likely to be serious 
disruption to transatlantic flights and all passengers on routes to North 
America are advised to contact their airline before setting out for the 
airport."

Flights from Gatwick remain so far unaffected. The two Continental Airlines 
flights which left Gatwick for JFK airport today are both still heading for the 
US. A spokesperson for Gatwick said: "No flights have been altered, but the two 
planes en route to JFK will probably be diverted. The next planned flight to 
the US will leave the airport tomorrow morning. There are no plans as yet to 
delay that flight."

At the time of going to press, American Airlines had no further comment to 
make on the situation.
