A three-year-old boy who was being taken on a shopping trip by his grandmother 
was killed in a road rage shooting when a driver opened fire on the 
grandmother’s car because she “wasn’t moving fast enough at a stop sign”, 
police said.

The boy and his grandmother were at the stop sign in south-west Little Rock on 
Saturday evening when a driver, apparently angry about the delay, stepped out 
of his car and opened fire, police said.

The boy was struck by gunfire at least once, they said. The grandmother, who 
wasn’t struck, drove away and called police from a shopping center.

Police arrived at the shopping center and found the boy in the car outside a 
JC Penney department store. The boy was taken to a hospital where he died, 
becoming the second young child shot dead in a road rage incident in the city 
in the last few weeks.

Last month, a two-year-old girl was killed when a car drove by and someone 
fired into her vehicle. The shooter in that case has not been captured.

Lt Steve McClanahan said investigators believed the boy and his grandmother 
“were completely innocent” and had no relationship with Saturday’s shooter, who 
was being sought.

He said the grandmother was simply “driving the car and was taking her 
grandson shopping when the incident occurred”.

Police said they were looking for an older black Chevrolet Impala. Police did 
not release a detailed description of the man who was driving it.

Police chief Kenton Buckner said the road rage killings were frustrating for 
the police department and the community, especially because the young victims 
were “very innocent” and “can do very little to protect themselves”.


“We cannot have a community where the least protected among us, being infants, 
are dying of these senseless crimes in our city,” Buckner said.

He said he did not know if the children’s shootings were related.
