About six weeks ago my Alliance & Leicester card was stolen and about £1,000 
withdrawn from my account. I was told someone from the bank's fraud department 
would be in touch with me the following day. Since then I have spoken to 
customer services twice, and the complaints department twice.

In my last conversation with them I was told I should have heard 
within 48 hours and that they were re-reporting the incident. A week later I 
have yet to be contacted a single time by the bank about this. To top it all 
off, the fraud caused me to go over my overdraft limit and, a few days after 
reporting the fraud, I was sent a letter by A&L notifying me of a penalty 
charge for this and a request to rectify it immediately.KA, London

Oh dear – another case of one department not communicating properly with 
another. Santander, Alliance & Leicester's parent company, cancelled your card 
the day after you reported the theft. However, whoever did this did not submit 
the details to its fraud department and so no one did anything about your 
missing money. The bank has now reunited you with your stolen money and has 
also sent you a goodwill payment of £75.
