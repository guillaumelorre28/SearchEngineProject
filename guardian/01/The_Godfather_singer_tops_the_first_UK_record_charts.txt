The pop charts began in postwar Britain when Percy Dickins of the New Musical 
Express telephoned 20-odd shops asking for a list of their bestsellers. Coming 
out on top with Here in My Heart was crooner Al Martino, who kept the No 1 spot 
for nine weeks on the first UK chart based on record sales. Martino later 
starred as Johnny Fontane in The Godfather – a character said to be based on 
Frank Sinatra.
