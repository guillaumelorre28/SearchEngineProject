coin. Tommy Lee Jones played the character in Joel Schumacher's 1995 episode

Batman Begins role as the Caped Crusader, while Michael Caine and Morgan

Eckhart will next be seen opposite Catherine Zeta-Jones in this summer's 
romantic comedy No Reservations. He also stars as a hapless man who reinvents

by American Beauty screenwriter Alan Ball.
