David Cameron <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> is advising 
the newly elected Pakistani prime minister to revive relations with Afghanistan 
amid fears in Downing Street that its so-called "Af-Pak" strategy is losing 
momentum.

On the second day of his overseas visit, Cameron became the first western 
leader to visit Nawaz Sharif sincehis election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/13/pakistan-elections-nawaz-sharif-imran-khan>
 in the first peaceful and democratic transition of power in Pakistan since 
independence in 1947.

The prime minister hailed Sharif's election. He said: "He's in a strong 
position because Pakistan is having and has had effectively this democratic 
transition which is a huge bonus forPakistan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan> and will raise its profile in a 
thoroughly good way in the eyes of the world. He won a decisive election 
victory and I'll congratulate him on that. I think it puts him in a strong 
position."

There are concerns in Downing Street that Sharif may be in danger of 
neglecting relations withAfghanistan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan> amid historic and continuing 
enmity between the two neighbours. Relations hit a new low this month when an 
Afghan diplomat, Naqeebullah Ibrahimkhel, was shot in the leg in Islamabad.

Speaking at the Pakistani prime minister's official residence, Cameron said 
both countries had a shared interest in the "battle against terrorism".

He said: "This is a battle that requires a tough and uncompromising security 
response. But it is also a battle that has to go so much wider.

"Countering extremism and radicalisation, investing in education, tackling 
poverty, dealing in all the issues that can fuel extremism and radicalisation."

He added: "In this battle the friends of Pakistan are friends of Britain
and the enemies of Pakistan are enemies of Britain. We will stand together and 
conduct this fight against extremism and terrorism."

The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, is suspicious of the role played by 
Pakistan in theopening of a Taliban office in Doha 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/20/taliban-doha-diplomacy-afghanistan>
, Qatar. Karzai was outraged when the Taliban described it as the mission of 
the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan – the Taliban's name for the country during 
its period of rule.

Sharif has named trade, relations with India and the battle against extremism 
as his three main priorities. He wants to seek peace with the Pakistan Taliban, 
allies of the AfghanTaliban <https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban>.

Cameron, who met President Asif Ali Zardari 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/asif-ali-zardari> on his arrival in Pakistan 
on Saturday night, is making clear that two of Sharif's priorities – battling 
extremism and stabilising relations with its nuclear rival India – would be 
helped if relations with Afghanistan were put on a more stable footing.

The British prime minister said: "I think that increasingly Pakistan knows 
that it's in its best interest to have a stable Afghanistan as its neighbour 
and it supports the peace process and that's what the trilateral meetings I've 
held have been all about. From everything I've heard, and I've spoken to him 
[Sharif] on the telephone a couple of times, he fully supports that. We'll have 
a very constructive view."

Cameron hoped to achieve a breakthrough in relations between Pakistan and 
Afghanistan when he held atrilateral summit  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/04/david-cameron-afghan-elections-taliban>
at Chequers in February involving Zardari and Karzai. But officials believe the 
momentum has slipped and relations are deteriorating.

Britain believes Pakistan must play a pivotal role as Nato prepares to 
withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

Cameron said: "Our approach is to have this very clear boost to Afghan 
security by funding their armed forces and police. The peace process then is 
additional to that. There are some difficulties but there are some good 
prospects and I think Pakistan will want to help with that."

The prime minister said Sharif's election was a good chance for a new start 
and played down concerns that the leader of the Muslim League, criticised for a 
soft approach to the Taliban, could not be even handed.

Cameron said: "I think he has the credibility of having just been elected with 
a full term ahead of him, with Pakistan's long term interests in mind, and I 
think that gives him a certain power and influence."
