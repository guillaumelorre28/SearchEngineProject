Porthcurno is a classic Cornish beach. The golden sand is surrounded by a host 
of strangely shaped rocky outcrops, and it's thought that this is what gave the 
place its Cornish name – "cove of horns". Up on the western side of the beach 
is the Minack theatre (minack.com <http://www.minack.com/>) – during the day 
you can pop in and have a walk around – but the coastal path to the east of 
Porthcurno is the real star of the show, winding along the cliff edge towards 
the Logan Rock. I always feel a childlike urge to clamber around and 
investigate the outcrops in this area; the granite forms conceal all manner of 
pools, nooks and crannies. There is a great beach just west of the Logan Rock 
promontory, with an impressive sandbar that moves every year.

The seafront promenade at Newlyn makes for a lovely stroll, and both the lido 
and the art gallery (newlynartgallery.co.uk <http://www.newlynartgallery.co.uk/>
) are well worth a visit. This part of Mount's Bay affords great views back 
across to St Michael's Mount (pictured) and is the mainland home of the
Scillonian ferry <http://www.ios-travel.co.uk/>.

Rinsey is a delightful mix of seascape, landscape, mining heritage and natural 
history. Take in three old engine houses with world heritage site status plus 
close-up views of rare plant life, and further afield the enigmatic Bishop Rock 
in the Scilly Isles. You might see ponies grazing, choughs displaying or even 
dolphins playing. As from Penzance, the views to St Michael's Mount are quite 
stunning.

The Lizard coastal walk

The Lizard peninsula is the most southerly point of mainland Britain, and on a 
blustery winter's day it certainly feels exposed. There are hidden gems on this 
route, such as Kynance Cove, home to a great little cafe (kynancecovecafe.co.uk 
<http://www.kynancecovecafe.co.uk/cafe.htm>) complete with turf roof and wool 
insulation – and its welcome is as warm as the interior. This area is famous 
for its wildlife, and seals and basking sharks can often be seen. The views 
from this stretch of Cornwall are magnificent: the coastline starts to soften 
from this point east, so make the most of the imposing cliffs.

The Helford estuary is a stunning sight, particularly rewarding if you are an 
early bird, as you often get a beautiful hanging mist just after dawn. 
Glendurgan (nationaltrust.org.uk/glendurgan 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/glendurgan/>) is home to a great maze, so take 
care – you might unintentionally lengthen your walk! My favourite stretch is 
from Porth Saxon beach out to Rosemullion Head, as the transition from wooded 
riverside through to rocky outcrops provides a great backdrop to this walk. The 
real highlight, however, are the views across Falmouth bay to Henry VIII's 
castles at Pendennis and St Mawes (pictured). If you catch the right season 
then the wildflower meadows on Rosemullion Head make this the perfect spot for 
the nature lover as well as the amateur historian.

Nestled on its own peninsula, Trelissick is almost surrounded by water, and 
has direct access across the river Fal via the amazing King Harry chain-driven 
ferry. I'm always surprised at the size of the vessels that get this far 
upriver to be worked on by the numerous boatyards. They're anchored in the deep 
water channel and provide an unexpected twist to any walk in this area. And, as 
with many of our sites, there is a depth of history at Trelissick – you walk 
from the Iron Age fort past the industrial quay. The tidal mudflats are home to 
all sorts of wading birds, which you can spot while you're hidden out of sight 
in the woodland. There's a lovely National Trust cafe to refuel in Trelissick.

This gentle, rolling landscape is a real contrast to the crags of West 
Penwith. The sandy beaches are relatively sheltered from the prevailing swell, 
which seems to give this area its own microclimate. You could extend this walk 
by setting out from Porthscatho and heading south-west, all around the south 
coast of the peninsula, until eventually you round the headland and come back 
up the inland waterway, with its views over toSt Mawes 
<http://www.stmawes.info/> from St Anthony. The change from the rise and fall 
of the landscape behind the beaches through to the wooded riverside offers a 
fascinating journey. Andy, the butcher in Porthscatho, makes the best sausages, 
which I fry up on my gas stove as a treat while taking in the stunning vista 
from Carrick View.

One of the finest natural harbours in Cornwall, Fowey <http://www.fowey.co.uk/>
 (pictured) offers all that a sailing haven should – good pubs, good food and 
people with their collars turned up … The walking around this area is amazing – 
the exposure of the Gribbin, steep craggy coves, beautiful beaches and stunning 
grassland meadows, it really does have it all. When the sea mist rolls in you 
can see why Daphne du Maurier was drawn to the place and set several of her 
books here.

If you strike out east rather than west you can catch the ferry across to 
Polruan and then take in the equally stunning coastline towards Lansallos, the 
unspoilt campsite here is well worth a visit and a cracking cream tea is on 
offer at Lansallos Barton Farm. Lantivet Bay and Lantic Bay are a reward for 
the intrepid – a steep path winds down to the latter beach, but the rewards are 
instantaneous. Details for thisLantivet Bay circular walk are:

An often overlooked spot, Whitsand Bay (pictured) stretches from Polperro 
eastward to Maker Heights. The walking in this area is surprisingly tough, but 
for those who do take it on the views are stunning. The bay is home to two 
Napoleonic forts (or Palmerston's Follies) and I always find the collection of 
shacks fascinating. There are a couple of great little cafes (one has its own 
cable car delivery system), and you will never tire of the breathtaking views 
from the headland across Plymouth Sound towards the Yealm Estuary and the 
Mewstone.

For me the Tamar Valley is one of the most magical places; it provides the 
natural boundary between Cornwall and Devon and contains a wealth of history. 
This area became famous for its market gardens and mining, both well serviced 
by the navigable reaches of the Tamar. Cotehele was at the heart of the 
activity, with a bustling quay, lime kilns and market gardens on all the 
suitable slopes. Today, it's a fantastic place to explore on foot. Start on the 
quayside, perhaps with lunch in the Edgecumbe arms and a wander around the 
historic barge, Shamrock. The gardens are beautiful and frame some of the most 
magnificent views down this mighty river. The wider estate is steep but well 
worth the effort when you stumble upon the Chapel and Prospect Tower.
