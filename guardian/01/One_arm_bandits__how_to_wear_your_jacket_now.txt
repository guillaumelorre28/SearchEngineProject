your coat or jacket. Forget that you had to manoeuvre yourself around a room 
like a baby geisha, silently praying for no large gusts of wind, it was a way 
of wearing your coat that suggested both poise and being a boss.

But, as the styling in both the AW 2016 collections of Balenciaga

 (off both shoulders) and Vetements (jacket demoted to being held in a ringed 
coat holder worn off your belt, see below), the jacket mood was shifting south.

That was March. A couple of months later and we are officially in a 
post-robing era. “One-arming” is the delicate practice of wearing your jacket 
like you hate it. Like your jacket is perhaps a torture device that you are 
quietly easing yourself out of before your captors come back home. Taken in the 
context of the rise of theraptor arm pose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/may/12/raptor-applause-the-new-red-carpet-pose>
 too, that body part is having a weird moment. If 2015 was about 
#Freethenipple, 2016 is about #Freethearms. It’s difficult not to see it as 
part of the rebelliousness that may forever be called “the Vetements effect” – 
conforming to the non-conforming silhouettes of Demna Gvasalia’s designs and 
recalibrating the idea of how you should wear your clothes.

In this case, an insouciant, Kevin and Perry-ish attitude towards your jacket 
is key; witness Kylie Jenner manhandling her denim jacket onSnapchat 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BD9CTuJMw56/>, or Ariana Grande, who wears every 
jacket like it’s a pesky outstanding tax return she just can’t seem to rid 
herself of. We are pretty sure some of Kylie and Ariana’s best friends are 
jackets, but the look now is all about pretending they are mortal enemies.
