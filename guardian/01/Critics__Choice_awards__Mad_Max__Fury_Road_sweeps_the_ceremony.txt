Miller’s win as best director helps his Oscar chances against Alejandro 
González Iñárritu, whose filmThe Revenant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/17/the-revenant-review-leonardo-dicaprio-alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-tom-hardy-domhnall-gleeson>
 won three Golden Globes and12 Oscar nominations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jan/14/oscars-2016-the-revenant-mad-max-the-martian-peter-bradshaw>
 last week. The Revenant suffered a hit at the Critics’ Choice awards, 
nominated for nine awards but winning only two.

The Revenant’s star, Leonardo DiCaprio, claimed the Critics’ Choice best actor 
award, confirming his Oscar frontrunner status, while Spotlight – about Boston 
Globe reporters uncovering a Catholic child molestation scandal – won best 
picture. The Critics’ Choice awards often reflect which films will win big at 
the Academy awards, which will be held on 28 February.

This was the first year the Critics’ Choice combined the awards for film and 
television into one ceremony. The full list of winners is below.
