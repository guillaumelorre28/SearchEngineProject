Netflix lets you set up a maximum of five separate profiles for people to 
share your account: it’s a great way of making sure the viewing habits of your 
kids (or your better half) don’t affect the recommendations and currently 
playing titles that you see when you log into Netflix. Even if you don’t have 
any family members to share your Netflix subscription with, you can create 
different profiles for different moods, complete with their own viewing 
histories and recommendations. Choose the Manage Profiles option from theNetflix
 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix> menu on the web to create and edit 
profiles.

2. Save data usage on mobile devices

If you’re watching Netflix over a 3G/4G connection then you might want to 
limit the amount of data used (for the sake of your phone bill), but you can’t 
do this from within the Netflix mobile apps themselves. Instead, you need to go 
to the Netflix web portal, choose Your Account from the main drop-down menu, 
and then select Playback settings. The option you pick here applies across all 
of the devices you view Netflix on – you can see how much data is used per hour 
alongside each entry in the list.

3. Add extra features with a browser extension

The Flix Plus browser extension for Google Chrome (search for it online in the 
Chrome Web Store) adds a total of 22 tweaks to enhance the standard Netflix 
website in various ways. They include tweaks to filter your recommendations, 
identify recommendations you’ve already watched, rearrange home screen 
sections, hide any spoilers that might be shown in associated images and text, 
add extra keyboard shortcuts and the option to add notes to the list of films 
and television shows you want to watch. Ratings from the Internet Movie 
Database and Rotten Tomatoes are shown right inside Netflix too.

BBC iPlayer

4. Download new programmes automatically

Downloading television shows to your various devices rather than streaming 
them ensures you’ve got something to watch even when you’re without internet 
access, and another reason to install the desktop clients for Windows or Mac 
(via the iPlayer downloads section) is that they include an option called 
Series Record. Enable this setting once you’ve downloaded one programme and new 
episodes of your chosen series are then saved automatically (assuming the 
application is running), saving you the trouble of remembering when they’re on. 
Note that downloaded programmes have the same expiration date as those streamed 
from the mainiPlayer <https://www.theguardian.com/media/iplayer> website.

5. Restart shows that have already begun

You might know you can use iPlayer to watch the BBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> channels live (if you have a valid TV 
licence), but you might not know that it’s possible to jump back to the start 
of a programme at any point. From the main iPlayer site on the web, click 
Channels and then choose the Watch live option. If you hover over the playback 
window, a Restart the current programme link appears (you can also jump back to 
any point via the playback bar). It’s a useful way of catching up with live 
programmes if you’ve just missed the start.

YOUTUBE

6. Queue up videos to watch later

You’ll find a YouTube app on most smart TVs and streaming devices, and through 
YouTube you can also get at movies and shows you’ve purchased via Google Play. 
One of the playlists YouTube creates on your behalf is called Watch Later, and 
you can save videos to it from anywhere provided you’re signed in with your 
Google account – from the web, mobile apps, streaming dongles, smart TVs and so 
on. On the YouTube web portal, for example, click Add to and then Watch Later 
on any video page. It’s a handy way of bookmarking content for future watching.

If you have a smart TV or dongle with a built-in YouTube app available on it, 
it’s possible to use YouTube on Android or iOS to control playback and pick new 
clips. On many sets and devices (such as the Chromecast) this happens 
automatically via the magic of Wi-Fi, but if not you can configure the setup 
manually: head to youtube.com/pair and follow the instructions to connect your 
television set up to your phone. The same process can be used to pair up games 
consoles with a YouTube app running on a mobile device.

Every Roku comes with a distinctive and intuitive remote control, but if it 
gets lost or you need a change for whatever reason then you can use your 
smartphone instead. Download the official Roku app for Android or iOS and it 
lets you browse, add and rate channels on any Roku model, as well as enter text 
more easily through your device’s touchscreen keyboard. The mobile Roku apps 
also support voice search, so you can speak out queries looking for particular 
movies, shows, actors or directors.

Roku isn’t just for streaming video content over the web: it can also play 
local files and videos stored elsewhere on your home network. You first need to 
install the Roku Media Player channel from the official directory – once it’s 
up and running the app will spot files on attached USB drives (if your Roku has 
a USB port) as well as those available on your local network through the 
popular DLNA standard. Media server applications including Twonky, Windows 
Media Player, Plex and Tversity are supported. Check the Roku support site for 
a list of compatible file types.

You don’t necessarily have to settle for the purple colour scheme that the 
Roku software wears by default. Head into the Settings pane then choose Themes 
to pick something different – there are a number of free themes on offer and 
you can follow the Get more themes link to look at some premium themes 
available over the web. It’s possible to customise the Roku screensaver as well 
from the Settings menu. To move individual channels on the Roku home screen, 
select a channel icon, tap the star button on the remote and choose Move 
channel.

AMAZON FIRE TV

11. Listen on your headphones

Enjoying your on-demand video content late at night or early in the morning 
can be tricky if there are other people in the house. One way around this is to 
pair a set of wireless Bluetooth headphones with your Amazon Fire TV – the 
audio is then streamed direct to your ears instead of through your television’s 
speakers. From the main Fire TV interface, go to Settings, then Controllers and 
Bluetooth Devices, and then Other Bluetooth Devices. Select Add Bluetooth 
Devices and follow the on-screen instructions to pair the headphones. The same 
method works for Bluetooth speakers too.

12. Install apps from the web

Navigating around Amazon’s app store from the Fire TV or the Fire TV Stick 
isn’t the smoothest of experiences, but you can send apps straight to your 
device from a web browser – it’s usually easier to browse for apps with a mouse 
and a keyboard. As long as you’re signed into the same Amazon account in both 
your browser and on the device itself, you’ll see a Get App button appear when 
you’re looking through the app section of Amazon’s online store. Product 
descriptions, reviews, developer info and more are all listed on the site.

Those of you who have splashed out on an Amazon Fire HD or Fire HDX tablet can

then choose Display & Sounds and Second Screen Notifications. Both devices need

You can configure your Chromecast to accept audio and video streams sent from 
phones, tablets or laptops that aren’t on the same Wi-Fi network: it’s called 
Guest Mode, and it lets you allow friends to beam content to your TV without 
letting them on your network. To configure Guest Mode, open the Devices tab in 
the Chromecast app for Android or iOS, tap the menu button on the relevant 
Chromecast (three vertical dots) and choose Guest Mode. Your guests will need 
the PIN code shown by the Chromecast, and currently the feature only works for 
guests with Android devices.

turn on many modern TV sets at the same time as you start casting thanks to a 
protocol called HDMI-CEC. You’ll need to check your television’s manual to see 
if you have it, but most sets now do – it’s not always called the same thing, 
though (Sony refers to it as BRAVIA Sync or BRAVIA Link while Samsung calls it 
Anynet+, for example). HDMI-CEC is automatically enabled on the Chromecast but 
it might be switched off on your television, so check through the relevant 
settings screens.

With smartphones and tablets running Android 4.4.2 or higher, it’s possible to 
cast the entire screen to your dongle – a useful option to have if you’re using 
apps without native Chromecast support. Open the main menu from the Chromecast 
app on Android, then choose Cast screen/audio to get started (on some devices 
there’s also a Cast option on the quick settings drawer, accessed with a 
two-finger swipe from the top of the screen). Audio output is transferred too, 
and the Chromecast dongle adapts to show your device in portrait or landscape 
mode as required.

By default your Chromecast displays a slideshow of handpicked photos from 
various online services when you’re not actually casting anything. To find out 
more about a particular image, open the Chromecast app, tap the Devices tab and 
then tap the image (or just use the “what’s on my Chromecast?” voice command in 
Google Now on Android). To change the photos used by your Chromecast, tap Edit 
Backdrop from the Devices tab – you can use images from your Google, Flickr and 
Facebook accounts if you wish, as well as enable or disable the compact weather 
report on the screensaver.

You can personalise the fourth-generation Apple TV 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple-tv> home screen as easily as you 
can on an iPhone or iPad, and it helps to get your most-used apps and channels 
up near the top of the page. Press and hold on the Siri remote touchpad (at the 
top) and the currently selected icon begins to shake – you can then swipe on 
the touchpad to position the app icon somewhere new. If you want to uninstall 
an app completely (and remove its icon at the same time), press the Play/Pause 
button while the icon is wobbling.

Hold down the Siri (microphone) icon on the remote and you can search your 
Apple TV and the web at large using your voice: try “show me action movies from 
the 80s” or “show me new TV comedies”, for example, or something like “will I 
need an umbrella tomorrow?” or even “what was the Celtic score last night?” 
When you’re watching something, you can use voice commands to “go forward 30 
seconds” or “go back five minutes”. Ask “what did he/she say?” and theApple

The Apple TV plugs into your big screen television via an HDMI cable, but you 
don’t necessarily have to send the audio to your TV set – any 
AirPlay-compatible speakers can be used. From Settings, choose Audio and Video 
then Audio Output to select a new device. The Apple TV itself is an AirPlay 
device too, so you can stream audio and video to it from an iPhone or iPad, as 
long as they’re on the same Wi-Fi network: drag up from the bottom of the 
screen in iOS to find the AirPlay option.

The latest Apple TV features a brand new tvOS, enabling the device to support 
full third-party apps for the first time, and as a result a lot of developers 
are busy creating TV-specific versions of their games. If you’ve bought premium 
games on iOS, in most cases you won’t have to pay for them again on the Apple 
TV – to see if your previous purchases have new Apple TV editions available, go 
to the front page of the App Store, select Purchased from the top menu and then 
pick Games from the category list.
