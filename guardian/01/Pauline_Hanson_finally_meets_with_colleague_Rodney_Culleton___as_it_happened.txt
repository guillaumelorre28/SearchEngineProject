Night time politics

That’s your bloomin’ lot for the evening, as Peter Cundall would say.

Today,

 * Labor MP Emma Husar gave a searing personal speech about her father’s 
violence towards her mother and the scars it left on her.

 * The Coalition government has threatened to sue a man for using the Medicare 
logo on his Save Medicare site, despite Coalition MPs using the logos on their 
campaign material.

 * The Coalition’s superannuation policies passed the parliament. There was 
much cheering on the government benches.

 * The backpacker tax remains in limbo though Barnaby Joyce refused to rule 
out negotiating on the 19% proposal.

 * Fraser immigration minister Ian McPhee was highly critical of Peter 
Dutton’s comments regarding the Lebanese Muslim Australian community.

 * Barnaby Joyce ruled out a sugar tax after a policy recommendation by the 
Grattan Institute to combat obesity.

 * On White Ribbon Day, the Coalition announced an e-safety commissioner on 
revenge porn and Labor announced a policy to protect domestic violence victims 
from cross examination by perpetrators.

 * One Nation - well I am not really sure what happened with One Nation. Rod 
Culleton and his leader Pauline Hanson tried to have a meeting at the same time 
as actively avoiding each other. The four senators split on a superannuation 
vote, 2 for, 2 agin. Then Culleton and Hanson had a meeting. It’s all G now, 
they say.

 * Hanson said Trump followed her policies.

 * Treasurer Scott Morrison said Trump released corporate tax cut policies 
after the Coalition did. He counselled Bill Shorten not to look to Bernie 
Sanders’ policies but to Trump instead. 
You know it makes sense. 

Thanks to the brains trust, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens. 

Tomorrow is Thursday.

I leave you with a picture of the father of the Nats, former senator Ron 
Boswell who named his biggest achievement in his valedictory speech many years 
ago as the defeat of One Nation in Queensland. He campaigned assiduously 
against the party in its first flush of success.

At the time, he said:

In the fight of my life against Pauline Hanson, I risked everything to stand 
up against her regressive, narrow view of Australia. To defeatPauline Hanson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/pauline-hanson> and One Nation in 
2001 has been my greatest political achievement.

He returned to parliament today as a special guest at the Nats’ barbeque and 
Pauline Hanson was in the house.

Goodnight.

Pauline Hanson: Trump followed me

Pauline Hanson has praised conservative senator Cory Bernardi and said that 
Malcolm Turnbull had moved to the right to hold the top job and stave off 
“revolt” in his party.

In comments at the Tourism & Transport Forum Australia on Wednesday, Hanson 
also saidDonald Trump was “saying what I was saying 20 years ago.”

She said conservative senator Cory Bernardi is “a straight shooter and I think 
he’s said a lot of things that are in line with my views and opinions”.

Asked whether Turnbull had moved to the right, she said: “Well he has moved, 
otherwise he wouldn’t be there, there would’ve been a revolt.”

He has changed. He has to start listening to voters.

If you were with us during question time, you would know treasurer Scott 
Morrison said Trump had announced his corporate tax cuts after the Coalition 
had done so in the 2016 budget.

Also in the senate, Labor’s Glenn Sterle made a joke about a zebra while 
women’s ministerMichaelia Cash was making a point about respect for women on 
White Ribbon Day.

Cash was wearing a black and white jacket.

After chasing each other around the building today, One Nation senator Rodney 
Culleton has had his meeting with party leader Pauline Hanson. 

The meeting happened in Hanson’s office, so she won that little arm wrestle, 
although Culleton told Sky News it was “a little patronising” of her to request 
his attendance on ABC TV last night.

Culleton told Guardian Australia he explained the circumstances around the 
Queensland attorney general’s decision to refer his letter to a magistrate to 
the Queensland police,after concerns it may amount to a threat or perverting 
the course of justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/22/rodney-culleton-referred-to-queensland-police-over-threatening-letter-to-magistrate>
.

Culleton denies the letter was a threat and said it was written “in the 
interest of justice” on behalf of a distressed individual. He said Hanson was 
“very comfortable” with his explanation and “fully supportive of me”.

Culleton said Hanson had asked if he was “alright to keep going” because she 
wanted to check her senators were “firing on all cylinders”. Culleton said he 
was OK, and she accepted that.

The pair also discussed the Australian Building and Construction Commission 
bill. Culleton foreshadowed further amendments but didn’t commit to vote one 
way or the other.

Asked if he would attend One Nation party room meetings, he told Guardian 
Australia “once I’m fully over the high court case, I suppose”. One Nation 
party room meetings are “not compulsory” he said, and Hanson wasn’t the type of 
leader to tell people what to do.

Culleton told Sky News he was not pleased Hanson had backed the Senate 
referral of his eligibility, claiming she and others had “been misled”.

Emma Husar's speech in full

Labor MP for Lindsay, Emma Husar’s, speech in full. 

In my first speech in this place I said 29 out of my 36 years of life had been 
affected by domestic violence.

I am a survivor of family violence, and it has taken me a long time to 
overcome the trauma of that to be where I am today.

I know there are a lot of women out there who suffer in silence. Today I stand 
in solidarity with survivors, with those women afraid to speak, and I will use 
my story, told in this place to advocate for the change we need.

I will use the eve of white ribbon day as an opportunity to shine a light into 
the darkest corner of my own life.

The first 13 years of my life was marred with physical domestic violence, 
committed towards my mother, at the hands of my always drunk-when-abusive 
Father.

My Dad was the son of a World War Two German soldier who committed many acts 
of violence against his wife and against his seven children. My father had been 
raised in a house where violence was the accepted norm and at a time when 
society said these were private matters.

Whilst the blows that landed on my mother during my childhood didn’t land on 
me physically – they may as well have. The trauma inflicted was the same. I 
recall it vividly and in great detail.

Each episode of this violence over my 13-years was different but the aftermath 
was always the same: Dad would apologise, promise to be different, and that 
would work for just a short time.

One evening, at the end of another round of abuse, Dad launched the family 
dinner of that evening at the wall.

The stain remained on that wall for a very long time – the stain in my heart 
would linger much longer. Mum then bundled my sister and I into the family car 
and fled.

We would go to the refuges in our community, until, after so many years and so 
many incidents, my father knew the locations and we were not safe there 
anymore. We then shifted to staying in hotels, which were located above pubs 
where the people below were loud and sometimes their noise would spill into the 
streets, waking me and reminding me that I wasn’t in my own bed, in my own home.

I was in a foreign place, because I was not safe.

One night, when Mum was hurrying to get my sister and I out. Dad had removed 
and smashed the distributor cap from the car rendering it useless and us 
trapped. The Police fetched us this time.

I still remember sitting in the Police station well into the early hours of 
the morning and the officers in Penrith police giving us pink milk while we 
waited. The police did their best.

Again, after this event my Mum returned home.

We know why women return time and time again even when their lives are 
massively disrupted along with their children’s’, and I hope that the blame 
that was launched at my Mum during the 90’s for not leaving, is no longer part 
of the “solution” around domestic violence – and I hope the questions of ‘why 
doesn’t she just leave’ quit being asked.

Eventually, though, the courage rises up, services step up and women stand up. 
Finally leaving. But not before one last terrible incident.

There were 13-police cars the last time physical violence affected my 
childhood. But this was the end of the physical violence, once and for all. 
Whilst the physical part ceased other abuse around finance and control ramped 
up.

Sadly, the wheel of domestic violence continues to affect my life as a grown 
woman, with children of my own. The last 16-years of my life have been and 
continue to be affected by domestic and family violence.

In the limited time I have left, I would like to thank Opposition Leader Bill 
Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> for his 
continued support of my current situation, his understanding, and the support 
he provides to me. I would also like to thank my caucus colleagues and staff 
who know my story, who don’t judge me and continue to provide support.

I would like to acknowledge the Penrith Women’s Health Service who have been 
providing services to my community for 30-years, including to my Mum then, and 
to my family now.

Sometimes in my experience I have found that, mostly, victims don’t talk about 
domestic violence because other people don’t talk about domestic violence.

For many years I was embarrassed and ashamed. I know that I shouldn’t be but I 
am.

I hope that today, I have lent my voice, my story, and my passion for 
advocating change, to the choir of the white ribbon movement who call on us to 
stand up, speak out and act.

That’s your bloomin’ lot for the evening, as Peter Cundall would say.

Today,

 * Labor MP Emma Husar gave a searing personal speech about her father’s 
violence towards her mother and the scars it left on her.

 * The Coalition government has threatened to sue a man for using the Medicare 
logo on his Save Medicare site, despite Coalition MPs using the logos on their 
campaign material.

 * The Coalition’s superannuation policies passed the parliament. There was 
much cheering on the government benches.

 * The backpacker tax remains in limbo though Barnaby Joyce refused to rule 
out negotiating on the 19% proposal.

 * Fraser immigration minister Ian McPhee was highly critical of Peter 
Dutton’s comments regarding the Lebanese Muslim Australian community.

 * Barnaby Joyce ruled out a sugar tax after a policy recommendation by the 
Grattan Institute to combat obesity.

 * On White Ribbon Day, the Coalition announced an e-safety commissioner on 
revenge porn and Labor announced a policy to protect domestic violence victims 
from cross examination by perpetrators.

 * One Nation - well I am not really sure what happened with One Nation. Rod 
Culleton and his leader Pauline Hanson tried to have a meeting at the same time 
as actively avoiding each other. The four senators split on a superannuation 
vote, 2 for, 2 agin. Then Culleton and Hanson had a meeting. It’s all G now, 
they say.

 * Hanson said Trump followed her policies.

 * Treasurer Scott Morrison said Trump released corporate tax cut policies 
after the Coalition did. He counselled Bill Shorten not to look to Bernie 
Sanders’ policies but to Trump instead. 
You know it makes sense. 

Thanks to the brains trust, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens. 

Tomorrow is Thursday.

I leave you with a picture of the father of the Nats, former senator Ron 
Boswell who named his biggest achievement in his valedictory speech many years 
ago as the defeat of One Nation in Queensland. He campaigned assiduously 
against the party in its first flush of success.

At the time, he said:

In the fight of my life against Pauline Hanson, I risked everything to stand 
up against her regressive, narrow view of Australia. To defeatPauline Hanson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/pauline-hanson> and One Nation in 
2001 has been my greatest political achievement.

He returned to parliament today as a special guest at the Nats’ barbeque and 
Pauline Hanson was in the house.

Goodnight.
 
Pauline Hanson has praised conservative senator Cory Bernardi and said that 
Malcolm Turnbull had moved to the right to hold the top job and stave off 
“revolt” in his party.

In comments at the Tourism & Transport Forum Australia on Wednesday, Hanson 
also saidDonald Trump was “saying what I was saying 20 years ago.”

She said conservative senator Cory Bernardi is “a straight shooter and I think 
he’s said a lot of things that are in line with my views and opinions”.

Asked whether Turnbull had moved to the right, she said: “Well he has moved, 
otherwise he wouldn’t be there, there would’ve been a revolt.”

He has changed. He has to start listening to voters.

If you were with us during question time, you would know treasurer Scott 
Morrison said Trump had announced his corporate tax cuts after the Coalition 
had done so in the 2016 budget.

women’s ministerMichaelia Cash was making a point about respect for women on 
White Ribbon Day.

Cash was wearing a black and white jacket.

Very good question. All domestic violence is bad not just that of men against 
women.https://t.co/wbgk9P5XgM <https://t.co/wbgk9P5XgM>

In a matter of moments, there will be a panel - again at the Tourism and 
Transport Forum that will feature crossbench senatorsPauline Hanson, Jacqui 
Lambie and Derryn Hinch. 
 
After chasing each other around the building today, One Nation senator Rodney 
Culleton has had his meeting with party leader Pauline Hanson. 

The meeting happened in Hanson’s office, so she won that little arm wrestle, 
although Culleton told Sky News it was “a little patronising” of her to request 
his attendance on ABC TV last night.

Culleton told Guardian Australia he explained the circumstances around the 
Queensland attorney general’s decision to refer his letter to a magistrate to 
the Queensland police,after concerns it may amount to a threat or perverting 
the course of justice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/22/rodney-culleton-referred-to-queensland-police-over-threatening-letter-to-magistrate>
.

Culleton denies the letter was a threat and said it was written “in the 
interest of justice” on behalf of a distressed individual. He said Hanson was 
“very comfortable” with his explanation and “fully supportive of me”.

Culleton said Hanson had asked if he was “alright to keep going” because she 
wanted to check her senators were “firing on all cylinders”. Culleton said he 
was OK, and she accepted that.

The pair also discussed the Australian Building and Construction Commission 
bill. Culleton foreshadowed further amendments but didn’t commit to vote one 
way or the other.

Asked if he would attend One Nation party room meetings, he told Guardian 
Australia “once I’m fully over the high court case, I suppose”. One Nation 
party room meetings are “not compulsory” he said, and Hanson wasn’t the type of 
leader to tell people what to do.

Culleton told Sky News he was not pleased Hanson had backed the Senate 
referral of his eligibility, claiming she and others had “been misled”.

 
Labor MP for Lindsay, Emma Husar’s, speech in full. 

In my first speech in this place I said 29 out of my 36 years of life had been 
affected by domestic violence.

I am a survivor of family violence, and it has taken me a long time to 
overcome the trauma of that to be where I am today.

I know there are a lot of women out there who suffer in silence. Today I stand 
in solidarity with survivors, with those women afraid to speak, and I will use 
my story, told in this place to advocate for the change we need.

I will use the eve of white ribbon day as an opportunity to shine a light into 
the darkest corner of my own life.

The first 13 years of my life was marred with physical domestic violence, 
committed towards my mother, at the hands of my always drunk-when-abusive 
Father.

My Dad was the son of a World War Two German soldier who committed many acts 
of violence against his wife and against his seven children. My father had been 
raised in a house where violence was the accepted norm and at a time when 
society said these were private matters.

Whilst the blows that landed on my mother during my childhood didn’t land on 
me physically – they may as well have. The trauma inflicted was the same. I 
recall it vividly and in great detail.

Each episode of this violence over my 13-years was different but the aftermath 
was always the same: Dad would apologise, promise to be different, and that 
would work for just a short time.

One evening, at the end of another round of abuse, Dad launched the family 
dinner of that evening at the wall.

The stain remained on that wall for a very long time – the stain in my heart 
would linger much longer. Mum then bundled my sister and I into the family car 
and fled.

We would go to the refuges in our community, until, after so many years and so 
many incidents, my father knew the locations and we were not safe there 
anymore. We then shifted to staying in hotels, which were located above pubs 
where the people below were loud and sometimes their noise would spill into the 
streets, waking me and reminding me that I wasn’t in my own bed, in my own home.

I was in a foreign place, because I was not safe.

One night, when Mum was hurrying to get my sister and I out. Dad had removed 
and smashed the distributor cap from the car rendering it useless and us 
trapped. The Police fetched us this time.

I still remember sitting in the Police station well into the early hours of 
the morning and the officers in Penrith police giving us pink milk while we 
waited. The police did their best.

Again, after this event my Mum returned home.

We know why women return time and time again even when their lives are 
massively disrupted along with their children’s’, and I hope that the blame 
that was launched at my Mum during the 90’s for not leaving, is no longer part 
of the “solution” around domestic violence – and I hope the questions of ‘why 
doesn’t she just leave’ quit being asked.

Eventually, though, the courage rises up, services step up and women stand up. 
Finally leaving. But not before one last terrible incident.

There were 13-police cars the last time physical violence affected my 
childhood. But this was the end of the physical violence, once and for all. 
Whilst the physical part ceased other abuse around finance and control ramped 
up.

Sadly, the wheel of domestic violence continues to affect my life as a grown 
woman, with children of my own. The last 16-years of my life have been and 
continue to be affected by domestic and family violence.

In the limited time I have left, I would like to thank Opposition Leader Bill 
Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> for his 
continued support of my current situation, his understanding, and the support 
he provides to me. I would also like to thank my caucus colleagues and staff 
who know my story, who don’t judge me and continue to provide support.

I would like to acknowledge the Penrith Women’s Health Service who have been 
providing services to my community for 30-years, including to my Mum then, and 
to my family now.

Sometimes in my experience I have found that, mostly, victims don’t talk about 
domestic violence because other people don’t talk about domestic violence.

For many years I was embarrassed and ashamed. I know that I shouldn’t be but I 
am.

I hope that today, I have lent my voice, my story, and my passion for 
advocating change, to the choir of the white ribbon movement who call on us to 
stand up, speak out and act.
