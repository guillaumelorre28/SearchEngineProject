Graham was already recognised as the most ingenious guitarist of his 
generation, his extraordinary inventiveness hewn from world travels, 
particularly Morocco. He'd written his masterpiece Angi in standard tuning, but 
his revolutionary new DADGAD tuning unlocked the door to a much richer guitar 
sound, which he first used on the track She Moved Through the Fair in 1963. It 
revolutionised folk accompaniment and inspired a new generation of guitarists.
