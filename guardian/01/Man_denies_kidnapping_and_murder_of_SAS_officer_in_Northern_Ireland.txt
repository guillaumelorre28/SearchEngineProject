A Northern Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> man has 
pleaded not guilty to the kidnapping, false imprisonment and murder of Captain 
Robert Nairac, who was on his fourth tour of duty when he was abducted from the 
Three Steps Inn in south Armagh in May 1977. His body was never found.

Three men have been jailed for his murder. A crown lawyer said yesterday that 
the case against Kevin Crilly, 59, of Jonesborough, SouthArmagh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/armagh>, was "at an advanced stage of 
preparation".

Releasing Crilly on continuing bail, Mr Justice Hart said the trial would 
start at the end of November and last for about three weeks.
