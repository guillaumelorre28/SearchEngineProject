Night-time politics

 * Malcolm Turnbull has defended his immigration minister, Peter Dutton, over 
his comments questioning Malcolm Fraser’s decision to bring in Lebanese 
Muslims. Turnbull said Dutton was a good minister. He would not enter into any 
correspondence on the comments themselves. But the Lebanese Muslim 
Association’s president, Samier Dandan, said the comments were racist.

 * The Queensland attorney general, Yvette D’Ath, has referred the One Nation 
senator Rod Culleton to that state’s police commissioner over a letter that 
could amount to an attempt to pervert the course of justice.

 * Question time was dominated by a Labor attack on division within the 
government after the Nationals abstained or voted against an import ban on the 
Adler shotgun. Turnbull said not all the Nats needed to be in the Senate for 
the vote – which lost with the support of Labor and the Liberals.

 * Superannuation fund types laughed at the financial services minister, Kelly 
O’Dwyer, when she suggested super funds were not governed to the same standard 
as the banks.

 * The registered organisations bill passed in the wee small hours of the 
morning, giving the government reason to celebrate its passage for the day. 
Nick Xenophon and Derryn Hinch successfully amended it to include whistleblower 
protections. They are hoping the Australian Building Construction Commission 
will be next. It was debated today in the Senate but there is still no vote. 
That’s it for me. Thanks to Gareth Hutchens, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy. To
Mike Bowers, to sleep perchance to dream. You need it. 

Tomorrow we have superannuation in the Senate, the PM is doing a national 
security statement at noon and presumably more ABCC.

Until then, goodnight.

Things are whipping along here. On a brief walk around the corridors, MPs 
began running for a division. The lower house is voting on the 
counter-terrorism legislation. It passes the lower house.

Queensland attorney general refers Rod Culleton letter to police commissioner

This is a statement from the attorney general and justice minister, Yvette 
D’Ath.

I have referred a matter to the Queensland Police Commissioner for his 
consideration.

The Chief Magistrate of Queensland informed me that Senator Rodney Culleton, 
One Nation Senator for Western Australia, had written a letter to the 
Magistrate at Cairns Magistrates Court.

The Chief Magistrate expressed concern that the contents of the correspondence 
from Senator Culleton could amount to an attempt to pervert the course of 
justice, and threatening a judicial officer.

Paul Karp rang the senator but Rod Culleton can’t talk right now. I cannot 
tell you anymore than that.

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has rejected criticisms of 
its policies by the UN special rapporteurFrançois Crépeau.

Last week Crépeau wrapped up an 18-day official visit to Australia with a 
highly critical assessment of some of the federal government’s immigration 
policies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/18/australias-immigration-policies-have-promoted-xenophobia-un-expert>
.

In a statement released today, the department welcomed Crépeau’s “cooperative 
engagement” but said it did not accept some of his preliminary observations “on 
Australia’s compliance with international obligations and human rights 
principles”.

In particular, we reject the special rapporteur’s characterisation of the 
human rights situation for all migrants in Australia.

The human rights expert had said Australia’s immigration policies had eroded 
human rights and tarnished the country’s reputation and, while some other 
policies were laudable, he singled out prolonged and indefinite detention, 
temporary protection visas, lack of access to health and justice services and 
punitive action against asylum seekers as “regressive and [falling] way behind 
international standards”.

The department said Australia had a longstanding history of promoting and 
protecting human rights, and was a “world leader” in investing in refugees with 
responsive settlement services:


Public confidence in migration and refugee intakes is strongest when the 
department provides safe pathways for those most in need, rather than unsafe 
pathways offered by people smugglers to those who can pay.

Australia’s humanitarian dividend has been possible due to the success of 
Operation Sovereign Borders. It is Australia’s view that strong border security 
measures, including mandatory detention, ensures the integrity of Australia’s 
migration programmes.

The department accused Crépeau of factual inaccuracies which it suggested he 
did not give it an opportunity to respond to.

For example, Australia guarantees that all asylum claims are thoroughly 
examined through an individual assessment conducted by trained and highly 
experienced protection decision makers, with reference to Australia’s domestic 
laws, international non-refoulement obligations and contemporary and 
comprehensive country information.”

Crépeau had also said the temporary nature of some visas also let migrants 
open to exploitation, and called for better oversight, but the immigration 
department said Australia had rigorous legal protection regimes and employers 
were subject to monitoring.

You can read the department’s response in full here.

The justice minister, Michael Keenan, has introduced the counter-terrorism 
legislation amendment bill (No 1) 2016 to the house.

This is the bill that lowers the age at which control orders can be applied to 
terrorism suspects from 16 to 14. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/13/age-limit-control-orders-terrorism-suspects-reduced-14>
 It also imposes an obligation on a person subject to a requirement to wear a 
tracking device to maintain the tracking device in good operational order and 
create offences for interfering with the operation of a tracking device.

It is the fifth tranche of security legislation introduced by the government. 
The shadow attorney general,Mark Dreyfus, says Labor generally supports matters 
of national security.

Katharine Murphy has written a comment piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/22/malcolm-turnbull-smiles-into-the-void-of-his-own-leadership-in-dutton-row>
 onPeter Dutton and how Malcolm Turnbull used to try to calm the debate on 
national security to allow trust between government and the community.

Turnbull realised just how dangerous that road was and insisted on calming the 
conversation, which was one of his most comprehensive early achievements when 
he took the Liberal leadership last September.

So let me honour this legacy by saying today what Turnbull, our leashed prime 
minister, couldn’t bring himself to say.

Peter Dutton’s comments are ridiculous.

The immigration minister (of all people) is suggesting Australia should have a 
discriminatory immigration policy, a policy that discriminates against migrants 
of particular ethnic or religious origin on the basis that people connected 
with them in the future might be involved in criminal activity.

Only five seconds thought delivers the manifest absurdity of this statement. 
Not so much stopping the boats as stopping the grandkids.

Dutton’s comments are also inflammatory. The immigration minister is 
prosecuting a low-grade culture war against a community which is dealing with a 
radicalisation problem. A real problem, not an abstract one.

Radicalisation is a problem that requires trust, cooperation and clear lines 
of communication to be able to manage.

Bowers reports there was a little bit of awks during the divisions between 
Dutton and Turnbull, perhaps stemming from Dutton’s comments.

Paul Karp

The Labor senator Glenn Sterle has asked the minister for resources and 
northern Australia,Matt Canavan, whether he supports the prime minister’s 
position that the import of Adler shotguns should be banned, given he had not 
voted on it last night.


Canavan replied: “I support the government’s position on the national firearms 
agreement,” which is not the same thing as supporting the ban on the Adler.

He rattled off a bunch of things he was proud of: gun ownership laws, 
responsible gun use and its benefits. Everything but the Adler ban.


Canavan also recognised the “rights of individual senators to express their 
views, to have independent thoughts” and added he was “very proud to stand with 
my colleagues on all those issues”.

Given no Nationals voted for continuation of the Adler ban, it was not a 
ringing endorsement ofMalcolm Turnbull’s position.

 * Malcolm Turnbull has defended his immigration minister, Peter Dutton, over 
his comments questioning Malcolm Fraser’s decision to bring in Lebanese 
Muslims. Turnbull said Dutton was a good minister. He would not enter into any 
correspondence on the comments themselves. But the Lebanese Muslim 
Association’s president, Samier Dandan, said the comments were racist.

 * The Queensland attorney general, Yvette D’Ath, has referred the One Nation 
senator Rod Culleton to that state’s police commissioner over a letter that 
could amount to an attempt to pervert the course of justice.

 * Question time was dominated by a Labor attack on division within the 
government after the Nationals abstained or voted against an import ban on the 
Adler shotgun. Turnbull said not all the Nats needed to be in the Senate for 
the vote – which lost with the support of Labor and the Liberals.

 * Superannuation fund types laughed at the financial services minister, Kelly 
O’Dwyer, when she suggested super funds were not governed to the same standard 
as the banks.

 * The registered organisations bill passed in the wee small hours of the 
morning, giving the government reason to celebrate its passage for the day. 
Nick Xenophon and Derryn Hinch successfully amended it to include whistleblower 
protections. They are hoping the Australian Building Construction Commission 
will be next. It was debated today in the Senate but there is still no vote. 
That’s it for me. Thanks to Gareth Hutchens, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy. To
Mike Bowers, to sleep perchance to dream. You need it. 

Tomorrow we have superannuation in the Senate, the PM is doing a national 
security statement at noon and presumably more ABCC.

Until then, goodnight.

We are not very, very mediocre, says Queensland LNP president Gary Spence.

On the weekend, Senator Brandis made some comments

 ...
 
Things are whipping along here. On a brief walk around the corridors, MPs 
began running for a division. The lower house is voting on the 
counter-terrorism legislation. It passes the lower house.
 
This is a statement from the attorney general and justice minister, Yvette 
D’Ath.

I have referred a matter to the Queensland Police Commissioner for his 
consideration.

The Chief Magistrate of Queensland informed me that Senator Rodney Culleton, 
One Nation Senator for Western Australia, had written a letter to the 
Magistrate at Cairns Magistrates Court.

The Chief Magistrate expressed concern that the contents of the correspondence 
from Senator Culleton could amount to an attempt to pervert the course of 
justice, and threatening a judicial officer.

Paul Karp rang the senator but Rod Culleton can’t talk right now. I cannot 
tell you anymore than that.
 
The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has rejected criticisms of 
its policies by the UN special rapporteurFrançois Crépeau.

Last week Crépeau wrapped up an 18-day official visit to Australia with a 
highly critical assessment of some of the federal government’s immigration 
policies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/18/australias-immigration-policies-have-promoted-xenophobia-un-expert>
.

In a statement released today, the department welcomed Crépeau’s “cooperative 
engagement” but said it did not accept some of his preliminary observations “on 
Australia’s compliance with international obligations and human rights 
principles”.

In particular, we reject the special rapporteur’s characterisation of the 
human rights situation for all migrants in Australia.

The human rights expert had said Australia’s immigration policies had eroded 
human rights and tarnished the country’s reputation and, while some other 
policies were laudable, he singled out prolonged and indefinite detention, 
temporary protection visas, lack of access to health and justice services and 
punitive action against asylum seekers as “regressive and [falling] way behind 
international standards”.

The department said Australia had a longstanding history of promoting and 
protecting human rights, and was a “world leader” in investing in refugees with 
responsive settlement services:


Public confidence in migration and refugee intakes is strongest when the 
department provides safe pathways for those most in need, rather than unsafe 
pathways offered by people smugglers to those who can pay.

Australia’s humanitarian dividend has been possible due to the success of 
Operation Sovereign Borders. It is Australia’s view that strong border security 
measures, including mandatory detention, ensures the integrity of Australia’s 
migration programmes.

The department accused Crépeau of factual inaccuracies which it suggested he 
did not give it an opportunity to respond to.

For example, Australia guarantees that all asylum claims are thoroughly 
examined through an individual assessment conducted by trained and highly 
experienced protection decision makers, with reference to Australia’s domestic 
laws, international non-refoulement obligations and contemporary and 
comprehensive country information.”

Crépeau had also said the temporary nature of some visas also let migrants 
open to exploitation, and called for better oversight, but the immigration 
department said Australia had rigorous legal protection regimes and employers 
were subject to monitoring.

The justice minister, Michael Keenan, has introduced the counter-terrorism 
legislation amendment bill (No 1) 2016 to the house.

This is the bill that lowers the age at which control orders can be applied to 
terrorism suspects from 16 to 14. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/13/age-limit-control-orders-terrorism-suspects-reduced-14>
 It also imposes an obligation on a person subject to a requirement to wear a 
tracking device to maintain the tracking device in good operational order and 
create offences for interfering with the operation of a tracking device.

It is the fifth tranche of security legislation introduced by the government. 
The shadow attorney general,Mark Dreyfus, says Labor generally supports matters 
of national security.

<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/22/malcolm-turnbull-smiles-into-the-void-of-his-own-leadership-in-dutton-row>
 onPeter Dutton and how Malcolm Turnbull used to try to calm the debate on 
national security to allow trust between government and the community.

Turnbull realised just how dangerous that road was and insisted on calming the 
conversation, which was one of his most comprehensive early achievements when 
he took the Liberal leadership last September.

So let me honour this legacy by saying today what Turnbull, our leashed prime 
minister, couldn’t bring himself to say.

Peter Dutton’s comments are ridiculous.

The immigration minister (of all people) is suggesting Australia should have a 
discriminatory immigration policy, a policy that discriminates against migrants 
of particular ethnic or religious origin on the basis that people connected 
with them in the future might be involved in criminal activity.

Only five seconds thought delivers the manifest absurdity of this statement. 
Not so much stopping the boats as stopping the grandkids.

Dutton’s comments are also inflammatory. The immigration minister is 
prosecuting a low-grade culture war against a community which is dealing with a 
radicalisation problem. A real problem, not an abstract one.

Radicalisation is a problem that requires trust, cooperation and clear lines 
of communication to be able to manage.
 
The lower house is voting on the superannuation reforms.

The Coalition’s superannuation reforms have passed the house. They are on the 
list for debate in the Senate tomorrow.
 
A very strong statement follows. The frustration of the community is palpable.

Bowers reports there was a little bit of awks during the divisions between 
Dutton and Turnbull, perhaps stemming from Dutton’s comments.

The Labor senator Glenn Sterle has asked the minister for resources and 
northern Australia,Matt Canavan, whether he supports the prime minister’s 
position that the import of Adler shotguns should be banned, given he had not 
voted on it last night.


Canavan replied: “I support the government’s position on the national firearms 
agreement,” which is not the same thing as supporting the ban on the Adler.

He rattled off a bunch of things he was proud of: gun ownership laws, 
responsible gun use and its benefits. Everything but the Adler ban.


Canavan also recognised the “rights of individual senators to express their 
views, to have independent thoughts” and added he was “very proud to stand with 
my colleagues on all those issues”.

Given no Nationals voted for continuation of the Adler ban, it was not a 
ringing endorsement ofMalcolm Turnbull’s position.
