Adam & Joe's 6 Music radio show may be a thing of the past, what with Joe 
hanging out with Hollywood's finest 
<http://www.deadline.com/2012/06/attack-the-blocks-joe-cornish-lands-snow-crash-at-paramount/>
 instead of imaginary slobbering dogs these days. But for fans of his erstwhile 
radio chumCount Buckules 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamandjoe/2009/07/count-buckules-on-the-archers.shtml>
 these are giddy days indeed. The great man and his beard are the stars of new
Sky Atlantic show Bug <http://skyatlantic.sky.com/shows/adam-buxtons-bug> – a 
mixture of music promos, insane YouTube comments and associated internet whimsy 
based on the show of the same name that Buxton been performing at the BFI and 
various festivals for the past few years.

Not one to miss out on an opportunity to record a jingle or ident, the show 
also features plenty of Buxton's own music and video extravaganzas including 
opening titles that simultaneously welcome viewers and scold them for being 
distracted by a picture of a little monkey flashing on the screen. Bug is 
wonderful fun. So wonderful that it's a puzzle why it has taken a broadcaster 
so long to give Buxton his own series, and even more puzzling why that 
broadcaster wasn't the BBC. But let's not dwell on the mysteries of the Big 
British Castle's commissioning policy. Instead let's remind ourselves of the 
wonder of Buxton and his six finest non-Joe telly moments. Let us know in the 
comments section if we've missed any.

Film industry wizard Ken Korda has been popping up in various Adam Buxton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/adam-buxton> TV projects for decades, 
and has interviewed legends including Pat Sharp and MC Devvo. Perhaps his 
finest gig was his spell as resident film critic on late night Channel 4 show 
The Last Word in 2005, during which he gave his insider's eye of In Her Shoes, 
a film where he was "the lady expert" who came up with the idea of Toni 
Collette owning lots of shoes.

Rock Dad – a middle age cool father in the short-lived BBC3 sketch show Rush 
Hour – expertly circumnavigated the swearing and violence in NWA's Fuck Da 
Police by changing the words ever so slightly and changing it into 
child-friendly message about the pleasures of police enforcement, in order to 
treat his son to "NWA Day". On YouTube, controversy continues to rage about 
Buxton's disrespect to NWA member Ice Cube who doesn't like the words of his 
songs being changed and would definitely never endorse keeping biscuits in a 
car.

Dynamo was a guest when Adam compered Never Mind the Buzzcocks last year, but 
despite the Bradford magician impressing the audience by threading a gold chain 
through his neck and yanking out a Polo mint, that wasn't the best trick of the 
night. Instead it was how a long-running TV quizshow was transformed into a 
completely different show without anyone noticing. Best bit was the Moby 
Tiebreaker round where the teams had to add up the Moby heads cunningly 
disguised amid Michael Stipe and Bruce Willis heads. The greatest bit of panel 
game telly ever. Possibly.

Told that Jen is dead – really, she just doesn't want to go on another date 
with him – Bill Crouse (Adam Buxton) is haunted by the flying decapitated head 
of the woman he all too briefly loved, just as he is boasting to his colleagues 
that he was the last person to sleep with her. Not all of Adam's acting gigs 
have been as successful – although fortunately only 75 people watched him and 
Iain Lee in ad agency sitcom The Persuasionists.

Just one pilot episode of Buxton's video manipulation show Meebox was 
broadcast on BBC3 in 2008, which is a bit sad because it was ace. Perhaps the 
British public wasn't ready to see an alien ruler (who closely resembled our 
queen) whose energy is supplied by a "floating life drone".

Buxton's finest posh idiot character is Monty Buggershop Hooty – a rambling 
toff who takes us on guided trips to the rural outback, treating us to 
inspiring vignettes about country life along the way. In this episode – part of 
a series for the BBC's comedy pages – Monty finds an unexpected discovery 
inside a dome of nettles and successfully avoids a rabbit who is "boring as 
shit".

• Adam Buxton's Bug is on Sky Atlantic at 9.30pm from Mon 9 July
