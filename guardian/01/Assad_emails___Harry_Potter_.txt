Hi,

Glad to hear that [XXXXXXXXXXXX] all went well don't even mention it I did not 
do anything.

Just arrived to [XXXXXXXXXXXX], will be gone and back on or around the 2nd and 
will make sure I bring Harry Potter Deathly Hallows Part 2.

I did not hear/see the bookra song will search for it on YouTube and give you 
my feedback.

Take good care, will try to visit my friend this week if not too busy.
