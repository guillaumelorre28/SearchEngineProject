Great Britain’s Gordon Reid has reached a second wheelchair final at the 
Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>.

The Scot and his Japanese partner Shingo Kunieda, seeded second in the men’s 
doubles, won their semi-final against Gustavo Fernández and Joachim Gérard 7-6 
(7-3), 6-2 to set up a final against the French top seeds, Stéphane Houdet and 
Nicolas Peifer.

, having beaten Kunieda and Fernández along the way. That ended a nine-year 
unbeaten run for Kunieda in the competition, which he has won every year since 
2007, apart from an absence in 2012.

There were only two holds of serve in the first six games and though Reid and 
Kunieda opened up two break points on Fernández’s serve at 4-3 the Argentinian 
saved both, the second with a brilliant lob from his Belgian partner.

Reid then held serve and play was suspended for rain with Reid and Kunieda 5-4 
up. They returned to close out the set in a tie-breaker ended by a double fault.

They broke to lead 3-2 in the second set and never looked back, taking the 
next three games as well to seal victory.
