Mail Online is expected to post record-breaking traffic figures for August. I 
understand that the Daily Mail andMail on Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/mailonsunday> website exceeded more than 
100m unique browsers last month.

It came close to the 100m mark in January, recording 99,218,476 monthly 
browsers. In subsequent months, it averaged about 91m, rising to 93.7m in July.

So the admittedly unaudited 100m-plus figure - fuelled, doubtless, by the 
London Olympics - would represent a significant breakthrough. Given thatMail 
Online <https://www.theguardian.com/media/mail-online> was reported in July as 
turning a profit, it's no wonder that there is an air of optimism among its 
staff.

The latest appointment - London Evening Standard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/london-evening-standard> assistant editor 
Amy Iggulden is to become Mail Online's assistant editor - also indicates 
increasing investment being allocated to the site by its owner, Associated 
Newspapers.

No wonder its publisher, Martin Clarke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/martin-clarke>, talks of it being "a very 
exciting time for Mail Online." He adds: "As well as broadening and deepening 
our global news coverage we are expanding significantly."

He has greeted Iggulden's appointment by saying she will play "a key role" in 
the site's future.
