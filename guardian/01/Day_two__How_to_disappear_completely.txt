When you meet a girl who does that to you, you have to try. What kind of man 
would you be otherwise? As they left, I gave her my card. It was clumsy; the 
other girls noticed. I said "I'm an artist. Call me sometime. I'd love to paint 
you" That smile again.

But she did call. Three weeks later but I hadn't forgotten. She called me Mr 
Art Gallery Man and invited me to a gig. "You didn't even ask what the music 
is," she said. "Doesn't matter," I said, "I'll bring earplugs." That made her 
laugh. I liked her laugh even more than her smile.

The gig was comically bad. She, the singer, forgot some of the words. The 
blonde guitarist broke two strings. The red-headed drummer toppled over in her 
seat. But the audience were good-humoured, tolerant. The music, when they made 
some, was good.

Afterwards she found me in the crowd, took me by the hand and led me through a 
security door. My pulse thumped in my ears. We climbed up the back stairs. At 
the top, a door led on to the flat roof. And there was London. Glittering, 
golden and glorious.

She ran to the edge, laughing. 
"London!" she shouted, "one day you're gonna be mine!"
"Do you want the whole place?"
"Yeah. All of it. Taking over the radio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/radio>, red carpets, interviews on TV. 
Don't you want it?"
I shook my head. 
"No," I said, "just time to paint would do for me. And a girl like you."
"That's sweet." 
She leaned over the wall again and shivered.
I put an arm round her. From below us, music began to play. 
"Do you really want to paint me?"
"A hundred times."
She looked up at me. I leaned down. She tipped her face up. I kissed that 
sweetly curved mouth.
After a moment, she broke away. 
"Nah," she said, "just doesn't feel right, does it?"
"Mmm," I said.
