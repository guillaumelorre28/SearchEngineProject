Britain's Anne Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> 
was eliminated from the Pattaya Open in Thailand on Wednesday after losing her 
second-round match to Sania Mirza.

Keothavong, who stunned the second seed and world No16, Dominika Cibulkova, in 
round one for the biggest win of her career, was beaten 6-4, 7-5 by the Indian.

The 28-year-old Londoner, the British No2, broke her opponent once in each set 
but Mirza capitalised on Keothavong's meagre 47% of first serves in to break 
four times in a match which lasted one hour and 39 minutes.
