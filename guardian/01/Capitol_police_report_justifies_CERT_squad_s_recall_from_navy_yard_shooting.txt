A specially trained tactical Capitol police squad was recalled from responding 
tothe Washington navy yard shooting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/16/washington-navy-yard-shooting> 
in part because of concerns about possible threats to the US Capitol, according 
to a report released on Friday. The report calls the decision reasonable.

The two-page document says the unit, which responds to emergencies like the 
mass shooting on 16 September, became stuck in traffic and was unable to reach 
the command post during the event. A supervisor recalled the four-member unit 
because of concerns about possible threats at the US Capitol and because there 
were no further requests for help, the report states.

A summary of the findings was released by the Capitol police board. The 
investigation was launched days after the shooting, amid reports that a Capitol 
police supervisor had told the Containment and Emergency Response (CERT) Team 
to stand down, instead of responding to the shooting.

Senate sergeant at arms Terrance Gainer, who serves on the Capitol police 
board, said the decision to recall the unit made sense in light of the fact 
that the officers had not even reached the building and were not prepared to go 
in.

"I think speculating on whether anybody including the CERT officers could have 
made a difference is actually unfair," Gainer said, later adding, "Over my 43 
years [in law enforcement], I always question whether I could have done 
something different to prevent a crime."

The gunman, Aaron Alexis, a former navy reservist and government contractor

building where he worked before dying in a police shootout. The FBI has said he 
was suffering from delusions.
