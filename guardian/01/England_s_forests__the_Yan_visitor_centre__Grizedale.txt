How do you persuade people to come deep into the heart of the forest, to make 
the forest part of their daily lives? You build a beautiful centre that will 
reflect the woods themselves, both inside and out. And then you offer it up 
for community use.

That was the concept behind the building of the Yan 
<http://www.forestry.gov.uk/theyan> ("The One" in Cumbrian dialect), the new 
visitor centre inGrizedale <http://www.forestry.gov.uk/grizedale> in the 
southern part of the Lake District. After many years with very little local 
investment here, the Forestry Commission was keen to begin a project that would 
benefit both the local community and visitors. This part of south Cumbria 
extends across the area between Windermere and Coniston Water, from Hawkshead 
in the north to the A590 in the south. It's historically associated with the 
coppiced woodlands that provided charcoal for the iron industry.

Intended as a celebration of wood, the Yan uses a number of different timbers: 
oak for the interior finishes where its beautiful grain can be seen; cedar for 
the external cladding because of its strength and durability; and Douglas fir 
for the main structure.

Over the next few years, the Yan should become a community centre which local 
schools, groups promoting mental and physical wellbeing, those working with 
people from disadvantaged local communities, and local businesses will all 
regard as their own. They will be able to use it for meetings, for outings – or 
simply as a space in the heart of the forest.
