Between Sideways in 2004 and The Descendants in 2011, Alexander Payne did not 
make any movies. This,he revealed to Anne Thompson on the release of the latter 
<http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/alexander_payne_talks_the_descendants>
, was in part because he was working on Downsizing, which he described as “a 
large canvas, science-fiction social satire” and “an epic masterpiece”.

Payne and regular writing partner Jim Taylor spent two and a half years on the 
script, which was then to star Sideways’ Paul Giamatti and Election’sReese 
Witherspoon <https://www.theguardian.com/film/reesewitherspoon> as an 
impoverished married couple who decide the way ahead lies in shrinking 
themselves. She then pulls out of the deal, after her husband has already 
undergone the procedure. Sacha Baron Cohen was also onboard to play a tiny 
Spaniard and his regular-sized business partner.
