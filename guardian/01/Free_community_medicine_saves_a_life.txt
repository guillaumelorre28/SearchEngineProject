Three-year-old Segnogo Pafadman peeps out from behind her grandmother's skirt, 
a cheeky grin lighting up her face. Grabbing her grandmother's hand, she pulls 
down to attract her attention. Seeing her granddaughter playing around, Tingsom 
Pafadman, 60, smiles.

"I would like to thank you a lot," Tingsom says to the community health 
workers. "My granddaughter is now healthy and walking around here because of 
you. If you were not here, the ending could have been very different."

Segnogo was 18 months old when her mother died. As the family mourned the 
loss, Segnogo began to lose more and more weight.

"My granddaughter was suffering from malnutrition," Tingsom explains. "We 
thought it was because she missed her mother. But there was also a lack of 
food."

Fearing the worst, Tingsom decided to bring Segnogo to the local community 
health centre in Noaka. The staff took one look at the little girl before 
packing the pair into an ambulance and sending them to Kaya's regional hospital.

"I was very afraid," Tingsom looks down, her voice trembling. "I was so 
frightened because I thought that she may die."

For 17 days, Tingsom lived in the hospital with her granddaughter, watching as 
she fought her way back to health. Expecting a big bill at the end of her stay, 
Tingsom was overjoyed to find out that the medicine and healthcare was free 
thanks to Save the Children.

"Community health workers continue to come and supervise her regularly in my 
village," Tingsom says. "If she has any sickness I bring her here and I'm met 
with free care."
