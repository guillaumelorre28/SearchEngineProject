The Church of England is hoping to use funds raised by the government’s 
apprenticeship levy to help pay for the training of 6,000 new clergy to replace 
those approaching retirement.

“The church would very much like to see the levy being used to train more 
ordinands,” MP Caroline Spelman told colleagues in her capacity as second 
church estates commissioner, who coordinates between the church and parliament.

Spelman said she hoped the government would support “the church’s quest to use 
some of the moneys from the apprenticeship levy to meet its shortfall” of 
clergy.


The church has raised the possibility with the Department of Business, 
Innovation and Skills (Bis), though it stressed that talks were at an early 
stage. It is also expecting to pay into the apprenticeship levy, under which 
large employers will contribute towards funding the government’s target of 3 
million apprentices.

“The C of E pays stipends to 8,000 clergy and others through a central payroll 
system for simplicity and efficiency, so will have to pay the apprenticeship 
levy,” said a spokesperson.


“At the same time, the church is heavily committed to training, with hundreds 
if not thousands of future clergy, youth workers and others in training in any 
year. The C of E is, therefore, discussing, internally and with Bis, how we can 
work with the apprenticeship levy to maintain those high levels of professional 
development.”


The C of E is facing a significant shortfall of vicars as those approaching 
retirement are not being replaced by people seeking ordination. The statutory 
age of retirement for clergy is 70, although vicars’ terms can be extended by 
his or her bishop.


Many parish vacancies take months – and sometimes years – to fill, and vicars 
are increasingly being required to manage multiple churches in their area.


William Nye, the C of E secretary general, told reporters earlier this year 
that the church was aiming to recruit 6,000 new priests over the next 15 years. 
“They will be the leadership of the church in the 2030s, 40s and 50s,” he said.


Meanwhile, the church has been forced to admit it made a mistake in saying 
that people applying for the role of “vocations adviser”, advertised on its 
website, did not need to be Christian.

Arun Arora, the C of E’s director of communications, said: “This was a 
mistake. We have taken the adverts for the role down and will be re-posting 
them … The adverts that went out slipped through unchecked and for that we are 
sorry.”


The revised adverts, for national young vocations adviser and national 
minority ethnic vocations officer, would make clear it was a “genuine 
occupational requirement” for the post-holders to be Christian.


But, Arora pointed out, there were many jobs with the church for 
non-Christians. “Working for the church can take many forms – from data 
inputters to schoolteachers, accountants to graphic designers, project managers 
to investment analysts; there are jobs and roles for people of all faiths and 
none.”
