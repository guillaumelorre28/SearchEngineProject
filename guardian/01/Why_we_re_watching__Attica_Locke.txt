Attica, that's an unusual name… I know. Screenwriter-turned-novelist Attica 
Locke <https://www.theguardian.com/books/attica-locke> was named after the 1971 
uprising at the Attica State Correctional Facility in upstate New York. "My 
mother dearly believes that's why I have no problem saying no to people and 
standing up for myself," she says.

It was a political family? It certainly was. Locke's parents were civil rights 
activists whose love came "wrapped up in a big political romance". Her lawyer 
father ran for mayor of Houston in 2009.

So what sort of books does she write? Crime novels with, as you might expect, 
a strong political bent. Her first,Black Water Rising, tackled 1980s Texas and 
was shortlisted for the 2010 Orange Prize.The Cutting Season, due out this 
month, centres on a gruesome discovery on a former slave plantation.

A light 'n' breezy read, then. No, but an utterly gripping one. The Cutting 
Season alsomakes some serious points about race in post-Obama America.

She says… "I don't like sentences to be too pretty. I see my books as falling 
somewhere between John Grisham and [film director] John Sayles."

We say… Searching for some deft plotting and a willingness to tackle difficult 
subjects? Look no further. The Cutting Seasonis published by Serpent's Tail on 
13 September, £14.99
