 <http://www.dundeerep.co.uk/event/cheviot>

The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil 
<http://www.dundeerep.co.uk/event/cheviot> 

The first professional production in more than 20 years of John McGrath’s 
legendary musical play, first produced by 7:84 Scotland in 1973, that takes the 
form of a ceilidh as it explores the history of Scotland and its economic 
exploitation from the Highland Clearances to the oil boom of the 1970s. The 
play was hugely successful when it was first produced, and it’s time may well 
have come again in a more politically engaged Scotland with the SNP in the 
ascendant. It will certainly be a good night out.


 * From 9 September to 26 September, Dundee Rep (01382 223530)

Martin McDonagh’s first UK play in over a decade is set in a pub in Oldham and

punishment is formally abolished. David Morrissey and the League of Gentlemen’s

Pomona <http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/pomona> 

Dystopian drama meets gaming in Alistair McDowell’s sinister, violent yet 
comic play in which a young woman searches for her lost twin sister and finds 
all roads lead to a hole in the centre of Manchester, a concrete island called 
Pomona. First seen at the Orange Tree last year, the play is revived at the NT 
before heading to Manchester and it is as fierce and as tender a portrait of 
lost souls and broken hearts as you could hope to find, full of moral 
ambiguities and startling images including an octopus-faced god of evil.

Waiting for Godot <http://lyceum.org.uk/whats-on/production/waiting-for-godot> 

There are times when it feels as if Beckett’s play about waiting in which 
nothing happens twice is becoming less of a play and more of a celebrity actor 
double-act. But the pairing of those two very fine actors Brian Cox and Bill 
Paterson, as Vladimir and Estragon, should not only kickstart the Royal Lyceum
Theatre <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre> Company’s 50th-anniversary 
celebrations in style but also provide a partnership that gets to the heart of 
Beckett’s play and the human condition: that there is nothing to be done but 
we’ll keep on trying anyway.

epic theatre, and now the pair set their sights on Christopher Logue’s poem War 
Music, inspired by Homer’s account of the last years of the Trojan war. This is 
a show that will be big in every way – from the cast and design to a running 
time of eight hours, split into four shows, that can be seen individually or in 
two marathon performances either all day or overnight.

More Greeks, with the revival of Euripides’s ever-popular play about a heroine 
who gets her revenge on the faithless Jason by murdering their two young sons. 
Rupert Goold’s production of Rachel Cusk’s new version concludes a fascinating 
season devoted to the Greeks – and the fact that Medea is played by Goold’s 
wife, Kate Fleetwood, lends a certain spice to the occasion.

A season of French farce kicks off with a rare sighting of a play by Eugene 
Labiche: one that shows a group of bourgeois husbands thrown into panic when 
the philandering hero threatens to jettison their wives. The versatile Jeremy 
Sams not only provides a new translation and directs but ensures that song and 
dance, vital to Labiche’s vaudevillian farces, strongly feature.

extraordinary play about a ship’s stoker, Yank, who embodies the alienated

but last doesn’t have to mean least. McIntyre who has proved herself a hugely

Are we not drawn onward to new erA 
<http://www.theatreroyal.com/whats-on/2015/are-we-not-drawn-onward-to-new-era/> 

A show which like the title is a palindrome that can be read both forward and 
backwards, the latest from Belgian theatrical whizz-kids Ontroerend Goed heads 
to the Adelaide festival following its three days in Plymouth. The second part 
of a trilogy exploring the world and its four billion years of history through 
the prism of Kierkegaard’s dictum that “life must be lived forwards, but it can 
only be understood backwards”, this is a piece that asks whether our impact on 
the world is irreversible. Or can we right the wrongs and heal the wounds of 
the past?

Sleeping Beauty <http://www.bristololdvic.org.uk/sleepingbeauty.html> 

Who says that great theatre can’t be for Christmas as much as at any other 
time of the year? Not director Sally Cookson, who has created a string of 
gorgeous and gloriously inventive shows that have premiered around the festive 
season but which have often had much longer lives. They include the fabulous 
Cinderella: a fairytale, Peter Pan and last year’s utterly loveable 101 
Dalmatians. With her staging ofJane Eyre 
<http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/jane-eyre> opening at the National 
Theatre this week, Cookson is riding high and this inverse version of the 
famous fairytale – it’s the Prince who has fallen into a 100 years slumber – 
should be a cracker.
