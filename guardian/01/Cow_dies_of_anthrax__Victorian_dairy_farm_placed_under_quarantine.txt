A farm in Victoria <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria> is 
under quarantine following the death of a cow from anthrax.


The dairy cow died from the bacterial disease at a property in Tatura, 
northern Victoria, a spokeswoman from the Department of Economic Development, 
Jobs, Transport and Resources said.


The department’s chief vet, Charles Milne, said it was an isolated case on a 
farm with a history of anthrax, but further cases were possible.


The anthrax bacterium has been in Australia for 150 years and is known to 
occur in the soil in parts of Victoria, occasionally causing livestock deaths.


The property has been placed under temporary quarantine and stock have been 
vaccinated. Stock on adjoining farms are also being vaccinated.


“Farmers in the region should check their paddocks for sudden, unexplained 
deaths among their animals and report any cases to the 24-hour emergency animal 
diseases hotline ... or to their local vet,” Milne said.

Anthrax <https://www.theguardian.com/world/anthrax> is a bacterial disease 
that occurs sporadically in herbivores, such as cattle, sheep and goats.

It can also infect people if they handle products from infected animals or 
breathe in anthrax spores from infected animal products, but only 11 human 
cases were reported between 1977 and 2010, the Department ofHealth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/health> said. The spores can remain 
infectious for long periods.


The infected person is usually isolated in hospital as a precaution while they 
undergo treatment.
