Cook fish on the bone to keep that lovely moist texture. It's easy to serve it 
family-style and allow everyone to dig in, perhaps with a nice chicory salad on 
the side.

(Serves 4)
400g new potatoes, halved
Pinch of salt
2 medium bream, 400g each
1 small onion, finely sliced
1 small head of fennel, finely sliced
Olive oil
1 lemon, rind grated and juice reserved
200ml water
2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped

Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark six.

Cover the potatoes with cold salted water in a pan and parboil for 10 minutes.

Place the bream in a large ovenproof dish.

Combine the onion and fennel, hold the fish open with one hand and stuff with 
the mixture.

Season the bream, add a dash of olive oil, the lemon juice and water, cover 
with foil and place in the oven for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, drain the potatoes and saute over a medium/high heat until golden 
brown.

Mix the parsley, lemon rind and garlic, season and add enough oil to bind.

Check the fish is cooked by piercing with a knife – it should go in without 
resistance – and remove from the oven.

To finish, cover the bream with the parsley mix and serve with the sauteed 
potatoes.
