This week President Obama launched a major push to fix the country’s criminal 
justice system and end mass incarceration. The reform talk is coming from both 
sides of the aisle and unlikely partnerships are being forged between big 
business interests like the Koch brothers and vocal liberals. But big business 
is tied to thecarceral state

, so how can they be part of the solution to end it?

Van Jones, the liberal political commentator, and a Koch representative named 
Mark Holden recentlyappeared on Democracy Now 
<http://t.sidekickopen13.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XX48rBsjTVf01Gj64R0bbVRJgRK56dGNkf3gxDMd02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democracynow.org%2F2015%2F7%2F15%2Fstrange_bedfellows_why_are_the_koch&si=4774209355513856&pi=a476f9fc-5107-419a-a57f-10e28f8ad4d4>
 where they harmoniously backed Obama’s reform plans. Holden stated that 
“Charles Koch and David Koch are classical liberals who believe in expansive 
individual liberties in the Bill of Rights and limited government.” He went on 
to say:

What worked 20 or 30 years ago doesn’t work today. And we have to have the 
intellectual honesty and courage and humility to correct that. In our 
businesses, we do that all the time when things aren’t working … what we’re 
seeing happen in the states is really a template for what should happen at the 
federal level.

This language reinforces the idea that the prison system in the United States 
is a business. The Koch Brothers have been connected to the conservative, 
corporate-funded American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, for some 
time. In 2011, the Koch brothersdonated $24 million 
<http://t.sidekickopen13.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XX48rBsjTVf01Gj64R0bbVRJgRK56dGNkf3gxDMd02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publicintegrity.org%2F2013%2F01%2F31%2F12105%2Fkoch-brothers-pour-more-cash-think-tanks-alec&si=4774209355513856&pi=e3091438-70a7-43a3-c45b-f1c982469fe1>
 to various conservative organizations and think tanks including ALEC, through 
four foundations they run. ALEC received funding from the brothers to help 
finance meetings where “model” legislation would ultimately be drafted.

That relationship is enough to doubt Koch Brothers’ commitment to prison 
reform. Consider that, in 2009 ALEC has helped draftrepressive immigration 
legislation

 and has had a longstandingcomfortable relationship

 with the private prison industry. Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), 
the largest prison company in the country, once chaired ALEC’s now defunct 
“Criminal Justice Task Force.” The origins of mandatory minimum sentences, 
three strikes laws and truth-in-sentencing which create higher prison 
populationshave origins in ALEC’s model legislation

.

So what’s motivating the corporate elite’s interest on this social justice 
issue? One likely answer is that there are special interests who see prison 
reform as an opportunity to push for privatization, and make money. Private 
prisons have been a growing trend in recent years and between 2000 and 2010 
their numberdoubled 
<http://t.sidekickopen13.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XX48rBsjTVf01Gj64R0bbVRJgRK56dGNkf3gxDMd02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.motherjones.com%2Fmojo%2F2015%2F06%2Fprivate-prisons-profit&si=4774209355513856&pi=a476f9fc-5107-419a-a57f-10e28f8ad4d4>
 in the United States.

One of the first rules of capitalism is: increase profits. That’s why it must 
be assumed that increasing big business’s power over the criminal justice 
system could only make things worse. We have seen how with other important 
reform efforts,like education reform 
<http://t.sidekickopen13.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XX48rBsjTVf01Gj64R0bbVRJgRK56dGNkf3gxDMd02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fbillmoyers.com%2F2014%2F03%2F28%2Fpublic-education-who-are-the-corporate-reformers%2F&si=4774209355513856&pi=a476f9fc-5107-419a-a57f-10e28f8ad4d4>
, privatization motives often sneak in the back door. Another risk is that 
their involvement could lead to cosmetic changes to the prison industry that 
shift attention away from the primary problems. Consider the empty nature of 
many of the administration’sNSA reforms

It’s important for liberals to scrutinize the alliance between progressive 
groups and big business, especially as it is growing rapidly. The Gates 
foundation, for example, hasinvested in private prisons like the GEO Group

. Both of these foundations support and fund nonprofits that are likely to take 
up the cause of prison reform, if they are not already doing work to circumvent 
the expansion of the prison industrial complex.

Re-imagining the prison system with the private sector is problematic and it’s 
a liability that we shouldn’t easily disregard.

There are many important issues where progressives and corporate giants will 
likely not see eye to eye, such asabolishing bail.

: “a 2007 brief by ALEC recommended releasing people early from prison with 
conditional release bonds, similar to bail bonds, effectively setting up 
bonding companies as private parole agencies.” Those who have long been 
fighting to end mass incarceration know abolishing bail is vital, but groups 
like ALEC have worked to obstruct real progress on issues like this in the past 
by pushing towards privatization.


If we allow big business to co-opt the movement to end mass incarceration, we 
risk diluting real change. Another empty corporate led “reform” movement where 
big business has too many seats at the table is not the systemic change it will 
present itself to be. Those who have been misused by the prison system in this 
country are more than bullet points in nice speeches. They are real people who 
have suffered and are still suffering. We must ensure that we work in the 
interests of those who have been hurt by this crisis, not the private interests 
who helped create it.
