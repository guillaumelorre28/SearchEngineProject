You can expect people in Albania to be curious (have an answer ready to the 
question of why you are not married), but friendly. The usual greeting when you 
meet someone on a country road or track is "Mirë jeni?" ("Are you well?", 
pronounced "Meer Yenni?").

In rural areas, food and bottled water can be found in villages on main roads, 
where there are also small roadside restaurants. Smaller villages away from 
tarmac roads sometimes have shops selling unpredictable types of food and soft 
drinks but almost never water.

A fine area for walkers who like hills and not just mountains is Mallakastër, 
in the triangle between the towns of Fier, Berat and Tepelenë. But unless you 
are camping, it might be difficult to find somewhere to sleep (there is 
currently no hotel operating on the 80km stretch of the north-south highway 
between Fier and Tepelenë).
