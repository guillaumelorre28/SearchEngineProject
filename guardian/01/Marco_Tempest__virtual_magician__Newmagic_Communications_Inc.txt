 Activate New York 2012: Marco Tempest 
Marco Tempest's imaginative combination of computer-generated imagery, 
quick-cut video and enthusiastic stage presence has earned him a place in the 
pantheon of great illusionists. At 22, the Swiss magician won the New York 
World Cup of Magic, launching him into international prominence. Tempest's 
award-winning television series "The Virtual Magician" airs in dozens of 
countries worldwide, while his lively phonecam postings on YouTube, done 
without post-production and video-editing tricks to astonished people on the 
street, get millions of views (search on "virtualmagician"). His Vimeo channel 
showcases his artistic side -- like his recent hypnotic series "levitation," 
using a high-speed camera.
