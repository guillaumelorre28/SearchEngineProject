Giles Fraserâ€™s observations on secular funerals were painfully accurate (Loose 
canon

, 22 August). It is no surprise that there have been several angry responses (
Letters: Secular funerals are not a blind date with truth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/24/secular-funerals-are-not-a-blind-date-with-the-truth>
, 25 August). Life tends to be short in east London, so I have attended scores 
of funerals in my 68 years. Secular funerals are often dominated by those with 
the loudest voices and the crassest anecdotes. They confuse the function of the 
funeral with the function of the post-funeral wake.

The one humanist funeral I have attended was well-ordered and polite but had 
to be followed by religious services for family who found the secular event 
lacked comfort. I am grateful to the Rev Giles Fraser for being so honest in 
saying what needed to be said.
