Good luck to Judi Kisiel as she begins her retirement after 25 years as editor 
of the Weston & Somerset Mercury. She can be proud of her journalistic 
achievements because her paper has obviously been holding power to account. In 
her farewell message to readers last week she wrote:

"We set out to become a campaigning newspaper, fighting small and big battles 
that really mattered in the town.

A high point was in 1992 – our campaign against a mayor-elect who resigned 
after we revealed his dubious role in a planning application.

The Mercury also clashed with Jerry Wiggin, the town's standing MP... In a 
leader column we called for his resignation when he tabled amendments to a bill 
in the name of Sebastian Coe MP without asking him. Sir Jerry retired from 
politics at the next election."

[In May 1995, when the matter came to light, Wiggin - the Tory member for 
Weston-super-Mare - apologised to the Commons for tabling amendments without 
Coe's knowledge or consent. He stood down in 1997].

Kisiel continued: "One sign of a good newspaper should be its unflinching 
determination to highlight the bad behaviour of arrogant politicians – in fact, 
there are some in our own town who will probably be celebrating my retirement."

She explained that she had tried to run "a good, professional, independent 
newspaper" with "readers at the heart of everything" while "trying to make the 
town a better place in which to live and work."

Kisiel joined the paper in 1987 after training on the Bristol Evening Post and 
working on papers in Devon and Hampshire. She took over as editor the following 
year.

The Mercury, owned by Archant <https://www.theguardian.com/media/archant>, 
sells about 14,000 copies a week. It will now be headed by a content editor, 
Simon Angear, who was born, raised and educated in Weston.
