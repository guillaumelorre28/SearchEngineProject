"An educational role with a preventative purpose" is how Georgina Vividor, 29, 
a journalist from El Salvador's newspaper, El Diario de Hoy, sums up the role 
of the media when reporting natural disasters.

"All media needs to educate the population so that there are no severe losses 
to regret," she says. "Recently, El Salvador has had lightning and electrical 
storms so there have been a series of articles on what to do and what not to do 
during the storms."

Yet, despite this example, Vividor says coverage of measures that could reduce 
natural disaster risk is very limited in comparison to that of the disasters 
themselves.

"Disasters are newsworthy because of the general sense of alarm. The 
uncertainty people feel," she says. "[With] disaster risk reduction you don't 
get to see the immediate effects, so there is no immediate reason to know."

The lack of sensationalism surrounding disaster risk reduction means articles 
about it are much less popular than news about topis such as fashion, sport and 
technology, and are rarely featured in the media.

However, one story that did capture the paper's attention was a classroom with 
5,000 plastic bottles in its walls, built with the help of schoolchildren in a 
rural town in Ahuachapán, in western El Salvador. The project – co-ordinated by 
the organisation Hug it Forward, which uses bottles as insulation – is 
eco-friendly and earthquake-resilient.

"Definitely these types of stories need more coverage," says Vividor. "This 
type of article educates and inspires."
