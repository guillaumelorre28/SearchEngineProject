Authorities say more than two dozen monkeys have been set free in Puerto Rico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/puerto-rico> after someone broke a lock on 
their enclosures at a primate research facility.

Police say the roughly 30 rhesus macaques were freed early Sunday from the 
Caribbean Primate Research Center in the northern town of Toa Baja.

The facility established in the late 1930s is a unit of the University of 
Puerto Rico. It supplies monkeys for use in studies of diseases that afflict 
people.

There have been no arrests. Authorities have launched an effort to recapture 
the monkeys.

Puerto Rico has long struggled with controlling wild monkeys that descended 
from escaped research monkeys.

Over the years, the US Caribbean island has euthanized hundreds of wild 
monkeys blamed for scavenging crops and damaging natural resources.
