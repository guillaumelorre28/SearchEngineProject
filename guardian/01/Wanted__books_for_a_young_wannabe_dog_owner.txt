Our child is desperate for a dog. Are there any good children's books that 
show the good or the bad sides of owning a dog?

Dogs feature frequently in children's books and they are almost always seen as 
a "good thing". Not only do the dogs themselves often have useful 
characteristics such as courage and loyalty, but caring for them invests 
children with good qualities, too.
 Jeremy Strong, The Hundred-Mile-an-Hour Dog Goes for Gold! 
Having to take notice of the needs of a pet of any kind gives children the 
opportunity to be loving, unselfish and responsible. However, in books as in 
life, things only work out well if the dog plays the game too!

Streaker, the star of Jeremy Strong's The Hundred-Mile-an-Hour Dog

, is without doubt a handful. Trevor does his best to train her – and his 
attempts to do so are very, very funny – but it is certainly not an easy task. 
In spite of the problems she causes, though, she also brings the benefit that 
most dogs do: she enables Trevor to meet other people. In fact, her behaviour 
positively forces him to do so.
 Anthony Browne, A Walk in the Park 
The social advantages of being a dog-owner are also evident in Anthony 
Browne's A Walk in the Park. The Smiths and the Smythes – two very different 
families – would not ever have spoken to each other in the park if their dogs – 
also very different from each other – hadn't broken the ice by playing 
together. Following Victoria and Albert causes Charles and Smudge to become 
best friends.

 may help you make your mind up about ownership as both show the very terrible 
effects of not allowing a child to have a dog!

In A Dog so Small, Ben yearns for a dog so intensely that he believes he will 
get one and even that he has indeed been promised one. When it turns out that 
he isn't to be given a real dog he creates his own imaginary one and thus 
withdraws into his own world before he resolves his disappointment.

Hal in A Dog and his Boy is equally passionate in his longstanding and urgent 
need for a dog. His parents refuse to allow him to own a dog on the grounds 
that it will wreck their expense furniture. When they come up with what think 
of as a valid alternative – Hal can hire a dog by the day – Hal refuses to give 
the dog back and instead runs away runs with it and the whole pack of other 
dogs up for hire.
