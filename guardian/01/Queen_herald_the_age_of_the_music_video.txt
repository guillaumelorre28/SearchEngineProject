Queen's superstardom was built on a flimsy pretext: they didn't want to look 
foolish miming the mock operatics of Bohemian Rhapsody on Top of the Pops (they 
left the stage for that section in live shows). So for Â£4,500 they made a "pop 
promo", exposing a mass audience to the band's theatrical skills. The song 
reached No 1 and stayed there for nine weeks, ensuring videos would henceforth 
be a mandatory tool in the marketing of music.
