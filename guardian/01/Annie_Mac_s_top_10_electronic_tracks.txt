Massive Attack: Unfinished Sympathy

A masterpiece, one of those records that takes you out of reality. Blue Lines, 
the album it’s from, introduced me to electronic music at the age of 12. The 
lyric “you’re the book that I have opened and now I’ve got to know much more” 
summed up how I felt about music after that.

Portishead: Roads




I first heard this on a tape my friend had recorded off pirate radio, and my 
mind was blown. Geoff Barrow is a next-level producer, and Beth Gibbons’s voice 
sounds so frail. So many artists around now have been influenced by Portishead. 
FKA twigs, for example.

Leftfield: Space Shanty




My introduction to techno. It sounds a little dated now. Actually, it sounds 
very like 1995, because it’s incredibly fast – 134bpm. Leftfield loved reggae 
and dub and brought them into their music. I love people who defy categories 
and bring sounds together.

Goldie: Inner City Life

The strings, the emotion, the whole feel is so lush, yet tough, too. It’s a 
soul record as well as drum’n’bass. I’d never heard rhythms or beats like this 
before. It still sounds exciting.

Daft Punk: Burnin

Built for the dancefloor. There’s no hidden meaning, it’s not trying to be 
deep. It just is what it is: a big, rolling, buildup to an incredible bassline 
and drop. I counted and there are three breakdowns – it’s not often you get 
that. I had my first dancefloor epiphany to this. It taught me all the 
beautiful things clubbing can offer, that sense of communion and feeling 
invincible.

DJ Rolando: Knights of the Jaguar

This was released on cult Detroit techno label Underground Resistance. They 
were anti-major label, anti-establishment and this was their most popular 
release. I come at electronic music from an emotional perspective – my 
favourite element is strings – and this song demonstrates their hypnotic power. 
A lot of DJs play this as their last track. It’s a beautiful way to end a 
night, hugely uplifting.

A Tribe Called Quest: Electric Relaxation

A hip-hop track but also absolutely and undoubtedly electronic music. A Tribe 
Called Quest are a lesson in music, not just hip-hop. Q-Tip was a huge fan of 
jazz and sampled it a lot. That’s the beautiful thing about hip-hop: it can 
lead you to many other types of music.

Nuyorican Soul: I Am the Black Gold of the Sun (4 Hero remix)

4 Hero are iconic producers of UK dance and electronic soul. The drums and the 
breakbeat took this track somewhere else, which is what music should do. After 
hearing this, I discovered Rotary Connection and Minnie Riperton – my 
introduction to soul.

Justice: Waters of Nazareth (Erol Alkan remix) 

Justice got a lot of kids who loved rock into dance. Erol had Trash at the 
time, a big London clubnight, and the whole scene helped cause a shift in what 
dance music was. Justice toured America before EDM, turning a whole generation 
of American kids on to dance.

La Roux: In For the Kill (Skream remix)




A remix should change your perception of the original, which is what Skream 
did here. Dubstep had been going for a long time, but this was the point when 
the mainstream noticed. The underground scene is still strong, but this was the 
first time I saw a genre come and go so quickly in the mainstream. My favourite 
dubstep was the music more rooted to actual dub, but what the scene mutated 
into was big, noisy, and brash. Similar to Justice, a lot of kids who were into 
heavy metal and rock entered electronic music by discovering dubstep artists 
like Skrillex and Flux Pavilion. It was genuinely new and exciting and abrasive 
to people. That’s what music should be. It should be divisive.

Orbital: Belfast

Very emotional with a crazy vocal that weaves in and out. I’ve never played 
this in clubs – it’s more cerebral for me, a nostalgic choice. Orbital wrote it 
as a homage to Belfast, which is where I went to university. Those three years 
changed my life. It was where I decided to become a DJ, where I bought my first 
decks. My coming of age.
