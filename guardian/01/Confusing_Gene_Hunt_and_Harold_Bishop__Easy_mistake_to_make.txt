One viewer who complained to the BBC about the last-minute replacement of drama
Ashes to Ashes with live football last week was bemused by the surreal reply 
from the corporation's complaints department. "Thank you for contacting us 
about Neighbours moving to Five," it began. "We understand that you were upset 
that the programme is no longer on the BBC and would have liked an announcement 
to have been made to this effect." The long email went on to say how it wasn't 
the BBC's business to promote shows on rival channels, which is all well and 
good but had nothing to do with the complaint. It ended: "Nevertheless, I fully 
appreciate that you feel strongly about this matter. Therefore I would like to 
assure you that we have registered your comments on our audience log. It 
ensures that your points, and all other comments we receive, are circulated and 
considered across the BBC." Sounds like someone in the BBC complaints 
department decided to ape the Two Ronnies' Mastermind sketch, Answering The 
Question Before Last.
