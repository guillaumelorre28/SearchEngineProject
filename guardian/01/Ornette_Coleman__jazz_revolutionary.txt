"I heard him for the first time at college. I bought The Shape of Jazz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> to Come. I really loved it. Even 
though it was like nothing else I'd ever heard, it was also easy to relate 
to.It seemed groundbreaking, even though I'd heard music that had come after 
it. It definitely altered the way I played. I was 22, 23 at the time and I knew 
a bit of stuff, I was into Monk, John Coltrane, Mingus, Ellington.

"I liked the story of the band he had then. It seemed exciting, the way they 
got the music together, then all went to New York with a concept that freaked 
people out. I remember an interview with bassist Charlie Haden where he talked 
of seeing Coleman play in a club and realised, 'This is what I've been waiting 
for.' He followed him out of the club, started talking to him and they began 
playing together that day.

"I couldn't make his performance at Meltdown last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/jun/10/ornette-coleman> 
because I was playing myself, but I saw him a few years ago at the Cheltenham 
jazz festival. I was so moved by the gig, and I met him afterwards. I played 
the festival too, and I was just taking my drums out to the car when he came 
out of this door and I looked up and thought, 'Oh my God, it's Ornette 
Coleman.' He said: 'Hey, who are you?' I told him I was a drummer and he was so 
nice to me, just gave me advice about music and shook my hand. It felt like I'd 
met an angel â€“ he seemed like a beautiful person. As far I know, jazz would 
definitely be completely different with him."
