1) The Royal Croquet Club <http://www.royalcroquetclub.com.au/>

In 2014, the Royal Croquet Club felt like a nice idea that failed on the 
execution; the great design and location in Adelaide’s newly renovated Victoria 
Square was let down by some lacklustre programming. This year, with a new 
curatorial team and a long lead-in to the fringe, RCC is about to start its 
second year with one of the strongest programs on offer.

With five venues ranging from the 600-seat Panama Club down to an intimate 
black-box theatre space, RCC has a strong focus on contemporary performance, 
placing leading international productions in conversation with work from local 
and national artists. With circus, theatre, hypnosis and dance, to name just a 
few of the artforms on show, and an emphasis on exciting, new and genre-defying 
work, the RCC has the best pick-any-show program on offer.

2) Tuxedo Cat <http://www.tuxedocat.com.au/>

For those who like their art a little more rough and ready, the Adelaide 
fringe venue is always Tuxedo Cat. Home to those small comedians you’ve never 
heard of and experimental performance makers trying something new, the small 
venue now tucked away down Hyde Street in the city always brings together 
artists who throw stuff at the wall just to see what sticks – and who are 
always happy to be accosted for a drink at the bar after their show. One of the 
highlights of its 2014 program,Trygve Wakenshaw’s Kraken 
<http://www.adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/trygve-wakenshaw-kraken/e15295e4-7d67-42f8-88ea-c8dd5bbfb75f>
, went on to play to rave reviews in Edinburgh and has now moved up to the big 
side of town in the Garden of Unearthly Delights, so Tuxedo Cat is the venue to 
hit if you want to say: “I saw it first.”

3) The Garden of Unearthly Delights 
<http://www.gardenofunearthlydelights.com.au/home/>

Fringe wouldn’t be fringe without those searingly hot days where you try to 
find just a slither of shade to sit under in the Garden of Unearthly Delights 
and sweat through the inadequate air conditioning of its tents, and the warm 
evenings when you sit on the (mostly dead) grass, looking up at the stars and 
feeling the hustle of the fringe around you.

And these are the reasons we love it. It’s impossible to imagine the fringe 
without the Garden, now taking over nearly the entire block of Rymil Park with 
circus tents, fair rides, and the highest concentration of roving performers 
trying to sell tickets to their shows. The Spiegeltent is pretty much a whole 
fringe program in and of itself, but gems are hiding in the smaller spaces, too.

4) Ancient World <https://www.facebook.com/AncientWorldAdelaide>

Moving from the biggest venue of the fringe to one of the smallest, Ancient 
World is tucked away in a basement entered off a laneway off Hindley street. 
The small bar opened at the beginning of the 2014 fringethanks to Renew Adelaide
 <http://www.renewadelaide.com.au/> and this year is the first it’s dipping its 
toes into fringe programming.

The space is small and rough and strange, and the work on show seems to be 
similarly strange and experimental. Most shows are playing only a handful of 
times, but if you want to try something truly new and off beat, this is the 
venue to try.

5) Surrender <http://surrenderclub.com.au/>

One of the highlights of the 2012 and 2013 Adelaide festivals was the festival 
club Barrio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/mar/09/adelaide-festival-2013-circus>
. The club made sense of Adelaide’s barren Hajek Plaza for the first time, as 
the shanty town of bars was given over to a new art installation every night. 
The people behind Barrio have jumped ship to the fringe and moved a few hundred 
metres down the Torrens to set up Surrender.

Declaring itself a sovereign nation under president Doctor YaYa (who, among 
other honorifics, is the “Protector of the Abbott Proof Fence”), the artists 
are asking Adelaidians to surrender to this new salvation.

Like Barrio, Surrender promises to be part bar, part food experience, part 
club, and all art installation. Running every Friday to Sunday through fringe, 
the only line up to speak of is the DJs and the Saturday night Paris is Burning 
dance-floor competition. This isn’t the venue to visit if you want to see a 
show – this venue is the show.
