David Abraham may well prove to be a good chief executive at Channel 4 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jan/22/channel-4-david-abraham-chief-executive>
, but it is hard not to be disappointed by his appointment.

Back in November when Terry Burns was appointed chairman of the 
minority-supporting, cutting-edge public service broadcaster,we wondered 
whether such an organisation should be appointing someone other than another 
white male to its top posts 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder/2009/nov/04/channel-4-chairman-chief-executive>
. So, who have we got as a new chief exec?

Following the creative void at Channel 4 under the leadership of a marketing 
man, in the form ofAndy Duncan <https://www.theguardian.com/media/andyduncan>, 
we could have hoped for an inspirational creative leader. Instead we have 
another man with a commercial background.

And to make matters even more dispiriting, Abraham's biggest claim to fame is 
renaming one of his channels Dave and attracting an audience with wall-to-wall 
Top Gear repeats, lining Jeremy Clarkson's pockets even further.

On the plus side, Burns says: "David is a rare commodity as a broadcaster in 
that he has an exceptional track record as an innovative leader, both 
creatively and commercially."

This includes his period as co-founder of influential ad agency St Luke's and 
running a collection of Discovery channels.

And if Channel 4 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> does ever manage 
to create a commercial tie-up with BBC Worldwide to help its finances, Abraham 
does have plenty of experience of working closely with the BBC at UKTV.

It could be argued that, out of the frontrunners for the Channel 4 job 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediamonkeyblog/2010/jan/08/channel-4-itv-big-cheese-chart>
, Abraham is the one most likely to be able to work with director of television 
and content Kevin Lygo, given his commercial rather than programming background.

But as Lygo was a candidate for this post, will he want to stay on? Do Channel 
4 want him to?
