With the murder of Boris Nemtsov, Russia’s beleaguered liberal opposition has 
lost one of its last audible voices. There was a brief period, after 
parliamentary elections in late 2011, when street dissent seemed on the rise, 
and large rallies gripped Moscow.

The optimism dissipated however, after Putin won another resounding victory in 
the March 2012 presidential elections. The day before his inauguration, a huge 
protest turned violent. In a sign that any radicalisation would not be 
tolerated, a number of protesters were put on trial, often for extremely minor 
offences, and threatened with years in jail.

Since then, the opposition’s mood has been on the wane, with urban liberals 
either making plans to leaveRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> 
or simply getting on with life, feeling they have more to lose than to gain by 
protesting.

Russia’s parliament is dominated by the pro-Putin United Russia party but also 
has three parties nominally in opposition: Just Russia, the Liberal Democrats 
and the Communists. While these parties are given airtime on television and – 
especially in the case of the Communists – have a genuine electorate, they are 
best described as “systemic opposition”, managed by the Kremlin.

Among the “non-systemic” opposition, there are few politicians who have much 
of a national profile, with the restrictions of state television meaning it is 
hard to gain a real platform. Harassment, threats and fatigue have led many 
into either jail or exile. Now that Nemtsov has been silenced, here are a list 
of the main opposition figureheads.

Once Russia’s richest man, Khodorkovsky was jailed in 2003, on charges widely 
believed to be politically motivated after he began financing political 
parties. He spent a decade in prison but was released in December 2013 after 
Putin granted him amnesty.

Khodorkovsky was immediately flown to Berlin and now lives in Zurich. In 
December, he told the Guardian hebelieved he would be arrested if he returned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/26/mikhail-khodorkovsky-life-after-prison-russia-after-putin>
 to Russia.

He has set up the Open Russia Foundation and is prepared to go “all the way” 
to change the regime in Russia. However, although Khodorkovsky may have 
impressed some with his stoical handling of a decade in prison, most Russians 
have little regard for those who made billions in the 1990s, and it is also 
unclear how much he can influence politics from outside the country.

The former world chess champion became a fierce critic of Putin and was a 
frequent fixture at opposition events for many years, often being detained by 
police. In 2013, he announced at a press conference in Geneva that he had 
decided not to return to Russia as, after criminal charges were brought against 
Navalny and other opposition activists, he could be next.

A blogger and lawyer who gained a huge following for his investigations into 
corruption among Putin’s elite, Navalny came to prominence during the wave of 
street protests in Moscow at the end of 2011, and was widely seen as the 
brightest hope for the opposition.

Some are disturbed by his Russian nationalist views while others point out 
that they could help him gain broader support among Russians who would not 
normally support the opposition.

Since he came to prominence, Navalny has had to deal with a wave of 
bureaucratic and legal hassles, including two major court cases. At the end of 
last year, Navalny was given a suspended sentence in a fraud trial, but his 
brother was sentenced to 3and-a-half years in prison.

Navalny says authorities have effectively taken his brother hostage in an 
attempt to stop him working but he has vowed to continue. He was not at 
Sunday’s march in Moscow, having been jailed for 15 days when handing out 
leaflets advertising the event – back when it was still an “anti-crisis rally” 
and not a memorial for Nemtsov.

It has been suggested for a long time that the serious popular threat to Putin 
comes not from liberals but from nationalists, and these forces have been newly 
invigorated by the war in east Ukraine. Indeed, one theory is that rogue 
nationalist groups could be behind the killing of Nemtsov.

Strelkov, a fan of military re-enactments, fought for Russia in Chechnya and 
more recently helped coordinate the pro-Russian rebel movement in eastern 
Ukraine. Called back to Moscow after apparently going rogue, he has said he 
believes Russia will soon be engulfed by war.

“His analysis is simple,” said Alexander Borodai, another Russian leader of 
the Donbass rebels. “There is a crisis in the country, the government will fall 
soon, and in the inevitable civil war, Igor Strelkov will head patriotic forces 
and become the dictator of what is left of Russia.”

The scenario seems unlikely but there is no doubt that serious thought is 
being given as to whether the promotion of Russian nationalism in the armed 
conflict in Ukraine might have let a genie out of the bottle.

A familiar face at opposition protests for years, 38-year-old Udaltsov is a 
hardcore radical leftist, who has been detained on numerous occasions at 
rallies. He was charged as part of the “mass disturbances” case over a May 2012 
rally that turned violent, and was sentenced to 4 and-a-half years in prison. 
From jail, he has said that liberals and leftists must go separate ways now, 
due to their different positions on the conflict in Ukraine, and while he still 
opposes Putin, he calls for a new union of far-left forces.
