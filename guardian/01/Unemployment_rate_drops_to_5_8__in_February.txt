Australia’s jobless rate unexpectedly has dropped to 5.8%.

The February fall in figures, released on Thursday, unwound the equally 
surprising rise in the unemployment rate to 6% in January.

However, the number of people employed barely moved with just 300 new jobs 
created last month.

That’s because the 15,900 new full-time jobs were offset by the loss of 15,600 
part-time workers.

The unemployment rate fell as fewer people sought work, with the participation 
rate declining to 64.9% from 65.1%.

The deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, has said that an 
important factor in the outlook for interest rates will be whether economic 
growth continues to be sufficient to accommodate growth in employment.

Brendan O’Connor, Labor’s employment spokesman, said there was nothing to 
cheer about in the latest labour force report.

“Three hundred jobs in a nation this size in one month is not good news ... 
people are giving up looking for work,” he told reporters in Canberra.
