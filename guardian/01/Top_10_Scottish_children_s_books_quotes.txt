There’s a funny thing I’ve noticed about life. When you really dread 
something, it turns out not to be so bad. It’s the unexpected awful things that 
get you down.”
Elizabeth Laird, Red Sky in the Morning 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/red-sky-in-the-morning.html>

Look at the stars, how they shine and glow, some of the stars died a long time 
ago. Still they shine in the evening skies, for you see… love like starlight 
never dies…”

There are two things that men should never weary of, goodness and humility; we 
get none too much of them in this rough world among cold, proud people.”
Robert Louis Stevenson, Kidnapped

Education never ends, Watson. It is a series of lessons, with the greatest for

 Here today, up and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel, change, interest, 
excitement! The whole world before you, and a horizon that’s always changing!”
Kenneth Grahame, The Wind in the Willows 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/wind-in-the-willows-33.html>

Lying eats into the soul. If it becomes a habit it frays the edge of your 
spirit. Truth telling, although sometimes harder to do, strengthens your heart. 
It serves a person ill not to tell the truth.”
Theresa Breslin, The Medici Seal 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/medici-seal.html>

You can betray someone with a word or an action. You can betray them with 
silence or inaction too. And in betraying that one person, you can betray a 
whole world.”

 “Wendy,” Peter Pan continued in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able 
to resist, “Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty boys.”
JM Barrie, Peter Pan <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/peter-pan-24.html>

Yes, it is - a very great deal, for it is a beginning. And a beginning is the 
greatest thing of all. To try to be brave is to be brave. The coward who tries 
to be brave is before the man who is brave because he is made so, and never had 
to try.”
George MacDonald, At the Back of the North Wind
