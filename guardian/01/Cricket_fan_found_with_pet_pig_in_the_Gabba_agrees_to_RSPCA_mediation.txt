A cricket fan who was found with a pet pig at the Gabba during the first Ashes 
test has agreed to undergo mediation with the RSPCA.

Australian cricket fan David Gunn, 33, was charged with animal cruelty after 
the pig was allegedly smuggled into the Brisbane sportsground with its snout 
taped shut and disguised as a baby.

Gunn was found holding the 10-12kg domestic pig, named Ash, on the first day 
of the test match between Australia and England in November.

The Brisbane magistrates court heard on Wednesday that the case had been 
referred to mediation.

Police did not oppose the move after CCTV footage showed Gunn was not in 
possession of the pig when he entered the cricket ground.

RSPCA Queensland spokesman Michael Beatty said in his experience mediation 
involved sitting the person down and trying to make them understand how their 
actions affected the animal.

“If we were asked to participate in mediation I’d probably get one of our vets 
to come along and explain to the person just what stress and suffering their 
stupidity caused,” he said.

Ash was distressed and dehydrated when examined by an RSPCA veterinarian 
following the ordeal.

He has since made a full recovery and is leading a pleasant life on a large 
property in Brisbane, Beatty said.
