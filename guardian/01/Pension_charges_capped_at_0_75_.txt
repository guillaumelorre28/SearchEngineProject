Fees for managing pension pots will be capped at 0.75% from next year, 
following concerns that rip-off charges have been eroding the value of savings.

Steve Webb, the Lib Dem pensions minister, said the government would put 
pension charges in a vice and keep squeezing until there was a "full 
standardised disclosure of all costs and changes".

The new 0.75% charge will apply to auto-enrolment pension schemes from April 
2015, potentially saving the public Â£200m a year.

Ministers have been considering a charge limit of somewhere between 0.75% and 
1% for some time, but delayed confirming details until now.

The delay exposed the coalition to opposition attacks last week. Labour 
pointed out that nothing had been done about high charges despite the 
government's reforms announced in the budget allowing savers to withdraw large 
lump sums from their pension pots.

Labour has promised to cap pension pot fees at 0.75%, and then gradually 
reduce them further over the course of a parliament to around 0.5%.

Speaking in the Commons, Gregg McClymont, the shadow pensions minister, said 
that for the government to have adopted an opposition policy was "truly a 
success for Ed Miliband".

In October Webb launched a consultation on workplace schemes, saying that a 
limit on annual charges was one of the ways the system could be made fairer for 
consumers. He pointed to a report by the Office of Fair Trading "identifying no 
fewer than 18 different sorts of charges which can be taken from people's 
pensions".

Some pension providers, including Aegon, have warned that the 0.75% cap would 
not work for all schemes and urged the government to take more time to consider 
the issue.
