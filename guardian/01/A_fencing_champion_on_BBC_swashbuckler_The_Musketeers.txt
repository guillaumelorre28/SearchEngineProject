It would be easy for a fencing purist to look at this TV show 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01qfqg0>, based on Alexandre Dumas's The 
Three Musketeers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/17/alexandre-dumas-swashbuckling-musketeers-half-story>
, and criticise the swordsmanship. There are certainly big differences between 
modern fencing and the fighting we see on screen: the musketeers' duels are 
conducted in large, swashbuckling swipes for maximum entertainment value – 
unlike the light, quick moves used in the sport.

But there are some similarities. At the most basic level, fencing boils down 
to two areas: footwork and managing your weapon. We get good demonstrations of 
both in these fights. D'Artagnan is light on his feet and excellent at changing 
direction. He gets the gold medal from me.

Fencing <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/fencing> today uses three different 
weapons: foil, épée and sabre. All three have their roots, like the sport 
itself, in the art of duelling and the swordfighting tradition of medieval 
Europe. When the musketeers fight on their feet, they use techniques that are 
close to the foil and épée styles – keeping their opponent at a distance with 
the blade. On horseback, they're closer to the slashing sabre style: that's no 
surprise, as the sabre in fencing grew out of cavalry fighting.

Fencing, of course, is not a fight to the death – but then in reality, neither 
was duelling. A gentleman would usually only draw blood and, in so doing, prove 
a point of honour. We don't draw blood in fencing, but the point system 
reflects this tradition: when a fencer is hit, the weapon retracts, and a score 
is recorded electronically.

Historically, swordsmanship was very much a male preserve, but the number of 
men and women in modern fencing is roughly equal. I hope thisvery enjoyable 
programme 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/20/the-musketeers-tv-review> 
will draw many more people to the sport. After all, we saw a massive spike in 
interest in fencing after the Madonna scenes in the Bond film Die Another Day.
