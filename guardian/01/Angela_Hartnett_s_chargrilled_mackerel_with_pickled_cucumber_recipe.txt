Chargrilling mackerel works brilliantly because it is such an oily fish. The 
pickled cucumber cuts through the oiliness, plus if there is any left over, it 
is also good eaten cold.

(Serves two)
One cucumber (or two if you want leftovers)
50g caster sugar
50ml white wine vinegar
20ml olive oil 
Two whole mackerel
1 tsp chopped coriander

Peel the cucumber and cut into strips, removing all the seeds. Season it with 
salt and leave for a few minutes. This allows the water content to reduce. 
Rinse and squeeze the cucumber and leave to one side.

Place the sugar and vinegar in a pan and heat until the sugar has dissolved. 
Pour the liquid over the cucumber and leave for three minutes to pickle it. 
Drain and leave to one side.

Add a dash of olive oil to a hot grill pan. Season the mackerel and place in 
the hot grill pan and cook for about three minutes on each side. Allow the skin 
to crisp up before turning to prevent it sticking to the pan.

When the fish is ready, remove it from the pan. Add the chopped coriander to 
the cucumber.

Serve the fish and cucumber with a green salad and wedges of lemon.
