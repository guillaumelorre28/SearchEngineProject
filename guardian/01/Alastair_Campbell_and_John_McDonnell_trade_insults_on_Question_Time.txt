The BBC discussion show Question Time descended into a heated row on Thursday, 
as former New Labour spin doctorAlastair Campbell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alastaircampbell> traded insults with 
Jeremy Corbyn’s right-hand man John McDonnell. The two men each accused the 
other of damaging the Labour party.

While McDonnell and Campbell found common ground in their disapproval of 
Theresa May’s ambition to reintroduce grammar schools, they clashed when 
Campbell suggested support for Corbyn was “a disaster for theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party”. 


Interrupting him, McDonnell called the comments “nauseating”, adding: “It’s 
nauseating because you are the one, above all else, who actually created the 
environment where no one believed a word a politician said.

“You lost us 5m votes in that process and set us up to fail. The reason Jeremy 
was elected is because people wanted some honesty back in politics again.”

Campbell had earlier struck a mollifying tone, admitting that the Labour 
administration he served under had made mistakes. “I certainly don’t put 
everything at the door ofJeremy Corbyn 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn>. I think that’d be really 
unfair,” he said.

“I think that there are issues going back to when we were in power – Iraq 
being the most obvious in terms of policy, but also tuition fees that were 
very, very difficult for a lot of people. We lost support.”

But he added that Tony Blair had understood that “most people are not living 
the political bubble we live in”.

After being attacked by McDonnell, Campbell went on the offensive, saying he 
cared about the Labour party and worried that “you and yours are destroying it. 
And what’s more, I actually worry you don’t even care.”

While McDonnell accused Campbell and Blair of taking Labour “to the edge”, 
adding that Corbyn was trying to restore “honesty and confidence in politics 
again”, Campbell listed the achievements of New Labour, such as the minimum 
wage and winning three elections.

“I get why newspapers like the Daily Mail want to trash Tony Blair. we won 
elections and they’re a rightwing newspaper,” he said. “I understand why the 
Tories want to trash New Labour, because we beat them three times. But when the 
Labour party’s doing it, it’s utterly ridiculous. It’s part of the 
revolutionary posh-boy madness that’s taken this party over.”

After the exchange, Campbell tweeted:

Others criticised Conservative MP Anna Soubry, who called McDonnell a “nasty 
piece of work”.

Soubry said the shadow chancellor had allowed female Labour MPs to be 
“terrorised” by supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. “There are women MPs who suffer 
day in and day out from misogynist, unpleasant, sexist abuse on Twitter, on 
Facebook, from people who are apparently within their own party,” she said.

Other viewers imagined what a discussion between Campbell and McDonnell might 
have looked like after the show, with one posting a gif of a furious Malcolm 
Tucker – the spin doctor modelled on Campbell – from the political TV satire
