Childhood dream I wanted to be a PE teacher. I was really good at sports and 
pretty bossy – the perfect combination. I even did a diploma in sports studies.

Could have been A PE teacher! I would have been happy doing that.

First job I worked in Ladbrokes but I spent most of the day daydreaming about 
my music career.

Worst boss I've only ever had two jobs – Ladbrokes and a part-time 
receptionist – and both bosses were fine.

Big break When Mis-Teeq appeared on GMTV with another band – we had to recite 
a poem and whoever did the best job of it got to perform. That was the start of 
things happening for us.

Loves Earning a living from what was a hobby for years; I feel really lucky.

Dislikes Lack of sleep. When I've slept well I can do anything, but I get only 
about five hours a night. My diary is so intense.

Mentor My mum instilled in me that it's not what you do but who you are that 
matters.

Secret of success Appreciating that we have only one life and focusing on 
making the most of it.

What next I've got a new album out and I'm doing my first UK tour in October. 
I'm also doing some TV and, most of all, enjoying each moment.
