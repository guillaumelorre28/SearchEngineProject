It is, according to its director, “the Sisyphean rock that keeps rolling 
back”. A film, more than 20 years in the making, that’s been stalled by 
vanishing funds, flash floods and disease. Yet Terry Gilliam is againpushing 
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote up the hill

.

The director’s treasured adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes’s book has seen 
years of false starts. A who’s-who of acting talent have been attached to play 
the arrogant, dreamy Don (Jean Roquefort, Robert Duvall, John Hurt) and an 
approximation of his staunch squire Sancho Panza (Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor, 
Jack O’Connell). All departed, for reasons ranging from the dull (Depp’s been 
too busy making films for Disney) to the life-changing (Hurt wasdiagnosed with 
pancreatic cancer

 last year, just as the film entered another round of pre-production). The most 
famous mis-fire, which starred Depp and Roquefort, was chronicled in the 2002 
documentary Lost in La Mancha. The tagline for the doc read “They’ve got a 
story, but have lost the plot”.

Whisper it, so fate doesn’t hear, but this time, the eighth time, it looks 
like Gilliam will finally get Quixote made. He’s at theCannes film festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/cannesfilmfestival> to tell the world that 
the production is back in the saddle. He’s got his actors (Adam Driver, Michael 
Palin, Olga Kurylenko) and he’s got a financier (Amazon Studios). He will start 
shooting in October. He hopes to bring the finished film to next year’s Cannes, 
only a decade or so late.

“Quixote is a disease,” says Gilliam, who has arrived at the five-star Carlton 
hotel in ebullient mood, dressed in sandals (no socks) and a beach shirt. “I 
want to get it out of my life so I can get on with the rest of my life. It’s 
one of those nightmares that will never leave you until you actually kill the 
thing.”

He talks the press through the new incarnation. The time-travel narrative that 
was originally proposed has gone. This Quixote will be set solely in the 21st 
century with Driver playing Toby, a TV ad director who gets mistaken for Sancho 
Panza by a mad actor (Palin, Gilliam’s fellow formerMonty Python 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/monty-python> member) who starred in 
Toby’s film about Cervantes’s knight 10 years earlier and hasn’t been able to 
shake himself of the conviction that he is the real Quixote since. The film, 
says Gilliam, is partly inspired by the madness of film-making, specifically 
his guilt over the toll that regular folk often have to pay when a film 
production ravages their town.

“It’s very much about the danger of films, what they do to people and 
communities when you go and shoot there,” he says. “It’s my exposing a lot of 
the guilt I feel for some of the things that happened during filming in 
Scotland for Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

“All of us came up from London. Local girls and local guys got wrapped up in 
the business and then, at the end of it all, you realise that marriages have 
broken up, people are pregnant, people go back to London and they’re trailed by 
love affairs that didn’t end. I thought, ‘God. We kind of fucked up a lot of 
lives there!’”

Driver – also at Cannes, with Jim Jarmusch’s new film, Paterson – is, 
according to Gilliam, “the guy I’ve been looking for all these years”. He’s 
been emailing the director about the project regularly, picking through the 
book (the only one of Gilliam’s stars who has bothered) and suggesting bits 
that could be included. Gilliam appreciates Driver’s passion. His celebrity 
doesn’t hurt either.

“Thank God for Star Wars,” says Gilliam. “Adam Driver is bankable! He can get 
us the money we need!”

He does feel for him though. Apparently, the actor is finding super-fame 
frustrating.

“He’s living in London at the moment and can’t go out,” Gilliam says. “He says 
it’s terrible. He’s very tall, so it’s like [John] Cleese – it’s very hard for 
him to hide”.

As for Palin, it will be his fifth collaboration with Gilliam. Their first was 
on Jabberwocky, Gilliam’s first crack at directing a live action film solo. 
Their last might well be Quixote.

“He’s got to get on the horse, wield a lance – all this shit,” says Gilliam. 
“And he’s 73! It may be our last big adventure together.”

The other Pythons are unlikely to make an appearance (“Mike’s the nice one, 
the others are impossible”), besides Gilliam doesn’t want Quixote to be a Monty 
Python film. It’s too close to his heart for that. He cares about it deeply. 
Perhaps that’s why he’s always believed, despite the urban myth that the 
project is cursed, that he could always make this film.

“The curse is bullshit,” he says. “It’s a good story and I like it. It’s just 
not what’s really going on. But I’m like Trump, I’ll do anything for headlines.”

“People used to say I’m Don Quixote, because I’m a fantasist and a dreamer,” 
he says. “I go up against reality, fail and do it again. But I don’t think I am 
Quixote. I think I’m Sancho Panza. Don Quixote is the film and I’m following 
it.”
