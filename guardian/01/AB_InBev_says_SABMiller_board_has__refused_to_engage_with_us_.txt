The boss of Anheuser-Busch InBev has stepped up his assault on the board of 
rival brewerSABMiller <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sabmiller> for 
refusing to discuss his company’s £65bn takeover approach for the maker of 
Grolsch and Peroni.

Carlos Brito, chief executive of Belgian-based AB InBev, issued a statement to 
the stock market 
<http://www.investegate.co.uk/anheuser-busch-inbev--92pg-/rns/response-to-sabmiller-announcement/201510081020456546B/>
 in which he called on SABMiller shareholders to voice their views to the board 
and urge engagement in talks to create a brewer that would produce a third of 
the world’s beer.

AB InBev, which owns Budweiser and Stella Artois, also offered to share 
details of its work on assuaging regulatory concerns in China and the US – a 
topic of concern for SABMiller.AB InBev 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/anheuser-busch> said it would “work 
proactively with regulators to resolve any concerns”.

Brito said: “Notwithstanding our good faith efforts, the board of SABMiller 
has refused to meaningfully engage with us. Our proposal creates significant 
value for everybody. How long will it be before shareholders see a value of 
over £42 [a share] in the absence of an offer from AB InBev?

“If shareholders agree that we should be in proper discussions, they should 
voice their views and should not allow the board of SABMiller to frustrate this 
process and let this opportunity slip away.”

AB InBev went public with its £42.15 a share cash offer for SABMiller, which 
also makes Coors, on Wednesday after being rebuffed twice behind the scenes. 
Britohad said on Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/07/ab-inbev-raises-takeover-offer-sabmiller-brewer>
 that SABMiller investors should call the chairman to force him to discuss the 
terms.

Brito is also facing the problem that SABMiller’s two major shareholders – 
Altria of the US and BevCo, owned by Colombia’s Santo Domingo family – appear 
to be split over AB InBev’s approach. Altria has publicly supported the 
proposal but BevCo has not.

AB InBev seized on the support of the former, which owns 27% of SABMiller and 
has three representatives on the board, in Thursday’s stock market 
announcement. Altria, it said, “has publicly stated that it supports our 
proposal and ‘urges SABMiller’s board to engage promptly and constructively 
with AB InBev to agree on the terms of a recommended offer’”.

A spokesperson for SABMiller said: “We’ve noted their announcement, it 
contains nothing new, there’s nothing to respond to.”

James Edwardes Jones, analyst, RBC Capital Markets, said the two companies 
were not as far apart as their comments suggested. “SABMiller’s apparent 
intransigence has to be tempered, in our view, both by its largest 
shareholder’s public support for ABI’s proposal and the fate of those 
companies’ share prices where a deal has been aborted recently,” he said, 
pointing to the falls in the share prices of pharmaceuticals company Shire and 
insurer RSA when takeover approaches for them collapsed.

Under takeover rules AB InBev has until 14 October to make a formal offer to 
shareholders or walk away for six months.
