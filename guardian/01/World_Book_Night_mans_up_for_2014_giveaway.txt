World Book Night <https://www.theguardian.com/books/world-book-night> takes on 
a masculine air in 2014, with male authors – by a ratio of three to one – 
dominating the books selected for a mass give-away aimed at reluctant readers.

Fifteen male authors appear on a list of 20 novels designed for male readers 
featuring John Boyne's holocaust novel The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas alongside 
Martin Cruz Smith's classic Cold War thriller Gorky Park.

The organisers of World Book Night, which will take place on 23 April next 
year, said the focus of the list was a response to research revealing that 46% 
of teenagers and young adults, and 42% of men, did not read for pleasure. A 
recent survey found thatmen who never read for pleasure outnumber women by more 
than two to one

.

Four of the titles are Quick Reads 
<http://www.quickreads.org.uk/what-are-quick-reads/introduction> – a series of 
story-length novels designed to appeal to reluctant readers. The list also 
features five books for young adults, two short-story collections and three 
works of non-fiction.

Among the non-fiction titles are Sathnam Sanghera's memoir of his Sikh 
childhood in Wolverhampton, The Boy with the Topknot, Richard Wiseman's 
critique of the self-help industry, 59 Seconds, and Benjamin Daniels' 
Confessions of a GP.

The scheme was set up in 2011 as an independent charity, but has been taken 
over by the Reading Agency. Last month it announced that it washalving the 
number of free books given away by official volunteers to 250,000 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/30/world-book-night-halves-giveaways-public>
, but was appealing for community volunteers to make up the numbers by giving 
away their own books. World Book Night stickers or bookplates will be available 
from libraries and participating bookshops or to download at home.

Miranda McKearney, CEO of the Reading Agency, says: "Please join us! We're 
looking for an army of volunteers to help tackle the UK's literacy problems – 
volunteers who will go out into the community on World Book Night, aiming to 
inspire the 35% of people who don't like reading to think again."
