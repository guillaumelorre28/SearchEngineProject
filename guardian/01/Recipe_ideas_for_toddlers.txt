Do you have any ideas for adventurous foods we could feed our toddler?

Rachel Vere, London

Looking back at my children's diets when they were small, I realise that I 
naturally went back to some of the foods I grew up with in Barbados. I've read 
lots of books about what to feed my children, but the main points seem to be: 
keep away from salt, excessive spicing and anything processed; and aim to get 
all the nutrients they need into a small portion.

It's much easier to feed your children food you are going to eat as well, but 
try introducing your child to new flavours one at a time. For example, you 
could start by adding some finely chopped lemongrass to a chicken stir-fry of 
onions, cabbage, carrot and chicken. Next, add some ginger to the same base. 
Then try both together, and so on.

Have you tried avocado? It's the ideal baby food: easy to mash and spread on 
toast or serve with a small piece of cooked fish and mashed potatoes. You could 
also try it pureed with peeled cucumber to make a chilled soup.

Another of my childhood staples is salt cod. Correctly handled and prepared, 
it's delicious. Soak the cod for 24 hours with frequent water changes, to 
soften the flesh and remove the salt, then steam or poach in milk. Mix some of 
the prepared fish with pureed sweet potatoes and serve with a little scrambled 
egg.

Plantains are great, too, as they have a sweetness that appeals to children. 
They are perfect on pancakes for breakfast. Just lightly brown them in a teeny 
bit of butter. Sweet potatoes are another option. Nutritionally superior to 
plain old potatoes, they can simply be roasted in their skins, before the flesh 
is scooped out and mashed.
