Nearly night time politics

election result. Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images 
Ok I need to put down the loaded weapon known as live publishing because I am 
in danger of shooting myself in the foot. So let me summarise the day that was.

 * This time yesterday, there were still people merrily attending polling 
booths, downing democracy sausages, chewing the fat over the expected Malcolm 
Margin in the great 2o16 federal election. Twenty four hours later it has all 
gone to excrement.

 * Turnbull has given a short, sharp press conference to make a few points. 1. 
I would have preferred a clearer outcome. 2. There may be no clear outcome 
until the end of next week. 3. Parliaments are the houses of the people and 
democracy is our friend. Hello independents. 4. Tony Abbott will not be coming 
back to the ministry. Dream on Delcons.

 * Shorten has given a longer, more relaxed presser. His points were were also 
clear. 1. Labor is back. 2. I have never been more confident of my leadership. 
3. Anthony Albanese is a top bloke. 4. Malcolm Turnbull should grab the 
opportunity of common ground on marriage equality and climate change.

 * Nick Xenophon, keeper of one in the lower house and up to three in the 
Senate, has a number of things to make clear. 1. I have a party of the centre 
so I will deal with both sides in the event of a hung parliament. (But I will 
be swayed by ultimate numbers.) 2. The majors did play dirty against me on 
advertising and preferences but I do not hold grudges. 3. If Christopher Pyne 
suggests Mayo under NXT would be disadvantaged, I will make a call to my new 
best friend the PM.

 * Malcolm Turnbull has rung Cathy McGowan and Andrew Wilkie, to clear the 
communications channels. This would suggest the Coalition is continuing to 
workshop the potential for a hung parliament. Lucky the parliament is the house 
of the people and lucky we really love it.

 * Except Tony Abbott, great rocker of boats in the 43rd parliament, who 
lamented the Americanisation of politics which leads to the erosion of power of 
executive government. Somewhere Julia Gillard laughed maniacally.

 * The Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce enjoyed a flat white with his wife Nat 
and their dachshund after winning his seat against challenger Tony Windsor.

 * The senate looks like a mixed bag, involving Pauline Hanson, Jacqui Lambie, 
Derryn Hinch, Xenophon and possibly three others. While the count continues, we 
can safely say the senate has not been “cleaned out” as per Malcolm Turnbull’s 
wishes.

 * In the house, at publication 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/jul/02/live-australian-election-results-track-the-votes>
, the seats were tracking LNP 65, Labor 64, Others 5 with 134 out of 150 
confirmed. 
Counting will resume on Tuesday. 


Thanks so much for your company.

Goodnight.

Katharine Murphy has written a piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/03/tale-two-speeches-frustration-boiled-over-wait-for-testy-turnbull>
 contrasting last night’s speeches.

There were many curiosities on election night in 2016, but one stood out. The 
likely loser of the contest made a victory speech, and the likely winner made 
the diminished speech of a man who had suffered a profound loss.

If you want to relive the night – and in some ways it is worth reliving if 
only with the 20-20 of hindsight –it is worth having another look at Murph’s 
blog

Shorten says he doesn't want another election, nor does the crossbench

Shorten has rung a number of the crossbenchers. He won’t say who but he says 
their mood is constructive.

They want to be constructive, they don’t want Australia rushing back to the 
polls, I certainly don’t.

Shorten to Turnbull: grab the opportunity on marriage equality and climate 
change

Bill Shorten urges Turnbull to work on the common ground rather than the 
disagreements.

If Malcolm Turnbull could go back to being the old Malcolm Turnbull and stand 
up the climate change, we could do a deal in very short time. If he could go 
back to being the old Malcolm Turnbull before he was hostage to the right wing 
of his party, we could sort out marriage equality within 100 days of this 
election. IfMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> wants to be 
constructive on infrastructure and depoliticise it, I’m sure we can get things 
done. When we look at the crossbenchers I’m sure they want to be constructive 
as well.

Then questions about his confidence in his own leadership.

Q: What is your message to Anthony Albanese given reports this morning that he 
is already campaigning for your job?

Shorten: "Last night was a historic night. The Labor party is most certainly 
back."

Bill Shorten:

The public have spoken, I’m not sure who has finally won, we should now allow 
our professional Australian Electoral Commission to do their job and count the 
votes. What I’m very sure of is that while we don’t know who the winner was, 
there is clearly one loser, Malcolm Turnbull’s agenda for Australia and his 
efforts to cut Medicare.

Positions vacant: no thanks says Xenophon

Are you prepared to accept positions in a government if it comes to a minority 
government? Or would you simply reach an agreement on confidence?

Xenophon:

Again, it’s complete hypothetical. If you’re talking about accepting a

Xenophon warns Christopher Pyne: back off or I'll ring the PM

Rebekha Sharkie is asked about her effort. She gives a shout out to Indi’s 
Cathy McGowan, who won Indi on a handful of votes and then increased her margin 
last night.

Sharkie is asked about comments from ChristopherPyne that “Mayo will suffer as 
a result of your election”. It would appear Pyne has gone the full Mirabella.

Sharkie says if “Mayo suffered because it was no longer a Liberal seat and 
that suffering was caused by a Liberal government, I think that would be really 
disappointing”.

But Xenophon goes a step further, quickly making use of his new muscles.

I just can’t help myself. I have to respond to that response. Christopher Pyne 
is a consummate politician. It’s a pity he’s still a consummate student 
politician.If he is saying that the people of Mayo will be punished for 
supporting Rebecca, then that’s something I’ll be taking up directly with the 
Prime Minister.

Xenophon: hung parliament increasingly likely

Katharine Murphy

Just while Gabi is dealing with the tail end of the prime minister, Nick 
Xenophonis speaking to reporters in Adelaide. 

I didn’t think there would be a hung parliament but that now seems to be 
increasingly likely.

He says the NXT candidate is also still in the hunt in the seat of Grey, which 
would deliver the fledgling party another lower house seat.


He’s asked who he would support in the event of a minority government. 

It’s too early to say. It depends what crossbench colleagues are doing in the 
lower house.

Xenophon says the NXT will be inclined to support the party that can deliver a 
stable government.

Xenophon says he has spoken to the prime minister, but not the Labor leader 
yet.Bill Shorten may have called, he says, but his phone has been in meltdown. 

He says he’s spoken to Derryn Hinch and Jacqui Lambie, and no doubt he will 
try and speak to cross bench colleagues in the HoR in the coming days. He 
reasons the NXT didn’t do better last night in part because Labor ran an 
intense campaign against the party on penalty rates.


He also openly considered some sort of truth in political advertising reforms, 
given parties can say what they like.

There was a very misleading, deceitful scare campaign from the ALP in relation 
to penalty rates. It was a lie. I had to put up corrective advertising, nowhere 
near to the extend of their misleading advertising. There’s a real argument for 
some truth in political advertising laws. Why should politicians be exempt from 
the sort of laws that apply to misleading and deceptive advertising that apply 
to corporations and individuals.

Xenophon makes an inference that the penalty rates campaign might have been 
funded by the gaming lobby.

I couldn’t counter act it. I didn’t have the funds. We didn’t have the funds 
to do so. But would be interesting to see where that money came from. I 
understand the gambling lobby pump add lot of money into the major parties to 
fund that sort of campaign. My understanding is at least $500,000 of 
advertising was purposed into South Australia over the last few days before the 
blackout.

One last question to Turnbull:

Have you failed to deliver stability?

The stability that will be delivered by the parliament will be assessed by all 
Australians after the parliament is elected and after the formation of a 
majority government.

election result. Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images 
Ok I need to put down the loaded weapon known as live publishing because I am 
in danger of shooting myself in the foot. So let me summarise the day that was.

 * This time yesterday, there were still people merrily attending polling 
booths, downing democracy sausages, chewing the fat over the expected Malcolm 
Margin in the great 2o16 federal election. Twenty four hours later it has all 
gone to excrement.

 * Turnbull has given a short, sharp press conference to make a few points. 1. 
I would have preferred a clearer outcome. 2. There may be no clear outcome 
until the end of next week. 3. Parliaments are the houses of the people and 
democracy is our friend. Hello independents. 4. Tony Abbott will not be coming 
back to the ministry. Dream on Delcons.

 * Shorten has given a longer, more relaxed presser. His points were were also 
clear. 1. Labor is back. 2. I have never been more confident of my leadership. 
3. Anthony Albanese is a top bloke. 4. Malcolm Turnbull should grab the 
opportunity of common ground on marriage equality and climate change.

 * Nick Xenophon, keeper of one in the lower house and up to three in the 
Senate, has a number of things to make clear. 1. I have a party of the centre 
so I will deal with both sides in the event of a hung parliament. (But I will 
be swayed by ultimate numbers.) 2. The majors did play dirty against me on 
advertising and preferences but I do not hold grudges. 3. If Christopher Pyne 
suggests Mayo under NXT would be disadvantaged, I will make a call to my new 
best friend the PM.

 * Malcolm Turnbull has rung Cathy McGowan and Andrew Wilkie, to clear the 
communications channels. This would suggest the Coalition is continuing to 
workshop the potential for a hung parliament. Lucky the parliament is the house 
of the people and lucky we really love it.

 * Except Tony Abbott, great rocker of boats in the 43rd parliament, who 
lamented the Americanisation of politics which leads to the erosion of power of 
executive government. Somewhere Julia Gillard laughed maniacally.

 * The Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce enjoyed a flat white with his wife Nat 
and their dachshund after winning his seat against challenger Tony Windsor.

 * The senate looks like a mixed bag, involving Pauline Hanson, Jacqui Lambie, 
Derryn Hinch, Xenophon and possibly three others. While the count continues, we 
can safely say the senate has not been “cleaned out” as per Malcolm Turnbull’s 
wishes.

 * In the house, at publication 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/jul/02/live-australian-election-results-track-the-votes>
, the seats were tracking LNP 65, Labor 64, Others 5 with 134 out of 150 
confirmed. 
Counting will resume on Tuesday. 


Thanks so much for your company.

Goodnight.

In case you missed Turnbull's speech last night, here's a brief recap #ausvotes

Katharine Murphy has written a piece 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/03/tale-two-speeches-frustration-boiled-over-wait-for-testy-turnbull>
 contrasting last night’s speeches.

There were many curiosities on election night in 2016, but one stood out. The 
likely loser of the contest made a victory speech, and the likely winner made 
the diminished speech of a man who had suffered a profound loss.

If you want to relive the night – and in some ways it is worth reliving if 
only with the 20-20 of hindsight –it is worth having another look at Murph’s 
blog

.
 
Shorten has rung a number of the crossbenchers. He won’t say who but he says 
their mood is constructive.

They want to be constructive, they don’t want Australia rushing back to the 
polls, I certainly don’t.
 
Bill Shorten urges Turnbull to work on the common ground rather than the 
disagreements.

If Malcolm Turnbull could go back to being the old Malcolm Turnbull and stand 
up the climate change, we could do a deal in very short time. If he could go 
back to being the old Malcolm Turnbull before he was hostage to the right wing 
of his party, we could sort out marriage equality within 100 days of this 
election. IfMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> wants to be 
constructive on infrastructure and depoliticise it, I’m sure we can get things 
done. When we look at the crossbenchers I’m sure they want to be constructive 
as well.
 
Shorten is asked the chances of forming a government. Shorten does not answer. 
Then questions about his confidence in his own leadership.

Q: What is your message to Anthony Albanese given reports this morning that he 
is already campaigning for your job?

I have never been more certain of my leadership than I am this morning.
 
Bill Shorten:

The public have spoken, I’m not sure who has finally won, we should now allow 
our professional Australian Electoral Commission to do their job and count the 
votes. What I’m very sure of is that while we don’t know who the winner was, 
there is clearly one loser, Malcolm Turnbull’s agenda for Australia and his 
efforts to cut Medicare.
 
Are you prepared to accept positions in a government if it comes to a minority 
government? Or would you simply reach an agreement on confidence?

Xenophon:

Again, it’s complete hypothetical. If you’re talking about accepting a 
ministry, I can talk from my point of view, absolutely not.
 
 Shorten coming up Shortly. 
 
Rebekha Sharkie is asked about her effort. She gives a shout out to Indi’s 
Cathy McGowan, who won Indi on a handful of votes and then increased her margin 
last night.

Sharkie is asked about comments from ChristopherPyne that “Mayo will suffer as 
a result of your election”. It would appear Pyne has gone the full Mirabella.

Sharkie says if “Mayo suffered because it was no longer a Liberal seat and 
that suffering was caused by a Liberal government, I think that would be really 
disappointing”.

But Xenophon goes a step further, quickly making use of his new muscles.

I just can’t help myself. I have to respond to that response. Christopher Pyne 
is a consummate politician. It’s a pity he’s still a consummate student 
politician.If he is saying that the people of Mayo will be punished for 
supporting Rebecca, then that’s something I’ll be taking up directly with the 
Prime Minister.
 
Just while Gabi is dealing with the tail end of the prime minister, Nick 
Xenophonis speaking to reporters in Adelaide. 

I didn’t think there would be a hung parliament but that now seems to be 
increasingly likely.

He says the NXT candidate is also still in the hunt in the seat of Grey, which 
would deliver the fledgling party another lower house seat.


He’s asked who he would support in the event of a minority government. 

It’s too early to say. It depends what crossbench colleagues are doing in the 
lower house.

Xenophon says the NXT will be inclined to support the party that can deliver a 
stable government.

Xenophon says he has spoken to the prime minister, but not the Labor leader 
yet.Bill Shorten may have called, he says, but his phone has been in meltdown. 

He says he’s spoken to Derryn Hinch and Jacqui Lambie, and no doubt he will 
try and speak to cross bench colleagues in the HoR in the coming days. He 
reasons the NXT didn’t do better last night in part because Labor ran an 
intense campaign against the party on penalty rates.


He also openly considered some sort of truth in political advertising reforms, 
given parties can say what they like.

There was a very misleading, deceitful scare campaign from the ALP in relation 
to penalty rates. It was a lie. I had to put up corrective advertising, nowhere 
near to the extend of their misleading advertising. There’s a real argument for 
some truth in political advertising laws. Why should politicians be exempt from 
the sort of laws that apply to misleading and deceptive advertising that apply 
to corporations and individuals.

Xenophon makes an inference that the penalty rates campaign might have been 
funded by the gaming lobby.

I couldn’t counter act it. I didn’t have the funds. We didn’t have the funds 
to do so. But would be interesting to see where that money came from. I 
understand the gambling lobby pump add lot of money into the major parties to 
fund that sort of campaign. My understanding is at least $500,000 of 
advertising was purposed into South Australia over the last few days before the 
blackout.
 
One last question to Turnbull:

Have you failed to deliver stability?

The stability that will be delivered by the parliament will be assessed by all 
Australians after the parliament is elected and after the formation of a 
majority government.
