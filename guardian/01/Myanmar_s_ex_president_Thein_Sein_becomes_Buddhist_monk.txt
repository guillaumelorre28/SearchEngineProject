Myanmar’s former president Thein Sein 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/thein-sein> has shed his formal attire – and 
his hair – to become a Buddhist monk.

Thein Sein’s ordination took place on Monday, officials said, four days after 
he presided over a historic transition of power to the former opposition party 
headed byAung San Suu Kyi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi>.

Myanmar’s ministry of information released a statement on its Facebook page on 
Monday saying that Thein Sein will spend five days at the Dhamma Dipati 
monastery outside Pyin Oo Lwin, a scenic hill town near Mandalay in the centre 
of the country.

A temporary stint at a monastery is common in the predominantly Buddhist 
country, where boys are expected to ordain as novice monks at some point in 
their childhood and then return later in adulthood.

Thein Sein has not spoken publicly about temporarily becoming a monk but the 
official statement indicated he has been considering it since at least January 
when he attended a Buddhist conference inMyanmar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar>.

“Recently, the country’s most respected monk, Sitagu, urged ex-president Thein 
Sein to enter into the Buddhist monkhood when he attended the World Buddhist 
Conference,” the statement from the ministry of information said.

“Thein Sein told Sitagu that he was busy with the duties of a president and 
promised that he would be ordained as soon as he finished his term as 
president.”

The former general was installed as president for a five-year term in 2011 to 
head a nominally civilian government after the military ended a half century of 
rule.

In November, the country held its first free election in decades which Aung 
San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won by a landslide

Thein Sein presided over the transfer of power to the new president, Htin Kyaw,
