Any parent nowadays doesn't seem to have much patience. You have to persist, 
sit with your children and give them encouragement and don't overfill their 
plates. There is no point in giving in to them when they say they don't like 
something — science tells us it takes 17 mouth experiences to get used to a new 
food . Often children will say they don't like something, but if you keep 
giving it to them they will end up not necessarily liking it but definitely 
eating it. The key is trust — if you eat the food with them they are more 
likely to eat it .

One of the recipes my children love is chicken with coconut mash. Make a 
coriander paste, blending an inch of grated ginger root, two cloves of garlic, 
two tsps sweet chilli sauce, one tsp hot chilli sauce, three tbsp coriander 
leaves, one tbsp mint leaves, two tsp sesame oil and one tbsp sunflower oil. 
Slide the paste under the skin of a couple of chicken breasts and leave them to 
marinate for 10 minutes or more if you can manage it. Then heat some sunflower 
oil in a frying pan and cook the chicken, skin side down, for about 10 minutes, 
before giving it 5 minutes on the other side. While it's cooking, mix your mash 
(about 600-700g) with 150ml of coconut cream, 2 hot red chillies, finely 
chopped, 1 tbsp Thai green curry paste, 2 tsp fish sauce (nam pla), 2 tsp clear 
honey and some salt and ground black pepper, in a non-stick pan and heat 
through. Then fold in some baby spinach until it wilts . Serve up with the 
chicken.

By the way, you can make this with chicken thighs too. Just as good.
