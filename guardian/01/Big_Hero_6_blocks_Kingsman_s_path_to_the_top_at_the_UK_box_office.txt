The battling duo

No change at the top of the UK chart, as Big Hero 6 and Kingsman: The Secret 
Service <https://www.theguardian.com/film/kingsman-the-secret-service> hold on 
to the top two spots. Once again, Disney’s animation won the honours for the 
weekend, as can be seen in the top 10 below, although the bigger picture is 
more complicated.

With its family skew, Big Hero 6 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/big-hero-6> 
takes the bulk of its business on Saturday and Sunday, and the official 
box-office chart happens to measure takings on those two days, plus Friday. 
Whereas Kingsman, with an adult skew, is earning money every evening of the 
week.

 Kingsman: The Secret Service – video review 
Despite losing on both the first and second weekend to Big Hero 6, the 
cumulative total for Kingsman stands at £8.25m, against £7.48m for the Disney 
title. Both those numbers include previews. Strip out the previews, and 
Kingsman earned £7.57m, while Big Hero 6 took £7m. The margin should increase 
as the week progresses.

However, the February half-term holiday begins on Friday, which is when Big 
Hero 6 will really start surging. We can expect it to spank Kingsman every day 
next week. In fact, schools have already broken up in Scotland, so this will be 
boosting Big Hero 6 north of the border this week.

 Shaun the Sheep Movie - video review 
The family competition


Disney doesn’t have the family audience all to itself this half-term, with 
Aardman’s Shaun the Sheep the Movie also in the mix. The animated adventure 
opened in third place, with a decent £2.10m. That’s well down on the debut of 
2005’sWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were Rabbit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/oct/14/1> (£9.37m, including £2.92m 
in previews), which was similarly based on a popular Aardman TV brand. Aardman’s
The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/29/the-pirates-adventure-scientists-review>
 kicked off in March 2012 with £2.18m, including £278,000 in previews. Shaun 
has opened at a very similar level. Like Big Hero 6, Shaun should benefit from 
strong sales during the school holiday.

 Jupiter Ascending - video review 
The blockbuster?


Originally set for release last July, and with a budget reportedly north of 
$170m, the Wachowskis’ space adventure Jupiter Ascending certainly qualifies as 
a Hollywood blockbuster in scale and conception. Going by its box-office, 
however, the blockbuster designation seems misapplied. It earned a 
less-than-sensational £1.35m from 428 cinemas. That’s by no means in the same 
category of painful Wachowski flopSpeed Racer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/may/09/actionandadventure.family> 
(debut of £362,000), but it’s probably a lot less than backers Warners hoped 
when the studio approved the film’s script, cast and budget. The number 
shouldn’t hurtChanning Tatum <https://www.theguardian.com/film/channing-tatum> 
too much, as he is a proven box-office star, but it probably won’t do much to 
strengthen the negotiating hand ofMila Kunis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mila-kunis>’s agent. Previous hits for the 
actress – Black Swan, Ted, Oz the Great and Powerful – have featured her in 
supporting roles.

 Selma - video review 
The upscale alternative


At independent cinemas, the top-grossing film is new arrival Selma, with 
£792,000 including £70,000 in previews. Among the eight films nominated for the 
best pictureOscar <https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars>, that number is 
behind the debuts ofThe Grand Budapest Hotel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-grand-budapest-hotel>, The Theory of 
Everything,The Imitation Game 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-imitation-game>, American Sniper and 
Birdman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/birdman> (all over £1m), and ahead of 
onlyWhiplash <https://www.theguardian.com/film/whiplash> (£573,000, including 
£38,000 previews) andBoyhood <https://www.theguardian.com/film/boyhood> 
(£333,000 – but from only 89 cinemas). Selma’s screen average is an OK £2,232, 
or £2,035 if the previews are removed. The film’s top sites are a mix of 
independent cinemas (best of all is Ritzy in London’s Brixton) and upscale 
multiplex venues.

Comparisons with previous titles are very hard to make, but for the record, 12 
Years a Slave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/09/12-years-a-slave-review> debuted 
with £2.51m including £41,000 in previews, and before thatThe Butler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/14/the-butler-review> kicked off 
with £794,000 from 284 cinemas. A richer haul of nominations for Selma, which 
would then have been trumpeted on marketing, might have aided its cause. The 
film was completely ignored byBafta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/08/baftas-2015-list-of-winners-as-it-happens>
, for example.

 The Interview - video review 
The straggler


Propping up the bottom of the top 10 is The Interview, starring Seth Rogen and 
James Franco. The comedy earned a weak £284,000 from 287 venues, yielding a 
£989 average. Had backers Sony been able to release the film late last year, 
when curiosity was at its highest, due to the widely reported hack of the 
studio’s email server, it would surely have done better. The digital release of 
The Interview in North America last Christmas saw it appear rapidly on pirate 
sites, which must have eroded the UK box office, given the time lag. A 
worldwide simultaneous digital release would have given UK film fans easy legal 
alternatives to pirate sites. (Tech-savvy UK consumers with US iTunes accounts 
did have a legal method to see it.)This Is the End 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/27/this-is-the-end-review>, 
similarly featuring the two actors and directed by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, 
began in June 2013 with £1.39m.

 Trash – video review 

The big faller



When Trash <https://www.theguardian.com/film/trash> landed the previous 
weekend with £79,000 from 158 screens, it was evident that the film was 
struggling to establish a foothold in the market. However, even with that 
faltering start, the second weekend performance must rank as disappointing. 
Trash fell to 41st place, dropping a cruel 90% from the opening session, with 
takings this time of just £8,100 from 39 cinemas. The 10-day total is £150,000. 
With a respectable 6.9/10 IMDb user rating and a 63/100 MetaCritic score, there 
is almost certainly an audience for this film. The challenge now for 
distributor Universal is persuading some cinemas to hold Trash, allowing that 
audience to find it.

Although by no means in the same league, Inherent Vice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/inherent-vice> is also struggling to retain 
audience share, falling 61% from its opening frame. That’s the kind of drop you 
might reasonably expect to see for a youthful-skewing genre flick rather than a
Paul Thomas Anderson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/28/paul-thomas-anderson-intereview-inherent-vice-mark-kermode>
 film based on upscale source material (the Thomas Pynchon book). Cinemas have 
reported some customer walkouts for a film a few wags have dubbed Incoherent 
Vice. On the other hand, the IMDb user rating remains a supportive 7.1/10.

 Fifty Shades of Grey: ‘Do you stock cable ties?’ – video clip 
The future


Overall, the market is currently the very definition of average, ranking 27th 
out of 52 for the past year. It’s 4% down on the equivalent session from 
February 2014; and it’s 6% down on average weekend takings for the past year. 
Now, however, multiplex bookers are panting with excitement at the arrival on 
13 February ofFifty Shades of Grey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey>. Chains are reporting 
sizzling advance bookings, with the release date nicely timed for Valentine’s 
weekend. All the other major studios are running scared, with nothing much of 
commercial potential going up against the BDSM juggernaut. In limited play, the 
well-regardedLove Is Strange <https://www.theguardian.com/film/love-is-strange>
, expanding from its current London West End platform, has the best shot of 
making a mark. Quick-burst rereleases includeGrease Singalong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/07/valentines-day-film-events> on 
Saturday (in Cineworld cinemas) andCasablanca 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/casablanca> (in Odeons) on Sunday.
