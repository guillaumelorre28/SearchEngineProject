Li Na is confident she will take winning the Australian Open title 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/25/li-na-wins-australian-open-final-dominika-cibulkova>
 in her stride. The 31-year-old added a second grand slam title to the French 
Open crown she won in 2011 with victory over Dominika Cibulkova at Melbourne 
Park.

Li's French Open triumph turned her into a megastar and she struggled to deal 
with the pressure. She won only six more matches during the rest of 2011 and it 
was not until she linked up with Justine Henin's former coach Carlos Rodr√≠guez 
in the summer of 2012 that she became a grand slam contender once again.

"When I won the French Open I really didn't prepare for that," Li said. "I 
didn't know what I should do after the win. Also nobody told me what I should 
do. I think now it's different because I prepared to win the grand slam. Also 
Carlos, he has a lot of experience because before he was coaching Justine 
Henin. We will talk about what we should do. This time I was thinking about if 
I win or if I lose, what kind of life I will have."

Winning in Australia was the title Li really wanted after losing in the final 
in 2011 and 2013.

The victory will move her to within 11 points of Victoria Azarenka when the 
new rankings are released on Monday, but she knows building on her latest 
success will take a lot of hard work.

She said: "When last year I said I wanted to be top three, nobody believed me. 
At the beginning of this year I said I wanted to win another grand slam title. 
Nobody believed me.

"The most important thing is I believed, Carlos believed, my team believed.

"Of course it's very easy to say I want to win another one. But I think if you 
are a tennis athlete, you have to know how much work has to be done only to win 
one grand slam.

"If I want to win another one or two, I have to go back on court and work 
hard, even more tough than before, otherwise I'll have no chance."
