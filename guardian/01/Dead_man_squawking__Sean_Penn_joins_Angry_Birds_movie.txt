follows the start of the war between birds and pigs. It is scheduled for 
release in the UK on 13 May and in the US on 20 May.

Penn appeared most recently in the action thriller The Gunman, which received 
mostly negative reviews (the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw called it“flabby” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/19/the-gunman-sean-penn-film-review>
) and did poorly at the box office. His next film as a director, the South 
Africa-set drama The Last Face starring Charlize Theron, is tipped to premiere 
at this year’s Cannes film festival. He is also set to play US president Andrew 
Jackson in the forthcoming TV mini-series American Lions.

Penn is also still embroiled in the El Chapo controversy after his interview 
with the drugs baron for Rolling Stone caused ire. He is reportedly not 
involved ina planned biopic
