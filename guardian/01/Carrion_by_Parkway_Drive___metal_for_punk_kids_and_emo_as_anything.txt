The Den was a big shed with a concrete floor and an enormous PA system. It was 
where I saw my first hardcore gig on 7 October 2006. I was 18 and a contender 
for gangliest nerd in Sydney.

On the wall behind the bands, someone had hung a huge banner: “YOU ARE THE 
FUTURE.” I Killed The Prom Queen headlined. They sucked (see for yourself here 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx0glwTYqgQ>), but I thought it was the coolest 
thing I had ever seen. “You are the future.” I was there with the gronky 
black-haired kids with sleeveless band shirts and huge munters in Hurley gear 
and, fuck me, I believed it. Some parents stood up the back, covering their 
faces.

The year before, Parkway Drive had released their first album, Killing With A 
Smile <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQvijGmsNIc>. It went into my CD player 
as soon as I bought it and rarely came out. Parkway were like nothing else in 
the still-nascent Aussie metalcore scene: five surfers from Byron Bay who 
didn’t bother with complex guitar noodling, metal attitude, costumes (unless 
you count thongs and boardies) or grandiose solos.

There were no emo “clean” vox either – just huge guitars, Winston McCall’s 
guttural screaming, mammoth breakdowns, stage-dives and circle pits, guys and 
girls jumping and pushing and screaming.

Parkway is metal for punk kids, straight out of Australia’s hardcore punk 
mecca: Byron Bay High School. Its members were never that into metal, but came 
up at the same time as US metalcore giants Killswitch Engage and As I Lay 
Dying. They were influenced by bands like Unearth and In Flames, bands with 
whom they now share top billing.

At Sydney University’s Manning Bar in December 2006, we screamed our guts out 
when Winston stuck his mic into the crowd and we cheered when they played Gimme 
AD. Guys jumped from the speakers and the stage into the kids below, Michael 
Crafter walked out on everyone’s shoulders.

All the songs sounded the same and I just wanted to jump around.

Then in 2007, Parkway released Horizons. It was, in the language of metal 
reviewing 
<https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&rlz=1C5CHFA_enAU586AU586&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=parkway+drive+melodic+brutal>
, both more melodic and more brutal than ever. The shows got bigger. I went to 
Canberra for uni, dyed my hair black, grew a fringe and started wearing 
T-shirts with coffins on them. My mates and I kept going to the gigs, screaming 
“Carrion!” at the top of our lungs. The lyrics were emo as anything, but who 
cared?

In a moment I’m lost
Dying from the inside
Her eyes take me away
Tear me apart from the inside out.

This was shit to shout until your voice went, while giving boosts to 
crowdsurfers wearing Alexisonfire shirts, Acacia Strain shirts, Trivium shirts, 
Bury Your Dead shirts. With Carrion, Parkway had a true crowd-pleaser and had 
arrived. “CARRION!!!” and then a huge breath for the call back: “Dying from the 
inside.” That doesn’t even make sense, really, but when you think about it, 
neither did straightening your hair in the bathrooms between sets.

At one show, in the now-defunct Jamison Inn in Canberra, everyone screamed 
“CARRION!!!” while a guy jumped off the PA on a boogie board. By the end of the 
night we were all crammed onto the tiny pub stage, ears bursting from the kicks 
and getting those pointy ESP guitar necks in the ribs.

I loved the solidarity of it all, even if I was too awkward to talk to anyone 
except my friends. We’d come streaming out of the pit to knock back Bundy and 
Cokes between sets because we were 18 and we could; we’d shout: “So cry me a 
fucking river” with massive smiles on our faces before the breakdown inRomance 
is Dead <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DScZ42PPIyo>; and we’d always head home 
alone because we were terrified of the scene girls with pink hair and 
heart-padlock tattoos on their collarbones.

At Soundwave in 2007, the rain belted down and we moshed to Carrion so hard 
that steam poured off the pit. The singer from the Bronx did his set 
crowdsurfing with a sombrero and a tin of VB. We never had problems at those 
shows like you do at the likes of Big Day Out. There were no idiots on pingers 
or festival creeps.

“CARRION!!!” We were screaming it at No Sleep Til Sydney, when I went with a 
mate who had just returned from Afghanistan on a tour; “CARRION!!!” at Woden 
basketball court; or at the UNSW Roundhouse, or in the car driving to the 
library to study, or in my first-year uni room screaming “CARRION!!!” while I 
was putting the iron over my fringe before tutes.

Parkway put out two more albums and even got a song in the Triple J hottest 
100 in 2011 (at 97!). But Carrion is still the one they close with. Around the 
world thousands of teenagers are screaming “CARRION!!!” – inSofia 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0BLNkohhb8>, in Sao Paolo 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6FWzBuWE4c>, in Indianapolis 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP49fmftEEo>, in Bucharest, Bogota 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfxH3jAiU8g> and Minsk. In Tokyo, Barcelona 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7eaMi3dnMA>, Athens

I haven’t been to a Parkway gig in ages. I shaved off my black hair because 
the regrowth made me look like I was going bald. Then I started going bald for 
real. A laundry mishap destroyed most of my good band shirts. But every now and 
again I still like to put on Horizons and head back to 2007, when we were all 
shouting “CARRION!!!”
