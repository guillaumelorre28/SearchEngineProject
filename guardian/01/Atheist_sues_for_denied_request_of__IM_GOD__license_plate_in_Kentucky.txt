An atheist’s request for a personalized license plate saying “IM GOD” was 
denied by the state ofKentucky <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kentucky>, 
which said it might distract other drivers, and would be in bad taste.

Bennie Hart says that by announcing “IM GOD” on his license plate, he simply 
wants to show the impossibility of disproving anyone’s claim to being “God”.

Besides, Hart says, he had the same plate for a dozen years when he lived in 
Ohio, without causing any problems.

Hart sued the state transportation secretary, Greg Thomas, on Tuesday on free 
speech grounds, asking a federal judge in Frankfort to strike down some 
Kentucky laws and rules for personalized plates.

Transportation spokesman Ryan Watts says the agency does not comment on 
pending litigation.
