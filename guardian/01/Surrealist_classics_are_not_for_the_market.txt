I was concerned to read Maev Kennedy (We need a lobster phone, but two?

, 17 October) on the upcoming sale of surrealist art works by West Dean 
college. As an MA curating student from Sussex University, I worked at West 
Dean this spring when the prospect of a permanent gallery space was being 
discussed. I never imagined the trustees would consider funding it by selling 
off the art that would go in it.

During the 1930s, Edward James, whose foundation set up West Dean in 1971, 
collaborated closely with three surrealist artists: Salvador Dali,René Magritte 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/magritte> and Pavel Tchelitchew. 
Almost all of his collection of Dalis and Magrittes was auctioned by West Dean 
in the 70s and 80s, so the Tchelitchews have particular significance. For a 
“large group of paintings” by Tchelitchew to be included in the auction is 
deeply worrying.

Tchelitchew is now revered in his native Russia, where his works command high 
prices at auction. There is clearly a temptation to cash in. James’s collection 
includes many of Tchelitchew’s finest works from his English period (1928-1939) 
and is of unique international importance.

As the value of Tchelitchew’s work continues to rise, its power to attract 
visitors to West Dean offers far more long-term cultural and financial value 
than its premature sale would realise.
