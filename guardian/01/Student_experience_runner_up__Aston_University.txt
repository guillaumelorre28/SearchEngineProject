A voluntary scheme for all Aston's home and EU first years to take advantage 
of free language tuition was introduced in 2012. Its success - nearly 800 
students have so far enrolled to learn one of the six languages currently on 
offer - means that the opportunity may soon be extended to postgraduates as 
well.

Aston University <http://www1.aston.ac.uk/> is the first UK university to 
offer its freshers the chance to learn a language from scratch - or build on 
their existing level of fluency - as an enhancement to their curriculum 
studies, under the new student fee system.

Languages for All <http://www1.aston.ac.uk/languagesforall/>, explains 
programme director Dr Emmanuelle Labeau, hopes to address the widespread 
complacency in the UK regarding linguistic competence. The project aims to help 
the university's students develop not only the ability to operate in another 
language, but also, she says, a wider intercultural sensitivity that will stand 
them in good stead for their future lives and careers.

By contrast with students from other countries, applying for an industrial 
placement overseas is not currently a choice embraced with much enthusiasm by 
many British undergraduates. With greater ability and confidence in another 
language, Aston hope that more of its students will build the confidence needed 
to consider placements in non-English language speaking environments, and boost 
their employment prospects and career trajectories as a result.
