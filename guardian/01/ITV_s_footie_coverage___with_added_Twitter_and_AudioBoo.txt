More on the formalisation of the web as a backchannel for TV - this time from 
ITV's footie coverage. 

ITV.com <http://www.itv.com/sport/football/> will be running a Twitterfall app 
during theFA Cup final between Everton and Chelsea from 1pm tomorrow (with 
moderation of the tweets that appear, I should add) as well as a widget made by
thruSITES <http://www.web-developers.net/> which will show which players are 
attracting the most discussion.
 ITV.com will be representing the online chatter around the FA Cup final 
 Thirdly, hype-tastic iPhone audio tool AudioBoo 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/audioboo> will be integrated, so any 
relevant commentary from fans can be submitted to the ITV site. ITV has already 
run experiments with Twitter, notably duringPrimeval where writer James Moran 
posted during an episode.

Tapping the conversation during a major football match is a canny move 
commercially if only in terms of bring traffic to the site, though what kind of 
appetite fans have for these tools during the match (when they may well be in 
the pub) remains to be seen. Remember - don't drink and tweet.

Perhaps more interestingly, ITV is using one of AudioBoo's first paid-for 
features <http://blog.audioboo.fm/2009/05/27/magic-tags-audioboo-pro/>. Though 
the initial AudioBoo tool is free, the 'magic tags' allow premium, paying users 
to tag up all the relevant AudioBoo posts they want to create a bespoke RSS 
feed. That's how ITV is selecting FA Cup-related AudioBoos.
