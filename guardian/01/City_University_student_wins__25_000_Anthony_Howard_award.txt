Ashley Cowburn, a 23-year-old journalism student, has been named as the 2014 
winner of theAnthony Howard <https://www.theguardian.com/media/anthony-howard> 
award for young journalists.

He wins Â£25,000 and successive fellowships at The Times, The Observer and the 
New Statesman <https://www.theguardian.com/media/new-statesman>.

Entrants were required to submit detailed proposals for a 5,000-word essay on 
a political theme. Cowburn, who is studying for an MA in journalism at City 
University London, chose to examine how an increase in working-class people in 
the upper echelons of mainstream parties could revitalise voter turnout and 
reverse diminishing enthusiasm for British politics.

Registering his delight at winning the award, Cowburn said: "It's an exciting 
time for politics: in September, Scotland will decide whether to stay in the 
Union and in May next year Britain will vote in one of the most bitterly 
contested elections for decades."

The prize was determined by Robert Harris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/robert-harris>, Peter Hennessy, Sir Jeremy 
Isaacs, Jeremy Paxman and Claire Tomalin.

The award is sponsored by Haymarket Media Group and was established in memory 
of writer, editor and broadcaster Anthony Howard, who was recognised as one of 
the most acute political commentators of his generation.

Howard was also an acute judge of new talent. With this in mind, Lord 
Heseltine - founder of the Haymarket group - set up the award to honour the 
memory of his lifelong friend.

Full disclosure: I teach at City University.
