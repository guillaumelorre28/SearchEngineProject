Allison says in her introduction to the recipe, "Sunday Happiness after 
prayers at the mosque is to come home to penslawer, the Cape Malay answer to 
British tripe and onions. If you like tripe, which some of us do, this is a 
magnificent piece of culinary engineering, not to be missed even if it means 
hunting around for the tripe."

Serves 4-6.

1.5kg dressed tripe, washed very well
2 teaspoons sea salt
2 tablespoons sunflower oil
2 large onions, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 
2½ cm piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 tablespoon mild korma curry powder
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons garam masala
4 tablespoons tomato purée
4 tablespoons tamarind
1 bay leaf

Put the washed tripe in a large saucepan. Cover with cold water and add the 
salt. Place over a medium-high heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to 
low and simmer for 45 minutes. Drain well, reserving 4 tablespoons of the 
cooking liquid. Slice the tripe into wide strips and set aside.

Put the oil, onion, garlic and ginger in a saucepan large enough to eventually 
take the tripe. Place over a medium heat and fry until lightly golden, stirring 
occasionally. Reduce the heat to low. Add the spices, tomato purée, tamarind 
and bay leaf and simmer for 7 minutes.

Stir in the reserved cooking water and add the sliced tripe. Simmer for 15 
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt to taste. Serve very hot with plain 
rice.
