Cheers and jeers have greeted the start of the trial of 15 people over an 
attack on two AirFrance <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> executives, 
who had their shirts ripped by workers angry at planned job cuts.

The trial over the October 2015 incident 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/05/air-france-workers-storm-meeting-protest-executives-job-losses-paris>
, which made headlines worldwide, opened in a packed courtroom outside Paris 
amid raucous scenes by backers of the defendants, five of whom are charged with 
“organised violence”.

The five face up to three years in prison and a €45,000 (£39,000) fine if 
convicted in the two-day trial.


Another 10 face lesser charges over the confrontation, which arose from a 
dispute over plans to cut 2,900 jobs under a restructuring plan that the 
airline has since scrapped.

The court viewed a clip from footage of the incident in which a worker can be 
distinctly heard threatening the human resources boss, Xavier Broseta: “You’ve 
got millions, you’re going to pay.”

Union activists at the trial cheered as the defence lawyer, Lilia Mhissen, 
took on six opposing lawyers representing the aviation giant.

Banging his gavel, the judge warned the defendants’ backers: “No 
demonstrations, no protests or I will have the court cleared. This is not a 
show!” But he was equally stern with the lawyers, ordering them “not to bicker”.

The court deliberated over whether the union activists had the right to break 
down the gate of the perimeter fence at the company headquarters near Charles 
de Gaulle airport in Paris. The defence argued that the gate was normally open, 
and that padlocking it on the day of the incident was a “provocation”.

Striking Air France employees rip shirts off managers’ backs

After crashing through the fence, dozens of workers broke into the conference 
room where management was unveiling the restructuring plan to the company’s 
works committee.

As well as Broseta, another executive, Pierre Plissonnier, had his shirt and 
jacket torn in the incident. Guards employed by the company were also injured 
in the melee.

The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, said the men, whom he labelled 
“rogues”, should be given stiff sentences.

Air France’s lawyer, Dominique Mondoloni, said on Monday that the defence 
would seek to “transform the perpetrators [of the violence] into victims and 
the victims into perpetrators”.

Mhissen, the defendants’ lawyer, said she hoped her clients would “not be 
judged on the basis of video clips that last a fraction of a second” but on the 
bigger picture.


At least two of them “clearly acted to protect Mr Broseta and Mr Plissonnier”, 
she said. “If they had retrieved all of the video images … the story would have 
been different.”

Some Air France workers observed a strike on Tuesday in solidarity with the 
defendants. The company said it did not affect operations.

About 300 union members rallied outside the courtroom, with one, Mahchid 
Modjaverian, saying the trial amounted to “the criminalisation of union action”.

“They can’t take the right to protest from us,” she said. “It is engraved in 
the marble of the constitution.”

Air France-KLM returned to profit last year after seven years of losses, but 
faces stiff competition from Asian and Gulf airlines as well as new, low-cost 
long-haul alternatives.

Air France, which employs about 55,000 people, still faces tensions with 
pilots and flight crews, which staged strikes in July.

The airline also faces a downturn in bookings, notably by Japanese, Chinese 
and American customers, because of the terror attacks that have hit France over 
the past 21 months.
