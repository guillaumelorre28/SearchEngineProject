Job: editor, the Independent
Age: 30

New entry

The editor of the Independent was once a regular on this list, back in the 
days when the paper was still overseen by Simon Kelner.

The title is not the force it once was, but the Indy editor is back in the 
MediaGuardian 100 after the job was handed toAmol Rajan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/amol-rajan>, the first non-white journalist 
to edit a mainstream UK national newspaper for more than a century.

Rajan, who is of Indian origin, succeeded Chris Blackhurst, who moved up to a 
management role earlier this year.

The reshuffle saw Rajan's Cambridge University contemporary (and his 
predecessor as Varsity editor) Oly Duff named editor of the Independent's 
cut-price offshoot, i.

It has been a rapid rise for Rajan, a foodie and devoted cricket fan who 
briefly worked for the London Evening Standard before joining the team on 
Channel 5's The Wright Stuff.

A landmark appointment then, but in a Fleet Street – and a MediaGuardian 100 – 
which remains largely white, he cannot achieve critical mass on his own.
