The leader of the Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> 
jihadist group has purportedly ordered all Muslims to obey him in a video, 
released on Saturday.

The elusive Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi>, who on 29 June 
proclaimed a "caliphate" straddling Syria and Iraq, made his appeal in a sermon 
delivered on Friday, in the militant-held northern Iraqi city of Mosul.

"I am the wali [leader] who presides over you, though I am not the best of 
you, so if you see that I am right, assist me," he said, wearing a black turban 
and robe.

"If you see that I am wrong, advise me and put me on the right track, and obey 
me as long as I obey God in you."

The video was released on a website known to be used by the group, but it was 
not possible to independently verify whether the person shown was indeed 
Baghdadi. There were previously only two known photographs of him.

Aymenn al-Tamimi, an expert on Islamist movements, said that the video was the 
first official appearance by Baghdadi, although the jihadist leader may have 
appeared in a 2008 video under a different name.

"God gave your mujahideen brothers victory after long years of jihad and 
patience â€¦ so they declared the caliphate and placed the caliph in charge. This 
is a duty on Muslims that has been lost for centuries."
