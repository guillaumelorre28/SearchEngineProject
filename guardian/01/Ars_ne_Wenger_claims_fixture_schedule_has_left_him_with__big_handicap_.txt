Arsène Wenger <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsene-wenger> has 
strongly criticised the scheduling of Premier League matches during the 
Christmas and new year period, describing it as “the most uneven” he has 
encountered during his 20 years working in this country and claimed it has left 
Arsenal “with a big handicap” in regards to their title aspirations.

The Frenchman’s ire has been raised by his team having to travel to 
Bournemouth on Tuesday, afterfacing Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium on 
Sunday

. “Honestly I don’t really know if the Premier League masters the fixtures,” 
Wenger said, adding that “some teams have more luck than others” in regards to 
when their matches have taken place during this traditionally busy time of the 
season.

Wenger is not the first top-flight manager to criticise the scheduling. Sam 
Allardyce called for the fixture organiser to be “sacked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/sam-allardyce-football-crystal-palace-manager-premier-league-fixture-sacked-arsenal>
” for making Palace host Swansea City on Tuesday, with their opponents having 
24 hours extra to prepare for the potentially significant match. In October, 
Jürgen Klopp also expressed his bewilderment at Liverpool having to take on 
Sunderland some 44 hours after theyfaced Manchester City in the late kick-off 
on New Year’s Eve

.

“In 48 hours we go into a game with a big handicap on the fixture and I have 
to find fresh legs,” Wenger said before the trip to the Vitality Stadium. “In 
20 years it is the most uneven Christmas period I’ve seen. The difference in 
rest period is unbelievable in terms of all the teams. It’s more we have sold 
the rights to TV for a lot of money so we have to accept TV chooses the games. 
But some teams have more luck than others.”

Arsenal are having to play three games in nine days because two of those games 
– against Palace and Bournemouth – have been moved to their respective slots by 
Sky Sports. Liverpool have also had two of their games during this period – the
4-1 win against Stoke City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/27/liverpool-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report>
 and the 1-0 victory over City – moved to different time slots by broadcasters, 
in their case Sky Sports and BT Sport, meaning they have played three times in 
seven days.

Chelsea, the leaders on the back of a record-equalling 13-game winning run 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/31/chelsea-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report>
, will play three games across 10 days, with only one of their Christmas and 
new year games – the visit to Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday – moved for live 
broadcast. With the other two being home fixtures, it means Chelsea have also 
not had to leave London during this period.

Asked if TV companies are affecting the integrity of the Premier League, 
Wenger said: “We are privileged in our job. We get a lot of money to play 
football. Sometimes it goes for you and sometimes against you.”

It would also be wrong to overly focus on pressure from broadcasters for the 
scheduling given only one of Southampton’s games across Christmas and new year 
was shown on TV –the 4-1 defeat against Tottenham last Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/28/southampton-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report>
 – and they have arguably been dealt the roughest hand, having to play three 
times in six days.

One benefit Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have in 
regards to playing on Tuesday is that they can put pressure on Chelsea by 
cutting the gap to six points, although Wenger was reluctant to play that up. 
“I don’t know. At the moment I am focused on the next game,” he said.

“We go to a difficult place, Bournemouth. The good news is Jack Wilshere will 
not play [he is ineligible to face his parent club] but there are still enough 
good players to give any team problems.

“What’s happening in this league is all the big teams win against the smaller 
teams. Since November it is like that. The only moment where teams drop points 
is when they play against each other but that can change.

“Chelsea wins every single game, they are comfortable in front. We have to 
hang on and try to win and hope results turn in our favour. We had an 
exceptional run and in four games we lose two games. I hope it’s out of our 
system. But every game is so difficult.”

Mesut Özil missed Arsenal’s victory against Palace because of illness and 
Wenger will make a late decision regarding whether or not to select the Germany 
international for Tuesday’s match. “Mesut is a bit better, he is in bed,” the 
manager said. “Will he be ready for selection? We will have to wait a bit more.”
