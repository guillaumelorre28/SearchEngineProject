He might first have made his living as a telegraph operator for the St 
Louis-San Francisco Railway, but Gene Autry ended his life as a 
multimillionaire after becoming the first of Hollywood's famous "singing 
cowboys". In 1934, he made his silver-screen debut in a B-western called In Old 
Santa Fe, the first of his 93 films. He also became famous for radio, 
television and live theatre and rodeo performances. His radio career spanned 16 
years between 1940 and 1956, heard every Sunday evening across the US on CBS. 
As if that wasn't enough, his Gene Autry show aired for 91 episodes on 
television.

In the course of his career he released 635 recordings. His first hit was That 
Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine, winning the first ever gold record, but his 
trademark tunes were Back in the Saddle Again, as well as his eternally popular 
version of Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer. In 1939, he visited the UK with his 
horse, Champion, and while he was really a Hollywood creation, he brought the 
songs of the range to the world.
