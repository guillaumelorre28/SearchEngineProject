seasonal feast of myth, magic and photography.

February 2012.

Henrik Håkansson <http://www.themoderninstitute.com/exhibitions/4258/images>
This Swedish artist explores environmental issues and the mysteries of nature 
in installations that feature living plants and animals. His new exhibition is 
called The End, worryingly enough.

November until 23 December 2011.

Anselm Kiefer <http://www.artfund.org/artistrooms/on_tour/57/anselm_kiefer>
The great contemporary painter of myth and history shows up in a Welsh seaside 
town with an exhibition of works on paper. Wonderful to see Kiefer's mossy 
tangled organic vision so close to the romantic landscapes of Snowdonia.

FCB Cadell 
<http://www.nationalgalleries.org/whatson/exhibitions/the-scottish-colourist-series-fcb-cadell/>
Cadell was one of the Scottish Colourists who brought the fauve intensity of 
Matisse <http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/matisse>, whose works they saw 
in France, back to the north to create some of the most vivid Scottish painting 
of the 20th century.

, Edinburgh, until 18 March 2012

British Museum. 

Unknown ancient Greek artist – Hypnos, God of Sleep 
<http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/b/bronze_head_of_hypnos.aspx>
, first to second century AD
The winged face of Sleep invites you to dream of worlds of Aegean blue and 
legendary creatures in this captivating bronze sculpture that is probably a 
Roman copy of a Hellenistic original.
• At British Museum, London

Antonello da Messina – St Jerome in his Study 
<http://www.abcgallery.com/I/italy/messina4.html>, 1460-1475
The tale told by Renaissance Italians was that Antonello made a dangerous 
journey from southern Italy to the low countries to get the secret of oil 
painting from Jan van Eyck. Taking this secret to Venice, he was himself 
tricked in turn and soon everyone knew how to make oil paintings. Folk stories 
aside, this painting reveals his miraculous and mysterious power to render the 
world in oils. To the precision of Flemish painting Antonello adds an Italian 
light and fantasy. He is one of the mystical greats of the Renaissance, the 
peer of Piero della Francesca andLeonardo

• At National Gallery, London

Rubens – Oil sketch for the Whitehall ceiling 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=95101>, 1628-30
Rubens produced so much in so many places across Europe that his art became an 
industrial enterprise involving talented collaborators. This sketch for his
great London ceiling painting 
<http://www.artfund.org/artwork/10091/multiple-sketch-for-the-banqueting-house-ceiling>
 The Apotheosis of James I is by the master's hand, whipping up an idea like a 
chef creating a soufflé. Bought for Tate Britain after a national campaign, it 
is now on view in the display Rubens and Britain which explores the painters 
relationship with British monarchy.
• At Tate Britain, London

Diego Velazquez – Lady with a Fan 
<http://www.wallaceprints.org/image/321755/diego-velazquez-the-lady-with-a-fan>
, c1640
Other painters are a bit childlike beside Velazquez. They get lost in romantic 
daydreams, lovely colours, pretty faces. He looks at life with a much clearer 
eye. Intelligence and irony glitter in the silky surfaces of his art. This 
woman is a stranger, holding back secrets.
• At The Wallace Collection <http://www.wallacecollection.org/>, London

David Hockney – Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=6534&tabview=text&texttype=10>
, 1970-71
Last chance to see this cooly beautiful and lyrical classic of the 1970s on 
view at Dulwich Picture Gallery where it is Masterpiece of the Month until 4 
December. It is the perfect picture of that moment. We're just two lost souls 
swimming in a fish bowl, year after year; wish you were here.
• At Dulwich Picture Gallery 
<http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/exhibitions/now_on_show/masterpiece_a_month.aspx>

Image of the week
 Alex Hartley, Clearing, 2011. On show in the exhibition The World is Still 
Big at the Victoria Miro Gallery. 

The good folk who run St Paul's Cathedral should think themselves lucky that 
their campers haven't brought chickens with them. Artist Alex Hartley has spent 
many years investigating dystopian architecture; creating habitats in often 
inhospitable landscapes. Now he has set up camp on the lake at the back of 
Victoria Miro gallery (she's his gallerist, so he's unlikely to get an eviction 
order). His handmade geodesic shelter, part of the exhibition The World is 
Still Big, comes with chickens. The image above, Clearing (2011), is one of his 
earlier works, on show inside the gallery.
