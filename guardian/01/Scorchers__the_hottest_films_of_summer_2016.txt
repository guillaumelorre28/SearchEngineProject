Florence Foster Jenkins

Hugh Grant and Meryl Streep have some lovely chemistry in this bittersweet 
sentimental comedy, based on a true story. Streep playsFlorence Foster Jenkins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/florence-foster-jenkins>, a wealthy 1940s 
socialite who believed she was a wonderful soprano despite being embarrassingly 
tone-deaf; Grant plays her wayward but adoring husband and manager.PB

Everybody Wants Some!!

Richard Linklater, creator of the real-time masterpiece Boyhood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/boyhood>, returns with a movie which seems 
rooted in the slacker world of his earlier films – with a deceptive hint of 
National Lampoon’s Animal House. It’s the 80s, and we follow a group of college 
students as they goof off, make out etc. Yet there’s something more reflective, 
too.PB

Mustang

A complex, intelligent and hugely admired debut from the Turkish film-maker 
Deniz Gamze Ergüven, co-written with French director Alice Winocour. A quintet 
of orphaned teen sisters have some innocent fun on the beach with some boys, 
and their fierce grandma accuses them of loose morals, imprisons them in the 
house and orders them to prepare for marriage. It’s a story from Turkey with a 
very European flavour.PB

hints of Python and Blackadder. There is a glorious performance from Toby Jones

female-fronted one, with the Bridesmaids one-two ofMelissa McCarthy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-mccarthy> and Kristen Wiig 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/kristen-wiig> joined by SNL’s Kate McKinnon

remains to be seen. If the release goes well, though, there’ll be more 
Ghostbusters – a male-fronted one, and a cartoon – coming down the pipe.AP

regular role as Scotty. Not much has been revealed, other than that Idris Elba

attacked “by a powerful, unstoppable wave of unknown aliens”. So it’s as you

The BFG 

Roald Dahl’s 1982 novel was turned into an animated film in 1989, but now 
Steven Spielberg has made a live-action version, and it looks like it could be 
summer’s big family blockbuster. Man of the moment Mark Rylance is the amiable 
giant who kidnaps a little girl to help him defeat a tribe of menacing 
man-eating giants. Spielberg has cast an unknown, 11-year-old Ruby Barnhill, 
opposite Rylance. This sort of kids’ fantasy tends to bring out Spielberg’s 
best qualities; definitely one to look forward to.AP

Finding Dory

Pixar’s new one is a sequel to its 2003 hit Finding Nemo (you know: clownfish, 
lost, Willem Dafoe, sharks). Here, the focus is on Nemo’s forgetful pal Dory 
(Ellen DeGeneres, in the original as well as this), who embarks on a quest to 
find her family in California. The moderate response to 2015’s The Good 
Dinosaur took a bit of the gloss off Pixar’s reputation, and Finding Dory would 
seem at this distance to be solid rather than inspired. But we’re happy to be 
proved wrong.AP

Jason Bourne

Paul Greengrass is back in the Bourne saddle for the first time since 2007’s 
Bourne Ultimatum (after taking a break for 2012’s not universally admired 
Bourne Legacy). This one seems to be an attempt to recalibrate the spy series 
as an open-ended franchise. Not a lot of info is available,other than a trailer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/22/jason-bourne-trailer-things-we-learned-matt-damon-julia-stiles>
 that suggests Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is indeed back, and he’s protecting 
former contact Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles). Alicia Vikander is the most 
eye-catching new recruit to the series, playing some sort of agency aide, while 
Riz Ahmed is along for the ride, too. AP

Suicide Squad

A supervillain match-up movie featuring the Joker, Deadshot, Boomerang et al, 
as part of DC Comics’ belated attempt to rival Marvel’s “extended universe” 
blockbusters. Having seenBatman v Superman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/man-of-steel-2> flounder if not exactly flop, 
DC will be pinning a lot of hopes on this. Directed byFury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/fury-review-brad-pitt-second-world-war-drama>
’s David Ayer, it stars the likes of Will Smith, Jared Leto and Margot Robbie, 
and has the baddies teaming up in a task force to save the world. If this 
doesn’t work, there’s theJustice League

David Brent: Life on the Road

Another TV spin-off – this time more likely to appeal to the Alpha Papa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/24/alan-partridge-alpha-papa-review> 
crowd rather than the Dad’s Army one. Ricky Gervais dusts down his fondly 
remembered Office alter ego David Brent for a feature-length outing, which he 
wrote, directs and stars in. He seems to be trying a bit harder than most 
spin-offers: Brent is trying to rekindle his dreams of music-biz stardom in 
this one. Ifthe trailer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/07/ricky-gervais-david-brent-life-on-the-road-trailer>
 is anything to go by, Gervais will also be taking advantage of cinema’s less 
restrictive morals, with some nuclear-level potty-mouthing.AP

Swallows and Amazons

Arthur Ransome’s classic kids’ yarn is adapted for the screen for the first 
time since 1974. Inevitably, though, the much giggled-over character name Titty 
has been changed … to Tatty. There is a cast of biggish names – Rafe Spall, 
Kelly Macdonald, Harry Enfield – and a newly inserted plot strand about a 
suspicious-looking spy, apparently inspired byRansome’s own “diplomatic” 
activities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/13/arthur-ransome-double-agent> on 
both sides during his time in revolutionary Russia. Lots of splendid Lake 
District countryside, however, is assured.AP

Ben-Hur

This is one of those remakes that no one had particularly asked for. But, 
possibly inspired by the rise of thefaith film audience 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/17/faith-films-marketing-miracle>, 
the “tale of the Christ” is to get another workout. Boardwalk Empire’s Jack 
Huston steps into the Charlton Heston role of the Jewish prince forced into 
slavery by the Romans; Toby Kebbell is Messala, the former childhood friend he 
takes on in a chariot race. It isn’t likely, if we’re honest, to match the 1959 
version’s 11 Oscars – but is potentially an entertaining romp all the same.AP

Julieta

Pedro Almodóvar’s unlikely take on the work of Canadian short-story maestro 
Alice Munro has acquired some distracting notoriety, after the Spanish auteur 
and his brother were named in thePanama Papers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers>; Almodóvar promptly 
withdrew from press activity. Julieta, which will premiere at Cannes, features 
Emma Suárez (best known for her work with Julio Medem) as a woman looking for 
her runaway daughter.AP

War Dogs

Todd Phillips, king of the stoner-bromance movie, goes a tad more heavyweight 
here, with this arms-trading comedy (you heard that right) based on a 
non-fiction book called Arms and the Dudes. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill play 
the Miami stoners who luck into a $300m contract to supply guns to the military 
in Afghanistan. Producer Bradley Cooper has a supporting role as a major league 
arms dealer.AP
