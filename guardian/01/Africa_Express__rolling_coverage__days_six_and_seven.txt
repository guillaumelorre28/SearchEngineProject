Caspar Llewellyn Smith Oh, before I go, here's a review from today's Observer 
of the Bristol show 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/08/africa-express-bristol-music> and 
then Tim Jonze's review of the London show 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/09/africa-express-finale-concert-london>
 from the later editions of the paper, plusa short piece from Spoek Mathambo 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/09/africa-express-bound-for-glory> 
... and later I may make something more cogent of all of this.. But it's been 
some ride.

12.30am BST 

Caspar Llewellyn Smith So one good thing about Africa Express: the train 
returned to Kings Cross in London, which is five minutes walk from the new St 
Martins building and Granary Square, the venue for their final show - and that 
happens to be five minutes from the Guardian's offices. This means I'm now at 
my desk in the office, after half a week away (Tim Jonze covered the first week 
of the train tour) ... and exhausted, but equally exhilarated, following a five 
hour show - a greatest hits package, almost. 

The acts on the train had been told yesterday that a special guest might be 
turning up to play in London, and then Damon Albarn let the cat out of the bag 
in Bristol with his very public rehearsal of Coming Up. And so sure enough, 
shortly after the Africa Express collective gathered at Granary Square, the 
former Beatle showed. I spoke to him briefly - he said he'd always loved 
African music, met Fela Kuti in Lagos in the 70s, knew about Africa Express 
from Ian Birrell and was always into the idea, just had never been able to make 
a gig, had some feeble excuse for not being on the train all week ... - before 
he was whisked off to take the stage. And in a veryAfrica Express 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/africa-express> way, it wasn't to play one 
of his songs, but rather to back Rokia Traore; although later he was allowed 
his moment in the spotlight with Coming Up and Goodnight Tonight. 

At no other point over the last four nights have I thought "that sounds 
under-rehearsed" and meant it in a bad way, but Coming Up sounded ... 
under-rehearsed. (Later, Richard Russell said it had been so much better in 
that very brief run through, just as the doors to the venue were opening); 
Goodnight Tonight worked better - and then there was a point at which you just 
looked at the stage, and if you're not impressed by a lineup comprising .... 

PAUL McCARTNEY (Bass / Vocals)
Seye (Guitar)
Da Costa (Percussion)
Robel 'Grum' Taye (Percussion)
Tony Allen (Drums)
Yao (Bass)
Gruff Rhys (Synth / Vocals)
Damon Albarn (Piano / Vocals)
Pauli the PSM (Percussion)
Toby Couling (Percussion)
Jesse Hackett (Keyboards)
Bassekou Kouyate (Ngoni)
John Paul Jones (Mandolin)
Rokia Traore (Vocals)
Terri Walker (Vocals)
Fatoumata Diawara (Vocals)
Martina Topley Bird (Vocals)
Shingai Shoniwa (Vocals)
Yvo Abadi (Percussion)

And overall, the show? As Zhou Enlai might have said of the Russian 
revolution, it's probably a bit too early to tell ... it lacked some of the 
wild abandon of Bristol, but then they didn't get a Beatle. One of the 
loveliest things about the setup, and this is not meant as a criticism of 
McCartney: it was great for the audience to see him, but they weren't expecting 
him and the show would have still been incredible; but for the artists on the 
train, I think it must have felt (as Richard Russell just said to me) like 
Albarn's way of thanking them for embarking on the journey with him. 

Immediately after the show, I talked to the likes of Fatou Diawara, Johan from 
the Very Best, Carl Barat, the Krar Collective ... and they were all talking 
about the week they've spent on the train as a life-changing experience. Christ 
knows what they'll be like when I catch up with them in just a minute or to at 
the aftershow party .. .

The hip hop artist M1 from Dead Prez on what he's made of the trip.
It's been a process, that sense of the unexpected, to things falling into 
place, to finally kind of getting it ... and then it's over, it's too soon. 
It's been like magic from the first day.
When the organisers asked me to do it, I was immediately in - I was determined 
I was not going to be left out. Before I came on the train, I knew maybe a 
couple of the artists: M.anifest, who's from Ghana but has lived in Minnesota, 
and Mensah, he's Ghanaian - I've got a Ghana connection in New York and I'm 
cool with them. Baloji, who's just joined the train, we've been trying to work 
together for at least three years, but we just discussed it over email: we'd 
never met. So this is giving me concrete opportunities.
I've spent a lot of time planning and preparing to do work in and about Africa 
- since I first went to South Africa, I've made perhaps 15 trips there, east 
and west – and this is the highest kind of example of what I could ever have 
wanted to do. This is like a wet dream. It's like everything on steroids. It's 
like I'm living in heaven.
I was talking to Spoek Mathambo, and he said he was making a list of all the 
other artists on the train he wants to work with, and he'll do it even it takes 
10 years - and of course we all want to do that. And for me, it's with people 
like John (McLure), or Lucy Rose, or Rye Rye, too – not artists you'd associate 
with Dead Prez, just artists who you hear and you say “Damn, you're dope.”
Sometimes I just like to get out of the way, and to watch people like Amadou 
and Rokia and Afel. And I don't know about Malian culture and I don't speak 
French - heck, I don't speak much but slang from the United States - but I made 
a song with Afel that I think is one of the best things I've ever done. I just 
heard the music and told them some of the rhythms I'm thinking. We can't 
communicate in any other way, but this whole process, it's definitely going to 
widen me: I've got to change my life, I've got to speak some French!
The way it's come together, I don't even explain it as luck. It could have 
been a train wreck, and not just a little train wreck with two trains ... it's 
like 50 trains headed for the same junction and ... there is no wreck!

2.24pm BST 

Caspar Llewellyn Smith To clarify something from earlier: John Paul Jones 
didn't play bass on the version of Kashmir last night but mandolin. On the 
train to London, he's told me that he had 10 minutes notice that Amadou and co 
were going to play it. “I just saw the title on the set list. It was written 
down as Cashmere. The sweater song.”
We're rolling towards London, with Martina Topley-Bird, Reeps One and Marques 
Toliver improvising something in the rehearsal carriage, with Afrikan Boy and 
Karim Rush then jumping on the mic; Baaba Maal is lying with his shirt off 
having a massage in the chill-out carriage; Steve, from Direct Rail Services, 
is walking the length of the train asking everyone on board to sign his 
schedule sheet as a memento, and it seems like half the acts are scribbling 
down each others' names and email addresses with a view to working together in 
the future. Gruff from Super Furry Animals, who was just supposed to be playing 
the Cardiff show but made it on stage in Bristol last night, has come on board 
hoping he'll get a slot in London; the Noisettes missed last night because they 
had a gig in London, but they've took an early train from Paddington to Bristol 
this morning so as to be on this ride back to the capital; and Johan from the 
Very Best, who plans to try something in the studio with Baaba soon, is saying 
“none of us wil ever forget it”.

The Malian guitarist Afel Boucoum, who's been opening the shows, spoke to Andy 
Morgan about life on board.

On this train, there’s life! I’m with musicians of all kinds. I’ve spent two 
or three nights trying to work out the names of all the people I’ve met. I’m 
not tired of seeing people, of watching their performances. We have chats about 
everything – music, religion, war. It feels like we’re all together sitting in 
a room with the windows wide open, the breeze blowing through and this 
wonderful countryside going past. We’re relaxed. If you want to sleep, you 
sleep. If you want to wander, you wander. Everything is here. It’s a 
well-stocked train!

The countryside we’re passing through is wonderful. I don’t even know how to 
describe it. I’d love to transport it from here back home to Mali somewhere. It 
does me good to look at the greenery and the animals. We’re Peul nomads who 
live from our animals. Seeing animals like that, so well fed and fat, we could 
become jealous … even crazy … you know!
I’ve wanted to jam and collaborate more, but the rehearsal wagon is always 
bombarded with requests. Everyone wants to get in there. So when you find 
people playing in there already you can either just listen in or start dancing! 
But they’re producing great music, although it’s not always my style. If I 
joined in I’d make myself look ridiculous. But you can also play elsewhere on 
the train. The other day I was playing with Damon in one of the compartments. 
It was great!

We’re hoping to develop more collaborations. There are plenty of artists I’d 
love to collaborate with. I know Fatoumata Diawara’s style. It’s superb. 
There’s the rapper M1. I always say ‘"Em Un!" ha ha! I don’t know what his 
perception of music is exactly, but I have the impression that he’s someone who 
has already flown with his own wings and seen some life.
I found him to be a very smart and aware person. And from the first time we 
met we’ve been talking about things, despite the language barrier.
You have to collaborate, otherwise you’ll go nowhere in the world of today. 
It’s all about collaboration. M1’s music…rap…I like it. I even like music made 
by DJs, even though they’ve completely stolen the market now, with their 
machines that do everything. But if the youth want that, you have to give it to 
them. Maybe a certain epoch is coming to and end. But it’s no problem. You just 
have to do something else.

10.49am BST 

Caspar Llewellyn Smith Late in Bristol last night, Lorenzo Sillitto from the 
Temper Trap talked about how the acts on the Africa Express wait nervously for 
the running order for the gig to be posted before it each night, announcing 
what slot (if any) they're going to get: it's like being a footballer, and 
looking at the team sheet. It surprised Ian Birrell, one of Africa Express's 
founders - "I thought it was just a case of us trying to accommodate everyone 
with the set list" - but it's clear that the competition for places on the bill 
exerts a extra galvanising force on everyone.

The gig was extraordinary - probably the best Africa Express show I've seen - 
and, again, at least 60 per cent different from the previous evening. Helping 
it explode were Kano and Bashy, the two rappers who'd missed making a showing 
in Cardiff when the set list had to be trimmed for the curfew. Here they 
stormed on to the stage for the version of Dead Prez's Hip Hop that's been a 
staple of the shows on this tour, with that band's M1, Karim Rush, Mensah, 
m.anifest, Afrikan Boy and Martina Topley-Bird sharing the mic with them, and 
the oud player Mehdi Haddad layering his sound on top. It felt like that 
couldn't be topped, but to come was the version of The Very Best's Ndheka that 
morphed into Spoek Mathambo's Control, with Mehdi, Jack Steadman, Mim Souleyman 
and more, but especially the singer Nelly; beautiful quieter moments with Fatou 
Diawara, Baaba Maal and Damon Albarn; and most of all, the cover of Led Zep's 
Kashmir, with Seb Rochford drumming, the Temper Trap, the Express Horns, Amadou 
killing it on lead guitar, Rokia Traore, Nelly and Bashy joining in, the whole 
thing anchored by a bassist who'd only caught up with the tour a couple of 
hour's earlier, John Paul Jones from Led Zep.

This is also without mentioning a cover version of the XX's Crystalised, which 
Martina, Jones and Jupiter Bokondji conceived just before the show, in 
soundcheck; and Albarn covering Coming Up by Wings - announcing that this was a 
public rehearsal for tonight's show in London, when the plan at the moment is 
to involve that song's author Paul McCartney. But even the Beatle can't be a 
certainty on the team sheet.

It's now just after breakfast - it's been a pleasure to see the Africa Express 
gang queuing for their eggs and bacon at the hotel buffets every morning, some 
looking slightly dishevelled, Amadou always immaculate in a suit - and then the 
train leaves Bristol at 11.50am. Arrival at Kings Cross is at 3.22pm, doors for 
the gig at Granary Square shortly thereafter, with the music starting at 6pm.

4.20pm BST 

Caspar Llewellyn Smith
 At each place The Africa Express stops, splinter groups spread out for small 
pop-up shows. After arriving in Cardiff yesterday afternoon (and following a 
nuts performance on the station platform by Jupiter and Okwess International), 
I walked with Bryn Ormrod of the Barbican – who are helping produce this tour, 
as part of the London 2012 Festival – to try and catch up with Ethiopian group 
the Krar Collective, arguably the surprise package of the trip. It was for a 
pop-up at a cafe run by Gruff from Super Furry Animals's brother-in-law, and 
within five minutes we were lost, unable to pronounce the name of the venue – 
Hwtyhth – in any way that made us intelligible. In the end, it sounded better 
in Amharic.

The Krar's music illuminates the connections between the Arab world
 and the African continent, and in this quiet spot, with a pint of lethal Bare 
Naked beer, the combination of Genet Asseta's voice, Grum Teye's percussion and 
the krar (harp) playing of Temessen Zeleke was
 captivating.

Later that evening, it was wilder affair with the Krar gang, joined on stage 
for the gig proper as by Terri Walker and Afrikan Boy, Diabel Cissohko, 
Massamba Diop and more for a supercharged version of Eabo. There was also a 
daftly fun run through of Gyrru Gyrru Gyrru with Super Furry Gruff (a local 
hero), the percussionist Cubain, the man-mountain of enthusiasm that is John 
McClure, Carl Barat, two of the Krars and (legging it on stage halfway through) 
Damon Albarn. But, with perhaps 60 per cent of the show different from 
Manchester, it was a less frenetic gig overall, not helped by the visuals not 
working.

Yet still it was full of dazzling moments. Highlights for me included 
Fatoumata Diawara, catching up with the tour, singing Alama with Damon on piano 
and Mamadou Sarr on djembe; Rae Morris, Rokia Traore, Diabel and Jack Steadman 
perfoming For You; Spoek Mathambo spitting over Jupiter's The World Is My Land, 
with Nelly and Rokia; and, in particular, Baaba Maal with with Diabel and 
Basseko Kouyate.

The 58-year old Baaba had been resplendent in a robe for a high octane 
performance in Manchester, but this time he was wearing a fabulous feathered 
affair around his neck (borrowed from the guitarist Seye) and sat down to play, 
explaining that he wanted it to be like when he started out with his old friend 
Mansour Seck, growing up in Podor in northern Senegal, “waiting under a mango 
tree for other musicians to pass by”. The version of Danibe was breathtaking - 
and then he turned all that tradition on its head by asking Reeps One on to the 
stage.

Earlier on the train down to Cardiff, the two had sat behind me, in discussion 
and then improvising, the young pioneer of what he calls vocal electronic music 
mimicking the sounds of Baaba's percussionists. On stage, he introduced a beat, 
weaving in and out of the sounds of the kora and ngoni, creating a new sound 
and feeling.

Africa Express is seen as a vehicle for changing people's preconceptions about 
African music, but for Reeps it's been about challenging ideas of what it is 
that he does - he doesn't like the term “beatboxing” because it immediately 
raises certain suspicions. On the bus back back from the venue to the hotel, he 
talked passionately about how this has been the most intense learning 
experience of his life, an opportunity to push himself into wholly different 
areas. And then in the hotel bar, Baaba talked separately but equally 
passionately to me about how, for him, the chance to work with a younger 
generation – from a wholly different background – is utterly inspiring. “This 
is the best project I've ever been involved in in my whole career,” he said, 
which is an extraordinary testimony.

Others have been saying very much the same. Following an impromptu jam in the 
hotel lobby involving the Noisettes, Baaba, Marques Toliver, Terri Walker and 
others, I then talked late last night (early this morning) to Carl Barat, who 
couldn't stop enthusing about the audiences for these shows: how normally you 
know how a crowd will react and how to manipulate them, but here, with so much 
up for grabs, there's more demanded of everyone, audience and musicians, and 
that creates a very different energy.

This morning, I squeezed into a cab with the calabash player Pedro, the great 
guitarist Afel Boucoum, Ian Birrell from Africa Express and Damon Albarn and 
headed to a Community Music Wales initiative. In a first floor meeting room in 
a nondescript building in Fairwater, there were 50-odd people, several of them 
disabled children, who greeted the arriving musicians with a blast of 
percussion themselves. Damon then talked – about how to play a calabash, about 
the terrible ongoing situation in northern Mali, where Afel comes from – and 
lead everyone into a performance, but deferred quickly to the guitarist before 
a couple of young girls, who showed off their calabash skills. And this, very 
much part of the Africa Express trip, felt (as Afel said) “yes, beautiful,” too.

Now we're rolling on to Bristol. There are pop-up shows at the Canteen, a 
social enterprise cafe, and Bristol Crisis Centre, a homeless cafe, at 4pm. 
Then tonight's show. In the train's rehearsal carriage, I can hear some 
permutation of the 80-odd musicians on this train shaping something now for 
their moment this evening.

Caspar Llewellyn Smith:

Welcome back to our rolling coverage of the Africa Express tour of the UK, 
carried out with their own specially chartered train. This is day six, and this 
evening it's the penultimate show, in Bristol. Right now, everyone's just 
waking up in Cardiff. I'll post some more thoughts later, but in the meantime 
here's some YouTube from last - a bit of table tennis, and the scene in the 
hotel lobby at about 2am.
