Congratulations to my long-time Guardian colleague, Maggie Brown, who is to 
write the next chapter in the history ofChannel 4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4>.


She has agreed a deal to write a follow-up to her acclaimed book, published in 
2007,A Licence to Be Different – The Story of Channel 4 
<https://books.google.ie/books/about/A_licence_to_be_different.html?id=xEEfAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y>
. The new one will cover the years from 2008 until now.

Although she will benefit from supervised access to the broadcaster’s 
archives, hers will be an independent study rather than an authorised corporate 
history.

The key year will surely be 2009, when Channel 4 dropped Big Brother (then 
picked up by Channel 5) and the challenges that the decision presented. Later 
that year saw the resignation of chief executive Andy Duncan and, a couple of 
months later, chairmanLuke Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/lukejohnson>.

David Abraham <https://www.theguardian.com/media/david-abraham> became the 
channel’s sixth chief executive in 2010 and remains in post as the public 
service broadcaster faces the possibility of privatisation.

That will be dealt with in the final chapter of Maggie’s book. In earlier 
sections, she will assess Abraham’s creative renewal, which resulted in hits 
such as Educating Essex andGogglebox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gogglebox> along with ventures into 
factual programming; Channel 4’s relations with independent producers; and the 
introduction of its catch-up service 4oD.

The book is due to be on the shelves in 2017 and the publisher will be 
announced at a later date.
