 Activate London 2012: Speaker Rick Falkvinge 
Rick is the founder of the first Pirate Party and a campaigner for 
next-generation civil liberties and sensible information policy. In particular, 
he stresses how the copyright industries work in collusion with Big Brother 
hawks to erode or eliminate the parts of Internet that guarantee our civil 
liberties. On this platform, one of privacy and digital rights, his party 
became the largest in the below-30 demographic in the 2009 European Elections.
