Britain's Anne Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> 
finally saw her run at the Luxembourg Open ended on Saturday – but not before a 
marathon semi-final against Romania's Monica Niculescu.

Niculescu took a see-saw first set, which contained more breaks of serve – 
seven – than holds, 7-5, but Keothavong levelled after edging a second set of 
three breaks.

Three more followed in the third, with Niculescu serving out and taking her 
first match point to complete a 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 win in three hours and two 
minutes.

Keothavong was aiming to become the first British singles finalist in a WTA 
Tour event since Jo Durie in 1990.
