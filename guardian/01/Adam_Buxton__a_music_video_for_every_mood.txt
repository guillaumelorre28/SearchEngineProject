Sour – Hibi No Neiro 
(2009, Masashi Kawamura, Hal Kirkland, Magico Nakamura and Masayoshi Nakamura)

Even if you've never seen this video, you're likely to have seen one of 
several adverts that used it as "inspiration". It features webcam images of 
around 80 fans of Japanese band Sour coordinated to create a web version of 
those times they get people at football matches to hold up cards that make a 
giant image when viewed from a distance. It took two months to plan and four 
weeks to execute.

Justice – Stress 
(2008, Romain Gavras)

A gang of yobby boys (or "boyyobs") walk very fast through Parisian streets 
being horrid to everyone and everything they come across. They wear nice 
leather blousons emblazoned with the cross logo associated with French band 
Justice and, er, Jesus. Gavras also made the exploding ginger boys promo for 
MIA'sBorn Free 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/may/02/mia-born-free-music-video> and the 
slo-mo riot with surprise elephant promo for Kanye West's No Church In The 
Wild, and his direction in the Stress video is so smart that at times you 
wonder if the violence and harassment really is staged. Is it cool? Is it bad? 
Is it coolbad? Or is it just balls? Whatever it is, it packs the kind of 
punches that would have Daily Mail readers short-circuiting within 30 seconds, 
and if you've recently been harassed by a real gang of urban boyyobs, you 
should probably avoid it. Less controversial and perhaps more fun is Gavras's 
recent video for MIA'sBad Girls <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYs0gJD-LE> 
featuring everyone's favourite Cs: colourful costumes, choreography and car 
stunts. And no one gets beaten up, burned or exploded.

Baby trashes bar in Las Palmas 
(2010, Johannes Nyholm)

Not strictly speaking a music video, but one that should nevertheless be seen 
by all humans. A group of marionettes in a cardboard tourist restaurant are 
terrorised by a real toddler, staggering from table to table apparently pissed. 
Johannes Nyholm brilliantly captures a series of mealtime toddlerisms that also 
bring to mind every lubricated Brit tourist you've ever had the misfortune to 
come across on holiday.

The Lonely Island – Threw It On The Ground 
(2011, Akiva Schaffer)

The Lonely Island are Saturday Night Live 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/apr/05/snl-kristin-wiig-andy-samberg>
 star Andy Samberg, director Akiva Schaffer and comedian, actor, writer and 
producer of much ofthe Lonely Island 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/15/lonely-island-turtleneck-and-chain>
's music, Jorma Taccone. Since 2005, they have racked up hundreds of millions 
of views online for their works, includingDick In A Box 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZLIQodHaFk> (featuring Justin Timberlake), I'm 
On A Boat <http://vimeo.com/18848658> (featuring T-Pain) and Jizz In My Pants 
(featuring Samberg and Taccone's peerless "jizz faces"). It'll be a few years 
before I play any of those to my sons (eight and ten years old) but aside from 
some light anal tasering near the end, Threw It On The Ground is entirely PG, 
and as funny as any of them. It's hard to say what it's about, other than 
celebrating the act of throwing things on the ground, but Samberg's superbly 
rubbery face is always a big part of the appeal. I don't know what's more fun, 
watching the video or watching the children laughing as they watch the video.

David Bowie – China Girl 
(1983, David Mallet)

Not exactly a hidden gem but one of Bowie's best videos capturing him at his 
most conventionally handsome and charismatic, gyrating about jerkily like a 
malfunctioning sex robot. New Zealand model Geeling Ng plays the China girl in 
scenes that toy with Oriental stereotypes, juxtaposed with bits where she and a 
blond Bowie flirt weirdly. The video was controversial at the time for the 
brief glimpse of David's nude bottom and, in the uncut version, some 
ladynipple, as the happy couple enjoy a saucy roll in the surf, but in 2012 the 
standout moment is Bowie pulling back the corners of his eyes in a pre-PC 
parody of a Chinese face. In a video featuring more overtly political imagery 
(Geeling running through the desert in cultural revolutionary garb; David 
loosening his tie angrily then tossing a bowl of rice in the air in slow 
motion!) it's this gesture of playful offence that ends up saying the most 
somehow. It's followed too by a smile from Bowie that is at once very sexy and 
very stupid. Sample YouTube comment: "SO funny what 30 years will do to your 
perspective; when this video was new, Bowie seemed so OLD to me, but now he 
look very young in this video. Enjoy your youth kids, getting old sucks." –

Roots Manuva – Witness (1 Hope) 
(2001, Mat Kirkby)

Everything works in Mat Kirkby's joyful video for Witness (1 Hope). A simple 
idea married to a great track and terrific performances from the children of 
Woodmansterne Primary School, first impressed then outraged by the visiting 
rapper, and of course Roots himself: cool, handsome and funny, very much the 
way I think of myself, in fact. When I play this video atBug 
<http://www.bugvideos.co.uk/> shows, I wait for the audience's reaction to the 
three-legged race. If they don't laugh, I know I'm in for a hard night, but I 
honestly can't recall the last time that happened.

Manchester Orchestra – Simple Math 
(2011, Dan Kwan & Dan Scheinert)

The bearded singer of American indie rockers Manchester Orchestra 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/may/07/new-band-manchester-orchestra> is 
driving through woodland when, all of a sudden, he has to swerve to avoid a 
deer (hate it when that happens). The car rolls, catapulting him through the 
windshield (really hate it when that happens) and SHWOINK! It's flashback time. 
For the next five minutes the action switches back and forth between 
significant moments in the beardy singer's life, unfolding with the help of 
ingenious visual tricks and edits, mainly achieved in-camera rather than with 
CGI. The video makes for a cinematic experience that will make your throat go 
painful as you struggle not to weep like a lady watchingOne Born Every Minute 
<http://tvlistings.guardian.co.uk/catch-up/?tvgSearchPhrase=One+Born+Every+Minute&tvgShowID=2861902&tvgPageNumber=1>
. The video's directors recently made another epic for Tenacious D's singleRize 
Of The Fenix <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls3rD8VfiSY>. It's packed with 
in-jokes about music video production that will amuse anyone involved with, 
well, music video production. It's good too, though.
