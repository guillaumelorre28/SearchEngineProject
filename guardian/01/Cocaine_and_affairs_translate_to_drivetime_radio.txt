The qualities that helped Fleetwood Mac's Rumours sell 40m copies – its west 
coast provenance, which gave the record a languid charm, and the pain of dual 
marital break-ups transmuted into elegant, harmony-laden pop songs – weren't 
really transferable, but they turned soft rock into one of the definitive 
sounds of the late 70s anyway. Some American radio stations even switched 
formats to exploit the upsurge in sleek, melodic pop that followed in the wake 
of Rumours. It was, famously, unsurpassable; its bizarre and fractured 
follow-up, Tusk, has gone down in history as one of rock's great follies.
