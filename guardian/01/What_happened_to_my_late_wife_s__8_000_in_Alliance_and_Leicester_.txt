My wife died in March. She had opened a two-part account in June 2008 which 
was £14,000 with Legal & General and £8,000 with Alliance & Leicester at 9% for 
a year. When I contacted A&L, it said the link no longer operated and the 
£8,000 had been transferred to L&G. Each company claims the other has the money.

A&L has put you through unnecessary additional stress. Your wife's £8,000 is 
still safely with the bank. The L&G investment continues but the A&L element 
matured after one year. It was reinvested in a fixed rate bond and the £687 
interest had been sent to your wife by cheque. A&L is sending you a hamper to 
apologise for the poor service.
