Arcelor Mittal <https://www.theguardian.com/business/arcelor-mittal>, the 
world's biggest steel-maker, today laid bare the first fruits of its merger 
with pre-tax profits of $15.3bn (£7.82bn) for last year.

The group, headed by Indian billionaire entrepreneur Lakshmi Mittal, has been 
riding high on stock markets since the eponymous company won a six-month battle 
to take over pan-European rival Arcelor in mid-2006.

The shares are up almost 20% this year.

Mr Mittal, who has created the world's first 100m-tonne steel group, is 
expected to give his views on the prospects for further consolidation in the 
global industry later today when he presents the pro-forma results.

This follows Indian group Tata's successful bid for Corus, the Anglo-Dutch 
steelmaker.

The combined group said sales last year were $88.6bn and it expected operating 
earnings to be up to $4.2bn in the current quarter.
