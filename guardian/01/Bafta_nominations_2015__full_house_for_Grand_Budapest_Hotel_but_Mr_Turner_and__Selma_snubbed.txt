Wes Anderson’s whimsical and madcap The Grand Budapest Hotel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-grand-budapest-hotel>, so far largely 
overlooked this awards season, has garnered the largest number of nominations 
at this year’s Baftas, with 11. Anderson is nominated as best director; the 
film is also up for best film, best original screenplay and best actor for 
Ralph Fiennes.

As with the Golden Globe nominations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/11/birdman-soars-over-the-competition-at-2015-golden-globe-nominations>
, Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch vie for the best actor award with 
competing portrayals of scientific geniuses: Stephen Hawking in The Theory of 
Everything and Alan Turing in The Imitation Game. Michael Keaton and Jake 
Gyllenhaal round out the category, the latter perhaps filling a spot many had 
assumed reserved for David Oyelowo, the British actor who plays Martin Luther 
King in Selma. That film – an Oscar frontrunner – failed to score a single 
nomination.

Perhaps trying to swerve this strong British actor field, Steve Carrell was 
instead put forward for the supporting actor category for his Oscar-tipped 
performance in Foxcatcher. He is nominated along with his co-star Mark Ruffalo.

Nightcrawler did surprisingly well at the nomination stage, with four, 
including one for Rene Russo’s supporting role; outdoing them with five was
Whiplash <https://www.theguardian.com/film/whiplash>, with nods not just for JK 
Simmons as best supporting actor, but also in the directing, original 
screenplay, editing and sound categories.

Awards favourites Birdman, The Theory of Everything 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-theory-of-everything> and The Imitation 
Game all scored highly, but Mr Turner, Mike Leigh’s biopic of the British 
artist, would have expected to do much better on home turf. Of its four 
nominations, none are in major categories, not even for Leigh’s direction or 
Timothy Spall’s Cannes-winning lead performance.

 The cast and crew of Boyhood describe the 12-year -film-making process 
Oscar favourite Boyhood will also disappoint its film-makers with only five 
nominations, though they were in major fields including best director for 
Richard Linklater and best film. It is being rereleased in the UK next week, 
ahead of its potentially lively awards season. Two other potential Oscar 
darlings, JC Chandor’sA Most Violent Year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-most-violent-year> and Paul Thomas 
Anderson’s Inherent Vice, both also failed to secure any nominations at all.

In the best actress category, Rosamund Pike gave Gone Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-girl> one of only two nominations, 
suggesting its own awards campaign might falter. Felicity Jones, Reese 
Witherspoon, Julianne Moore and Amy Adams were also nominated.

While Mr Turner may have been relatively ignored, Bafta used the awards to 
throw its weight behind some other British hits. Hit family comedyPaddington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/paddington> earned two nominations, as did 
Troubles drama ’71, while Pride earned three, including a supporting actress 
nod for Imelda Staunton.

Under the Skin, the elliptical drama from Jonathan Glazer with Scarlett 
Johansson as a lonely alien stalking the wilds of Scotland, was given a 
nomination in the Outstanding British Film category, while Mica Levi was also 
recognised for her music. It was also namedbest film of 2014 by the Guardian

Working Title’s Eric Fellner, one of the producers of The Theory of 
Everything, told the Guardian he was “delighted” with the film’s stack of 
nominations, calling it “one of those rare times where it’s a conflation of 
three factors: we’re pleased with the film, the critics love it, and it’s a 
success with the real audience” – it is currently top of the UK box office 
charts. He also acknowledged the nod for Trash in the foreign category, calling 
the film an “extraordinary gamble” – it was directed by Stephen Daldry, but 
with a mostly Brazilian cast and crew. He expressed surprise forSelma 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/selma> and Spall not being nominated, though 
said that “it is always tough in a field as strong as this.”

The EE Rising Star award for the best in young talent had already been 
announced 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/07/bafta-rising-star-award-nominees-jack-oconnell-gugu-mbatha-raw>
, with Shailene Woodley, Jack O’Connell, Margot Robbie, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and 
Miles Teller.

On hearing the news that he was unexpectedly nominated, Ralph Fiennes said in 
a statement: “I’m delighted of course, merci Madame Bafta. Dom Pérignon all 
around for guests and staff at The Grand Budapest Hotel. And a free sample of 
eau de panache too darling,” referring to his character’s favoured scent. 
Anderson meanwhile said he was “thrilled, honoured, humbled, elated – and 
deeply grateful” on hearing the news of the nominations.

Cynics will say that The Grand Budapest Hotel’s success is rooted in securing 
a lot of minor categories, though it certainly stands a good chance of winning 
many of them, given Anderson’s typically witty approach to production design, 
costumes and music. It’s a coup for a film that only got five Golden Globe 
nominations, and has generally been overlooked in the year’s variouscritics’ 
prizes
