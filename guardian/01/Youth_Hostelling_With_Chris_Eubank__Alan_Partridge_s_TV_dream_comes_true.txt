Eighteen years after Alan Partridge desperately pitched the idea to a BBC 
executive in I’mAlan Partridge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/alan-partridge>, Youth Hostelling 
With Chris Eubank is finally a reality, after booking website Hostelworld 
created a mock trailer starring Eubank himself.

It’s a remarkable turn of events given that, just last week, Eubank was 
expressing confusion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/12/bbc-youth-hosteling-chris-eubank-alan-partridge-twitter>
 over why Twitter users kept on asking him about youth hostels. His befuddled 
Twitter responses went viral and attracted widespread media attention.

Now, though, Eubank seems to be firmly in on the joke. In the Youth Hostelling 
With Chris Eubank trailer, the former WBO Middleweight World Champion checks 
himself into a youth hostel and makes use of its amenities. He wrestles with 
the Wi-Fi (“all lower case?”) and regales fellow guests with his motivational 
spiel: “The key thing in life is to be humble. Just be little: that way you 
have nowhere to fall”.

“Up until recently, I had absolutely no idea why people used to mention 
hostels to me and smile. It was truly an unsolved mystery to me,” Eubank said 
in a statement.

“Youth Hostelling with Chris Eubank has now become a reality and finally, 
albeit a little embarrassed and ashamed, I’m in on the joke 18 years after Alan 
Partridge pitched it!”
