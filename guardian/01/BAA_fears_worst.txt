BAA, the airports operator, last night was preparing for a further slump in 
passenger numbers after the crash of the American Airlines jet in New York.

The company, which operates seven British airports, including Heathrow - left 
- and has commercial interests in three US terminals, yesterday reported a 31% 
dive in transatlantic traffic following the September 11 attacks.

BAA shares plunged 5% in the immediate aftermath of the latest tragedy, with 
the City saying it would further undermine public confidence.

BAA operates Indiannapolis airport as well as the retail management of Boston 
and Pittsburg terminals in the US, along with its control of Heathrow, Gatwick 
and other British hubs.

Overall passenger numbers at the seven UK airports fell 12% in October over 
the corresponding month a year ago.

Passenger volumes through Heathrow - the world's busiest international airport 
- fell 20% last month while Gatwick saw a 13% slump and cargo business across 
British airports fell by 15%.

The position has been made worse by global economic slowdown. 

BAA shares ended the day down 28p at 564p.
