Ted Jeory, the Express group's digital director, was frogmarched out of a 
Tower Hamlets council meeting on Wednesday evening after telling a senior 
council officer he was "acting like a prick".

Jeory, who is a regular blogger and tweeter about the east London borough, 
later tweeted about the incident: <https://twitter.com/TedJeory> "I regret 
using the five letter term of abuse to Takki Sulaiman. I wish I'd used just 
four letters."

Sulaiman is the council's head of communications and the pair have a history, 
as Jeory points out in his blog <http://trialbyjeory.wordpress.com/>: "He 
dislikes my journalism and I dislike his attitude to press freedom."

Their argument erupted when Jeory was told he could not sit in the seats 
reserved for the press, several of which had been taken by members of the 
public.

Although this could be seen as little more than a local spat, it draws 
attention to the parlous state of affairs within Tower Hamlets and does have 
wider press freedom implications.

It is time for the government to take a much closer look at the borough, which 
continues to publish a weekly newspaper,East End Life 
<http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/news/east_end_life.aspx>, in defiance of the 
law.

That publication has had a marked effect on the sales of the commercial paper 
that has served the area since the 19th century, theEast London Advertiser 
<http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/home>. Jeory was its deputy editor 
before moving to the Sunday Express.

The Life, which is distributed free to 83,500 households in Tower Hamlets, is 
a classic example of what communities minister,Eric Pickles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eric-pickles>, calls a "town hall Pravda."

In recent years, the circulation of the Advertiser - published by Archant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/archant> - has fallen dramatically, down to 
little more than 6,000 a week, a sales fall that exceeds the overall decline 
for local newspapers across Britain.

Bloggers like Jeory have stepped in to ensure that the council, one of the 
most controversial in the country, is being held to account.

As Jeory told the London Evening Standard: 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/transparency-fears-raised-in-tower-hamlets-after-journalist-evicted-from-council-meeting-9530604.html?origin=internalSearch>
 "I've been reporting on those meetings for nine years now. I go there, I tweet 
live, thousands of people follow it. It's almost like a big event, and it's 
good for transparency."

What is not so transparent is what Pickles is doing to enforce the law aimed 
at preventing councils from publishing weekly newspapers.

In mid-April, as I reported, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/apr/17/eric-pickles-council-run-newspapers>
 Pickles sent letters to five London councils, including Tower Hamlets, giving 
them a two-week ultimatum to explain why they should not face legal action.

Meanwhile, the government is holding an investigation into Tower Hamlets 
council followingallegations by BBC's Panorama in March  
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-26716862>that the administration 
led by the mayor, Lutfur Rahman, sought to gain votes with favourable grants to 
Bangladeshi and Somali-led organisations.
