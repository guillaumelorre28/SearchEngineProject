Langan was appointed creative director of the BBC’s feature film-making arm in 
2009 after a string of successes at Granada (including a production credit on 
the Oscar-winning 2006 drama The Queen), and a stint as production executive at 
BBC Films on the likes of The Other Boleyn Girl and The Duchess. Her tenure as 
head ofBBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> Films saw multiple 
award-winning films go into production, including My Week With Marilyn, An 
Education, and – in collaboration with Baby Cow – Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa.

Baby Cow was set up in 1999 by Coogan and Normal, and initially concentrated 
on TV, before the company moved into film in 2001 with The Parole Officer and 
the Michael Winterbottom-directed 24 Hour Party People, in both of which Coogan 
had the lead role. Another Coogan vehicle, Philomena, became an awards magnet 
and international commercial success in 2013. BBC Worldwide boughta 25% stake 
in the company in 2008

, a shareholding which hasincreased to 73%

The BBC have yet to officially confirm the story, stating that Baby Cow and 
BBC Worldwide have yet to complete their search for a new CEO for the 
business.” However,according to Screen

may leave the BBC post in October.
