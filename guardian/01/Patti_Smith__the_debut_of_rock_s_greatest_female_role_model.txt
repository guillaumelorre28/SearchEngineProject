Patti Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/music/patti-smith> had left a factory 
job to work in bookshops, act in plays and dream of transcendence. Piss 
Factory, the B-side to her debut single, Hey Joe, offered that transcendence. 
Channelling the Beat poets and tapping into the disgust that would climax as 
punk, Smith made riveting rock'n'roll out of a poem about the dehumanising 
effects of piece work and the desireÂ for escape.
