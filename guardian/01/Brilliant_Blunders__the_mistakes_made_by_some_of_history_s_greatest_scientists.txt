No one should be in any doubt that scientists can blunder, just like anyone 
else.


Many doctoral theses have lost a crucial, un-backed-up section due to 
late-night fat fingers. InSmashing Physics

 I wrote about the first, abortive attempt to start up the Large Hadron 
Collider in 2008 – not to mention a proton decay experiment that accidentally 
siphoned a cesspit into its (previously) clean detector volume.


None of those are especially productive mistakes – though sometimes the 
rewritten thesis can be an improvement, and we did do some useful work while 
the LHC was repaired. In any case, blunders are an inevitable, integral part of 
the scientific process, as Mario Livio will argue in this public lecture this 
evening. He will describe some notable mistakes of famous scientists, and 
attempt to explain how they happen.
