Until the Rolling Stones' 1969 US tour, the loudest thing at big-capacity 
shows was often the crowd, as anyone who's heard the long-deleted Beatles at 
the Hollywood Bowl LP knows. In fact, a key reason for the Beatles' decision to 
stop touring in 1966 was their frustration at being unable to hear themselves 
on stage, because of the inadequate amplification. So when the Stones announced 
their first jaunt round the States since 1966, they decided to do it properly. 
Chip Monck was commissioned to come up with a lighting and sound system that 
would allow the Stones to be seen and heard in the biggest arenas; the Stones' 
management was ruthless in securing the best possible contracts from promoters. 
The combination of front-of-house excellence and behind the scenes savvy took 
the business of touring to an entirely new level, and turned it into a much 
better experience for the fans. Visitors to the O2 benefit from theÂ Stones' 
breakthroughs.
