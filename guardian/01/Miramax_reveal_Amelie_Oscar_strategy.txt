Miramax is pinning next year's Oscar hopes on Amelie, the feel-good French 
film. The film company, which won two Oscars for Roberto Benigni's Life Is 
Beautiful, is hoping thatAmelie <https://www.theguardian.com/film/amelie> can 
replicate that success.

"Let's just say we are taking the same strategy as we did on Life is 
Beautiful," Mark Gill, president of Miramax LA told Screendaily. "We're opening 
in New York and Los Angeles and then widening slowly to the top 10 cities and 
then the top 20 cities. Like Life is Beautiful, we are prepared to add more 
screens and even take TV advertising, which we did in the fifth week on that 
film. We're tied in with French businesses in the US."

Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film reportedly cost Miramax $1m (£670,000) for North 
American rights. However, it has become one of France's all time box office 
hits and taken $61m (£41m) worldwide. Now Miramax are said to be pushing for 
Oscar nominations in not just the foreign film category but for best actress 
(for Audrey Tatou) cinematography, editing, music and director. Screen Daily 
reports that Miramax are probably smarting at missing out on last year's huge 
foreign language success, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
