What Was Happening

Compact glare of a match flame in daylight

and the waiter's dark hand still
as an ornament, the flame an upright leaf
tending to Jenkins as he sucked his cigarette alight,
because the train had slowed.
He wished it wouldn't slow, not
among the lion-coloured slums
with their cattery stink.
He could see people posting themselves,
third class, into the train windows or dropping
carefully onto wide, unfeeling feet.

The waiter waved out the flame.

Can I get you a drink, sir? Sun's over the yard arm. 

The waiter stood in the cylinder of his white shift, understanding or not.The 
train bucked, gathering speed. He levelled himself naturally as a glass of 
water.
Jenkins blew smoke towards him. 

Also there is an Englishman, English boy,
sir, on the train with ... other people.
Really? Who?
I don't know name, sir.
Well, tell him to come and see me,
and the answer is yes, bring me a drink.
