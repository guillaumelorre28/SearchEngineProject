I love the simplicity of this dish. If you can't get hold of broad beans, use 
peas instead – or mix it up a bit with both. There are plenty of sources for 
sustainable cod these days, but pollack works nicely in this recipe too.

(Serves four)
50ml olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
50g salami, finely chopped
300g broad beans, cooked
4 cod fillets, around 120g each
1 bunch mint, torn
Half a lemon, juiced and rind grated

Put a dash of oil in a pan, add the onion and saute until soft.

Add the salami and broad beans, remove from the heat and leave to one side.

Put a dash of oil into another pan on a medium heat.

Season the cod fillets, put in the pan skin-side down, and cook for around 
four minutes (if the fillets are thick, check they're cooked through the middle 
after this time).

Add the mint to the bean, onion and salami mix, reheat and lightly crush the 
beans.

Serve with the fish and finish with the lemon and a drizzle of olive oil.
