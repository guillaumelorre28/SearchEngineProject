London shares slumped in the minutes after this afternoon's crash of an 
American Airlines jet in Queens, one of New York's five boroughs.

At 14.37pm, the FTSE 100 Index was down 178.9 points at 5065.3, after being 
down around 30 points at lunchtime. The index recovered to close down 98 points 
or 1.9% after the authorities said there was no sign of terrorism.

In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average also tumbled, falling 171.67 
points at 14.38pm to 9436.33.

Shares in airline stocks were impacted heavily, with British Airways falling 
13% and airports operator BAA down 5%.

Experts said trading was highly volatile as investors scrambled to sell shares 
in their concern about the repercussions of the crash.

Tom Hougaard, trader at bookies Financial Spreads, said: "It is complete 
volatility [on the markets].

"Is it new terrorism or a plane crash? Has the terror campaign started again? 
There is volatility all over the place. People are worried sick and want to get 
out of their positions at any price - they just want to get out of their 
investments."

The share slide brings back memories of the stock market falls seen on 
September 11, when the FTSE 100 Index saw Â£67bn wiped off share prices, closing 
at 4746 - down 287.7 points on the day.

Despite falling further since that date to touch lows of around the 4,430 
mark, for the last month the Footsie has managed to close above 5,000.

By mid-afternoon today, the Footsie pulled back from its initial 178-point 
fall, and at 3.15pm was less than 100 points down at 5145.8.

As well as airline stocks being affected, aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce was 
down 6%, while insurer Prudential was off 4%.
