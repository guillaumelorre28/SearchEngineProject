Rioting flared last night in north Armagh, Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland>, just hours after a three man 
republican dissident gang from the area were jailed for 15 years over a plot to 
kill police officers.

A lorry and van were hijacked during disturbances in Lurgan which at one 
staged caused disruption to the Belfast-Dublin rail line.

Trouble erupted on the republican Kilwilkie Estate where the van was hijacked 
and left burning on the railway track.

SDLP assembly member Dolores Kelly said there had been reports of armed and 
masked men in parts of the town and that the violence was "futile".

"The trouble was anticipated by both police and the community given the 
sentencing of three men for dissident crimes earlier," she said.

Kelly added: "It is very serious and highly organised, with stockpiling of 
petrol since yesterday, and we are getting reports of more hijackings and armed 
and masked men being seen in parts of the town.

"But my main concern is for the young people who are getting caught up in 
rioting. I would ask them to reflect on what is happening here.

"Tonight three young men are beginning long prison sentences to absolutely no 
purpose whatsoever."

Public transport company Translink said rail services had been disrupted 
between Lisburn and Portadown.

A few hours earlier a Belfast court sentenced three Lurgan men for 15 years 
over a mortar bomb plot to kill police officers earlier this year.

Damien McKenna, 26, Gary Toman, 24, and Sean McConville, 23, pleaded guilty. 
The police said they believed the men were members of the Continuity IRA. They 
had been under surveillance by members of an Army special forces unit.
