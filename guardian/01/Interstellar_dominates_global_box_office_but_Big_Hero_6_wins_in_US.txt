The canvas for Christopher Nolan’s three-hour intergalactic drama stretches to 
distant galaxies accessible only through wormholes. So it’s fitting that the 
film comprehensively dominated the global box office on its weekend of release, 
with a $132m haul.

Along with the $50m scored in the US, the film took $14m in Korea, $8m in the 
UK and $8m in Russia. The film has not yet opened in Japan and China, which 
should boost sales on the third week of release.


But in America, Disney’s latest, Big Hero 6 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/big-hero-6>, won the battle for box office 
supremacy, taking $56m on its first week of release, and emulating the success 
of recent mouse house hits Frozen and Wreck-It Ralph.

Both Interstellar <https://www.theguardian.com/film/interstellar> and Big Hero 
6 cost around $165m, and both seem to have succeeded in the same weekend by 
targeting different markets, with 25s and over accounting for 75% of 
Interstellar’s sales, while 36% of Big Hero 6’s crowd was under 12.

Meanwhile, Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-theory-of-everything>, starring Eddie 
Redmayne, took a $41k screen average across five locations in New York, Los 
Angeles and Toronto, and Edward Snowden documentary Citizenfour won a $3,523 
screen average.
