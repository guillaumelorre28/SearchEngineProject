The Sun on Sunday <https://www.theguardian.com/media/sun-on-sunday> 
experienced a significant boost in circulation in May, driven largely by 
increases in bulk sales of discounted copies and increased distribution outside 
the UK.

The Murdoch-owned paper recorded a 2.6% increase overall, with multiple copy 
sales accounting for the largest part of the increase, 31,000 copies, supported 
by an additional 10,000 copies sold overseas.

The Mail on Sunday <https://www.theguardian.com/media/mailonsunday> also added 
an additional 10,000 copies to its distribution outside the UK, however that 
failed to stop the title recording an overall 1.7% fall in circulation, 
according to the latest monthly figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations.

Meanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/sunday-telegraph> posted a small increase of 
under 0.1%, with an 867 copy increase in overseas sales being the largest 
contributor to it staying out of negative.

The Sunday Times and Observer were the biggest Sunday fallers, both down by 
around 2.5%.

Daily newspapers fared less well, with all paid titles, except the Sun, Times, 
Financial Times and i, posting declines.

The Times continues to maintain a small growth in circulation, up 0.3% in May, 
through increases in discounted multiple copy sales.
