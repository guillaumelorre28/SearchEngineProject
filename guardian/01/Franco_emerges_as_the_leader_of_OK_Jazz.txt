Born in a village in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
François Luambo Luanzo Makiadi became known throughout Africa simply as Franco 
– or by his nickname, the "Sorcerer of the Guitar". In 1960, he emerged as the 
leader of OKJazz <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> when singer Vicky 
Longomba left the band, and he stayed at its helm through several metamorphoses 
until his death aged 51 in 1989. By then, soukous as it was known, was the 
sound of the continent, and state radio played nothing but his songs for four 
days.
