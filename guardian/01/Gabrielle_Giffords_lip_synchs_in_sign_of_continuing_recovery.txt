The US congresswoman shot in the head in Arizona has demonstrated her 
continuing recovery by lip-synching to songs and phoning the International 
Space Station.

Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot during a public meeting in Tucson

 on 8 January, was able to mouth along to Happy Birthday to You and Twinkle, 
Twinkle Little Star, according to reports, as she works to regain her speech.

Six people were killed and 13 wounded – Giffords included – as the Democratic 
congresswoman met constituents outside a grocery store.

She began intensive rehabilitation at TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston late 
last month, her programme including squats and repetitive movements as well as 
speaking exercises.

"We tell her everything that's going on," her chief of staff, Pia Carusone, 
told the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/us/14giffords.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&hp>. 
"Don't get the idea she's speaking in paragraphs, but she definitely 
understands what we're saying and she's verbalising."

Carusone said that Giffords had spoken by telephone to her brother-in-law 
Scott Kelly, who is aboard the International Space Station.

"She said, 'Hi, I'm good,'" Carusone said.

Rehabilitation specialists say brain injury patients who regain speech 
typically begin to do so about four to six weeks after the trauma.

"It's not like she's speaking the way she spoke, but she is vocalising and 
making progress every day," Carusone added.

"She's working very hard. She's determined. It's a tight schedule. A copy of 
it is hanging on her door."

Aides have been conducting bedside briefings, telling Giffords about the 
recent uprising in Egypt, and the decision by the Republican senator of Arizona 
Jon Kyl not to seek re-election.

A friend helping Giffords with her rehabilitation recorded a video of her 
mouthing the words to Happy Birthday to You as a surprise for her husband, the 
New York Times said.

The suspected gunman, Jared Loughner, pleaded not guilty

 to three attempted murder charges on 25 January.
