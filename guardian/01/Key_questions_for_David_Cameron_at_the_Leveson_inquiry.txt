• Why did you hire Andy Coulson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/andy-coulson> given that you knew phone 
hacking had happened during his time as editor of the News of the World?

• Why, despite mounting evidence of the scale of phone hacking at the News of 
the World reported by the Guardian in July 2009 and New York Times in September 
2010, did you not seek independent assurances that Coulson did not know about 
criminality at the paper?

• Why was Coulson not put through the highest level of "developed vetting" 
security clearance when he joined No 10? Did you fear he would fail given the 
furore around the phone-hacking scandal?

• Rebekah Brooks claims you texted one another on a weekly basis. Did you text 
other newspaper executives as frequently? Did you sign those texts LOL?

• Given that you knew Jeremy Hunt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt> believed the UK media sector 
would "suffer for years" if the BSkyB takeover was not approved and it would be 
"totally wrong to cave in" to opponents of the bid, why did you choose him to 
replace Vince Cable?

• Can you describe your conversation with Rupert Murdoch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/rupert-murdoch> at the George club in London 
on 10 September 2009 at which he confirmed the Sun would back the Conservatives 
at the election?
