It sold 30m copies worldwide, scooped four Grammys and made Alanis Morissette 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/alanis-morissette> one of the 
fastest-selling female artists of the 90s, but music history hasn’t been too 
kind to Jagged Little Pill, reducing the album to a punchline for jokes about 
women making music. Twenty years after its release, we find out what young 
female musicians make of its legacy.

I must have been 12 when my best friend Hannah bought it for me on cassette – 
I’d never heard of her. I think I was quite taken aback when I first heard it, 
because it wasn’t what I was expecting; it was like, “Oh my God, I’ve found 
grown-up music.” I remember asking my mum what a 69 [as in the lyrics ofRight 
Through You <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk_cvERwBJk>] was – she didn’t 
tell me, but it became a staple household album that we listened to in the car 
all the time. We were obsessed.

At the time, she was just this woman – not this girl – she was this woman 
playing electric guitar, really wailing and not trying to be sexy. Her lyrics 
had real integrity; she’s singing about stuff that really matters and there are 
real stories in there. I remember loads of guys at the time and since have 
said, “I hate that album, she’s really angry.” Men somehow can’t accept that in 
a woman, [but] it’s perfectly acceptable if you’reRage Against the Machine 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWXazVhlyxQ>. I remember thinking, “I don’t 
care, because she’s doing it and she’s really cool.”

As a strong female role model, she was important and encouraging. It was the 
soundtrack to a particular summer when [my sisters and I] binged on Alanis. It 
was great to sing along to. There are a lot of harmonies to those songs.

Jagged Little Pill was my first record. My dad bought it for me on tape. 
Listening to it again in my 20s, it has been hugely inspirational in 
cultivating confidence to “tell it like it is”; she is very unabashed in what 
she wants to say. I’ve never had to defend loving Alanis. I never knew it was 
uncool. Alanis is raw, she’s vulnerable, and her voice is extremely powerful 
and emotional. When I listen to Jagged Little Pill, it instills in me the 
desire to share what I’ve experienced. She remains one of my favourite female 
artists.

When I first heard All I Really Want 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLHvb9V8Yzs> blaring behind the closed door of 
my sister’s bedroom, it was 1995 and I was eight years old. My mother had 
consulted other parents about whether or not the subject matter of JLP was 
appropriate for an eight-year-old. The answer was obvious, so she drove to Port 
Hawkesbury, Cape Breton and picked up two other records at Walmart (the only 
place to acquire CDs): Celine Dion’s Falling Into You and Let’s Talk About Love.

Learning Celtic music and only hearing a narrow selection of male 
singer-songwriters, Alanis was an alien. Every word, yodel and yarble was 
memorised and mimicked. The artwork was mysterious enough that I needed to know 
more about this woman. With no internet or access to music videos on 
television, I knew the only way to see Alanis was to stay up late to watch her 
perform on the Juno awards. There she was, with what looked like wet hair, 
black leather pants and an oversized men’s white collared shirt, belting 
Ironic. Soon after, I began parting my hair in the middle and unbuttoning the 
wrists of whatever Oxford shirts I owned. By the time the Spice Girls became a 
sensation in Canada, I wanted nothing to do with them.

 Shura, AKA Aleksandra Denton. 
As a teenage girl learning to play the guitar, JLP was incredibly exciting. It 
wasn’t necessarily that I had never heard a sound like it, it was more that it 
was exciting to see a woman rock out – that there was more than just the Spice 
Girls.

There was almost certainly a time where I wouldn’t admit to having it in my 
record collection. But as you get older I think you care a hell of a lot less 
what people think. It took me a long time to get to that stage, but to say 
someone is an angry woman as a critique of music is kind of ridiculous. What 
does that even mean? Why can’t you be angry? Why does it matter if you are a 
woman?
