"We changed up our style, we went rock'n'roll," George Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/georgeclinton> said of his band Funkadelic, 
whose third album, Maggot Brain, boasted heavy metal vamps alongside gospelised 
pleas for harmony. Maggot Brain was furious, joyful, messed-up revolutionary 
music, although Clinton was a reluctant spokesperson for any kind of movement, 
claiming "I ain't no guru, I'm just looking for some drugs and some pussy!"
