The British Boxing Board of Control wants to see both Audley Harrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/audley-harrison> and David Haye about their 
world heavyweight fight at the MEN Arena in Manchester last month

The board said it has "called Audley Harrison to appear at a date and venue to 
be confirmed to discuss his performance in the contest against David Haye".

Harrison could have some of his Â£1m purse docked for a display that was at 
best below par while the board is concerned by suggestions that Haye may have 
laid a wager on the outcome of the defence of his world title.

Haye's manager, Adam Booth, said they had no problem going to the board to 
answer any questions. "David said something in the heat of the moment straight 
after the fight," he told the Daily Express. "We know and David knows he has 
done absolutely nothing wrong."
