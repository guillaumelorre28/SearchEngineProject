It’s been a presidential campaign which has seen the music world taking sides 
– with Loretta Lynn, Kid Rock anda crotch-grabbing Ted Nugent

 endorsing Donald Trump, and pretty much every other musician who expressed a 
view throwing their weight behind either Bernie Sanders or the eventual 
Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.

Madonna has been one of the most vociferous Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> supporters, and announced 
on Instagram that on Monday night she would play an “intimate very small 
acoustic concert” somewhere in Brooklyn for Clinton. Further details have not 
been released.

In another recent post, Madonna <https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna> 
declared: “If Trump were elected we would be at war in no time at all. The 
whole world is laughing at us right now. I can only imagine what Trump writes 
in his emails. Wait - can he even write?? Wake up people this is not a reality 
show. I appreciate his charm and entertainment value but he is not qualified to 
be a head of state!”

This is not Madonna’s first intervention in a US presidential election. In 
1990 she made a video encouraging fans to vote, dressed in lingerie while 
wrapped in the stars and stripes.

Meanwhile, in a more ambiguous contribution, Aphex Twin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aphex-twin> also commented on the US 
election with a video to promote his first appearance in the country in over 
eight years, at Houston’s Day for Night festival.

Made by the company Weirdcore <http://weirdcore.tv/>, which has made visuals 
for musicians ranging from Miley Cyrus to Radiohead, and “approved” by the 
Cornish electronic music titan, the video incorporates sped-up footage from the 
presidential debates – including Trump’s notorious line “such a nasty woman” – 
the candidates’ faces folded up in Aphex Twin’s signature visual style. It ends 
with computerised footage of Aphex Twin-branded bombs falling on Houston.

Meanwhile, Trump has continued to attack Jay Z and Beyoncé after they 
performed for Hillary Clinton at a rally in Cleveland on Friday. On Monday in 
Florida,the Republican candidate said 
<http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/07/donald-trump-slams-jay-z-and-beyonce-language>
: “The language is so bad. As they were singing? Singing, right? Talking? Was 
it talking or singing? I don’t know. But the language – by both – but the 
language was so bad, that many of the people left. By the time Hillary got up, 
there was nobody there.”

Trump added: “Isn’t it amazing that when Jay Z 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/jayz> and Beyonce use the filthy language 
they use in the songs – using words that if I ever said those words, it would 
be the reinstitution of the electric chair, right? They use these words, and 
then she comes on and hugs them, like everything is right. And yet with me, 
‘He’s very lewd.’”
