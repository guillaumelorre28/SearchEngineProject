Jimi Hendrix <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jimi-hendrix> didn't just have 
a British manager, bassist and drummer to thank for helping to focus his 
extraordinary but wayward talent. There was also Brad Plunkett of Vox – a 
company formed in Dartford, Kent – who invented the wah-wah pedal that was all 
over the Experience's records (and many other late 60s classics). Switching 
from mellow to sharp with the twitch of a toe, it became psychedelia's 
non-psychotropic aid.
