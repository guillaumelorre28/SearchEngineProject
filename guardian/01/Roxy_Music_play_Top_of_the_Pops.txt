There had never been anything quite like Roxy Music on Top of the Pops before, 
as the audience's reaction to their debut performance attested. Much of 
Virginia Plain's weirdness emanated from a small wooden box with dials played 
by an androgynous character wearing silver gloves. Thus, Brian Eno introduced 
electronic music to the mainstream. From this memorable beginning,Roxy Music 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/roxymusic> went on to be one of the most 
influential bands ever.
