Ashley Tabor is the most powerful person in UK commercial radio, head of 
Global Radio <https://www.theguardian.com/media/globalradio> which owns Classic 
FM, Capital, Heart and London talk station LBC.

But Tabor, who also has a talent and music publishing business including boy 
band the Wanted, suffered a blow in May when the Competition Commission 
rejected large parts of its £70m acquisition of GMG Radio,ordering the sell-off 
of stations in seven areas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/may/21/global-radio-ordered-sell-seven-stations>
 (a decision which Globalhas appealed against 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/14/global-radio-appeals-sell-off-gmg>
).

This deal ended the consolidation Tabor began with the £545m dual purchase of 
GCap Media and Chrysalis Radio completed in 2008, bankrolled by his father, the 
multimillionaire racehorse owner, Michael Tabor.

Tabor axed dozens of local heritage station names with his rollout of the 
Capital and Heart brands, and presides over the biggest commercial radio group, 
some way ahead of second-placed Bauer Media.

Former ITV chief executive Charles Allen serves as Global chairman, while 
Tabor's key lieutenants include former Associated Newspapers executive Stephen 
Miron and his director of broadcasting, Richard Park.
