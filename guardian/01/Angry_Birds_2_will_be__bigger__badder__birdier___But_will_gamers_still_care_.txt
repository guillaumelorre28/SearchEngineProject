It may be five years, and countless follow-ups, since the original Angry Birds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/angry-birds> catapulted the casual 
gaming market into the mainstream, but there’s never been a fully fledged 
sequel: until now.

The game’s developer Rovio has tweeted a teaser image for the game, the aptly 
titled Angry Birds 2, including a date – 30 July – and the promise that it will 
be “Bigger. Badder. Birdier”.

30 July is a Thursday – the standard release day for new mobile games – which 
suggests the game will be launched on that date. Rovio isholding media events 
in San Francisco and New York

The original Angry Birds was released in 2009, with its popularity spawning a 
franchise that expanded into toys, sweets, online videos, books, educational 
initiatives and even real-world playgrounds.

Along the way, there have been a host of other Angry Birds mobile games. Some 
followed the bird-slinging gameplay of the original, including Angry Birds Rio, 
Angry Birds Seasons and Angry Birds Stella, as well as two Angry Birds Star 
Wars games.

There have also been expansions into other gameplay forms: Angry Birds Go! 
offered kart racing; Angry Birds Transformers was an action game; Angry Birds 
Epic an RPG adventure; and Angry Birds Fight! and Angry Birds Pop! were 
match-three puzzle games.

Along the way, however, there have been significant challenges, as Rovio tried 
to adapt to the growing dominance of “free to play” games on mobile devices, 
which made their money from in-app purchases of virtual items and currency.

All of Rovio’s recent games have been free-to-play, yet the company has 
struggled to break into the upper reaches of the app stores to compete with 
lucrative games like Clash of Clans and Candy Crush Saga.

At the time of writing, for example, Angry Birds Pop! is the only Rovio game 
in the200 top-grossing games in Apple’s US App Store iPhone chart 
<http://appshopper.com/bestsellers/gros/?device=iphone> – and it’s in 124th 
place.

Rovio’s financial results 
<http://www.rovio.com/en/news/press-releases/495/rovio-entertainment-reports-2013-financial-results/2014>
 reflect its battle to make money in a free-to-play world. The company saw its 
annual revenues rise from €6.5m in 2010 to €75.6m in 2011, and then €152.2m in 
2012.In 2013, they flattened out to €156m 
<http://www.rovio.com/en/news/press-releases/495/rovio-entertainment-reports-2013-financial-results/2014>
, although the company later restated them as €173.5m. Then, in 2014,Rovio’s 
annual revenues fell to €158.3m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/19/angry-birds-revenues-2014-rovio>
.

By comparison, fellow Finnish firm Supercell, which publishes the Clash of 
Clans, Hay Day and Boom Beach games,reported annual revenues of €1.55bn in 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/24/clash-of-clans-supercell-revenues-2014>
 – nearly 10 times Rovio’s.

At the franchise’s peak in late 2012, Angry Birds games were played by more 
than 263 million monthly active users 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/apr/03/angry-birds-rovio-financials-2012>
, but that totalfell to 200 million by September 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/30/angry-birds-players-200m-rovio>
. The company has not updated that total since publicly, although it has said 
thatits games were downloaded 600m times in 2014 
<http://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/60975/rovio-sees-2014-sales-drop-9-percent/>.

In October 2014, Rovio announced plans to lay off 16% of its staff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/angry-birds-rovio-layoffs-growth>
, and admitted that “we have been building our team on assumptions of faster 
growth than have materialised”. Chief executive Mikael Hed stepped down, and 
was replaced by former Nokia marketing executive Pekka Rantala.

Angry Birds 2 is a hugely important game for Rovio, then. Not least because 
the company is continuing to work on the Angry Birds film, which is due for 
release in 2016.

If the new game is a success, it will build anticipation for the film – as 
will one of Rovio’s bright spots, the ToonsTV online video network, which 
launched in March 2013 andreached 4bn views by the end of 2014 
<http://www.rovio.com/en/news/press-releases/597/toonstv-reaches-4-billion-views>
.

With 200 million active players, €156m of annual revenues and a growing 
presence in the fast-moving world of online children’s video, Rovio is far from 
an also-ran in the mobile entertainment space. But Angry Birds 2’s success will 
be a key pointer to the company’s future trajectory.
