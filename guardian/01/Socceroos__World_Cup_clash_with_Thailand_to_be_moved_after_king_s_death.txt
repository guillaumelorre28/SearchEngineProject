Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> were set to play 
their final fixture of the year at Bangkok’s Rajamangala National Stadium on 15 
November (16 November AEDT).

But this week’s passing of 88-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world’s 
longest-reigning monarch, has plunged Thailand into a state of grief.

In addition to a year of mourning, the government has ruled entertainment will 
be heavily toned down and “festivities” avoided for 30 days.

While the Socceroos match falls just outside that window, the Football 
Association of Thailand (FAT) has submitted a formal request to the AFC and 
FIFA that the match be shifted to an alternate venue outside the country.

The FAT has also cancelled all remaining domestic fixtures, including the Thai 
League and League One.

The most likely outcome is that the game will be shifted to a neutral venue 
somewhere else in southest Asia such as Kuala Lumpur or Singapore.

The AFC and FIFA could also suggest the match be played somewhere in 
Australia, in a straight swap that would see the Socceroos visit Thailand next 
year instead.

However, that would be a highly unlikely proposition given the logistics FFA 
would face in tying down a free venue at such short notice.

The Socceroos’ 1-1 draw with Japan this week has seen Ange Postecoglou’s team 
slip to second in their final-phase qualifying group for Russia 2018, two 
points behind new leaders Saudi Arabia.
