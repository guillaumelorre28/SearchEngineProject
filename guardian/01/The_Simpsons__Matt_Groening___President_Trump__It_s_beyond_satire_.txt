Earlier this year I was invited to be part of Graphic 
<http://graphic.sydneyoperahouse.com>, an event at the Sydney Opera House that 
describes itself as “a festival of visual storytelling”. On discovering that 
Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons and the most successful cartoonist in 
history, would also be in attendance, I said yes straight away.

My acceptance came with a condition: that I would also be invited to the fancy 
party they would no doubt throw for Matt Groening, because I planned to hide in 
a corner and tweet about how I was at a party with Matt Groening.

Later, we received an email from the festival people: 

“Mr Groening has agreed to do an interview for the Guardian, however he has 
only agreed to this interview if Mr Dog is to be the interviewer and write the 
piece … Matt told me what a huge fan he is of First Dog. They’ll have a great 
time.”

There are two challenges in doing an interview like this. Firstly, as a 
cartoonist, I’m not an interviewer. And secondly, how do I make this interview 
about Matt Groening when all I want to do is talk to him about how MY NEW BEST 
FRIEND MATT GROENING IS A BIG FAN OF MY WORK?!


Let’s get that part out of the way first.

First Dog: Obviously I have to ask this, but why did you want to talk to me?

Matt Groening: I just checked you out, I love your cartoons … You made me want 
to come out of retirement – your stuff is really inspiring, I like it a lot.

 First Dog freaking out 
(Has actual myocardial infarction, calls ambulance) Thank you very much indeed 
– I am just going to be speechless for a moment. It’s a real honour that not 
only have you read my cartoons, but you also like them.

No, I really like them. You know, I drew my comic strip Life in Hell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/22/arts.books> for 32 years and, 
uh, then I got fired by too many papers and I stopped … But yeah, I miss it, 
and I like what you do. A lot.

I know you’re hugely busy, but surely if you want to draw Life in Hell again 
you can just do it and tell people they have to print it.

Well, you know, we just finished our 600th episode of The Simpsons a week ago, 
and animation doesn’t get any easier – it’s amazing how much sustained 
attention it requires. And maybe I’m kidding myself, but I like to think that 
my scrutiny makes a difference.

So how hands-on are you with The Simpsons?


I work on it full time. What’s great about being in my position is I get to 
show up whenever I want to and sit in, mostly with the writers, and just pitch 
jokes along with the rest of them.

Do you work in animation?

Not really. I would like to, but as you pointed out it is very time consuming.

I actually get a good night’s sleep these days … We’re pretty confident that 
we can deliver the jokes

Very time consuming, and the best thing to do is get other people to do the 
hard work. It needs sustained attention; it’s amazing how wrong things can go 
in animation. Whenever I see a piece of animation, a TV show or movie that 
doesn’t work, I feel so bad, because I know how many tears and how many drops 
of blood went into that, into those projects. And you can’t always get the tone 
right – that’s the hardest part. It’s a painful process.

When you get to work with a group of people who are incredible collaborators, 
then it’s a little more relaxing. Back at the beginning of The Simpsons, I used 
to go home after working until the middle of the night and still not be able to 
sleep, because I was so worried about the problems that we were going to be 
facing the next day. I actually get a good night’s sleep these days, so that’s 
pretty good. And we’re pretty confident that we can deliver the jokes.

By the way, I’m really looking forward to coming to Australia because – just 
based on fan mail and occasional encounters with Australians – it seems like 
the country where The Simpsons has the most fanatical fans. They just really 
really dig it, and it makes me really happy because they’re watching the show 
in its original language.

 Australian fans of The Simpsons, by First Dog on the Moon. 
When I hear fans from Brazil or Argentina or wherever, I’m always wondering: 
are they laughing at our jokes, or are they laughing at the Portuguese- or 
Spanish-speaking actors who are dubbing it into another language? You guys are 
getting it unadulterated!

The Australian Simpsons episode, Bart vs Australia 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0778446/>, had a big impact here. I think it was 
partly joy at being recognised in an episode of The Simpsons, but then also 
outrage at everything you probably deliberately got wrong … There’sa campaign 
<https://www.change.org/p/change-the-australian-currency-name-to-dollarydoos> 
to rename our currency “Dollarydoos”.

I am not particularly happy with that [Bart vs Australia] episode ... But 
whatever, that's a long time ago

Well, the feeling at the time was, “We know we can’t get Australia correct, so 
let’s go the other way. Let’s get everything as wrong as possible” – thinking 
that you guys would all understand our idiocy, and realise that it was us being 
intentionally stupid.

 The Simpsons’s Australia episode. 
But you know, I have mixed feelings about it. I am not particularly happy with 
that episode. I wish we’d tried a little bit harder. But whatever, that’s a 
long time ago.

Perhaps you could review it because you’re going to get a lot of questions 
about it when you come here.

OK, I will review it. Is there a single correct observation in the entire 
show? I don’t think so.

I’m not sure there was.

Australia is not the only country that we have upset, by the way. We clearly 
annoyed the minister of tourism in Brazil forthe way we depicted Rio de Janeiro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/apr/09/broadcasting.internationalnews>. 
And then we didan episode for the World Cup in Brazil 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTsEueaIWG8>, and we correctly predicted 
bribery and payoffs and corruption – and we were just making that up too.

And Donald Trump? Were you just being prescient, or did you summon his 
presidential candidacy into being by raising it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/17/simpsons-president-trump-prediction-was-meant-as-warning-to-us>
?

We predicted that he would be president back in 2000 – but [Trump] was of 
course the most absurd placeholder joke name that we could think of at the 
time, and that’s still true. It’s beyond satire.

We did one online piece of animation when Trump announced his candidacy, when 
he was going down the escalator we had Homer actually follow him on the 
escalator and we went into a fantasy of what was happening inside Trump’s hair. 
But we’ve been trying to figure out how to do more and it’s really hard.

If by chance he gets elected, which I doubt highly will happen, I think we’ll 
suddenly be very inspired. Mr Trump’s election, as horrible as it would be, 
would be great for comedy – as comedians always say …

If by chance Trump gets elected, which I doubt highly will happen, I think 
we’ll suddenly be very inspired

One of the things that occurs to me is the sober writing of political history 
is impossible for this election. When historians are writing about this 
election, after all of the other presidents, it’s the worst. Just quoting from 
it would be like a clown show. It’s just the most amazing thing. And I’m 
hopeful that this is just an aberration but I don’t think it will be. There’s a 
certain lack of civility and common sense, a complete exaggeration of name 
calling and triviality [that] is just astounding. And it may be here to stay. 
We shall see.

If Trump wins there will be an exodus of people. I won’t [leave the US] 
because I actually think it will be amazing in all its horror.


You’re coming to Graphic and doing a session on The Simpsons, and also one 
with your friend, the cartoonist and writer Lynda Barry 
<http://graphic.sydneyoperahouse.com/home/matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/>. What 
can we expect from that conversation?

She and I went to college together and we do a tandem talk about growing up 
and how our childhoods were similar and different – and at one point she and I 
read some of my strips [from Life in Hell] together …

As years went by, and I had more things to do, I simplified my style

I was doing strips in which the characters stayed in exactly the same 
positions from frame to frame, and the only thing that changed were their 
expressions and the dialogue. It plays like a very primitive form of animation 
when you see it on the big screen. And it is quite gratifying for me, to read 
these comic strips and get a laugh, you know.


I always thought – and I see this in your stuff too – that you’re holding the 
reader’s eye on the page so that the dialogue [works]. You can’t just go to the 
last frame and get the punchline; you need to be led through the strip. That’s 
one reason why Life in Hell was so dense at the beginning: I was in weekly 
newspapers and I felt I only got a crack at getting people to look at my stuff 
once a week, so I was going to make it so they really had to work at it in 
order to get the joke. And as years went by, and I had more things to do, I 
simplified my style.

And also, man, after doing things a certain way it’s fun to mix it up a little.

That’s Python’s “the tyranny of the punchline 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/oct/03/life1.lifemagazine2>”, 
isn’t it? I often struggle if I have to come up with a punchline, whereas if I 
put 20 sort of vaguely funny jokes into one cartoon and you add them all 
together, it’s actually possibly funnier. Well, that’s one way of working 
anyway.

I agree completely: you make getting there the fun part; you just don’t want 
to let the air out of the tyre for the last frame, that’s all.

A lot of animated cartoons – the great Warner Brother cartoons, Bugs Bunny and 
all those – they’re brilliant. Generally the last gag of the cartoon is a 
complete misfire, but you still go, “That was brilliant.” You know, getting 
there was great.

Although I have to say, for the most part when writing a comic strip I do know 
where I’m going before I start drawing. Occasionally I change my mind along the 
way; as I’m pencilling the strip, I sometimes come up with a better joke at the 
end.

I love pacing and timing and it’s fun – comics are definitely their own 
medium. It’s not animation, it’s not a single panel; you’re capturing time. And 
partly that time is the time it takes to read the dialogue balloons.


Getting back to your stuff – that’s why I like your stuff so much: I like the 
journey, I like the story.

(Grinning like an idiot) Do you have any pets? 

Pets? I have had pets. Right now we have a pet salamander named Ramone. At the 
moment that’s all we have. But we’ll be getting more. Over the years I’ve had 
cats and dogs. I have a house full of kids, I have two 10-month-old twin 
daughters and a three-year-old son as well, so the house is full.

 Ramone, Matt Groening’s pet salamander. Illustration: First Dog on the Moon 
You’re hugely successful, with a back catalogue you can see from outer space, 
but do you ever think it will one day be enough? Bill Watterson [Calvin and 
Hobbes] and Gary Larson [The Far Side] gave it up. Is there a point where you 
just want to say, “I can go and sit on a beach and look at the children and 
talk to my new dog that I’m going to get?”

I could easily stop and have a completely fulfilling life reading books and 
scuba diving and all the rest of that stuff, but I still am having such a blast 
making up stories and working with people – I don’t feel like doing that. It’s 
really fun to make up stories and tell jokes. It’s really an extension of 
child’s play. The same kind of joy I got as a kid, making up worlds and drawing 
dinosaur battles and all the rest, you know? That was a blast. And in a way I 
was able to never leave that behind, I still get to do it. And that’s the fun 
part.

Every joke doesn’t have to be understood by every member of a family

You mention Watterson and Larson – well, first of all they did daily strips, 
or daily cartoons, or whatever you would call Larson’s Far Side. And I think 
that’s just such a grind. I was told a story that Gary Larson had to go on book 
tours and they would set up a drawing table for him in the hotel room after he 
got done with his hours-long book signings. And I thought, that sounds like 
such a nightmare.

We had Gary Larson on The Simpsons playing himself [Once Upon a Time in 
Springfield <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Springfield>] 
and that was amazing. To me he is one of the great legends, and I certainly 
miss Calvin and Hobbes – I think that was one of the best comic strips of all 
time.

Watterson had the skill to make some very dark satire uplifting and hopeful. 
What is the most hopeful or beautiful thing you’ve worked on?

My favourite stuff that I’ve ever done is taking my children’s actual words 
and illustrating them 
<https://www.amazon.com/Will-Abes-Guide-Universe-Groening/dp/B001PO69T6>. I 
have two sons named Will and Abe and when they were younger I recorded their 
conversations, and then I would illustrate it. And it’s the funniest, sweetest 
stuff – it makes me laugh, maybe because my ego is taken out of it.

Yeah, that’s the stuff I love the most. 

The fantastic truth of Calvin and Hobbes

<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/feb/17/fantastic-authenticity-calvin-and-hobbes>
And The Simpsons? The world is a terrible place and essentially the job of a 
cartoonist seems to be finding fault so you can make fun of it. It is a lot 
darker.

Well at The Simpsons, we just try to make sure that whatever the story is, it 
is ultimately a celebration of the family, even if families drive you crazy … 
We’re trying to do a family show in the broadest sense: that there are jokes 
for different members of the family – there are jokes that little kids will 
love and there are jokes that they won’t get at all. And what we figured out a 
long time ago, partly through luck, is that it doesn’t matter. Every joke 
doesn’t have to be understood by every member of a family. As long as you keep 
it moving fast you can have a rude joke that makes a 13-year-old boy laugh, and 
makes the uptight grandparents maybe purse his or her lips a little but not 
leave, or not change the channel.

The end

(There was a lot more; we were only supposed to talk for half an hour but we 
just went on and on.And then he invited me to dinner at his house next time I 
am in the US. No he really did.)
