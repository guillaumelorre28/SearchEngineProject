Rwanda Eco-Tours

The number of mountain gorillas in Rwanda is now in a far healthier state, 
thanks to companies such as Rwanda Eco-Tours which has convinced local 
communities that these magnificent animals are worth more alive than dead. 
Co-run by local Rwandan Edwin Sabuhoro, the company organises guided treks to 
see the gorillas in the heart of theParc National des Volcans 
<http://www.rwandatourism.com/parks.htm>. Gorilla treks range from a one-day 
hike from the base of the Virunga mountains to tours lasting several days that 
include a visit to theDian Fossey Research Station 
<http://www.gorillafund.org/conservation/fieldnews_item.php?recordID=112>.

Tropic: Journeys In Nature, Ecuador

Dubious about the claims made by travel companies promising "authentic" tribal 
tours? Well, Tropic's trips are the genuine article. The Ecuadorian operator 
has pioneered small-scale, sensitively run trips to meet remote nomadic 
hunter-gatherer tribes in the Amazon, including the Huaorani (with whom it has 
helped set up a smalleco-lodge <http://www.huaorani.com/> and 3,000-hectare 
nature reserve), and more recently with the Secoya people in the upper Amazon 
basin.

with the Huaorani, US$600.

Yachana Lodge, Ecuador

Deep in the Ecuadorian jungle, Yachana Lodge is more like a village, and 
guests are encouraged to get involved in the indigenous lifestyle while staying 
in the lap of luxury by the river Napo. Judge Dan Linstead said there is "clear 
evidence of engagement with specific local environmental issues, and smart 
solutions, including reusable 'souvenir' water bottles for tourists." Pride of 
place is Yachana's technical college, educating young, indigenous Amazonians in 
green issues. According to Linstead, the college is "a brilliant 
hearts-and-minds investment in the region's long-term sustainability."

Andaman Discoveries, Thailand

The simplest way to escape the tourist trail and see the real Thailand is to 
stay in a homestay. Andaman Discoveries runs one of the country's 
best-organised programmes, born out of theNorth Andaman Tsunami Relief 
<http://www.northandamantsunamirelief.com/> fund, which places visitors in 
homes on a rotational basis to spread the benefits around villages along the 
Andaman coast. Activities include hiking, mangrove tours and snorkelling before 
returning to your host family in the early evening for freshly caught seafood 
and home-cooked curries.
