Efforts to crush Pakistani militants have further undermined security in 
Afghanistan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan> as growing numbers 
of terrorists have entered the country, the Afghan president said on Wednesday 
at a major regional summit in Islamabad on the future of his country.


Ashraf Ghani <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ashraf-ghani> made the pointed 
comments during a Heart of Asia gathering of more than 31 countries, which was 
also notable for attracting the foreign minister of India – which is also 
deeply distrustful of Pakistan’s relations with militant groups.

The Afghan president said operations against the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan> in the wake of last year’s killing 
of more than 130 schoolchildren in the city of Peshawar had created “unintended 
consequences” and additional security challenges for his country.

He said Afghan special forces had been forced to launch more than 40 
operations against the TTP and that the country was now a hotbed of 
international jihadis. “Al-Qaida, Daesh [Isis] and terrorists from China, 
Russia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, the Middle East are all, unfortunately, present 
on our soil,” he said.

Afghanistan’s enduring security crisis was highlighted once again on the eve 
of Ghani’s arrival in Islamabadwhen dozens were killed during a Taliban attack 
on Kandahar airport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/taliban-attack-kandahar-airport-afghanistan-dozens-dead>
, a major civilian and military hub in the country’s south. The upsurge of 
Taliban attacks in Afghanistan that followed the revelation in late July that 
the movement’s former leader, Mullah Omar,had died more than two years before 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/31/taliban-admit-covering-death-leader-mullah-omar-two-years>
 has proved a major setback to efforts by Ghani to improve ties with Pakistan.

He had hoped, that in return for a series of concessions, Islamabad would use 
its influence to broker talks with Taliban representatives. But the succession 
dispute within the Taliban triggered by news of Omar’s death ensured only one 
such meeting was ever held. The spike in insurgent attacks heaped pressure on 
Ghani not to continueengaging with an eastern neighbour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/08/afghanistan-and-taliban-peace-talks-end-with-promise-to-meet-again>
 many Afghans believe supports the rebels.

Despite the difficulties there were strong hints from officials of a push to 
restart talks with insurgent leaders soon. The US deputy secretary of state, 
Antony Blinken, said the Afghan and Pakistani leaders renewed their commitment 
to an “Afghan owned and Afghan led” process during a meeting with US and 
Chinese diplomats.
Blinken said the first meeting between Afghan officials and authorised Taliban 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban> representatives in the hill town of 
Murree on July 8 had been a “very significant development” and there was a 
“clear desire to return to that process”.
Salahuddin Rabbani, the Afghan foreign minster, said he hoped to see
“positive moves in the coming weeks” on peace talks.

Doubts had persisted until the last few days over whether Ghani and the Indian 
foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj, would attend a diplomatic conference that was 
first held in Turkey in 2011 in a bid to find regional solutions to 
Afghanistan’s security crisis.

But Swaraj’s arrival at Islamabad airport on Tuesday night marked the 
highest-level Indian visitor since 2012 and came amid a long period of frosty 
relations between the two sides.

It was time India <https://www.theguardian.com/world/india> and Pakistan 
displayed “the maturity and self-confidence to do business with each other and 
strengthen regional trade and cooperation”, Swaraj told the conference.
“The entire world is waiting and rooting for a change. Let us not disappoint 
them.”

There have been few high-profile meetings between Pakistani and Indian 
officials after the Indian government made clear it was only prepared to 
discuss terrorism-related issues with Pakistan and not the contested region of 
Kashmir. Aziz Ahmed Khan, a former Pakistani ambassador to both Kabul and New 
Delhi, said there was now a “ray of hope” for improved relations with India.

However, bitter experience meant “you should never be overly enthusiastic 
because you never know where the next stumbling block will come”.

Khan doubted there would be an immediate resumption of Pakistani-brokered 
talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government, saying there now needed to 
be an “intra-Taliban reconciliation process” between the splintered insurgent 
movement.

“Ashraf Ghani probably did have reason to be upset with us so the fact that he 
has come here and everyone has talked at the highest level is something,” he 
said.
