The Guardian's lease on this office has run out, so I must gather my things 
and scram. Please, if you're in LOndon or thereabouts, consider coming over to 
King's Place Dec 8 for "Christmas Without Tears", an annual comedy-music 
variety show Judith Owen and I put on for charity, thjis year benefitting 
Shelter. Guests include Chris Difford from Squeeze, Jacqui Dankworth and 
Charlie Wood, two great nonexistent people (Barry from Watford and Tina C) and 
lots of surprise guests. See you there, or elsewhere. Thanks.

John Schwarzwelder. He wrote many of the best episodes, and he's not around 
any more.

Thank you, and yes, I'm planning a new little Nixon series--not "Little 
Nixon"--based on a recently released series of tapes with him and Kissinger. 
Not funny this time, very dark and chilling and apropos of our era of perpetual 
war.

Firstly, I must have watched Spinal Tap 200 times, so you’re probably due some 
extra royalties from me.

It’s a given that you’re a master with voices, but it took me about 10 years 
to seriously believe that you and the boys were from the US, not Squatney. So, 
the boring question is, when you’re researching a character or role, what kind 
of research and practice regimen do you engage with?

It depends. So many of the characters I play are people that have inhabited my 
mind for a while before I've been able to tackle them, so there's already a lot 
of them inside. But I do make a fairly close study of technical things like, if 
they're real people, how they hold and user their mouth in speaking and how 
their body works.

Loved the sketches you wrote/performed for Saturday Night Live in 1979-80!

Which of those sketches do you look back on most fondly?

Actually, a sketch from my second time at SNL, Men's Synchronized Swimming. 
From the TV Show, probably "The Trial of Adolf Hitler," with Rob playing Hitler.

You are a master voiceover artist. When did you first realise you were good at 
a wide range of voices, and what is your method for coming up with voices for 
characters?

I played around wtih characters as a kid, when they all came out sounding like 
my kid voice. Looking back, I realized that I was training my ear long before I 
could actually recreate those sounds vocally.

there ever be a That Was Spinal Tap reunion movie?

As I stated in a video on YouTube when the suit was filed, Chris, Michael, Rob 
and I were partners in the film, and we deferred much of our salaries in return 
for which we were supposed to be paid a share of the film's profits. "Hollywood 
accounting" then took over.

Favourite Simpsons guest star? Michael Jackson

For me, Michael Jackson. Just kinda...weird. I know that's hard to believe. 
E.g., we were doing the final readthrough before recording, he read all his 
spoken lines, then when it came to the version of "Ben" his character was 
supposed to sing, he sat silent and nodded across the table. Suddenly a white 
guy started singing the lyrics, in an MJ-like voice. I whispered to Yeardley, 
"I guess we paid enough for the talking Michael Jacikson, not for the singing 
Michael Jackson."

The Guardian's lease on this office has run out, so I must gather my things 
and scram. Please, if you're in LOndon or thereabouts, consider coming over to 
King's Place Dec 8 for "Christmas Without Tears", an annual comedy-music 
variety show Judith Owen and I put on for charity, thjis year benefitting 
Shelter. Guests include Chris Difford from Squeeze, Jacqui Dankworth and 
Charlie Wood, two great nonexistent people (Barry from Watford and Tina C) and 
lots of surprise guests. See you there, or elsewhere. Thanks.

Thank you, and yes, I'm planning a new little Nixon series--not "Little 
Nixon"--based on a recently released series of tapes with him and Kissinger. 
Not funny this time, very dark and chilling and apropos of our era of perpetual 
war.

Firstly, I must have watched Spinal Tap 200 times, so you’re probably due some 
extra royalties from me.

It’s a given that you’re a master with voices, but it took me about 10 years 
to seriously believe that you and the boys were from the US, not Squatney. So, 
the boring question is, when you’re researching a character or role, what kind 
of research and practice regimen do you engage with?

It depends. So many of the characters I play are people that have inhabited my 
mind for a while before I've been able to tackle them, so there's already a lot 
of them inside. But I do make a fairly close study of technical things like, if 
they're real people, how they hold and user their mouth in speaking and how 
their body works.

As I stated in a video on YouTube when the suit was filed, Chris, Michael, Rob

for which we were supposed to be paid a share of the film's profits. "Hollywood

For me, Michael Jackson. Just kinda...weird. I know that's hard to believe. 
E.g., we were doing the final readthrough before recording, he read all his 
spoken lines, then when it came to the version of "Ben" his character was 
supposed to sing, he sat silent and nodded across the table. Suddenly a white 
guy started singing the lyrics, in an MJ-like voice. I whispered to Yeardley, 
"I guess we paid enough for the talking Michael Jacikson, not for the singing 
Michael Jackson."
