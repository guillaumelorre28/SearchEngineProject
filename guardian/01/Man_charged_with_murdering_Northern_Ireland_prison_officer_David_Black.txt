A North Armagh man has appeared in court charged with murdering a Northern 
Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> prison officer 
targeted by dissident republican paramilitaries.

Sean McVeigh from Lurgan was also charged with possessing an AKM assault rifle 
with intent to endanger life. The 33-year-old faced the charges in Craigavon, Co
Armagh <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/armagh>, on Wednesday.

His alleged victim, David Black, was the first prison officer murdered by 
paramilitaries in more than 20 years in Northern Ireland. Black, a 52-year-old 
father of two, was caught in a fatal ambush along the M1 on his way to work at 
Maghaberry high-security prison nearBelfast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/belfast> in November 2012.

In court McVeigh nodded to the judge to acknowledge that he understood the 
charges against him. A detective from the Police Service of Northern Ireland 
said he could connect the accused to the charges.

McVeigh's friends and family were reprimanded when they clapped and cheered 
him as he was led away. He will appear in court again via video link while on 
remand in prison on 28 February.
