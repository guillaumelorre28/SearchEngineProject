Gone Girl retained its No 1 position at the US box office over the weekend 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-gone-girl-trumps-740191?mobile_redirect=false>
, with a haul of $26.8m (£16.6m) in its second week.

Starring Ben Affleck <https://www.theguardian.com/film/benaffleck> as a man 
who becomes a murder suspect when his wife (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, David 
Fincher’s thriller dropped just 29% from its impressive opening haul of $38m. 
Benefiting from its status as the most talked-about movie of the autumn, it 
beat out competition from a total of five new movies.

 Ben Affleck talks about Gone Girl 
In second place, with $23.5m on debut, was the dark fantasy Dracula Untold, 
starring Luke Evans in the story of Vlad the Impaler’s transformation into the 
horror icon. Disney family taleAlexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, 
Very Bad Day 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alexander-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day>
 landed in third on opening with $19.1m. Starring Steve Carell, Jennifer Garner 
and Ed Oxenbould, the film is an adaptation of the popular 1972 children’s book 
by Judith Viorst.

Annabelle <https://www.theguardian.com/film/annabelle>, the low-budget horror 
prequel about a demonic doll which just lost out to Gone Girl for the No1 spot 
last week, dropped to fourth this time around, with $16.4m in its second week. 
The top five was rounded out by Robert Downey Jr drama The Judge, which pulled 
in just $13.3m on opening despite the near ubiquity of the world’s highest-paid 
actor on US talk shows last week. Downey Jr plays a lawyer who returns home for 
his mother’s funeral only to discover that his father (Robert Duvall, the 
town’s judge) is suspected of murder.

The other new films to hit the top 10 this week were thriller Addicted, about 
a businesswoman who finds herself in danger after embarking on a series of 
affairs, and the religious-themed documentary Meet the Mormons. The former 
bowed in seventh place with $7.6m and the latter debuted in tenth with an 
opening haul of $3m.
