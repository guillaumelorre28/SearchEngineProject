A man with a rifle who shot another person early on Sunday in the lobby of an 
upmarket downtownAustin <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/austin> hotel was 
then shot and killed by officers, police said.

The shootings happened shortly before 5am at the Omni Austin hotel, about four 
blocks from theTexas <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas> state capitol, 
assistant police chief Brian Manley said at a news conference.

He said an emergency dispatcher got a call about a man in the hotel lobby 
“walking around with a gun”. Then, the caller reported seeing the man shoot 
someone. The dispatcher could hear crying and yelling.

Officers arrived at the hotel to find a man with a rifle. Manley said the man, 
who appeared to be in his 30s, pointed the gun at the officers and they chased 
him. He said the man fired several shots inside the hotel, including some at 
police.

After a few moments, one of the Austin officers shot and killed the man. 
Manley said the officer, a member of the police force for five years, was 
placed on administrative duty pending an investigation – a common practice 
following officer-related shootings.

The names of the officer and two people killed were not immediately released.

Investigators were interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence and trying 
to determine what led to the first shooting.

“It’s a very complicated scene in there,” Manley told news reporters gathered 
outside the hotel.
