Djokovic’s 11th grand slam title means he has drawn level with Bjorn Borg and 
Rod Laver. Which isn’t too shabby. Here he comes to collect his trophy.“I need 
to pay the respect to Andy and his team for another tournament,” he says. “You 
are a great champion and a great friend. I’m sure in the future you are going 
to have more opportunities to fight for this trophy. I would also like to wish 
you and Kim a healthy delivery of your baby and I hope you will experience a 
feeling like no other before, because that’s what happened to me and my wife.”

A very dignified, warm speech from Murray. “Finally to my wife Kim, you’ve 
been a legend the last two weeks, thank you for all your support. I’ll be on 
the next flight home.” He’s struggling to keep it together now.

Andy Murray collects his runners-up trinket. “I feel like I’ve been here 
before,” he says with a weak laugh. “I’d like to congratulate Novak for six 
Australian Opens, it’s an incredible feat. I’d like to thank my team for 
getting me into this position. Sorry I couldn’t get it done tonight. It’s been 
a tough few weeks for me away from the court and I thank all you for your 
support in that.”

Are we talking about a player who could become the greatest of all time? Novak 
Djokovic kisses the blue court after equalling Roy Emerson’s record of winning 
sixAustralian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> titles 
and he’s secured his 11th grand slam title overall with a performance that was 
clinical, resilient and brilliant. To be brutally honest, the final was over as 
a contest as soon as Andy Murray went 2-0 down in the opening set. He lost the 
final in that dreadful sequence when he could hardly do a thing right, early 
on, allowing Djokovic to take a 5-0 lead. He made a better fight of it in sets 
two and three, but his attempts to play aggressively against the game’s best 
counter-puncher ended in frustration, angst and 65 unforced errors. Murray 
wanted it badly. Maybe too badly. He was too anxious in the big moments and it 
feels as though Djokovic has taken up residence in his head. It was a fine 
effort from Murray to reach the final, especially with everything that has gone 
on in his life away from the court, but Djokovic was remorseless. He is the

Third set: Djokovic* 6-1, 7-5, 4-4 Murray (*denotes server): At 15-0, Murray 
unleashes with a forehand and romps forward to put away a volley and the games 
to 30-all when Djokovic double-faults, challenging unsuccessfully. Yet Murray 
can’t capitalise, more errors allowing Djokovic to hold to 30.

Third set: Djokovic* 6-1, 7-5, 3-3 Murray (*denotes server): Murray wins the 
first point. Against anyone else, he’d have won the second one as well But 
Djokovic isn’t anyone else, he’s persistence personified and he outlasts 
Murray. He’s just so relentless. He saves a break point with a cross-court 
forehand. Yet Murray can be tenacious too and he earns another break point with 
a smash, softening Djokovic up with a diagonal backhand. Djokovic drifts a 
backhand long and Murray breaks back!

Third set: Djokovic 6-1, 7-5, 3-2 Murray* (*denotes server): The first two 
points are shared, but Murray takes the next three to hold to 15. “Given Andy’s 
repeated losses (Presuming he loses here) in Grand Slams in Australia/The World 
to Djokovic should we begin to nickname him ‘The Eternal Second’ like Raymond 
Poulidor?Or perhaps just Raymond?” says James Austin. “He looks like a Raymond.”

Third set: Djokovic* 6-1, 7-5, 3-1 Murray (*denotes server): Murray has a 
chance to break back, Djokovic’s focus slipping, but he overcooks a forehand. 
Bye bye, break point! Djokovic holds. “So far so good for Murray’s genius game 
plan,” says Simon McMahon. “Andy will keep going, he has all the street 
fighting qualities of Jimmy Connors. Unfortunately Djokovic is not Mikael 
Pernfors.”

Third set: Djokovic 6-1, 7-5, 1-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray has never 
come back from two sets down against Djokovic, even though he got close in 
Paris last year. But he lost that day and he’s going to lose today. Especially 
not now. He fluffs an easy smash, putting into the net, and Djokovic has two 
break points. Murray saves the first. Djokovic takes the second with a 
staggering backhand pass down the line.

Novak Djokovic wins the second set 7-5; he leads 6-1, 7-5!

Serving for a two-set lead, it’s a strange time for Djokovic to hit his first 
double-fault, letting Murray into the game at 30-all. It’s not quite over yet. 
Even more astonishingly, a repeat gives Murray a break point. Yet Murray nets a 
backhand. This isn’t exactly a classic and Djokovic has played better than 
this, but Murray is tenser in the key moments, almost too anxious. Another 
errant backhand gives Djokovic a set point and Murray limply nets a forehand. 
There have been periods of dominance from Murray, but he’s rarely convinced, as 
though he’s come into this a beaten man. Does he truly believe when he steps on 
to court with this guy?

Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 6-5 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray wins three 
straight points for 40-0. He’s the aggressor at the moment. Yet Djokovic isn’t 
going away that easily. Murray misses a forehand for 40-15 and Djokovic makes 
it 40-30 with a crunching forehand, before he wins a 36-shot rally. Murray was 
up 40-0, but now he’s facing a break point, Djokovic picking him off the net. 
Murray is living dangerously. His shots are just about clearing the net. One 
clips the net cord and almost lands long. It’s not happening for him. Djokovic 
is just putting the ball back into play, asking the question, and Murray comes 
up with the wrong answer, skewing a backhand long. Djokovic grabs the crucial 
break and Murray, who was looking dominant, is fading.

Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 5-5 Murray (*denotes server): A break up 15 minutes 
ago, now Djokovic finds himself serving to stay in the second set and he begins 
the game by sending a backhand long for 0-15. The call is late, Djokovic 
stares, but he doesn’t challenge. Murray is two points from the set when a huge 
backhand makes it 15-30, but he nets a forehand when he was in a promising 
position. Djokovic is under the cosh but he holds because of more errors from 
Murray.

Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 4-5 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray quickly 
charges into a 30-0 lead, but there’s work to be done when he chops a backhand 
slice long to make it 30-all, before a terrific forehand return from Djokovic 
brings him a break point as Murray stretches and nets his forehand riposte. 
Djokovic is threatening to let all the air out of Murray, leaving him in a 
saggy heap on the floor. Yet Murray is granite. He saves it with a stunning 
sliced serve down the middle for deuce. An ace earns him a game point, but it’s 
not over yet, Murray knocking a backhand long. Nothing comes to him easily. 
This is hard graft and cracks are appearing, Murray smashing an emotional 
forehand long to give Djokovic a second break point. Murray has to produce his 
best - he does. A coruscating cross-court backhand saves him and another brings 
him the advantage. Djokovic nets a backhand, a rare mistake from him, and 
Murray holds!

Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 4-4 Murray (*denotes server): Murray has made so 
many errors. As good as Djokovic has been, Murray is beating himself at times. 
He has a presentable opportunity for two break points; instead he needlessly 
splutters a forehand into the net to make it 30-all. Yet he keeps plugging away 
and he gets away with a slightly poor drop volley, a hurtling Djokovic unable 
to get a forehand over the net! Improbably, Murray has his first break point 
since the first game of the match. He didn’t take that one. He simply has to 
take this one. Djokovic drops a ball short. Murray arrives like a tornado and 
arrows a punishing backhand into the corner. He’s broken him at last! But wait. 
Djokovic is challenging. He thinks it might have gone out. Murray walks back to 
the baseline, his eyes closed, talking to himself, begging HawkEye to bring him 
good news. “Please, please,” he says. The camera zooms in. And the ball just 
clipped the line! Murray breaks back!

Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 4-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray double-faults 
on the first point and aces on the second. Last time that happened, the game 
lasted 12 minutes. Djokovic had four break points in that game. He gets a break 
point in this game, fighting back from 30-15 to 30-40, grinding Murray down, 
testing his patience, his willpower, his concentration levels. It’s too much 
for an increasingly frayed Murray. He’s vulnerable. A look at a second serve 
allows Djokovic to take control. He works Murray over and though the Scot does 
well to keep him at bay, eventually he sloppily knocks a careless backhand long 
and Djokovic breaks.

Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 3-3 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic is making 
some very odd noises as he strains to stay in the first point, Murray 
dominating the rally initially. Yet Murray can’t land the final blow and 
Djokovic asserts himself and wins the point with a cross-court forehand. His 
ability to extricate himself from sticky situations is amazing. Yet Murray’s 
level is rising. He has a sniff of a chance at 15-30, before two ordinary 
errors make it 40-30, but good depth allows him to force deuce. He should get a 
break point - but he dumps a gimme of a forehand volley into the net. Djokovic 
holds. He keeps slamming the door in Murray’s face with extreme force.

Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 1-2 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray’s second 
double-fault makes it 0-15. At least this one didn’t come on a break point, and 
he responds with an ace. The game goes to 30-all. When Murray has a second 
serve, he looks about as comfortable as Mark Corrigan at an illegal rave. The 
game goes to deuce and Djokovic then earns a break point with a moment of 
absurdity, sliding on to a Murray shot into the left corner and beating him 
with a preposterous backhand pass. Murray has to suck it up and he gets over it 
quickly, saving the break point with a big serve, only to sticking a 
self-conscious forehand wide. Too many errors. It looks like Djokovic is going 
to make the breakthrough here, but Murray defends well and Djokovic swerves a 
frustrated forehand wide. Another forehand error from Murray gives Djokovic a 
third break point, but he saves it with a smash. Murray is then given a warning 
from the umpire before a fourth break point; he perversely saves the day with 
an ace. Somehow he survives. He finally earns an ad point when Djokovic nets a 
backhand and Murray holds with an ace. That game took around 12 minutes. “Andy 
is doing a great job of getting into Novak’s head by giving him the first set,” 
says Simon McMahon. “I reckon he’ll give him this one too, and probably let him 
go a break up in the third. It’s genius, I tell you.”

Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 1-1 Murray (*denotes server): A simple hold for 
Djokovic, Murray never in the game. “Do you think Djokovic can win the golden 
slam?” says Alan Zawadzki. “It hasn’t been done before in the men’s game and 
he’d have to win two competitions for the first time in order to achieve it, as 
well as defending the other 3 of course.” I currently think that he could time 
travel if he put his mind to it.

Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): So here’s a problem 
for Murray: he’s never beaten Djokovic from a set down. He roars when he wins 
an attritional rally for 30-0, but Djokovic wins the next two points with a 
couple of magnificent shots. Brief moments of encouragement for Murray are put 
into perspective by those flashes of Djokovic’s class. Yet Murray does hold. 
The comeback is on!

Novak Djokovic wins the first set 6-1!

The first two points are shared, Murray reading a drop shot and charging 
forward to put a forehand away, but Djokovic’s cross-court forehand is a major 
source of the damage that’s being inflicted on Murray. Another makes it 30-15 
and Djokovic carves out his first set point when another drop shot has the 
desired effect, opening up the court for him to dink a forehand away, Murray 
pulled out of position. Yet if there are any positives for Murray to take from 
this debacle of an opening set, it’s that he’s beginning to compete. He saves 
the set point, attacking a weak second serve with a backhand winner. Djokovic 
can’t take a second set point either, netting a forehand, but he earns a third 
chance with a low forehand winner and Murray’s humiliation is complete when he 
nets a backhand return. That only took 30 minutes. The good news for Murray is 
that the first set is over. The bad news is he’s going to have play at least 
another two sets before he can get off court.

First set: Djokovic 5-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray is serving to stay 
in the set and also to avoid the ignominy of a first-set bagel. But this is 
nightmarish stuff at the moment, as he slaps a forehand volley into the net to 
gift Djokovic a 0-15 lead. He drags a forehand wide for 15-30. Yet he shakes 
his head clear with an ace for 30-all and then stirs when he crashes a forehand 
pass Djokovic, who really should have won the point. Djokovic then slaps a 
forehand return into the net and Murray is finally on the board. “Come on!” he 
cries. Yes. Come on.

First set: Djokovic* 5-0 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic swings an ace out 
wide to lead 40-0 and holds to 15 with a wonderfully disguised backhand back 
behind Murray, who needs to get his head in the game quickly! There’s a final 
going on here and currently it’s taking place without him! What a start from 
Djokovic. He can’t miss at the moment.

First set: Djokovic 4-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray stops the rot a 
little, winning the first point when Djokovic knocks a forehand long. Yet 
against Djokovic, Murray hits shots that would be winners against most players. 
Against this guy, they just get returned with interest and Djokovic wins the 
next two points for 15-30. Murray is flirting with serious trouble here and a 
tame forehand into the net gives Djokovic two break points. Given that Djokovic 
has never lost from a set up against Murray before, these have the feel of 
match points - and a wretched game for a confused, frazzled, muddled Murray 
ends with him drifting a dismal forehand past the baseline. There are gasps in 
the crowd. Djokovic breaks for a second time. He’s beating Murray up. The first 
set is gone.

First set: Djokovic* 3-0 Murray (*denotes server): The first point looks like 
a baseline grind - until Djokovic changes the pace with a backhand drop shot. 
Perfectly timed, perfectly placed, and Murray is stranded. Djokovic is in the 
mood. A stunning forehand makes it 40-0 and Murray is beginning to understand 
what Federer went through on Thursday. If it can happen to Federer, who pretty 
much is the best of us, it can happen to anyone. Another clean backhand forces 
Murray to net a forehand and Djokovic consolidates the break by holding to love.

First set: Djokovic 2-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray begins his first 
service game shakily, slicing a backhand into the net, before Djokovic gobbles 
up a second serve with a huge backhand return for 15-30. Murray’s then facing 
two break points, netting a forehand for 15-40. Then he double-faults. Oh dear. 
“We’d all really, really, really like Andy to win, but secretly we’re all 
really, really really scared that Novak is going to do really, really, really 
nasty things to the plucky Scot, and grind him into really, really, really 
small fragments of dust, leaving Andy looking really, really, really jealous in 
the background shot of Novak picking up yet another silver pot,” says Jeremy 
Boyce.

First set: Djokovic* 1-0 Murray (*denotes server): Novak Djokovic, the odds-on 
favourite, gets the 2016Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> men’s final underway. He 
looks over at the net and sees an opponent who simply refuses to go away. He 
sees a threat. Despite it all, he knows he’s probably going to have to be at 
his very best to beat Andy Murray. Djokovic thunders into a 30-0 lead, 
walloping a forehand down the line on the second point, but Murray crunches 
back to 30-all with some positive tennis. An attritional rally follows and it 
ends with Djokovic netting a backhand, handing Murray an early break point. 
Murray pushes, but Djokovic suddenly bursts into life, a brilliant backhand 
from left to right saving the break point and forcing deuce. It’s deuce for a 
while. Yet Djokovic zings an ace down the middle, before wriggling clear. A 
tricky opening game, but he emerges unscathed, and Murray will need to watch 
himself now.

Novak Djokovic has won the toss and chosen to serve first. “Morning Jacob,” 
says Simon McMahon. “So, here we go again. Djokovic v. Murray. The Borg and 
McEnroede nos jours. The Ray Purchase and Steven Toast of men’s tennis. And 
Andy no doubt thinking Novak ‘Bloody’ Djokovic. But whatever happens todayAndy 
Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> is, IMHO, without doubt 
the greatest individual sportsman that Scotland has ever produced. Jackie 
Stewart, Ken Buchanan, Colin Montgomerie, Chris Hoy, Stephen Hendry, Jocky 
Wilson - all greats, but Andy surpasses them all. Whilst remaining entirely 
likeable, good humoured and seemingly unaffected by the trappings of wealth and 
fame. I really, really,really want him to win. But I won’t think any less of 
him if he doesn’t. Come on Andy!”

Here come the players! Djokovic resists the temptation to make out he’s 
injured during the walk to the court. A wasted opportunity there. He really 
could have got in Murray’s head there.

The obvious weakness for Murray is his second serve. Raonic took advantage of 
it in the third-set tie-break and it will need to be much better than usual 
against the best returner in the game. My colleague Kevin Mitchell came up with 
this ominous statistic: Djokovic has tied for third on the tournament list with 
134 points from 217 second serves, at 62%, to Murray’s 138 from 243 at 57%, 
which places him equal 17th. “There has been a lot of talks about his second 
serve,” Djokovic said/warned/laughed, “and I’m sure he and his team are very 
much aware of that.”

So how did Murray prepare for his fifth Australian Open final? By staying up 
till 1am, of course. But he had a good reason. He was a smiling presence in the 
stands yesterday as he watched his brother Jamie win his first grand slam 
title, teaming up with his new doubles partner Bruno Soares andbeating Daniel 
Nestor and Radek Stepanek 2-6, 6-4, 7-5 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/andy-jamie-murray-support-australian-open-final-singles-doubles>
. Whatever happens today, it’s already a famous weekend for the Murray family. 
“It was funny to see Andy there at the end,” Jamie said. “He’d obviously been 
watching the match in the locker room. I didn’t know that. I thought he left to 
go back to the hotel, obviously. Maybe he came back when he thought we had a 
chance. We were [all] in the locker room for a little bit before. He was 
obviously practising. We kicked him off the court. He was having food and 
stuff. I thought him and the guys had left to go back to the hotel. I was 
shocked to see him there.”

Preamble

Andy Murray has been to four Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> finals. He’s accumulated a 
grand total of two sets, 56 games and four defeats. In 2010, Roger Federer was 
too good and Murray was too passive. In 2011, Novak Djokovic could have won 
with one hand behind his back and his shoelaces tied together. In 2013, 
Djokovic again, Murray spooked by a feather in the pivotal second-set 
tie-break. In 2015, Djokovic completed the hat-trick, fooling a gullible Murray 
into thinking he was injured and then racing away with it 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 6-0.

That’s a crushing sequence. And it gets worse. This is Djokovic’s sixth 
Australian Open final and the world No1 is five for five, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 
felled in 2008, Murray in 2011, 2013 and 2015, Rafael Nadal unable to stop him 
in their 2012 epic. Djokovic loves this tournament and he loves Rod Laver 
Arena, where the conditions are ideally suited to his surgical, wear-you-down, 
beat-you-up tennis. Though Stan Wawrinka managed to beat him here in their 2014 
quarter-final, Djokovic’s aura in Melbourne is starting to resemble Federer’s 
at Wimbledon and Nadal’s at Roland Garros. Victory today will bring him his 
11th grand slam title, edging him ever closer to Federer’s total of 17, and 
spark talk of the calendar slam, after his attempt to win all four majors last 
year was ended by Wawrinka in Paris.

So Djokovic is the heavy favourite. Last Sunday, he wheezed past Gilles Simon 
in five sets, making a century of unforced errors against the troublesome 
Frenchman, and he wasn’t too convincing in his quarter-final against Kei 
Nishikori on Tuesday either. Thursday, however, saw Djokovic hit new heights in 
his semi-final against Federer, obliterating his great rival in an opening two 
sets that looked more like a father showing off against his son than a match 
between two of the best players in the world. He leads his head-to-head with 
Murray 21-9 and he’s not lost to him in a grand slam since the 2013 Wimbledon 
final, beating him in Australia, Paris and New York since then. He’s lost one 
of their past 11 meetings, succumbing in the Rogers Cup final last year, and it 
is difficult to come up with many compelling reasons to back against him.

Yet Murray is back for more, like Rocky summoning the willpower to drag 
himself off the canvas <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25NmudB2fqg>. He’s 
carrying the scars of those previous disappointments, his pregnant wife is back 
in England, he’s had to cope with his father-in-law falling ill last weekend, 
he needed five sets to defeat Milos Raonic on Friday and everyone expects him 
to lose. But he’s back for more. Some might say he’s a glutton for punishment, 
others simply marvel at the streak of stubbornness that makes him such an 
incredible competitor. He’ll tell himself that he’s won two grand slam finals 
against Djokovic before, that he was close in their five-set encounter in the 
French Open last year, that he’s the world No2 and the man who more or less 
single-handedly won the Davis Cup for Great Britain in November. It may end in 
despair and heartbreak again, but he’ll keep plugging away. What else is he 
supposed to do?

The players will be on court at 8.30am GMT and 7.30pm in Melbourne.

Djokovic’s 11th grand slam title means he has drawn level with Bjorn Borg and 
Rod Laver. Which isn’t too shabby. Here he comes to collect his trophy.“I need 
to pay the respect to Andy and his team for another tournament,” he says. “You 
are a great champion and a great friend. I’m sure in the future you are going 
to have more opportunities to fight for this trophy. I would also like to wish 
you and Kim a healthy delivery of your baby and I hope you will experience a 
feeling like no other before, because that’s what happened to me and my wife.”
 
A very dignified, warm speech from Murray. “Finally to my wife Kim, you’ve 
been a legend the last two weeks, thank you for all your support. I’ll be on 
the next flight home.” He’s struggling to keep it together now.
 
Andy Murray collects his runners-up trinket. “I feel like I’ve been here 
before,” he says with a weak laugh. “I’d like to congratulate Novak for six 
Australian Opens, it’s an incredible feat. I’d like to thank my team for 
getting me into this position. Sorry I couldn’t get it done tonight. It’s been 
a tough few weeks for me away from the court and I thank all you for your 
support in that.”
 
I can’t watch a closing ceremony without thinking of this moment from 2012.

a contest as soon as Andy Murray went 2-0 down in the opening set. He lost the 
final in that dreadful sequence when he could hardly do a thing right, early 
on, allowing Djokovic to take a 5-0 lead. He made a better fight of it in sets 
two and three, but his attempts to play aggressively against the game’s best 
counter-puncher ended in frustration, angst and 65 unforced errors. Murray 
wanted it badly. Maybe too badly. He was too anxious in the big moments and it 
feels as though Djokovic has taken up residence in his head. It was a fine 
effort from Murray to reach the final, especially with everything that has gone 
on in his life away from the court, but Djokovic was remorseless. He is the 
best player in the world by a considerable distance.

unleashes with a forehand and romps forward to put away a volley and the games 
to 30-all when Djokovic double-faults, challenging unsuccessfully. Yet Murray 
can’t capitalise, more errors allowing Djokovic to hold to 30.
 
Third set: Djokovic 6-1, 7-5, 3-4 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray holds to 
15! Optimism flows back. Sort of. Not really.
 
Third set: Djokovic* 6-1, 7-5, 3-3 Murray (*denotes server): Murray wins the 
first point. Against anyone else, he’d have won the second one as well But 
Djokovic isn’t anyone else, he’s persistence personified and he outlasts 
Murray. He’s just so relentless. He saves a break point with a cross-court 
forehand. Yet Murray can be tenacious too and he earns another break point with 
a smash, softening Djokovic up with a diagonal backhand. Djokovic drifts a 
backhand long and Murray breaks back!
 
Third set: Djokovic 6-1, 7-5, 3-2 Murray* (*denotes server): The first two 
points are shared, but Murray takes the next three to hold to 15. “Given Andy’s 
repeated losses (Presuming he loses here) in Grand Slams in Australia/The World 
to Djokovic should we begin to nickname him ‘The Eternal Second’ like Raymond 
Poulidor?Or perhaps just Raymond?” says James Austin. “He looks like a Raymond.”
 
Third set: Djokovic* 6-1, 7-5, 3-1 Murray (*denotes server): Murray has a 
chance to break back, Djokovic’s focus slipping, but he overcooks a forehand. 
Bye bye, break point! Djokovic holds. “So far so good for Murray’s genius game 
plan,” says Simon McMahon. “Andy will keep going, he has all the street 
fighting qualities of Jimmy Connors. Unfortunately Djokovic is not Mikael 
Pernfors.”
 
Third set: Djokovic 6-1, 7-5, 2-1 Murray* (*denotes server): From 15-30 down, 
good serving gets Murray to relative safety. But we’re going through the 
motions now.
 
Third set: Djokovic* 6-1, 7-5, 2-0 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to

Terry Wogan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/jun/04/smalltalk.sportinterviews>.
 
Third set: Djokovic 6-1, 7-5, 1-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray has never 
come back from two sets down against Djokovic, even though he got close in 
Paris last year. But he lost that day and he’s going to lose today. Especially 
not now. He fluffs an easy smash, putting into the net, and Djokovic has two 
break points. Murray saves the first. Djokovic takes the second with a 
staggering backhand pass down the line.
 
Serving for a two-set lead, it’s a strange time for Djokovic to hit his first 
double-fault, letting Murray into the game at 30-all. It’s not quite over yet. 
Even more astonishingly, a repeat gives Murray a break point. Yet Murray nets a 
backhand. This isn’t exactly a classic and Djokovic has played better than 
this, but Murray is tenser in the key moments, almost too anxious. Another 
errant backhand gives Djokovic a set point and Murray limply nets a forehand. 
There have been periods of dominance from Murray, but he’s rarely convinced, as 
though he’s come into this a beaten man. Does he truly believe when he steps on 
to court with this guy?

Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 6-5 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray wins three 
straight points for 40-0. He’s the aggressor at the moment. Yet Djokovic isn’t 
going away that easily. Murray misses a forehand for 40-15 and Djokovic makes 
it 40-30 with a crunching forehand, before he wins a 36-shot rally. Murray was 
up 40-0, but now he’s facing a break point, Djokovic picking him off the net. 
Murray is living dangerously. His shots are just about clearing the net. One 
clips the net cord and almost lands long. It’s not happening for him. Djokovic 
is just putting the ball back into play, asking the question, and Murray comes 
up with the wrong answer, skewing a backhand long. Djokovic grabs the crucial 
break and Murray, who was looking dominant, is fading.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 5-5 Murray (*denotes server): A break up 15 minutes 
ago, now Djokovic finds himself serving to stay in the second set and he begins 
the game by sending a backhand long for 0-15. The call is late, Djokovic 
stares, but he doesn’t challenge. Murray is two points from the set when a huge 
backhand makes it 15-30, but he nets a forehand when he was in a promising 
position. Djokovic is under the cosh but he holds because of more errors from 
Murray.
 
Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 4-5 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray quickly 
charges into a 30-0 lead, but there’s work to be done when he chops a backhand 
slice long to make it 30-all, before a terrific forehand return from Djokovic 
brings him a break point as Murray stretches and nets his forehand riposte. 
Djokovic is threatening to let all the air out of Murray, leaving him in a 
saggy heap on the floor. Yet Murray is granite. He saves it with a stunning 
sliced serve down the middle for deuce. An ace earns him a game point, but it’s 
not over yet, Murray knocking a backhand long. Nothing comes to him easily. 
This is hard graft and cracks are appearing, Murray smashing an emotional 
forehand long to give Djokovic a second break point. Murray has to produce his 
best - he does. A coruscating cross-court backhand saves him and another brings 
him the advantage. Djokovic nets a backhand, a rare mistake from him, and 
Murray holds!
 
Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 4-4 Murray (*denotes server): Murray has made so 
many errors. As good as Djokovic has been, Murray is beating himself at times. 
He has a presentable opportunity for two break points; instead he needlessly 
splutters a forehand into the net to make it 30-all. Yet he keeps plugging away 
and he gets away with a slightly poor drop volley, a hurtling Djokovic unable 
to get a forehand over the net! Improbably, Murray has his first break point 
since the first game of the match. He didn’t take that one. He simply has to 
take this one. Djokovic drops a ball short. Murray arrives like a tornado and 
arrows a punishing backhand into the corner. He’s broken him at last! But wait. 
Djokovic is challenging. He thinks it might have gone out. Murray walks back to 
the baseline, his eyes closed, talking to himself, begging HawkEye to bring him 
good news. “Please, please,” he says. The camera zooms in. And the ball just 
clipped the line! Murray breaks back!
 
Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 4-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray double-faults 
on the first point and aces on the second. Last time that happened, the game 
lasted 12 minutes. Djokovic had four break points in that game. He gets a break 
point in this game, fighting back from 30-15 to 30-40, grinding Murray down, 
testing his patience, his willpower, his concentration levels. It’s too much 
for an increasingly frayed Murray. He’s vulnerable. A look at a second serve 
allows Djokovic to take control. He works Murray over and though the Scot does 
well to keep him at bay, eventually he sloppily knocks a careless backhand long 
and Djokovic breaks.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 3-3 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic is making 
some very odd noises as he strains to stay in the first point, Murray 
dominating the rally initially. Yet Murray can’t land the final blow and 
Djokovic asserts himself and wins the point with a cross-court forehand. His 
ability to extricate himself from sticky situations is amazing. Yet Murray’s 
level is rising. He has a sniff of a chance at 15-30, before two ordinary 
errors make it 40-30, but good depth allows him to force deuce. He should get a 
break point - but he dumps a gimme of a forehand volley into the net. Djokovic 
holds. He keeps slamming the door in Murray’s face with extreme force.
 
Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 2-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray holds to 15 
and the last point is a minor classic, Murray drop-shotting, Djokovic 
drop-shotting then lobbing, Murray retrieving, Djokovic smashing poorly, Murray 
spanking a splendid forehand past him.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 2-2 Murray (*denotes server): Murray wins the first 
point. He’s going to break! Or not. Djokovic wins the next four without any 
fuss at all.
 
Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 1-2 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray’s second 
double-fault makes it 0-15. At least this one didn’t come on a break point, and 
he responds with an ace. The game goes to 30-all. When Murray has a second 
serve, he looks about as comfortable as Mark Corrigan at an illegal rave. The 
game goes to deuce and Djokovic then earns a break point with a moment of 
absurdity, sliding on to a Murray shot into the left corner and beating him 
with a preposterous backhand pass. Murray has to suck it up and he gets over it 
quickly, saving the break point with a big serve, only to sticking a 
self-conscious forehand wide. Too many errors. It looks like Djokovic is going 
to make the breakthrough here, but Murray defends well and Djokovic swerves a 
frustrated forehand wide. Another forehand error from Murray gives Djokovic a 
third break point, but he saves it with a smash. Murray is then given a warning 
from the umpire before a fourth break point; he perversely saves the day with 
an ace. Somehow he survives. He finally earns an ad point when Djokovic nets a 
backhand and Murray holds with an ace. That game took around 12 minutes. “Andy 
is doing a great job of getting into Novak’s head by giving him the first set,” 
says Simon McMahon. “I reckon he’ll give him this one too, and probably let him 
go a break up in the third. It’s genius, I tell you.”
 
Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 1-1 Murray (*denotes server): A simple hold for 
Djokovic, Murray never in the game. “Do you think Djokovic can win the golden 
slam?” says Alan Zawadzki. “It hasn’t been done before in the men’s game and 
he’d have to win two competitions for the first time in order to achieve it, as 
well as defending the other 3 of course.” I currently think that he could time 
travel if he put his mind to it.
 
Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): So here’s a problem 
for Murray: he’s never beaten Djokovic from a set down. He roars when he wins 
an attritional rally for 30-0, but Djokovic wins the next two points with a 
couple of magnificent shots. Brief moments of encouragement for Murray are put 
into perspective by those flashes of Djokovic’s class. Yet Murray does hold. 
The comeback is on!
 
The first two points are shared, Murray reading a drop shot and charging 
forward to put a forehand away, but Djokovic’s cross-court forehand is a major 
source of the damage that’s being inflicted on Murray. Another makes it 30-15 
and Djokovic carves out his first set point when another drop shot has the 
desired effect, opening up the court for him to dink a forehand away, Murray 
pulled out of position. Yet if there are any positives for Murray to take from 
this debacle of an opening set, it’s that he’s beginning to compete. He saves 
the set point, attacking a weak second serve with a backhand winner. Djokovic 
can’t take a second set point either, netting a forehand, but he earns a third 
chance with a low forehand winner and Murray’s humiliation is complete when he 
nets a backhand return. That only took 30 minutes. The good news for Murray is 
that the first set is over. The bad news is he’s going to have play at least 
another two sets before he can get off court.
 
First set: Djokovic 5-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray is serving to stay 
in the set and also to avoid the ignominy of a first-set bagel. But this is 
nightmarish stuff at the moment, as he slaps a forehand volley into the net to 
gift Djokovic a 0-15 lead. He drags a forehand wide for 15-30. Yet he shakes 
his head clear with an ace for 30-all and then stirs when he crashes a forehand 
pass Djokovic, who really should have won the point. Djokovic then slaps a 
forehand return into the net and Murray is finally on the board. “Come on!” he 
cries. Yes. Come on.
 
First set: Djokovic* 5-0 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic swings an ace out 
wide to lead 40-0 and holds to 15 with a wonderfully disguised backhand back 
behind Murray, who needs to get his head in the game quickly! There’s a final 
going on here and currently it’s taking place without him! What a start from 
Djokovic. He can’t miss at the moment.
 
First set: Djokovic 4-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray stops the rot a 
little, winning the first point when Djokovic knocks a forehand long. Yet 
against Djokovic, Murray hits shots that would be winners against most players. 
Against this guy, they just get returned with interest and Djokovic wins the 
next two points for 15-30. Murray is flirting with serious trouble here and a 
tame forehand into the net gives Djokovic two break points. Given that Djokovic 
has never lost from a set up against Murray before, these have the feel of 
match points - and a wretched game for a confused, frazzled, muddled Murray 
ends with him drifting a dismal forehand past the baseline. There are gasps in 
the crowd. Djokovic breaks for a second time. He’s beating Murray up. The first 
set is gone.
 
First set: Djokovic* 3-0 Murray (*denotes server): The first point looks like 
a baseline grind - until Djokovic changes the pace with a backhand drop shot. 
Perfectly timed, perfectly placed, and Murray is stranded. Djokovic is in the 
mood. A stunning forehand makes it 40-0 and Murray is beginning to understand 
what Federer went through on Thursday. If it can happen to Federer, who pretty 
much is the best of us, it can happen to anyone. Another clean backhand forces 
Murray to net a forehand and Djokovic consolidates the break by holding to love.
 
First set: Djokovic 2-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray begins his first 
service game shakily, slicing a backhand into the net, before Djokovic gobbles 
up a second serve with a huge backhand return for 15-30. Murray’s then facing 
two break points, netting a forehand for 15-40. Then he double-faults. Oh dear. 
“We’d all really, really, really like Andy to win, but secretly we’re all 
really, really really scared that Novak is going to do really, really, really 
nasty things to the plucky Scot, and grind him into really, really, really 
small fragments of dust, leaving Andy looking really, really, really jealous in 
the background shot of Novak picking up yet another silver pot,” says Jeremy 
Boyce.
 
First set: Djokovic* 1-0 Murray (*denotes server): Novak Djokovic, the odds-on 
favourite, gets the 2016Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> men’s final underway. He 
looks over at the net and sees an opponent who simply refuses to go away. He 
sees a threat. Despite it all, he knows he’s probably going to have to be at 
his very best to beat Andy Murray. Djokovic thunders into a 30-0 lead, 
walloping a forehand down the line on the second point, but Murray crunches 
back to 30-all with some positive tennis. An attritional rally follows and it 
ends with Djokovic netting a backhand, handing Murray an early break point. 
Murray pushes, but Djokovic suddenly bursts into life, a brilliant backhand 
from left to right saving the break point and forcing deuce. It’s deuce for a 
while. Yet Djokovic zings an ace down the middle, before wriggling clear. A 
tricky opening game, but he emerges unscathed, and Murray will need to watch 
himself now.
 
Novak Djokovic has won the toss and chosen to serve first. “Morning Jacob,” 
says Simon McMahon. “So, here we go again. Djokovic v. Murray. The Borg and 
McEnroede nos jours. The Ray Purchase and Steven Toast of men’s tennis. And 
Andy no doubt thinking Novak ‘Bloody’ Djokovic. But whatever happens todayAndy 
Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> is, IMHO, without doubt 
the greatest individual sportsman that Scotland has ever produced. Jackie 
Stewart, Ken Buchanan, Colin Montgomerie, Chris Hoy, Stephen Hendry, Jocky 
Wilson - all greats, but Andy surpasses them all. Whilst remaining entirely 
likeable, good humoured and seemingly unaffected by the trappings of wealth and 
fame. I really, really,really want him to win. But I won’t think any less of 
him if he doesn’t. Come on Andy!”
 
Here come the players! Djokovic resists the temptation to make out he’s 
injured during the walk to the court. A wasted opportunity there. He really 
could have got in Murray’s head there.
 
It’s cold and windy in Melbourne. Optimists are wondering if that will disturb 
Djokovic’s equilibrium.
 
Jamie Murray’s doubles partner, Bruno Soares, has gone and won the mixed 
doubles alongside Elena Vesnina. You can read about it here

.
 
The obvious weakness for Murray is his second serve. Raonic took advantage of 
it in the third-set tie-break and it will need to be much better than usual 
against the best returner in the game. My colleague Kevin Mitchell came up with 
this ominous statistic: Djokovic has tied for third on the tournament list with 
134 points from 217 second serves, at 62%, to Murray’s 138 from 243 at 57%, 
which places him equal 17th. “There has been a lot of talks about his second 
serve,” Djokovic said/warned/laughed, “and I’m sure he and his team are very 
much aware of that.”

So how did Murray prepare for his fifth Australian Open final? By staying up 
till 1am, of course. But he had a good reason. He was a smiling presence in the 
stands yesterday as he watched his brother Jamie win his first grand slam 
title, teaming up with his new doubles partner Bruno Soares andbeating Daniel 
Nestor and Radek Stepanek 2-6, 6-4, 7-5 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/andy-jamie-murray-support-australian-open-final-singles-doubles>
. Whatever happens today, it’s already a famous weekend for the Murray family. 
“It was funny to see Andy there at the end,” Jamie said. “He’d obviously been 
watching the match in the locker room. I didn’t know that. I thought he left to 
go back to the hotel, obviously. Maybe he came back when he thought we had a 
chance. We were [all] in the locker room for a little bit before. He was 
obviously practising. We kicked him off the court. He was having food and 
stuff. I thought him and the guys had left to go back to the hotel. I was 
shocked to see him there.”

Andy Murray makes late appearance to watch Jamie win Australian Open title

Andy Murray has been to four Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> finals. He’s accumulated a 
grand total of two sets, 56 games and four defeats. In 2010, Roger Federer was 
too good and Murray was too passive. In 2011, Novak Djokovic could have won 
with one hand behind his back and his shoelaces tied together. In 2013, 
Djokovic again, Murray spooked by a feather in the pivotal second-set 
tie-break. In 2015, Djokovic completed the hat-trick, fooling a gullible Murray 
into thinking he was injured and then racing away with it 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 6-0.

That’s a crushing sequence. And it gets worse. This is Djokovic’s sixth 
Australian Open final and the world No1 is five for five, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 
felled in 2008, Murray in 2011, 2013 and 2015, Rafael Nadal unable to stop him 
in their 2012 epic. Djokovic loves this tournament and he loves Rod Laver 
Arena, where the conditions are ideally suited to his surgical, wear-you-down, 
beat-you-up tennis. Though Stan Wawrinka managed to beat him here in their 2014 
quarter-final, Djokovic’s aura in Melbourne is starting to resemble Federer’s 
at Wimbledon and Nadal’s at Roland Garros. Victory today will bring him his 
11th grand slam title, edging him ever closer to Federer’s total of 17, and 
spark talk of the calendar slam, after his attempt to win all four majors last 
year was ended by Wawrinka in Paris.

So Djokovic is the heavy favourite. Last Sunday, he wheezed past Gilles Simon 
in five sets, making a century of unforced errors against the troublesome 
Frenchman, and he wasn’t too convincing in his quarter-final against Kei 
Nishikori on Tuesday either. Thursday, however, saw Djokovic hit new heights in 
his semi-final against Federer, obliterating his great rival in an opening two 
sets that looked more like a father showing off against his son than a match 
between two of the best players in the world. He leads his head-to-head with 
Murray 21-9 and he’s not lost to him in a grand slam since the 2013 Wimbledon 
final, beating him in Australia, Paris and New York since then. He’s lost one 
of their past 11 meetings, succumbing in the Rogers Cup final last year, and it 
is difficult to come up with many compelling reasons to back against him.

Yet Murray is back for more, like Rocky summoning the willpower to drag 
himself off the canvas <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25NmudB2fqg>. He’s 
carrying the scars of those previous disappointments, his pregnant wife is back 
in England, he’s had to cope with his father-in-law falling ill last weekend, 
he needed five sets to defeat Milos Raonic on Friday and everyone expects him 
to lose. But he’s back for more. Some might say he’s a glutton for punishment, 
others simply marvel at the streak of stubbornness that makes him such an 
incredible competitor. He’ll tell himself that he’s won two grand slam finals 
against Djokovic before, that he was close in their five-set encounter in the 
French Open last year, that he’s the world No2 and the man who more or less 
single-handedly won the Davis Cup for Great Britain in November. It may end in 
despair and heartbreak again, but he’ll keep plugging away. What else is he 
supposed to do?

The players will be on court at 8.30am GMT and 7.30pm in Melbourne.
