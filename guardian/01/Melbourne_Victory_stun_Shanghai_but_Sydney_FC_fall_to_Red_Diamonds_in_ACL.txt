Jai Ingham’s first professional goal helped Melbourne Victory to a winning 
start in theirAsian Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/asian-champions-league> campaign. The 
A-League club downed Shanghai SIPG 2-1 at AAMI Park on Wednesday night with 
goals to Ingham and Besart Berisha either side of Wu Lei’s equaliser.

It was Victory’s win but Ingham’s moment, signed by coach Kevin Muscat in 
January on a mature-age rookie contract and used sparingly since. Ingham faced 
Victorian state league opposition as recently as September but, against the 
cashed-up Chinese Super League outfit, he took his chance.

Shanghai, coached by Sven-Goran Eriksson, fielded a team laden with talent. 
All three of their foreign attacking stars – Elkeson, Dario Conca and Asamoah 
Gyan –started the match, along with six Asian internationals, and they quickly 
made an impact.

On 12 minutes, Elkeson missed a long-range shot wide and, shortly after, Yu 
Hai struck a first-time volley wide.

As the rain came down, an impressive contingent of red-clad Shanghai 
supporters outsang the usually voracious Victory fans. But Victory stole the 
lead after countering with pace from Nick Ansell’s block of Elkeson’s shot.

Oliver Bozanic’s ball found Ingham and split the Shanghai defence, allowing 
the former state league player to cut in and lash home. 

Danny Vukovic and Daniel Georgievski made last-gasp blocks to give Victory a 
scoreboard advantage at half-time but their lead lasted just seven minutes 
after the break. Shanghai’s Brazilian menace delivered a fine cross to the back 
post, allowing Chinese national team winger Wu to swoop past Georgievski to 
score.

Shanghai were level, but were forced to play the final half-hour without 
$500,000-a-week man Gyan, who was taken off on a stretcher with a groin 
complaint.

The visitors continued to carve out chances but came unstuck as Kosta 
Barbarouses rampaged into their penalty area. The Kiwi was brought down by 
substitute Lu Wenjun on the edge of the box, with referee Abdulrahman Al-Jassim 
awarding the spot-kick.

The Qatari official had previously caught Victory’s ire for awarding Ingham a 
yellow card for a foul made by Berisha. But there were no complaints when the 
foul was seen to be inside the box, with Berisha dispatching the penalty 
strongly.

The Albanian missed a terrific chance to wrap up the match five minutes later, 
trickling a one-on-one chance wide and in a madcap finish, both Victory 
substitute Connor Pain and Conca hit the post, with Shanghai spurning a number 
of chances.

Shanghai led the shots count 22-11 but would leave Melbourne with no points 
from their campaign opener.

Muscat paid tribute to his side’s attacking spirit and pointed to fine 
performances from defenders Nick Ansell and Jason Geria. “We beat an excellent 
team tonight – a very, very good team,” he said. “When you work that hard, you 
come out on the right side of the ledger more often than not.”

In his 40 years in football, Eriksson said he had never seen an incident that 
led to a disallowed Shanghai goal with the score at 1-1. The referee stopped 
play as Shanghai attacked in the vicinity of a second ball on the pitch, 
leaving the Swede confused.

“It was a good football match [and] I don’t think we deserved to lose if you 
look at the football,” he said. “Five games to go and we’ll have to take points 
somewhere else.”

In the night’s other game involving an A-League side, Sydney FC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/sydneyfc> fell on their sword in Japan to 
go down 2-0 to a classy Urawa Red Diamonds.


Former J-League coach Graham Arnold was haunted by one of his former Vegalta 
Sendai players in Wednesday night’s first group-stage match, when Yuki Muto 
scored the early opener before Shinzo Koroki’s second-half penalty ensured 
Sydney are still yet to beat a Japanese opponent.


The Sky Blues started all at sea in the three-degree chill at Japan’s Saitama 
Stadium, flummoxed by the Reds’ high pressing and struggling to find space. 
Debutant central defender Zac Anderson was thrown into the cauldron as the 
centrepiece of a tweaked five-man backline.

Unfortunately for Anderson, he will remember his first club match mostly for 
the goal he handed the Reds in the eighth minute. The 24-year-old’s failure to 
clear the ball in the box allowed Muto to fire a one-touch finish straight past 
Vedran Janjetovic.

Already with the upper hand, the Mihailo Petrovic-coached Reds looked 
worryingly in danger of chewing their Australian opponents up and spitting them 
out. But the Sky Blues forced their way into the game. Or rather, Urawa invited 
them, sending a few passes astray and making a handful of errors in their rush 
for possession.

It gave Sydney a welcome look-in and numerous set-piece opportunities – though 
none were executed well enough to yield an equaliser.


Sydney had their own chance to capitalise on a Reds error when Andrew Hoole 
ran onto an errant ball in the box, but his shot was wide and nevertheless 
deflected out of play.


He would have been thankful for team-mate Chris Naumoff’s stroke of brilliance 
just before halftime that kept his side in the contest. Tomoaki Makino 
unleashed an overhead kick that would have sailed straight past Janjetovic had 
it not been for Naumoff’s instinctive goal-mouth clearance.

Janjetovic did produce a sterling save to deny Tsukasa Umesaki after the 
break, and later parried away a cracking dipper from Japan Under-23 captain 
Wataru Endo.


But he was partly to blame when Sydney put another goal on a plate for their 
opponents. This time is was Seb Ryall, who sent a backward pass into the path 
of substitute Koroki. It forced Janjetovic into an ill-timed challenge on the 
forward to give the Reds a penalty, which Koroki duly converted.

Arnold finally brought Alex Brosque and Milos Ninkovic off the bench, 
reshaping the formation and helping the Sky Blues string more passes together.


Matt Jurman had the best chance yet to provide his side with a lifeline when 
he lunged at a corner six minutes from time, but somehow missed from 
point-blank range.


Unfortunately two mistakes cost us the game,” Sydney midfielder Milos 
Dimitrijevic said. “We’ll stay positive, we’ll keep working hard and learn 
every game. Now we have to be better and not make obvious mistakes.”

The Sky Blues host reigning ACL champions Guangzhou Evergrande at Allianz 
Stadium next Wednesday night.
