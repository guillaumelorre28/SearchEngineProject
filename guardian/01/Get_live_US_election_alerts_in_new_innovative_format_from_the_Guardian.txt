On 8 November, US presidential election night 2016, the Guardian Mobile 
Innovation Lab <https://medium.com/the-guardian-mobile-innovation-lab> and the 
Guardian mobile apps team will offer an innovative way to get live presidential 
election results right on the lock screen of the Guardian’s Android and iOS 
apps.

What is it? 

We’re offering the quickest and most convenient way to get live election night 
results on mobile without a tap, a search or the opening of an app. We’ll send 
one mobile alert that will automatically update with the latest data. It is a 
highly innovative use of alert technology that will give you the up-to-date 
information whenever you pick up your phone.

What will I receive?


If you sign up, you’ll receive a single continuously updating notification 
that will sit on your phone’s lock screen as results come in on election night. 
The notification will show the most up-to-date numbers of electoral votes won 
and states called, as well as an indication of which swing states have been 
called, and the breakdown of the popular vote between the two top candidates.

 The notifications as they will appear on Android and iOS devices 
You will also be able to expand the alert to see a data visualization showing 
the electoral vote and options to tap through to the Guardian live blog or a 
page of full results.

How do I sign up?


The service is part of the Guardian app. When you open it, if you’re in the US 
you’ll automatically get an introductory screen that invites you to sign up. 
Tap that and you’re done. (If you’re outside the US, and have theAndroid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android> app, you’ll also see the 
screen.)

If you don’t see the screen, you can follow these steps to sign up: 

 * Download the most recent version of the Guardian app 
 * Go to the Settings > Alert section of the app (see below)

 * Turn on the Live US presidential election results alert 
 * Note for iOS users: You must also be running iOS 10 to sign up  <> Facebook

 Turn on election night results notifications in your app’s Alert settings

Important: This notification is entirely separate from the general alerts the 
Guardian US news desk will send at key moments on election night, such as when 
swing states are called and when the electoral vote tips over 270 and 
establishes a winner.

What if I decide I want to stop getting alerts?


Sure, no problem. When the notification is expanded (pull down to expand 
notifications on Android, and either swipe sideways to tap ‘view’ or hard press 
to expand them on iOS) there will be buttons attached to the notification, 
including an option to Opt out (on iOS) or, Stop (on Android) the notification. 
Tap that and you’ll be unsubscribed.


Are you excited?


Yes! Are you? This project is the latest installment in ongoing 
experimentation with notifications, part of theMobile Innovation Lab’s mission 
<https://medium.com/the-guardian-mobile-innovation-lab> to learn more about 
mobile storytelling. After the experiment, we’ll send out a survey soliciting 
feedback on the experience. We’re eager to hear what you think!


What exactly is the Guardian US Mobile Innovation Lab? 

The lab is a small multidisciplinary team housed within the Guardian’s New 
York newsroom, set up to explore storytelling and the delivery of news on small 
screens. It operates with the generous support of theJohn S. and James L. 
Knight Foundation <http://knightfoundation.org/>.
