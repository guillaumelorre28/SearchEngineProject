Sly and the Family Stone were the most good-time group since the Lovin' 
Spoonful. What they did with their fourth album, Stand!, wasn't rocket science â€“
Sly Stone <https://www.theguardian.com/music/sly-stone> took the live 
excitement of the Stax Soul Revue, grafted on James Brown's completely 
functional, rhythm-as-a pure-state funk, and mixed in the heightened airs of 
psychedelia (the Family were from San Francisco, after all). It's just that no 
one else had thought of it, and no one else could have made it quite as tight 
and loose, as blessed and blithe spirited.
