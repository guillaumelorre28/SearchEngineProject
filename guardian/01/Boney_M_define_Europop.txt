Move over Bill Grundy – the most scandalous pop TV appearance of 1976 was 
Boney M doing Daddy Cool on Musikbladet, Germany's Top of the Pops. Bobby 
Farrell's wild gyrations – and the band's revealing costumes – did more than 
jump-start their career. They sparked the look and ethos of Europop. 
Eye-popping costumes, gravelly spoken bits, big-lunged divas singing 
outrageously catchy nonsense – everyone from Snap! to the Black Eyed Peas has 
used this formula and they all owe a debt to Boney M.
