Nothing is more central to rock mythology than the cult of the lead guitarist. 
And no one did more to create that cult thanEric Clapton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/ericclapton>. He had already been a member 
of the Yardbirds before joining John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, the clearing house 
for guitarists, in April 1965. His two stints with Mayall saw his reputation 
grow to the extent that a famous graffito captured the popular appraisal of him 
among rock fans: "Clapton is God."
