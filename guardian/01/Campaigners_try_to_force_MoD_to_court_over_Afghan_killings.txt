The prospect of a judicial review into previously covered-up civilian 
shootings in Afghanistan has opened up after human rights campaigners launched 
an attempt to take theMinistry of Defence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ministry-of-defence> to court.

This follows the disclosure in the Guardian that a series of unusual civilian 
shootings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/british-troops-afghan-civilian-shootings>
 involving two British army units, are documented in last week's WikiLeaks 
publication ofthousands of leaked US military files 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/afghanistan-the-war-logs>.

A formal letter was sent to the defence secretary, Liam Fox, at the weekend by 
a lawyer, Phil Shiner, on behalf of the peace campaigner Maya Evans. Shiner 
said: "I am sure we will be able to get this into court."

The campaigners say the killings "require to be investigated as suspected war 
crimes" under the legislation that set up the international criminal court. 
They call on the MoD to conduct a proper investigation of the allegations.

Since the details of civilian shootings recorded in the war logs were 
revealed, MoD officials have not disputed their general accuracy, but ministers 
have failed to give any explanation, or order any public investigation.

Shiner told Fox the documents reproduced in the Guardian "Identify ... the 
killing of at least 26 civilians and the wounding of a further 20 by British 
forces".

This is a relatively small fraction of the hundreds of civilian killings 
admitted to by US forces in the course of filing war logs which were later 
leaked. Most British units barely figure in the civilian casualty reports 
collected in the field by US intelligence.

But two detachments of UK soldiers figure repeatedly, and it is unclear 
whether this exceptional pattern was ever fully investigated. One US soldier 
reported in Kabul that they could not obtain the full story of a shooting 
because "the investigation is controlled by the British".

The US field reports detail a series of four shootings of individual innocent 
civilians in the streets of Kabul, during the space of little more than a month 
in 2007, at a time when the Coldstream Guards were newly patrolling the 
capital. The incidents culminated in the death of an Afghan general's son.

In the US documents it is alleged that the following year saw a six-month 
period in which Royal Marine commando units took a regular toll on innocent 
motorists, shooting innocent drivers and motorcyclists on eight occasions for 
approaching too close to convoys.

Earlier this year, in separate proceedings, the high court gave permission for 
a judicial review of the government's failure to hold a public inquiry into the 
British army's detention policies in Iraq, amid allegations that large numbers 
of civilians were tortured.

The court said it could be argued that "the alleged ill-treatment was 
systemic, and not just at the whim of individual soldiers". It criticised the 
effectiveness of MoD proposals to investigate the claims.

Meanwhile, US army investigators seeking to trace the source of the massive 
trove of leaked logs have been questioning people with links toWikiLeaks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks>, as well as the US army 
intelligence analyst arrested in May on charges relating to an earlier military 
leak.

Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, further upped the war of words against 
the WikiLeaks website when he told ABC News: "There's a moral culpability. And 
that's where I think the verdict is 'guilty' on WikiLeaks. They have put this 
out withou t any regard whatsoever for the consequences."

Investigators are fanning out across Boston, interviewing students and 
associates of Bradley Manning, the intelligence analyst accused of leaking a 
video of a US helicopter attack in Baghdad which was posted by WikiLeaks.

Manning has not been charged with any offences connected with the Afghan war 
logs, but he continues to be held at the Quantico marine base in Virginia.

A computer expert in the Boston area told The Boston Globe 
<http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/08/01/mit_graduate_admits_link_in_leak_case/>
 today that he had been approached by US military officials. Several other 
computer experts and hackers have also been interviewed anonymously, according 
to theNew York Times <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/31/world/31wiki.html> and 
Washington Post 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/31/AR2010073103058.html?sub=AR 
.>.

A further extension of the inquiry into the leak came when Jacob Appelbaum, a 
specialist in internet privacy protection based in Seattle, was detained at 
Newark airport in New Jersey having returned to the US from Amsterdam.

Appelbaum, who has connections with WikiLeaks and has stood in for its 
founder, Julian Assange, at hacker conferences, had his laptop and three mobile 
phones seized.

According to Cnet, he <http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20012253-245.html> 
was questioned for three hours about WikiLeaks and the whereabouts of Assange, 
as well as about his views on the Iraq and Afghan wars. Appelbaum declined to 
answer any of the questions without a lawyer present.

The aggressive inquiry is considered partly designed to discourage any further 
leaking from the military.
