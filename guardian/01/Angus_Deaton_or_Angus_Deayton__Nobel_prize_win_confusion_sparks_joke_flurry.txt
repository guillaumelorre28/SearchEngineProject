The moment Scottish economist Angus Deaton was announced as the winner of the 
Nobel prize in economics, everyone did a double take.


Not because it’s an undeserved win – Deaton is best known for his work 
promoting welfare and reducing poverty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/12/angus-deaton-wins-nobel-prize-in-economics>
 – but because some people, for a second, thought perhaps actor and comedian 
Angus Deayton had won the prize instead.

For a second there I thought Angus Deayton had won the Nobel Prize.

There’s a big difference between the two. Deaton, as well as being a Nobel 
prizewinner, is the Dwight D Eisenhower professor of economics and 
international affairs at theWoodrow Wilson school of public and international 
affairs <http://wws.princeton.edu/faculty-research/faculty/deaton> at 
Princeton. Deayton, on the other hand, was once the presenter of satirical news 
show Have I Got News For You,leaving in 2002 amid tabloid allegations about his 
private life. <https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/oct/29/broadcasting.bbc6> 
He has also starred in One Foot in the Grave and Waterloo Road.

But, inevitably, Twitter <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> kept 
making the same joke about the Deaton/Deayton confusion, especially the 
latter’s apparent career change.

"No, he's Angus DEAYTON. Different guy." - repeated phrase today

Some began tweeting an unverified and probably fake Angus Deayton Twitter 
account offering their congratulations:
Tony Roberts (@bonytony) 
.@Angus_Deayton <https://twitter.com/Angus_Deayton> Congratulations on the 
Nobel Prize, you really nailed your career change! :-)

One trickster briefly updated Deayton’s Wikipedia page to say he had won a 
Nobel prize.

Someone already updated (UK comedian) Angus Deayton's Wiki page to say he won 
#NobelPrize <https://twitter.com/hashtag/NobelPrize?src=hash>. He'd be tickled 
by thatpic.twitter.com/jTOYZgX2ud <http://t.co/jTOYZgX2ud>

Except he hasn’t, as people pointed out over and over again.

It's a good day to NOT get Angus Deaton and Angus Deayton mixed up

Some people got tired of the joke pretty quickly.

Dear Twitter, stop with this Angus Deaton/Angus Deayton thing. Was only 
slightly amusing 1st time. Anyone who is funny has now done the joke

<https://twitter.com/GarryWhite/status/653539355064160256> 
But in case you are still confused: the man in the middle is Angus Deayton 
and, no, he did not win the Nobel prize in economics.

To think we were one letter away from the greatest Nobel Prize announcement 
ever. Cheers Angus Deaton / Deayton.pic.twitter.com/PGXTm5SuIW
