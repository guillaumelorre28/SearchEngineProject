The Cuban cruise

Voyages Jules Verne has a new trip for 2011: a cruise right around Cuba, 
starting and finishing in Havana. You'll stop off at four Cuban destinations – 
Isla de la Juventud, Trinidad, Santiago de Cuba and Cayo Saetie – and one on 
Jamaica, Ochos Rios. This is the first time that the Cuban authorities have 
granted permission for this particular itinerary, as cruises have previously 
only visited Havana and Santiago de Cuba, so it's a unique holiday.

• From £1,295pp for 14 days, including flights, seven nights' full-board on 
the ship and six in a five-star Havana hotel (0845 166 7003,vjv.com
