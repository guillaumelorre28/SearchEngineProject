Headland House Hotel, St Ives 

Each named after a different Cornish beach, the rooms are done up like a 
summer's day in shades of driftwood and vanilla, nautical blues and deck-chair 
stripes. You get pocket-sprung mattresses on king-size beds, bay windows with 
views across Carbis bay to Godrevy Lighthouse, White Company toiletries in 
luxury bathrooms and complimentary cake in the afternoon. There's a decked 
terrace, a snug with a licensed bar, and a long strip of sandy beach on the 
doorstep. St Ives is a 30-minute walk along the coast-path (or take the scenic 
branch-line train fromCarbis bay station 
<http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/cbb.html>).

Primrose Valley Hotel, St Ives
 Primrose Valley hotel, St Ives, Cornwall 
Within spitting distance of lovely Porthminster beach, this popular St Ives 
hotel is big on sustainable tourism (it's only five minutes' walk from the 
station, so no need to take the car). Some of the rooms are on the small side, 
but others have decked patios or sea view balconies. The decor is fresh and 
bright (lush fabrics, oak floors and original features), and there's a 
cafe-bar, a therapy room and a passion for all things Cornish (from local beers 
and Camel Valley wines toTrevaskis Farm <http://www.trevaskisfarm.co.uk/> bacon 
andDelabole salami <http://www.delifarmcharcuterie.co.uk/>). Porthminster beach 
cafe <http://porthminstercafe.co.uk/> is just across the road.

The Aramay, St Agnes
 The Aramay B&B, St Agnes, Cornwall 
At the foot of Stippy Stappy (a steep terrace of old mining cottages) in surfy 
St Agnes, this groovy little number was the AA's choice for the funkiest B&B in 
Britain award last year. It's run by music-bizz escapees Amie and Kye, and its 
style is boutique meets rock and roll: vivid colours (fuschia, lime, leather, 
peacock, a hint of gold and glitter), late breakfasts, midday check-outs, room 
service, spare wellies and a stream at the bottom of the garden. A walk 
downhill takes you to Trevaunance Cove for rockpools, restaurants and old 
engine houses (St Agnes is part of the Cornish mining world heritage site).

doubles from £105 per night

Treverbyn House, Padstow
 Treverbyn House, Cornwall 
Just up from the harbour, this Edwardian mini mansion goes for an 
old-fashioned look: antique beds (brass, French or walnut), vintage rugs on 
polished wood floors, wing back chairs and – in three of the rooms – working 
fireplaces (you can snuggle up to a real fire). Decanters of sherry are offered 
on the house. Fresh Cornish breakfasts are served in the rooms or on a decked 
terrace with fabulous views across the Camel Estuary to Rock village (the fruit 
for the homemade jams are grown in Treverbyn's own gardens). Padstow's fish 
restaurants are a short stroll down the hill.

St Moritz, Polzeath
 St Moritz, Polzeath, Cornwall 
A crusty old St Moritz was knocked down to make way for this glitzy, 
deco-style hotel, built from scratch in 2008. From ship-like decks and glassy 
portals, it overlooks the Atlantic from its own landscaped grounds and solar 
heated outdoor pool. Inside, the rooms are crisply modern (think high-spec show 
home) with oak floors and super-comfy beds – thanks to marshmallow mattress 
comforters and downy duvets. There is a lively brasserie and bar, the Sea Side 
restaurant by the pool, a gym and the Cowshed Spa. Sounds expensive. Well, yes 
(this is Kensington-on-Sea, after all) but the smaller rooms – the hotel calls 
them "cosy" – are good value. Nearby beaches include Polzeath, Rock, Daymer bay 
and, at the foot of the garden, Greenaway.• Trebetherick, 01208 862242,

Boscastle House, Boscastle
 Boscastle House, Boscastle, Cornwall 
From the village (the bit the locals call Paradise), Sean and Morwenna Gee's 
ornate period villa peeks at the Atlantic across slate rooftops and brooding 
headlands. The rooms are stylish, contemporary, with good beds and snazzy 
bathrooms (with solar-heated water). Great breakfasts, too (like spinach and 
poached egg on a toasted muffin). It takes about 15 minutes to wander down to 
Boscastle's salty little village and rocky tidal inlet – all rebuilt since the 
devastating floods of 2004. It takes twice as long to puff your way back up the 
hill.

The Old Rectory, Boscastle
 The Old Rectory B&B, Cornwall 
Back in the 1870s, Thomas Hardy fell in love with his first wife, Emma Gifford 
(the rector's daughter) while staying in this bucolic former rectory – set in 
three acres of wildflowers, hidden dells, woodland and a kitchen garden. The 
rooms are pure Victoriana (one has an en-suite thunderbox), furnished with 
chintzy florals, curios, pelmets and French polish. Breakfast includes the 
Rectory's own fresh fruit and free-range eggs. Or you can stay for dinner – 
dining on home-grown vegetables and fish and Cornish farm meats from nearby 
Boscastle.

Bangor's Organic, Poundstock, near Bude
 Bangors Organic, Bude 
When it opened nine years ago, it claimed to be Britain's first 100% organic 
B&B. Now it's one of three (the others are in Cumbria), but it still maintains 
its Soil Association standards. Just off the "Atlantic Highway" (the A39 – a 
mile from Widemouth bay), Gill and Neil Faler's low-carbon Victorian house sits 
on a five-acre smallholding. They offer two spacious eco-luxe rooms, bike 
storage, underfloor heating (powered by wind turbine) and free pick-ups for 
guests arriving on public transport. The emphasis, however, is on the food: 
home-baked, home-grown, delicious organic breakfasts and evening meals.

The Beach at Bude
 Beach at Bude, Cornwall 
A run-down hotel on Bude's Summerleaze beach was gutted and rebuilt to create 
this New England-style boutique B&B, which opened in 2011. The 15 swish rooms 
look a wee bit corporate but they want for nothing in terms of comfort 
(Vi-sprung beds, flat-screen tellies and lots of space). With a glamorous sun 
terrace overlooking the sea (one of Bude's finest beaches is metres away), it 
has a grown-up surfer vibe – mixing cool interiors, a library and a business 
centre with surf-board storage, Blu-ray players and outdoor showers. Sadly, no 
children under 12, and no restaurant, though the latter is in the pipeline.

The Bush Inn, Morwenstow
 The Bush Inn, Morwenstow, Cornwall 
A few miles from the Cornwall-Devon border, this medieval free house has got 
it all – a low beamed bar with log fires and a whiff of old smugglers, 
occasional live-music nights (local bands – like Blind Brother Stubbs or Fifers 
Ruse), simple, country-style bedrooms with Atlantic views, an all-day menu of 
reasonably priced gastro-pub food (beetroot and Cornish Yarg salad, homemade 
beef casserole with dumplings) and breakfast served until 11am. An added bonus, 
are the wild cliff-top landscapes of this rugged stretch of Cornish coast. And 
the Cornish ales, of course.
