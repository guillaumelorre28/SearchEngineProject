Untimely death is always tragic, but the timing of Aaliyah's passing at 22 was 
doubly poignant because it occurred months after the release of her greatest 
album. The self-titled third LP showed the former "street but sweet" teen star 
had grown up. Her collaborations withTimbaland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/timbaland> gave songs such as We Need a 
Resolution a sophisticated, innovative touch. They also changed the face of R&B 
for ever. When she died in a plane crash in August 2001, she was on the cusp of 
something remarkable.
