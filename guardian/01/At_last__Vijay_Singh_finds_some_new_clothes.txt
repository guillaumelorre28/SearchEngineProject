Vijay Singh has apparently decided he can no longer stand by his man. Or at 
least not stand so closely to his man.

A week after Allen Stanford was formally charged with fraud

in connection with the operations of his various financial services companies, 
and six days after Singh's agent revealed the player continued to display 
Stanford's name and company emblem on his clothing out of personal support for 
his friend

, the Fijian turned up for the AT&T National event in Washington DC this week 
having shed the Stanford logo.

Singh has always been his own man and deserves at some of the support he 
received – not least in a number of comments on this blog – for his public 
display of loyalty, as well as his respect for the legal process. But there are 
plenty of ways to show support in circumstances like this, and all of them are 
less offensive to those who have lost their money in the Stanford scandal.

It is bad enough becoming penniless through no fault of your own without 
having to watch one of the world's leading golfers flaunt the name of the 
company you believe is responsible. And whether or not Stanford himself is 
ultimately convicted, there is no argument that most of money invested with his 
companies will never be recovered.

Singh could still have supported his friend without offending the sensitivites 
of these poor people. Presumably someone, either his agent at IMG or perhaps 
someone senior at the PGA Tour, has pointed this out to him. About time.
