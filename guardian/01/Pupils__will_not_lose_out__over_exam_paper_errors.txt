 this summer will "get the grades they deserve," exam boards have said.

Qualifications regulators for England, Wales and Northern Ireland are 
investigating why mistakes appeared in 12 exam papers. Some 10 of the errors 
were in papers sat by pupils in England.

The Joint Council for Qualifications, which represents exam boards, said it 
had taken action to ensure no pupil would be disadvantaged by the errors.

In some cases, exam boards have awarded pupils full marks for rogue questions, 
while in others they have discounted the question and changed the total number 
of marks available for a paper.

It said exam boards had used "well-tested statistical procedures ... to ensure 
that all students receive the grades they deserve".

In a joint statement, the exam boards said they "deeply regret" that the 
errors occurred and "wish to apologise again to students and their families".

"Although only 12 out of more than 60,000 questions set this year were 
affected, we understand the distress they have caused," they said.

Exam boards said they had told university admissions tutors which papers have 
contained errors so that students' chances of winning places on degree courses 
would not be jeopardised.

The qualifications regulators said their investigation into why the errors 
happened would be finished before the end of the year.

The errors included a printing mistake in a maths paper, set by the AQA exam 
board, which included questions originally answered by pupils taking the same 
exam in March. Over 31,000 pupils at 567 schools and colleges took the paper.

Other errors were discovered in a GCSE Latin paper and a physics A-level exam, 
both set by the OCR exam board.
