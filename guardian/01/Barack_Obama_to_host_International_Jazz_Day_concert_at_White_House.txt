a string of musical legends includingAretha Franklin

Herbie Hancock.

The show will take place at the White House, Washington DC – this year’s host 
city – on 29 April, and will be televised a day later by ABC, to mark the fifth 
anniversary of InternationalJazz <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> Day.

“Jazz has been a uniting force and very unifying for people all over the world 
for the last century,” Tom Carter, president of the Thelonious Monk Institute 
of Jazz, told the Associated Press.
