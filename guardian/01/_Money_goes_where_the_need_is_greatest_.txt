Ungweru, means "light" in Tumbooka, the local language in Mzuzu, northern 
Malawi. Ungweru is also the name of a local grassroots NGO, which hopes to 
bring light into the communities that it serves.

One initiative that Ungweru champions is its "Pigs Pass On" project. It gives 
piglets to HIV community support groups, also handing over the responsibility 
for raising them.

Once the piglets have matured, the group's members are free to determine the 
next step. "They can sell them at the market to generate income, breed them to 
create a small scale business, or eat them as a rare source of nutrition," says 
Lucia Ngwira, project co-ordinator at Ungweru.

Today's group has decided to sell some of the second-generation piglets that 
they have bred themselves, in order to pay school fees for the local children.

"There are a large number of orphans in the village," explains Ngwira. "This 
project will not only help members of the support group, but the wider 
community too. The money can go to where the need is greatest."

This group sings and dances on the site of their new community support group 
building (which has yet to be built), they show off their pigsty with immense 
pride and, perhaps most importantly, they have found a valuable place within 
their community.

The members of the group are now eager to pursue other income-generating 
activities. "What they really want next is a maize mill," says Ngwira with a 
wry smile. "You have to admire their ambition."
