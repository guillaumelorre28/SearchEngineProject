But there was no time for getting help. Not yet, anyway. This was when things 
started to go wrong. But at first, of course, it seemed like nothing.Clouds 
always seem like that, seen from a distance

It was those journalists. The ones who'd been going through her bins. Couldn't 
leave her alone. Of course there was the drug use, and that was bad enough. I'd 
started to get used to seeing pictures of her stumbling out of a nightclub, her 
pupils dilated, her face slack.

But one of them found her father. Terence Henry Mulligrent, of no particular 
employment, living in a squat in Dollis Hill. And what a story Mr Mulligrent 
had. They had to split it into three parts. First came the touching tale of 
Vic's childhood. Then the sad story of how he'd been forced, yes forced to 
leave by her rapacious and clawing mother who was determined to have the 
child's love to herself.

But they saved the best for last. The Explosive Finale to Vic's story they 
left for the Sunday edition. He'd found his beloved daughter again after so 
many years of searching. How lucky he'd felt that her fame had allowed him to 
track her down again. He'd gone to seek her out. And what had happened? She'd 
told her bodyguards to keep him away. He hadn't even been able to talk to her! 
And now the only way left for him to contact her was via the pages of this 
newspaper. So he was pleading with her, right now. Would she welcome him back 
into her heart?

We read this piece together. I looked for signs that it had affected her, but 
she just laughed and poured herself another drink.
