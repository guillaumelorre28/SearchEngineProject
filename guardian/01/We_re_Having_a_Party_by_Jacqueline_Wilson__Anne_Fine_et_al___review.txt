There are 7 stories in this book. The first story is about a girl called 
Jemima and her magic friend Mr Maggs.

The next story is about some children getting themselves ready for school in 
the morning and getting their baby brother ready for nursery. The third story 
is about an angry baby who causes trouble on an allotment. The 4th story is 
about a boy who really wants a baby brother or sister but thinks he will never 
get one. You will have to read the rest yourself!

The stories are good because they are not too babyish and not too grown-up. 
There are some pictures but not too many. And the stories are just the right 
length to have at bedtime!
