Police <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> officers investigating child 
sex abuse are to be required to be specially trained and accredited in the same 
way as specialist firearms officers under proposals announced by the home 
secretary.

Amber Rudd <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd> said she wanted 
to see only registered officers who could demonstrate specialist skills used to 
investigate complex “high harm” crimes involving the most vulnerable people, 
such as child sex abuse.

In a speech to the College of Policing, the home secretary said the new police 
licence to practise would mean officers and staff were not forced to take on 
roles they were not prepared for or professionally trained to do.

“For too long crimes against vulnerable people have simply not been taken 
seriously enough and their voices have not necessarily been heard. They have 
been treated as second-class crimes and not always been given the attention 
they deserve,” said Rudd.

“Police professionals investigating complex cases against the vulnerable 
should hold a licence to practise so the public can have confidence that an 
officer has the necessary knowledge and skills to carry out such important 
work.”

Rudd said the proposed licence to practise, which has been put forward by the 
College of Policing, would put beyond doubt that the skills required to protect 
the vulnerable were every bit as valued and critical as those required by a 
firearms officer or any other specially trained officer.

The announcement follows last week’s scathing report by Her Majesty’s 
Inspectorate of Constabulary on the record of the Metropolitan police on child 
protection, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/25/report-exposing-met-police-failings-on-child-sex-abuse-shocking>
which showed that mistakes had been made in 75% of child sexual abuse cases.

The home secretary announced that an initial £1.9m would be made available to 
the College of Policing to develop training for frontline police officers to 
identify signs of vulnerability and provide better protection for victims. It 
will also pilot intensive courses for supervisors to give police officers a 
better chance of preventing further abuse and gathering evidence for 
investigations.

Chief Constable Alex Marshall, the head of the College of Policing, said the 
funding would support officers and staff to do their job while the new guidance 
would focus on their own welfare.

 “Vulnerability is a priority for everyone in policing and it is important 
that we protect the most vulnerable in society and the officers and staff 
carrying out this essential work,” he said.

 “To deliver the best service to the public we want our members who are 
overseeing cases involving vulnerability to benefit from an accredited 
qualification and undergo continuing professional development to keep their 
skills up to date and link learning directly to practice.”

The new guidance will set out how forces should manage the psychological 
stress of those working in high-risk areas such as firearms, undercover 
operations, counter-terrorism and child sexual exploitation.

Labour’s shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the proposed licence was 
welcome but was not a strategy to tackle child sexual abuse.

 “This offering from the Home Secretary is a wholly inadequate response to the 
magnitude of the crisis in society and the tasks facing the police.

“The Tories have cut police numbers. Their inquiry into child sexual abuse is 
failing and scandals continue to multiply. This is a piecemeal offering to the 
victims of child sexual abuse. They and we all deserve more from this 
government,” she said.
