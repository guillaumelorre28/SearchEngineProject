.

The film – which has nothing to do with the Guy Ritchie reboots starring 
Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law, or the BBC series with Benedict Cumberbatch and 
Martin Freeman – is scheduled for release next year and is currently shooting 
in London.

Will Ferrell and John C Reilly <https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-c-reilly>
 reunite after Talladega Nights and Step Brothers in the leads, while Kelly 
Macdonald, Rebecca Nicholson and Rob Brydon have already been confirmed for 
supporting roles.

The Hollywood Reporter quotes sources who suggest both Fiennes and Laurie will 
play beloved canonical figures from the books ofArthur Conan Doyle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/arthurconandoyle>. A Moriarty is not yet 
listed in the cast, but following Laurie’s villainous turn in The Night 
Manager, bets are off as to who is the more likely candidate.

Etan Cohen is writing and directing; his most recent credit was the 
Ferrell/Kevin Hart jail farce Get Hard.
