Dissident republicans were blamed today after a suspected mortar bomb was 
fired at a police station inNorthern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland>.

The device missed the barracks in Craigavon, Co Armagh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/armagh>, and caused no injuries.

A year ago a policeman was shot dead by the Continuity IRA not far from the 
scene of this attack. Dissidents were behind last week's murder of Kieran 
Doherty, 31, in Derry as well as a number of other attacks on police stations.

Sinn FÃ©in <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sinn-fein> assembly member 
John O'Dowd said: "This attack was wrong and should not have been carried out. 
I would challenge those who claim to speak politically for these factions to 
tell the republican and nationalist community exactly how these sorts of 
activities, or indeed the recent murder in Derry, advance the cause of a united 
Ireland one iota."
