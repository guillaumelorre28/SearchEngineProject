The rate of aircraft accidents is at a historical low, despite the series of 
high profile crashes in recent years that have seen a rise in the number of 
fatalities.


Figures from the Bureau of Aircraft Accident Archives 
<http://www.baaa-acro.com/presentation/> (BAAA) make the Germanwings crash in 
the Alps the 17th such incident in 2015 compared to 33 that occurred up to the 
same point in 2014.

It also takes the total number of fatalities for 2015 so far at 247, which 
assumes the 150 on board today’s Germanwings crash have all died.

In 2014, the BAAA say 1,328 died in aircraft accidents - the highest annual 
fatality figure since 2005 due to a series of crashes including AirAsia flight 
QZ8501

 andthe downing of MH17 in Ukraine 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/despite-high-profile-tragedies-air-safety-remains-tight-say-experts-1419785686>
 . The organisation counts military transport planes and any aircraft capable 
of carrying six or more passengers.

The Aviation Safety Network put the number of fatalities, excluding QZ8501, at 
526 for 2014 <http://aviation-safety.net/statistics/period/stats.php?cat=A1>, 
the highest since 2010. The ASN figures only include aircraft capable of 
carrying 14 or more passengers and excludes military aircraft.It also 
reportedly excludes casualties from hostile actions, such as the MH17 incident 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/despite-high-profile-tragedies-air-safety-remains-tight-say-experts-1419785686>
.

Using annual aircraft departure figures collated by the World Bank 
<http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.DPRT?page=1> and the International 
Civil Aviation Organization 
<http://www.icao.int/Newsroom/NewsDoc2014/COM.48.14.EN.pdf>, we can calculate 
the rough accident and fatality rate per million departures for the BAAA and 
ASN (with AirAsia added) figures up to 2014. I say rough as the coverage of 
countries in the World Bank dataset varies from year to year.

For comparison, I’ve also included aircraft accident rates up to 2013 from a 
report produced by Boeing

The rate of accidents for 2014 is at the lowest since at least 1973 and the 
overall trend is towards flights having fewer accidents overall.

Despite the decreasing rate for accidents, the rate for fatalities has 
increased in 2014 over 2013, though historically it is still relatively low, 
with the overall trend being downwards:

This is consistent with fewer accidents but the crashes that did happen in 
2014 were particularly severe in terms of lives lost. This is especially 
apparent when you look at the ratio of fatalities to accidents:
