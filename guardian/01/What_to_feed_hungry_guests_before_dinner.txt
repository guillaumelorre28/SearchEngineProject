Besides olives and Doritos, what can I serve my guests 
before a meal when the food is running late and everyone's 
getting a bit peckish?
Matilda Keating, Orkney

A reasonable selection of interesting nibbles can take the place of a starter 
and, if you give just a little thought to what you will serve, much of the work 
can be done in advance. Here's a selection of nibbles you'll be proud to serve 
your peckish guests ...

Thinly slice an aubergine lengthways and sprinkle with salt. Leave to drain in 
a colander for at least an hour, pat dry and then bake in the oven in a little 
olive oil until soft and golden, being careful not to let them go crisp. 
Meanwhile, soften some goat's cheese in a bowl with a little lemon oil, a few 
capers and some fresh herbs. Once the aubergine strips have cooled, spread on 
the goat's cheese and roll into neat cylinders.

Old favourites such as cheese straws – the perfect foil to pre-dinner drinks – 
are easy to make and can be prepared in advance. Use ready-rolled puff, a 
decent parmesan and don't forget the cayenne.

To keep the smoked salmon lovers happy, hard-boil some quail's eggs, wash and 
blanch some large spinach leaves and have some thin strips of smoked salmon and 
a jar of creamed horseradish handy. Spread a little of the horseradish on the 
salmon, place the egg on the end and roll up, making sure it is not too bulky. 
Wrap each bundle with the blanched spinach to create what looks like a plate of 
leafy green eggs.
