The screenplay comes from Boardwalk Empire creator Terrence Winter, whose 
credits also include The Wolf of Wall Street and 50 Cent drama Get Rich or Die 
Tryin’. He will use Victor Bockris’s 1989 book Warhol: The Biography as 
inspiration, with Leto acquiring rights.

Warhol shot to fame in the 1960s with his unique take on American consumerism 
and quickly became a fixture in the New York club scene. He was also openly gay 
at a time when homosexuality wasn’t readily accepted. Amid his success, he 
suffered from hypochondria and was the victim of an attempted murder in 1968.

He has previously been played by Jared Harris in the 1996 indie I Shot Andy 
Warhol and John Cameron Mitchell in the recently canceled HBO series Vinyl, 
also written by Winter.

Leto drew criticism from the LGBT community for being a straight man playing a 
trans character in Dallas Buyers Club, a role that won him an Oscar. He also 
recently spoke out about the problems facing gay actors in Hollywood.

“I definitely don’t think a gay leading man would have the same opportunities 
as a straight leading man,”he said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/04/jared-leto-hollywood-conservative-gay-leading-men>
. “I don’t know if that’s offensive or not, but that’s my thought right now. It 
shouldn’t be that way. This is still a very conservative business.”

Leto was recently added to the cast of Blade Runner 2 alongside Ryan Gosling 
and Harrison Ford and is rumoured to be reprising the role of the Joker in next 
year’s Justice League.
