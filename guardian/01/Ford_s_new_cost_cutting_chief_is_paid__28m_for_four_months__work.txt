Alan Mulally <https://www.theguardian.com/business/alan-mulally>, the former 
Boeing executive brought in to slash costs at Ford, earned $28m in four months 
last year when the stricken cars group lost a record $12.7bn.

Mr Mulally, who replaced Bill Ford <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ford> 
as chief executive on September 1, was paid $666,667 in 2006, implying an 
annual salary of $2m, but received a bonus of $18.5m - including a $7.5m hiring 
bonus and $11m to compensate for giving up performance and stock option awards 
at Boeing.

His remuneration package was outlined in a proxy statement to the US 
securities and exchange commission, and emerged a day after Mr Mulally said 
Ford must do "whatever it takes" to make its cost structure, including the 
17-18% of budget comprising wages and benefits, competitive.

Credited with turning around Boeing's commercial aircraft division to the 
point where it has regained its primacy over Airbus after five years in the 
European planemaker's slipstream, Mr Mulally also earned $8.7m in stock options 
and was given compensation worth an extra $334,433, including relocation costs 
and $173,000 for required use of the corporate aircraft.

Mr Ford earned no salary, bonus or stock options because he had forsworn any 
new compensation until the group achieved sustainable profitability. He did, 
however, gain $10.5m, mainly from earlier options.

Mr Mulally dropped a heavy hint on Wednesday that he would be seeking a wage 
freeze or pay cuts in talks with the United Auto Workers union this summer. The 
company is closing a dozen plants in North America and axing 35,000 jobs as 
part of the new chief executive's turnaround programme.

Rick Wagoner, his counterpart at General Motors, which lost $10.4bn in 2005 
and $2bn in 2006, received no bonus last year and agreed to halve his $2.2m 
salary to help cut costs.
