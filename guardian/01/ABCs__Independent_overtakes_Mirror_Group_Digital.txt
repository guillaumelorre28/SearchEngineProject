The Independent <https://www.theguardian.com/media/theindependent> overtook 
Mirror Group Digital in March to become the fifth-largest national newspaper 
website in the UK, according to the latest Audit Bureau of Circulations figures 
published on Thursday.

Independent.co.uk grew daily unique browsers by 3.4% between February and 
March to 644,331. Monthly unique browsers grew by 13.33% over the same period 
to reach 14,528,315.

This was enough to put it ahead of Mirror Group Digital, its national website 
network that includes Mirror.co.uk, 3am.co.uk and MirrorFootball.co.uk, which 
reported month-on-month declines in monthly and daily browser numbers.

MGD, which suffered a major loss in traffic

 in February following a website relaunch, saw a further 11.8% month-on-month 
decline in daily unique browsers in March to 583,800.

Monthly browsers declined by 5.9% month on month to 12,342,893.

newspaper groups have recorded audited figures; the previous time was in 
September last year.Trinity Mirror 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/trinity-mirror> has had its websites audited 
since February 2008, and the Independent since August 2007.

Mail Online saw the landmark 100m monthly browser target recede last month 
with slight declines in traffic. Daily unique browsers dropped 5.77% to 
5,414,336.

 – fell 0.39% month on month to 90,789,741 in March.
