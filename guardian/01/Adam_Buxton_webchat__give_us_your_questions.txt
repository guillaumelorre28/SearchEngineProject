There is no better time to talk to Buxton, with the station controversially 
due to be closed next year underplans put forward by the BBC's director 
general, Mark Thompson 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/mar/02/bbc-6-music-asian-network>.

The proposal prompted a furious response from listeners 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/mar/12/bbc-complaints-close-6music> – 
with more 160,000 people signed up to a "Save 6 Music" Facebook group to date – 
and protests from trade unions, the music industry and the station's own DJs.

Buxton's response? Challenging "Thommo" Thompson to a fight
