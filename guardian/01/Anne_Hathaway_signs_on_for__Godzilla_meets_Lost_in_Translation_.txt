Anne Hathaway <https://www.theguardian.com/film/anne-hathaway> will continue a 
streak of thoughtful blockbuster fare – after appearing in Christopher Nolan’s 
Interstellar and The Dark Knight Rises – with a lead role in Colossal.

According to the Hollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-anne-hathaway-star-colossal-794762?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews&utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News_now_2015-05-12%2003%3A20%3A47_rford>
, the Oscar-winning actor has signed on to director Nacho Vigalondo’s next 
project, which has been pegged as “Godzilla meets Lost in Translation”.

Hathaway will play Gloria, a woman who moves back to her hometown after losing 
her job and her fiance. After she hears reports of a giant lizard attacking 
Tokyo, she comes to realise she has a kind of psychic connection with it. “In 
order to prevent further destruction,” the Hollywood Reporter said, “Gloria 
needs to determine why her seemingly insignificant existence has such a 
colossal effect on the fate of the world.”

Vigalondo broke out in 2007 with ambitious thriller Timecrimes. He recently 
directed Open Windows, starring Elijah Wood. “Colossal is my most ambitious 
script so far, and probably the most personal one. Having Anne and this 
terrific team around goes beyond my craziest expectations,” he said.

Hathaway will next star in the Nancy Meyers comedy The Intern as the head of a 
fashion website who hires Robert De Niro as an intern. She will also appear in 
the Disney sequel Alice Through the Looking-Glass.
