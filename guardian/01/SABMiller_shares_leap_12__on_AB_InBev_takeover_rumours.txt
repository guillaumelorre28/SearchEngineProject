SABMiller <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sabmiller> shares have leapt 
by more than 12% on reports that the brewer might prove the target of a £75bn 
takeover bid.

The value of the company, which sells beer brands such as Foster's and Coors, 
surged after the Wall Street Journal said Anheuser-Busch InBev, the owner of 
Budweiser, was talking to banks about raising finance for an acquisition.

A tie-up between the world's two largest brewers has been rumoured for years, 
but the speculation has been revived by the surge in international mergers this 
year. The Journal added thatAB InBev 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/anheuser-busch> was not in active 
discussions with SABMiller, but was attempting to line up financing before 
making a formal approach.

The news came after Heineken rejected a takeover offer from SABMiller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/15/heineken-rejects-sab-miller-takeover>
 after the founding family of the Dutch brewer insisted it should remain 
independent.

In a statement on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/15/heineken-rejects-sab-miller-takeover>
 intended to quell press speculation, Heineken confirmed it had been approached 
by London-listed SABMiller, the world's second-largest brewer, but said the 
proposal was "non-actionable".
