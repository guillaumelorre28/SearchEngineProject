My mum has just died and I am upset by the mean-spirited attitude of Axa Sun 
Life insurance <https://www.theguardian.com/money/lifeinsurance>. Last June, 
Axa offered Mum an increase to her funeral payout, from £962 to £1,212, if she 
agreed to use Co-operative Funeralcare when she died. I signed on her behalf 
and explained that she had Alzheimer's, and that I was looking after her 
financial affairs.

When she died we used the Co-operative, but Axa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/axa> refuses to honour the offer as my 
mum did not actually sign the document herself. I feel I am being penalised for 
being honest – I could have forged her signature. Instead I am struggling to 
pay for her funeral.JW, Bristol

Axa says it needs to see a power of attorney or court protection order before 
it can accept someone else's signature on a customer's behalf. But Citizens 
Advice told you a power of attorney was not necessary, because your mother's 
affairs were very simple. You had already arranged to receive her pension after 
proving your position with various official documents, including birth 
certificates, and believed that Axa would also accept this evidence.

On looking at your complaint more carefully, Axa realises that it is only fair 
to pay you the higher amount. It is sending you a cheque for £250.
