It's easy to forget that, pre-Bobby Brown and drugs, Whitney Houston 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/whitney-houston> was once a record-breaking 
artist, not just an early sign of pop's imminent annexation by all things R&B 
but an old-fashioned diva, too. It was in her DNA, of course (Aretha Franklin 
is her godmother, Dionne Warwick her aunt). By the time her second album, 
Whitney, was stripped of singles, she'd managed seven consecutive US No 1s 
(three came from her debut) – one more than the Beatles. It was a long way down 
from there.
