Henry is a librarian with a chromosome defect that catapults him from one time 
period to another. He materialises in and out of his present, past and future, 
naked and confused. Throughout his chaotic, uncontrollable life, he maintains a 
relationship with Clare, whom he meets when he is 36 and she is six. Odd as the 
circumstances are, while he drifts in and out of her present time, she grows up 
and they marry. Somehow, they eke out a life together and manage to have a 
child. But there are events in Henry's life to which he returns, reliving 
nightmares he can't change and having to deal with the knowledge he gains from 
travelling into the future. As an audiobook, the dates and times can be 
confusing, but stick with it; they are, in the end, irrelevant to the story's 
meaning and listeners can engage in a magical way that defies time and space.
