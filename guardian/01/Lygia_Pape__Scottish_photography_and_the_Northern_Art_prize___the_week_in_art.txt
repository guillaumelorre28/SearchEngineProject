Lygia Pape: Magnetised Space 
<http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2011/03/lygia_pape.html>
This Brazilian artist who shoved abstract forms up against the grit of real

Anselm Kiefer <http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/anselm_kiefer/>
The weight of memory, the grotesqueries of imagination and the power of 
symbols have no greater champion in the art of today than Kiefer. His sense of 
scale and texture make his art often inexplicably moving.
• At White Cube <http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/anselm_kiefer/>, Bermondsey, 
London SE1, from 9 December until 26 February 2012

Correggio – Venus with Mercury and Cupid 
<http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/correggio-venus-with-mercury-and-cupid-the-school-of-love>
, c1525
The supple sensuality of this painting encompasses not just the gods' golden, 
melting flesh but the rustic mistiness of soft foliage. Correggio is one of the 
boldest artists of myth, as well as a great religious painter, and this scene 
of divine family life speaks like a pastoral poem.
• At National Gallery, London

Rembrandt – A Woman in Bed 
<http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/simple-search/R/4413/artistName/Rembrandt%20%28Rembrandt%20van%20Rijn%29/recordId/5353>
, c1645-6
This almost shockingly intimate painting shows a young woman pushing back a 
red and gold curtain as she leans upon a lace pillow. The luxurious fabrics and 
the gold ornaments in her hair suggest a mythic setting. She might be waiting 
anxiously for a god or a king – or this may be a portrait and her lover could 
be Rembrandt.
• At Scottish National Gallery 
<http://www.artfund.org/scottish-national-gallery>, Edinburgh

JE Millais – Portrait of Benjamin Disraeli 
<http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw00408/Benjamin-Disraeli-Earl-of-Beaconsfield>
, 1881
When Vincent van Gogh worked for an art dealer in London, he wrote to his 
brother Theo lamenting the poor standard of British 19th-century art. One 
exception to his disapproval was Millais. This powerful portrait shows why Van 
Gogh was right to rate the eminent Victorian. It is a moving homage to a 
politician who did so much to shape modern Britain and is arguably the 
architect of our democracy through the 1867 Reform Act.
• At National Portrait Gallery, London

Ary Scheffer – Francesca da Rimini 
<http://www.wallaceprints.org/image/322949/ary-scheffer-francesca-da-rimini>, 
1835
This morbid and darkly memorable romantic painting illustrates Dante's 
14th-century poem Inferno. In the second circle of Hell, Dante meets Francesca 
da Rimini, sentenced to eternal damnation for a sin all too easy to understand: 
forced into an arranged marriage, she had an affair. Scheffer makes her an icon 
of doomed love.
• At the Wallace Collection, London

Francis Picabia – The Fig-Leaf 
<http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=11848&tabview=image>, 1922
In Paris after the first world war there was a "call to order", a revived 
traditionalism in art, as critics and artists called time on modernism. 
Picabia's harlequin-like silhouette pokes fun at this moment of neoclassicism, 
going along with the new refinement yet intimating some terrible wickedness and 
diabolical threat below the fig leaf.
• At Tate Modern <http://www.artfund.org/tate-modern>, London
