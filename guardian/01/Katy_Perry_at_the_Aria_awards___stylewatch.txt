Imagine a Goth mermaid, the survivor of several storms, washing up on the Aria 
red carpet in crystal barnacles … that was Katy Perry on Wednesday night, in a 
two-piece, midriff-baring outfit by West Australian designer Jaime Lee Major.

Her outfit included a bib-style front made from lace sourced “exclusively from 
France, onyx crystal beads and patent leather”,according to Perth Now.

The “intricate, hand-beaded creation took Major approximately 400 hours to 
make and retails for $6,600”, the website claimed.

Perry capped off her Goth mermaid look with a Minnie-the-Mouse style black 
headband and a forehead tightening bun.

Jaime Lee is a favourite with popstars. She also dressed Kimbra on the red 
carpet at the Arias in 2011 and at the 2013 Grammy awards, where she wore a 
“Broome-inspired” turquoise tulle gown covered in 2kg worth of fresh-water 
pearls. Shakira and Lady Gaga have also worn Jaime Lee creations.

Sadly it was a brief appearance in Jaime Lee for Perry. The popstar later 
changed for the ceremony itself, where she accepted an award on behalf of an 
absent Sia wearing a gold collar studded with oversize cameo brooches. Think 
less onyx crystal beads than oxen harness.

The verdict? Thumbs held horizontally. But whatever: have you heard the woman 
ROAR?
