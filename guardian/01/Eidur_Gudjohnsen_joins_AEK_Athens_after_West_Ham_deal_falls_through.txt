The former Chelsea and Barcelona forward Eidur Gudjohnsen has signed for the 
Greek sideAEK Athens <https://www.theguardian.com/football/aekathens> on a 
two-year deal.

The 32-year-old had been close to a move to West Ham United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/westhamunited>, but after the deal 
stalled he quickly decided on AEK.

The Icelandic international has played for Tottenham Hotspur, Stoke City and 
Fulham in the past 18 months but said he is now looking forward to the 
challenge of playing in a new country.

"I'm happy and excited to be here," Gudjohnsen told AEK's website. "It is a 
new step in my career and a challenge for me. I will give it my all."

Gudjohnsen won the Eredivisie with PSV Eindhoven as well as back-to-back 
Premier League titles during his time at Chelsea, while his spell at Barcelona 
culminated in winning the treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and the Champions 
League.
