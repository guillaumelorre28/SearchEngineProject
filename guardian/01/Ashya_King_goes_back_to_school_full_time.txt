The father of brain cancer survivor Ashya King 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ashya-king> has said he is proud as his 
son returns to school full time.

Brett King said six-year-old Ashya was doing very well after recovering from 
proton beam therapy for his rare condition.

King and his wife, Naghmeh, sparked an international manhunt after they took 
Ashya, then aged five, from Southampton general hospital without doctors’ 
consent in August 2014.

They were arrested a few days later in Spain and spent several nights in 
prison away from their son before being released. A high court judge later 
approved the move to take Ashya to Prague for proton therapy.

A report by the Portsmouth safeguarding children board found their actions had 
put Ashya at risk, but, speaking to ITV’s Good Morning Britain, King has again 
defended his actions.

He also told the programme that while his son still faced a few problems, he 
was delighted Ashya would be back in full-time education. “There are still a 
few issues – he is wobbly on his legs and his speech is a bit strained, but he 
is a fighter; he does not give up and he is prepared to try anything.”

He added that he and his wife expected their son to make a full recovery and 
to return to “the boy we had before”.

Proton therapy was not offered to Ashya on the NHS, although the health 
service later agreed to fund his treatment.Several new centres offering the
