Lucy Kabatha was the first agricultural goods supplier in Nanyuki to sign up 
to a groundbreaking insurance project developed by the Syngenta Foundation for 
Sustainable Agriculture (SFSA).

Kabatha is something of a minor celebrity to the farmers of Nanyuki. Her shop, 
Sunrise Agrovet, is often the first port of call for farmers having difficulty 
starting up or maintaining a farm. As the pioneer Kilimo Salama shop, it is 
working closely with SFSA to improve the livelihoods of farmers in the region. 
Kilimo Salama is an SFSA-led scheme whereby farmers can insure their maize, 
beans, sorghum and wheat crops against unpredictable rainfall. Initially, as 
one would expect, farmers were reluctant to trust an insurance scheme that 
promised so much, yet it has become a huge success.

Kabatha, who previously owned a beauty salon, decided to become an 
agricultural goods supplier because her husband is a vet. "I have developed so 
much since then," she says, adding that working with farmers is incredibly 
fulfilling. "It is more interesting than anything else," she enthuses.

Like many people in agriculture, she hopes her children will consider 
continuing her work, emphasising how crucial it is that the progress made by 
farmers in Kenya is not lost or wasted. A change in attitude is needed, she 
stresses, so that there will be food security in the future.
