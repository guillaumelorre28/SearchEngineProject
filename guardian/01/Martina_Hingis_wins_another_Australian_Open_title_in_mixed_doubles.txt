Martina Hingis won her second Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> mixed doubles title on 
Sunday as she teamed up with India’s Leander Paes to beat last year’s winners, 
France’s Kristina Mladenovic and Canada’s Daniel Nestor, 6-4, 6-3.

Hingis, a three-time winner of the women’s singles at Melbourne Park, also won 
four women’s doubles titles and the mixed doubles title with Mahesh Bhupathi in 
2006.

The 34-year-old Swiss returned to top-class tennis as a doubles specialist two 
years ago in her second comeback after injury and then a ban for a positive 
test for cocaine, which she denied taking, forced her into retirement.

Hingis, who made the US Open final last year with Flavia Pennetta but lost to 
Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina, first played at Melbourne Park 20 years 
ago.

The 41-year-old Paes won the mixed double titles at Melbourne Park in 2003 
with Martina Navratilova, who watched the final on Rod Laver Arena and was 
thanked by Hingis afterwards.

It was the first time Paes and Hingis, who were seeded seventh, had played 
together at a grand slam event.
