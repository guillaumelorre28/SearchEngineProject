12 Years A Slave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/dec/11/12-years-a-slave-trailer-steve-mcqueen-video>
 (15)
(Steve McQueen, 2013, US/UK) Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Lupita 
Nyong'o, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano. 134 mins

What with the acclaim, the awards buzz and the harrowing subject matter, 
finally seeing McQueen's slavery drama now feels like a duty. But this is an 
"issue movie" unlike any other, both in its deliberate formalism and its 
under-represented history. Along with Ejiofor's abductee, we're fully immersed 
in a slavery system so brutally oppressive even the expression of suffering is 
forbidden. McQueen gives us a study of institutionalised cruelty, the forces 
propping it up and its innumerable victims.

The Railway Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/sep/10/the-railway-man-trailer-colin-firth-nicole-kidman>
 (15)
(Jonathan Teplitzky, 2013, Aus/UK) Colin Firth, Nicole Kidman. 116 mins

Middle-aged romance is rapidly derailed by events of the past in this earnest 
bio-drama, as Kidman spurs Scotsman Firth to revisit his Asian prisoner-of-war 
days, first through flashback, then through direct confrontation with his 
Japanese tormentor.

The Square <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twB2zAOzsKE> (15) 
(Jehane Noujaim, 2013, Egy/US) 108 mins

The recent Egyptian revolution is fully evoked in this first-hand doc, which 
navigates the street-level chaos via three friends at the heart of the Tahrir 
Square protests – first against Mubarak, then the military, then the Muslim 
Brotherhood. The initial hope and unity steadily give way to discord and 
uncertainty, but this isn't the end of the story.

Delivery Man <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGAktL45XNQ> (12A) 
(Ken Scott, 2013, US) Vince Vaughn, Chris Pratt, Cobie Smulders. 104 mins

No-hoper Vaughn's sperm-donor days come back to haunt him in the form of 533 
offspring, in this remake of a French-Canadian comedy that wasn't all that 
hilarious to begin with.

After Tiller <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf3rETOO62s> (NC) 
(Martha Shane, Lana Wilson, 2013, US) 85 mins

Sensitive, level-headed documentary on the four remaining doctors performing 
late-term abortions in the US (since Dr George Tiller was assassinated in 
2009). Humanity cuts through politics, as we focus on the doctors and their 
distressed patients.

1: Life On The Limit <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKTX7_3BVsA> (12A) 
(Paul Crowder, 2013, US) 112 mins

Another white-knuckle racing doc to sell Formula One to those who didn't get 
Senna or Rush (ie: Americans). The focus is on the sport's most dangerously 
exciting era, the 1960s and 70s, when drivers were real men and safety was for 
wimps.

Exposed: Beyond Burlesque <http://vimeo.com/58822331> (18) 
(Beth B, 2013, US) 76 mins

Uninhibited documentary positioning striptease as a subversive art form, as 
practised by male, female, transgender and disabled performance artists.

Kiss The Water <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZucCVHaKA> (PG) 
(Eric Steel, 2013, US/UK) 79 mins

The gentle art of fly fishing eulogised in a semi-animated documentary centred 
on the late Megan Boyd, Scottish fly-tier extraordinaire.

Mad Max-style post-apocalyptic dystopia.
