Anne Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> lost to 
New Zealand's Marina Erakovic in the first round of the Texas Open after a 
final set tie-break.

The British No2, who is 80th in the world rankings, looked poised to earn a 
fine win over the 54th-ranked Erakovic in Dallas after leading by a break of 
serve in the deciding set.

But the Croatia-born Erakovic, who at 24 is four years Keothavong's junior, 
broke back and edged through 6-1, 5-7, 7-6.

Erakovic later teamed up with the British No1 Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> in doubles to get the better 
of Elizabeth Lumpkin and Yasmin Schnack, overcoming the little-known American 
pair 6-2, 2-6, 10-8.

Britain's Emily Webley-Smith was handed a late call for the tournament, 
entering as a lucky loser when the German top seed Angelique Kerber withdrew on 
Tuesday due to a minor shoulder injury.

Webley-Smith did not last long though, beaten 6-1, 6-2 by the Croatian 
qualifier Mirjana Lucic.
