Piedmont Park

There are paths here for running, walking and biking, lawns for game-playing 
and grassy knolls for picnicking and lounging. The rolling hills of Atlanta's 
central park, in the heart of Midtown, encompass the peaceful Lake Clara Meer – 
which had a cameo in the final scenes of the 2011 movieThe Change-Up 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1488555/> – as well as a public pool, dog park, 
and 30 acres of botanical gardens. The park holds a Saturday farmers' market, 
and has hosted outdoor movie nights, concerts (including a performance by 
Ludacris) and marquee musical festivals, such as the recently revived Music 
Midtown, which takes place in the autumn.

The Martin Luther King Jr Center for Nonviolent Social Change

Few people have had as powerful an impact on civil rights around the world as 
Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who was born and raised, preached in and laid to rest 
in Atlanta. His legacy of nonviolent social change is memorialised at the King 
Center, where you can view his Nobel peace prize and Bible, among other pieces 
of memorabilia. King's tomb is in the outdoor plaza at the centre of a 
meditation pool. Pause for a moment to enjoy the beautiful and fragrant World 
Peace Rose Garden before walking a few blocks on Auburn Avenue to King's 
birthplace and the historicEbenezer Baptist Church

The Atlanta Beltline's Eastside Trail

An award-winning smart growth project, the Atlanta Beltline is an in-progress 
22-mile loop of parks, trails and transit network that is helping make 
Atlantans a little less car-obsessed. The Eastside Trail opened in 2012, and 
since then locals have swarmed the 2¼-mile paved path that stretches from 
Midtown's Piedmont Park to the residential neighbourhood of Inman Park. 
Walkers, runners, bikers, and the occasional rollerblader weave in and out on 
the just-wide-enough path that skirts theHistoric Fourth Ward Park 
<http://www.h4wpc.com/>, a separate skate park, and connects with the Freedom 
Parkway Path, which will take you all the way toStone Mountain 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Mountain> if you're up for a workout.
• Access the Eastside Trail at Monroe Avenue and 10th Street, beltline.org

The Goat Farm Art Center

This former cotton gin mill turned arts compound is an industrial warren of 
lofts, artist studios and residencies, as well as venue for touring bands, 
local art exhibitions and performances … andThe Hunger Games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142857/hunger-games> shoots. On the 
Westside, the city's de facto art and design district, you can stop by the Goat 
Farm any time to grab a drink at the Warhorse Coffee Shop (it serves beer, 
too), or a quick lunch at the soup cart: a hand-painted Indonesian cart that 
offers a new menu every Wednesday in the courtyard in front of the Warhorse.

Westin Peachtree Plaza hotel and Sundial restaurant-bar
 Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel, Atlanta 
A curved glass anomaly on Atlanta's skyline, the Westin Peachtree Plaza was 
designed byJohn Portman <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Portman,_Jr.>, 
the world-famous Atlanta architect equally loved and loathed for the 
anti-street aesthetic he brought to downtown. But the Westin is a bit 
different: where most of Portman's designs forgo the cityscape's exterior 
bustle to focus on elaborate interior atriums, this skyscraper has its 
elevators on the outside to take in the glorious views as it ascends 73 storeys 
in 85 seconds. Get off at the observatory's View Level to see 360-degree 
panoramas of the city, which you can enjoy from the comfort of the Sundial, a 
rotating restaurant and bar.
• 210 Peachtree Street NE, +1 404 589 7506, sundialrestaurant.com 
<http://sundialrestaurant.com/>. Admission to View Level observatory $8 adults, 
$4 kids 6-12 years, free for under-6s; open daily from 10am-till closing

Fox Theatre

Constructed in the early 20th century as a romantic tribute to 
Moorish-Egyptian design, this movie palace indulges in rich jewel tones, 
intricate architectural details and trompe-l'oeils. When the Fox Theatre first 
opened, the local newspaper described it as having, "a picturesque and almost 
disturbing grandeur beyond imagination". While it's impressive from the 
outside, do yourself a favour and take thebehind-the scenes tour 
<http://www.foxtheatre.org/tours.aspx> (Mon, Thurs, Sat, adults $18, kids under 
10 free). The most spectacular trompe-l'oeil is the main theatre's ceiling: a 
faux sky with twinkling stars and floating clouds. It is still one of Atlanta's 
premiere performance venues, hosting touring Broadway shows, A-list comedians 
and popular bands.

Historic Oakland Cemetery

Gone With the Wind author Margaret Mitchell, golf great Bobby Jones, former 
Atlanta mayors Maynard Jackson and Ivan Allen Jr are among the notable local 
figures are buried in this stunning Victorian-era cemetery. Wander the brick 
pathways that twist and turn between beautiful mausoleums and gardens. It's the 
perfect place for a picnic while taking in some Atlanta history. There's an 
arboretum, the confederate memorial and burial grounds, as well as Potter's 
Field, a lush meadow that serves as the resting place for approximately 7,500 
of Atlanta's indigent population laid to rest before 1900.

Chattahoochee river

Summers in landlocked Atlanta are hot - super hot. Luckily, the city has the 
Chattahoochee river, a national recreation area surrounded by hiking and biking 
trails that are accessible at different entry points around the city. When it 
gets unbearably steamy, locals flock to the river to "shoot the hooch 
<http://www.shootthehooch.com/>": basically a lazy summer afternoon spent 
drifting down the river in an inner tube, canoe, or kayak.

Broad Street

This walkable couple of blocks in one of the oldest parts of the city is home 
to a number of wallet-friendly restaurants and cafes, including local favourite
Dua Vietnamese Noodle Soup <http://www.yougotpho.com/>. Grab some pho, a slice 
of pizza, a sandwich, or some coffee, and enjoy it at one of the many tables 
set up along the street. It's the perfect place to people watch and take in 
some of downtown's historic architecture: Broad Street is bordered on one side 
byAtlanta's Flatiron building 
<https://plus.google.com/112668538320419093073/about?gl=uk&hl=en>, which 
actually predates New York City's by five years. There's more seating across 
Peachtree Street at Woodruff Park, with views of a large, picturesque fountain 
and a cool playground. The best time to visit is during the working week; the 
street clears out once city employees have left.
