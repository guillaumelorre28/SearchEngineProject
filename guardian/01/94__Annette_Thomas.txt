American by birth and a biologist by training, Thomas will have enjoyed this 
year more than 2011, when Macmillan Education was ordered to pay Â£11m for 
paying officials to win an education deal in South Sudan.

This year the publisher promised a "major investment" in a new King's Cross 
campus, which will unite divisions in Basingstoke and Oxford with London-based 
Pan Macmillan. Its imprints include Pan and Picador.

Put in charge of the company after eight years running its science publishing 
division, Thomas has an impressive scientific background, having spent four 
years at a Yale research lab. She joined Macmillan in 1993 as an editor at 
Nature magazine, after rejecting the research scientist's path.
