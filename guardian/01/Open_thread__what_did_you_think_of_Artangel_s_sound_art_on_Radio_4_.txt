At 9.02 this morning, Radio 4 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio4> 
seemed to have been taken over by aliens. The words "Are you still on? Sorry 
I've lost you" followed by a hearty yawn were followed by a random selection of 
presenters' voices seemingly talking over one another. Only when the voices 
started to stutter did it become apparent that this wasn't a mistake.


In fact it was a sound installation by Christian Marclay, famous for his 
24-hour film The Clock 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2011/apr/07/christian-marclay-the-clock>
,the first of five three-minute "audio interventions" 
<http://www.artangel.org.uk/open/open_air> produced for Radio 4 by Artangel, 
famous for facilitating ambitious works outside galleries, includingJeremy 
Deller's restaging of the battle of Orgreave 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2013/jan/14/artangel-seeks-wacky-ideas> 
andRoger Hiorns's Siezure 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/jul/06/roger-hiorns-seizure-demolition-yorkshire>
, which saw the interior of a house in London encrusted with blue crystals.

Tomorrow at the same time, straight after the Today programme, Ruth Ewan 
<http://www.ruthewan.com/> will get her turn on the airwaves, followed by Peter 
Strickland 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/23/peter-strickland-berberian-sound-studio>
,Susan Hiller <http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/susan-hiller> and Mark 
Wallinger <http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/mark-wallinger>.

In a piece in the Telegraph today 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9943302/Artangel-Art-takes-over-the-airwaves.html>
 about the initiative, Artangel's Michael Morris says that the works mark a 
drive by Radio 4 controller Gwyneth Williams to allow artists a platform on the 
station, not just to discuss their work but to make it. So expect similar 
interventions in future. Will you welcome them?
