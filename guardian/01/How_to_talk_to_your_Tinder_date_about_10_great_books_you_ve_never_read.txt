Picture the scene. After some mutual right-swiping on Tinder, you and the 
man/woman of your dreams have met for a drink and maybe more. Worryingly, the 
conversation has turned to literature – and you’ve barely opened a book since 
you left school. Do you come clean and hope your natural charm will make up for 
your ignorance?

Of course you don’t. In a survey for the BBC 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/the-book-most-people-have-lied-about-reading--and-its-not-war-an/>
, one in four of us admitted to lying about books we think we ought to have 
read – usually because we don’t want to be left out of the conversation or want 
to seem more intelligent. The other three-quarters probably lie too, but they 
can’t even tell the truth about that.

It’s easier if you’ve seen a lot of TV adaptations. But if you haven’t? Don’t 
despair. Here’s all you need to bluff your way through some of the most 
lied-about novels, and some lines to turn the conversation in a more promising 
direction.

What happens: As Napoleon rampages across Europe, Russian aristocrats Pierre 
and Natasha fall for unsuitable suitors. It all ends happily, as the 
cheese-loving Frenchies get a pasting and our blueblooded heroes get together 
to oppress the serfs and raise a family.

What to say: “It’s extremely long, you know. And so’s Tolstoy’s book.”
