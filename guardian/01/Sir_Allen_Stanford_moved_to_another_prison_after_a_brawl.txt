The renegade financier Sir Allen Stanford, awaiting trial in Texas on $7bn 
(Â£4.4bn) fraud charges, is being moved to a different jail by US authorities

Stanford, who bankrolled Twenty20 cricket tournaments, had complained 
repeatedly about conditions at the Joe Corley Detention Centre, a private 
facility in the town of Conroe where he shared a cell with ten others. After 
representations by lawyers, a judge ordered authorities to move him to a 
federal detention centre in central Houston, saying this will make it easier 
for the former billionaire to meet with counsel in preparation for his trial 
Stanford's lawyer, Kent Schaffer, said the only way to communicate with 
Stanford had been to hold up documents to a window and shout through two-inch 
thick glass. Schaffer gave few details of the fight in which Stanford was 
injured, other than to say: "The reality is violence happens in any jail."
