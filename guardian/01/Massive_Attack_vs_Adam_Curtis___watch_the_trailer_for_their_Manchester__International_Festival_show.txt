The film-maker Adam Curtis <http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/adam-curtis>
 has provided a glimpse of the new work he is prepating with Robert del Naja of 
Massive Attack for the Manchester International Festival – a piece that he 
calls "a Glim – a new way of integrating a gig with a film".

It has also been revealed that the show, titled "Massive Attack v Adam 
Curtis", will feature two guest performers:Elizabeth Fraser 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/nov/26/cocteau-twins-elizabeth-fraser-interview>
, formerly of the Cocteau Twins, and reggae singer Horace Andy.Massive Attack 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/massive-attack> will also play live.

"The show will be a bit of a total experience. You will be surrounded by all 
kinds of images and sounds," said Curtis, director of films including The 
Century of the Self and The Power of Nightmares. "But it is also about ideas. 
It tells a story about how a new system of power has risen up in the modern 
world to manage and control us. A rigid and static system that has found in 
those images and sounds a way of enveloping us in a thin two-dimensional 
version of the past.

"A fake, but enchanting world which we all live in today – but which has also 
become a new kind of prison that prevents us moving forward into the future."

The collaboration between the Bafta award-winning director and Massive Attack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/massive-attack> has been commissioned 
especially for the Manchester International Festival, for which the Guardian is 
media partner. Of his pairing with Del Naja, Curtis added: "What links us is 
not just cutting stuff up – but an interest in trying to change the way people 
see power and politics in the modern world. To say to them – have you thought 
of looking at it like this?

"We've used film, music, stories and ideas to try and do this – to build a new 
kind of experience. The best way we can describe it is 'a Gilm' – a new way of 
integrating a gig with a film that has a powerful overall narrative and 
emotional individual stories."

The show also involves United Visual Artists, Felix Barrett of the theatre 
company Punchdrunk <http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/punchdrunk> and stage 
designerEs Devlin <http://esdevlin.com/>.
 Robert Del Naja of Massive Attack live on stage in 2008. 
"I will tell you this: we are going to be doing something we've never done 
before and we will be messing with music we've never even gone near before,"Del 
Naja told the Guardian recently 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/may/24/massive-attack-robert-del-naja>. 
The newtrailer <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ssws7s8lvY> for the work also
