Having displayed his action chops on The Dark Knight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/122806/dark.knight>, Aaron Eckhart is 
to star in a science-fiction tale, Battle: Los Angeles 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i7c31f644b1ae0cdc73ecffb61ab47532>
, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

In what sounds like classic B-movie fare, and a world away from the indie 
dramas in which he first came to public attention, Eckhart will play a marine 
platoon leader who defends Earth against aliens.

It will be his first starring role in an action movie, after his acclaimed 
performance as Harvey Dent/Two-Face in Christopher Nolan's $997m (Â£668m) 
grossingBatman <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/batman> sequel. Young South 
African director Jonathan Liebesman, who shot the horror prequel The Texas 
Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, will direct, working from a script by Chris 
Bertolini. Battle: Los Angeles has no start date as yet, and there are no other 
casting details.

Eckhart's star has clearly risen in Hollywood since the success of The Dark 
Knight. The 40-year-old actor, who made his name in lower budget films such as 
In the Company of Men andThank You for Smoking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/112704/thank.you.for.smoking>, is also 
set to star opposite Jennifer Aniston in the romantic drama Travelling, about a 
widower whose book about coping with loss turns him into a bestselling 
self-help guru.
