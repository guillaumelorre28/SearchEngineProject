Margaret Mitchell House

The first port of call for Gone With The Wind fans, thanks to its central 
location in midtown, the ground floor of this redbrick house is a museum that 
includes the apartment where Margaret Mitchell wrote most of her novel. 
Mitchell and her second husband, John Marsh, occupied one of 10 apartments 
crammed into the Tudor-revival building she nicknamed The Dump. The apartment's 
two small rooms plus a galley kitchen and bathroom look much as they would have 
when Mitchell lived there between 1925 and 1932. Further rooms have displays of 
photographs of Mitchell and there is a half-hourly guided tour, which talks you 
through her childhood and how she bluffed her way into journalism.

Georgian Terrace Hotel

Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable and Olivia de Havilland all stayed at the hotel 
while attending the Gone With The Wind premiere, held atLoew's Grand Theatre on 
Peachtree Street <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loew%27s_Grand_Theatre>, which 
burned down in 1978, and the after-gala in its Grand Ballroom. The movie's 
black cast members could not attend because of Georgia's segregation laws. In 
1921, long before she wrote the novel, a young Margaret Mitchell attended a 
French-themed party at the Georgian Terrace Hotel, scandalising onlookers – 
Scarlett style – by performing a risque dance with a male partner. In the 
now-renovated hotel lobby Mitchell, in 1935, hesitantly handed over the 
original manuscript of her one and only novel to her future editor.

Atlanta-Fulton Central Library

The Atlanta-Fulton Central Library, built in 1980, replaced the original 
Carnegie Library, which Mitchell's father co-founded. Her Remington typewriter 
is now on display in the library along with photos and artefacts including her 
1937 Pulitzer prize for Gone With The Wind. Some of the reference books 
Mitchell used to fact-check her novel form part of the library's small 
fifth-floor special collection.

Oakland Cemetery

In 1949, Mitchell was killed by a speeding car on Peachtree Street while on 
her way to the movies with her husband, John Marsh. She was buried at Oakland 
Cemetery, a historic oasis at the highest point of the city. Atlanta's modern 
skyline is visible beyond the walls of this beautifully kept 48-acre space that 
contains more than 6,900 Confederate graves from the American civil war and a 
separate African-American section dating from the days of slavery and 
segregation. One of the most photogenic tombs is the Austell mausoleum, where 
General Alfred Austell, founder of the Atlanta National Bank is buried. As the 
camera peers over Scarlett O'Hara's shoulder in the movie, his name appears on 
the cheque that she signs to the tax collector to save Tara.

Atlanta Cyclorama

When in town in for the 1939 premiere of Gone With The Wind, Clark Gable 
visited the Cyclorama, a 360-degree panorama depicting the Battle of Atlanta. 
Completed in 1887, it was once the world's largest oil painting. The movie star 
remarked that the only way the painting could be improved was if he was in it. 
And, so the story goes, his face was added to one of the figures in the 
foreground. Go and spot his image in this quirky feature of the Civil War 
Museum in Grant Park, a mile south of Oakland Cemetery.

Gone With The Wind Museum

To go deeper into the Gone With The Wind story, take a 30-minute drive 
north-west of Atlanta to the Gone With The Wind Museum on historic Marietta 
Square. The museum, an old warehouse where freight trains thunder past, 
displays Scarlett's honeymoon gown and original promotional material for the 
film. Other exhibits include the personal script that belonged to Ona Munson, 
who played Rhett Butler's best pal, brothel keeper Belle Watling. Although the 
movie's Hattie McDaniel became the first black actor to win an Oscar, for her 
performance as Mammy, the movie and the book have been criticised for their 
poor representations of African Americans. A small educational display makes a 
go of tackling this issue.

Stately Oaks

The Stately Oaks mansion in Jonesboro is as close to Tara as you can get now 
that Mitchell's ancestral home, the Fitzgerald mansion, is no more. At Stately 
Oaks, guides in period costume give a detailed hourly tour of the Greek-revival 
home and its exquisite locally made 19th-century furniture. Ask nicely and 
they'll rate the southern accents of the three leading British actors in Gone 
With The Wind. Several outbuildings include a sharecropper's cabin, an old 
schoolhouse and a country store selling local goods and Gone With The Wind 
whatnots.

Gone With The Wind fans in search of Tara, the O'Hara plantation house, will 
need to travel 30 minutes south of Atlanta to the "Official Home of Gone With 
The Wind", Clayton County, where Margaret Mitchell set much of the novel. The 
Road to Tara Museum, in an old train depot in Jonesboro, is filled with Gone 
With The Wind memorabilia including the original cotton pantalettes from the 
movie, the ones Mammy struggles to lace Scarlett into. A daily 1pm bus tour 
(adults $24.95, kids $13.95) takes in several locations related to Jonesboro's 
civil war history, accompanied by stories and events about the county and 
Mitchell's relations that neatly tie in with Gone with the Wind plots and 
characters.

Twelve Oaks

If, like Scarlett, you have a taste for the finer things in life, treat 
yourself to a stay in an authentic antebellum mansion. Plump for the one 
Margaret Mitchell used as the inspiration for Ashley Wilkes's home in the 
movie. Built in 1836, it's an impressive house fronted by several pillars. It 
was opened to the public in 2012 as a luxury B&B with gardens and an outdoor 
pool. A 45-minute drive east of Atlanta in Covington, the house has been 
tastefully renovated and named after the Wilkes mansion. There's even a Frankly 
Scarlett suite.

Long before it became a southern institution serving fried chicken, collard 
greens and "Champagne of the South" (that's sweet tea to non-locals), Blue 
Willow Inn, a turn-of-the-century neoclassical mansion, was the home of the 
Upshaw family. Margaret Mitchell visited many times while courting Redd Upshaw, 
her first husband and the inspiration for Rhett Butler. It's well worth the 
45-minute drive east of Atlanta to The Blue Willow in the small town of Social 
Circle. General Sherman's March to the Sea, mentioned in Gone With The Wind, 
passed through in November 1864. It's now a restaurant with a buffet deal for 
lovers of southern food. Frankly, give a damn and make the journey!

Mitchell's Gone With The Wind, begin in April, covering several locations in 
town plus vouchers for the museums in Marietta and Jonesboro.
