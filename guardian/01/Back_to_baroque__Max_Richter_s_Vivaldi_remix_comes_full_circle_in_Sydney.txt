Playing 18th-century instruments with gut strings, the ABO is “hardcore”, says 
Richter, whose own work is Vivaldi for the 21st century, with long looping 
rhythms, minimal shimmering passages stretching time. For the first time in 26 
years, ABO’s artistic director Paul Dyer will swap his harpsichord for a laptop 
and Moog synthesiser, while a modern harp replaces the baroque harp. Aside from 
these substitutions, the instruments all date from Vivaldi’s time.

Solo violinist Brendan Joyce says the orchestral language of Recomposed is 
more “ascetic” than the original in some ways, more lush in others, as if 
Richter has pushed Vivaldi to extremes. It’s romantic music too, with achingly 
beautiful ethereal violin solos underpinned by thrumming motor rhythms derived 
from 60s minimalism and 70s and 80s electronica.

Just 25% of Vivaldi’s original notes remain. “But that’s not to say the DNA of 
Vivaldi isn’t all over the place,” says Richter. “Pretty much everything is 
infused by Vivaldi atoms or haunted by his ghost, you might say. He’s there all 
the time, but in terms of dots on the page he’s almost never there!”

Paradoxically for a remix, Richter wrote Recomposed the old-fashioned way – 
with a pencil. “I thought: well okay, I’m going to remix this, using all those 
standard computer processes like cutting and pasting and looping and time 
stretching and reversing, but I’m going to do them on paper.”

And then there’s the tablet app, setting Vivaldi’s original alongside 
Richter’s update. “It’s just a brilliant, brilliant thing,” he says. “You can 
solo individual instruments, you can have different camera angles, you can see 
the score, you can hear what the back of the seconds are doing, it’s just mad!”

At its heart, Recomposed is a conversation between past and present, between 
traditional composition andtechnology, between one extraordinary composer and 
another. The ABO’s performance on Vivaldi-era instruments will complete the 
cycle, paying homage to the “beautifully made, very radical and thoughtful” 
music that Richter first heard as a child, only to fall out of love with 
through overfamiliarity.

And it’s a journey listeners can share, says Richter. “If we think of the 
original as a landscape that Vivaldi made for us, it’s really just taking a 
detour through that landscape, trying to examine it afresh and trying to see it 
anew.”
