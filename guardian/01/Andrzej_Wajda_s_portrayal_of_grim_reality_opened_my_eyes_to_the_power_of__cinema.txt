I was especially saddened to hear of the death of the great Polish director 
Andrzej Wajda (Obituary

October;Editorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/the-guardian-view-on-andrzej-wajda-a-voice-for-humanity>
, 11 October).

As a teenager, I had pretty typical young tastes in film – cowboys, space, war 
etc. Then one night, for reasons that escape me, I stayed up to watch Kanał, 
the second film of Wajda’s war trilogy, shown on the BBC in the days when it 
still showed such things.

To say I was blown away is an understatement. The film opened my eyes to what 
film could be, and how it could show the world as it really is, not just a 
fantasy adventure.

So thank you, Andrzej, for introducing me to a world of film that has stayed 
with me to this day.
