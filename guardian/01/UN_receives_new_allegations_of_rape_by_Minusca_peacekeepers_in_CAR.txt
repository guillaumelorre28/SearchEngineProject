Maestracci declined to give the nationality of the troops involved, but 
sources said they were from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The contingent 
was serving in the town of Bambari, north-east of Bangui.

The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, fired Minusca’s mission chief last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/12/un-peacekeeping-chief-central-african-republic-resigns-babacar-gaye>
, saying “enough is enough” after a string of allegations of child sex abuse 
and other misconduct by the 12,000-strong force.

Ban has denounced sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers as a “cancer in our system”.

Minusca, which took over from an African Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africanunion> mission nearly a year ago, has 
been hit by a series of allegations involving its soldiers. There have been at 
least 57 claims of misconduct, 11 of which possibly involve child sex abuse.

The UN security council expressed outrage and anger on Tuesday over the 
mounting allegations and reiterated the responsibility of countries that 
contribute troops to investigate.

Maestracci said UN peacekeeping officials had requested a meeting with the 
country whose troops are involved in the latest allegations to discuss them.

Minusca is also investigating allegations of rape by troops from Morocco and 
Burundi.

In June Ban appointed a review panel led by the former Canadian supreme court 
justice Marie Deschamps to look into how the UN handled separate allegations 
that French and African troops sexually abused children in the Central African 
Republic beginning in late 2013.

Its findings are expected in the coming months.
