Sean Penn <https://www.theguardian.com/film/seanpenn> is one of the defining 
actors of our generation. A two-time Oscar-winner, his presence alone can add 
nuance and gravitas to the lightest of projects. These projects now includeThe 
Angry Birds Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/09/the-angry-birds-movie-review-game-spin-off-that-doesnt-quite-reach-lego-movie-levels>
, in which all he is asked to do is growl. It’s a wonderful growl, full of 
depth and sorrow, but where does Penn stand among history’s other one-note 
characters?

Movie.
Portrayed by: Sean Penn.
Line: “Grrr.”

What does it mean? “Dear distressingly spherical green pigs, your abduction 
and subsequent housing of my unborn children inside your bizarrely 
dynamite-strewn shacks will not stand. I may look like a flying tumour, but my 
determination is real. Sirs, prepare to die.”

Portrayed by: Vin Diesel <https://www.theguardian.com/film/vin-diesel>.
Line: “I am Groot.”

What does it mean? “I am a tree. I do not adhere to the basic principles of 
time. I exist outside the realms of your petty ephemera. Chop me down and I 
will simply resprout. I have seen so much that all I can be certain of is my 
name. I am Groot. We are Groot.”

.
Line: “Hodor.”

What does it mean? “My name is not Hodor. Hodor is simply the only word I 
choose to say, thanks to a great, unseen trauma in my past. However, I am 
strong and loyal, and the actor who plays me can’t believe his bloody luck.”

Project: Looney Tunes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pTFYBL96ZY>.
Portrayed by: Mel Blanc.
Line: “Meep meep.”

What does it mean? “I am the worst cartoon character in the history of 
animation. I am perfect and unobtainable. Look at this idiot coyote, with his 
madcap schemes and human flaws. He is a fool, and you are a fool. If you have 
ever related to me, even in the smallest way, you are probably a sociopath, and 
you should be ashamed of yourself.”

Project: Team America: World Police 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jan/14/team-america-world-police-review>.
Portrayed by: Trey Parker.
Line: “Matt Damon.”

What does it mean? “Along with Sean Penn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/seanpenn>, I represent the stereotype of 
outwardly caring but inwardly self-absorbed celebrity. Although I desperately 
want to be a part of Hollywood’s liberal agenda, I am doomed forever to repeat 
my own name in a funny voice.”

Project: Arrested Development 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/arrested-development>.
Portrayed by: Justin Lee.
Line: “Annyong.”

What does it mean? “Hello. That’s all it means. It isn’t even my name. I’m 
just saying ‘Hello’ in Korean, but this dysfunctional family of entitled 
nitwits haven’t even taken the time to look beyond my basic courtesy. This joke 
gets old fast, which is why I don’t appear much after series one.”

Project: The Muppets <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/the-muppets>.
Portrayed by: Richard Hunt.
Line: “Meep.”

What does it mean? “I have shut down. Years of abuse at the hands of Dr Bunsen 
Honeydew have caused me to withdraw so far into myself that he can no longer 
hurt me. Blow me up all you like, Honeydew. Set fire to my hair again. You 
can’t hurt me, because I barely exist. I am a silent, eternal anguished howl in 
Muppet form.”

Portrayed by: Gabor Csupo, Liz Georges and Matt Groening.
Line: A dummy suck.

What does it mean? “I am young, and yet I see all. Although my personality 
hasn’t sufficiently formed to take in the chronic dysfunction that propels this 
family, know that I am always watching, and that one day I will find a way out.”
