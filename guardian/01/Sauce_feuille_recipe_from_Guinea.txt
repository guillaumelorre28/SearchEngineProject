This is one of my favourite Guinean dishes. Normally it's made with "potato" 
leaves but since that is more difficult to find here in New York, I substitute 
it with spinach. It taste just as good â€¦ or close. Here it goes!

Ingredients:

About 2lbs of meat (cut into large cubes)
1 large onion (diced)
2 scallion (spring onion) strands (chopped)
1 large tomato (diced)
2 Jamaican (scotch bonnet) peppers (whole)
Salt, black pepper, 1 big Maggi cube, garlic powder (and whatever other 
seasoning you like)
4 large tablespoons of tomato paste
1 cup of palm oil
1 bag of frozen chopped spinach

Steps:

Put 1 cup of palm oil in a deep pot.

When the oil is hot, add your seasoned meat (salt, pepper, seasoned salt and a 
small Maggi is enough to season the meat beforehand).

When the meat is browned, add the diced large onion and chopped scallions.

After about three minutes, add diced large tomato. Stir occasionally so the 
bottom of the pan does not burn.

Add tomato paste and mix. The key here is to let the paste become a darker 
shade of red. Three minutes is enough. Add about four cups of water. (You don't 
want to add too much water or the spinach will become too mushy and you'll have 
to wait much longer for the water to reduce).

Add your seasonings: salt, black pepper, 1 big Maggi cube, garlic powder (and 
whatever other seasoning you like). Also add the Jamaican peppers.

Cover pot and bring to a boil over high heat for about 10 minutes then add the 
bag of spinach.

Cover pot, lower heat and let simmer for about 30-40 minutes or until the 
water from your sauce is almost gone.

Serve over white rice (or brown if you are trying to be healthy). Voila!

Bon Appetit.
