HBO, the US TV network behind The Sopranos, Girls and True Detective, is to 
remake 70s sci-fi thriller Westworld with a host of blue-chip talent:Anthony 
Hopkins <https://www.theguardian.com/film/anthony-hopkins> and Evan Rachel Wood 
will take starring roles, and JJ Abrams will produce.

Westworld <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld>, set in the 
near future, imagines a theme park that recreates the Wild West, complete with 
artificially intelligent cowboys that visitors can shoot and kill, as well as 
pliant robots who agree to sexual encounters. A malfunction spreads through the 
robots, causing them to turn violently against the park's human visitors – with 
a robot gunslinger played by Yul Brynner most lethal of all. Released in 1973, 
it was directed by Michael Crichton, and was an early adopter of CGI.

Now HBO is expanding the action into a long-form TV series, a "dark odyssey 
about the dawn of artificial consciousness and the future of sin",according to 
the Hollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/anthony-hopkins-evan-rachel-wood-676206>
. Hopkins will play the "brilliant, taciturn and complicated creative director" 
of the park, while Wood will play an android farmer girl "who is about to 
discover that her entire idyllic existence is an elaborately constructed lie."

JJ Abrams, who is currently shooting his Star Wars sequel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/star-wars-episode-vii>, will produce the 
show, following his backing of blockbusting TV series Revolution, Person of 
Interest, Almost Human and Believe, the latter alongside Alfonso Cuarón.
