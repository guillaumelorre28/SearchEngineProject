Mourning loss of The Independent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/theindependent>, a vital liberal voice in a 
British press dominated by Tory papers. Thoughts with good journos losing jobs

The enthusiasm and loyalty of Indy staff is hard to beat. Very sad to see it 
disappear from newsstands

No newspaper has such agenda setting front pages as The Indy. It always 
grabbed your attention (pic via@suttonnick <https://twitter.com/suttonnick>)

The future may be online, but quite sobering to consider the political balance 
of UK newsstands once the Indy goes.

Shitty news about Indy. Didn't have sodding clue what I was doing when I 
started there. Was given a chance, learned from some amazing people
