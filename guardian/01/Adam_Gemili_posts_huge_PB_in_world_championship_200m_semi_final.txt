Adam Gemili <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-gemili> ran the fastest 
200m by a Briton for 19 years as he broke the 20-second barrier to roar into 
the final at the world championships.

The 19-year-old obliterated his personal best for the second time on Friday by 
clocking 19.98sec to win his semi-final at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium.

Gemili bettered his personal best, also set on Friday morning in the 200m 
heats, by nearly two-tenths of a second and became the second-fastest Briton of 
all-time over 200m, after John Regis.

It catapulted the London-born sprinter into medal contention as he went 
through to Saturday night's final as the second fastest qualifier behind Usain 
Bolt.

Gemili, who finished 0.02sec ahead of Jamaica's 100m finalist Nickel Ashmeade, 
was ecstatic at the finish line: "I can't believe it. Honestly that is the best 
feeling in the world. Twenty seconds, to break that, I'm over the moon.

"I didn't realise it was me. I was looking across when I crossed the line and 
I didn't know if I had qualified. I made the final and I have run a PB and I am 
so grateful to so many people who I have to thank, but I still have to stay 
focused for the final tomorrow.

"Whatever happens now, I've put myself in amongst the best 200m guys in the 
world. I can't ask for more than that. It's crazy, I'm speechless."
