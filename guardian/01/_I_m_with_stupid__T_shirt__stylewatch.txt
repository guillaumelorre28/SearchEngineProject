Sick of dressing like you’re invisible? Bored with blending into the crowds in 
your black suit and navy tie?

Never been stopped on the way to work by street-style photographers wanting to 
capture your latest looks? Struck by the maudlin feeling that you could walk 
the streets ofBrisbane <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/brisbane> 
and no one would look at you twice?

Satisfied customer Iain Fogerty, 44, of Brisbane, jazzed up his otherwise 
normcore outfit of jeans and Yankees capwith an “I’m with stupid” T-shirt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/08/queensland-man-arrested-waving-lnp-campaigners-im-with-stupid-t-shirt>
 – and the crowds went wild.

Hanging out at an intersection in the trendy Fortitude Valley precinct with 
friends from the Liberal party, Fogerty and his T-shirt were greeted with the 
sort of frenzied attention that most fashionistas can only dream of.

Looking like the maturing leader of a boy band – Fogerty’s white “I’m with 
stupid” T-shirt stood out in a backdrop of blue T-shirts.

Although his LNP friends arguably had better hair and more fashionable 
sunglasses, their ocean blue all-caps Robert Cavallucci MP T-shirts (the man to 
Fogerty’s right added the exciting touch of wearing a collared shirt, sleeves 
rolled up under the T-shirt) did not provoke the same response as the “I’m with 
stupid” T-shirt. Youth does not always trump style.

Queensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> police were 
among those who enthusiastically mobbed the state election’s first fashion 
superstar.

Arriving in three patrol cars and a paddy wagon, they converged on Fogerty and 
took him away to no doubt discuss his fabulous T-shirt.

Before images of Fogerty wearing his T-shirt went viral, he was just your 
average Joe who operated aparody Campbell Newman Twitter account

Now he’s been noticed. You could be too … in Queensland you’ll never walk 
alone again (to the paddy wagon) wearing an “I’m with stupid” T-shirt.
