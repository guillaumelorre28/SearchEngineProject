Inside Out review – high IQ family entertainment

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/23/inside-out-review-high-iq-family-entertainment>
On only three occasions this year has a studio occupied the top two spots in 
the UK box-office chart. Universal managed it in June, and again earlier this 
month. Now it’s Disney’s turn, withInside Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/inside-out> and Ant-Man delivering a one-two 
for the studio. Both hits are the result of strategic acquisitions for the 
deep-pocketed entertainment giant: Pixar in 2006 and Marvel Entertainment in 
2009.

With £7.34m without the benefit of previews, Inside Out has given Disney-Pixar 
one of its best UK openings, especially for a non-sequel. Brave, the last 
non-sequel, debuted in Scotland first, but its first full weekend of UK play 
grossed £2.60m plus £2.67m in previews. Before that, Up set off with £6.41m and 
no previews. Ratatouille, WALL-E and Cars all opened smaller than Up. The 
Incredibles debuted at a single cinema in November 2004, and then recorded 
£6.26m plus £3.49m in previews for its first weekend of wide play. A year 
earlier, Finding Nemo grossed £7.38m in its first weekend of wide play – 
slightly bigger than the Inside Out debut number, and with significantly lower 
ticket prices.

 Ant-Man - video review 
According to Disney, the company’s exit polls show a significant adult skew 
for the Inside Out audience, suggesting that the film can play strongly midweek 
as well as at weekends, and in showtimes that include the late evening slot – 
traditionally a challenge for family films. Ant-Man fell a relatively slim 37% 
in its second session, although it’s worth bearing in mind that rain on Friday 
and Sunday proved a boon to cinemagoing overall.Jurassic World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-world> fell only 12% from the 
previous frame, for example, and Minions 16%. Over the whole seven days, 
Ant-Man added a robust £5.61m, for a 10-day tally of £9.62m.

The impact of rain can be seen in daily fluctuations of individual films’ 
grosses. Inside Out, for example was strongest on Friday and Sunday, and weaker 
on Saturday, when sun returned to much of the UK. In general, films performed 
best of all on Sunday. Usually, Saturday is the strongest day for cinemagoing 
in the UK.

 Inside Out - video review 
The winner 2: Secret Cinema

Once again, Secret Cinema’s The Empire Strikes Back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/12/secret-cinema-the-empire-strikes-back-review-the-force-is-weak-with-this-one>
 recorded its best-ever weekend figure, although only very marginally up on the 
prior frame, which was the previous record holder. Over the whole week, Secret 
Cinema added £410,000, of which £305,000 was achieved over the weekend period. 
During the summer holiday period, the challenge for the brand is to push the 
grosses on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday closer to weekend levels. (Secret 
Cinema isn’t open on Monday.) Based on performance so far, The Empire Strikes 
Back is headed for a £6.5m gross, a very handy addition to the film’s existing 
UK tally of £9.0m.

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/amy-winehouse-review-documentary> 
Despite dropping out of the top 10 chart (it’s in 11th place) and recording a 
fall in box-office of 24%, Asif Kapadia’s Amy proved another of the weekend’s 
success stories. The film shed 43% of its cinemas, meaning that its screen 
average went up by a healthy 33%. The Sunday performance was particularly 
strong. Among the film’s top 20 sites for the weekend, only four showed 
declines in box-office compared to the previous frame, and many are positively 
surging. Including Monday takings, Amy has now overtaken Touching the Void 
(£2.64m) to become the fifth highest-grossing non-concert documentary in the 
UK, behind Fahrenheit 9/11, Deep Sea 3D, March of the Penguins and Kapadia’s 
own Senna. With little competition currently on offer in the 
non-blockbuster/indie space,Amy <https://www.theguardian.com/film/amy> looks 
set to extend its strong run for at least another week.

 Southpaw – video review 
The reviews tended to be sniffy (the Guardian’s own Peter Bradshaw called it 
“hammy”, “cynical” and “increasingly dull and overwrought” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/23/southpaw-review-gym-bunny-gyllenhaal-cant-save-this-heartless-boxing-film>
) but Southpaw benefits from a highly marketable redemptive premise and 
credible talent elements including director Antoine Fuqua and star Jake 
Gyllenhaal, coming off his acclaimed turn in Nightcrawler. Currently, audience 
appreciation (8.1/10 at IMDb) is running far ahead of critical response (57/100 
at Metacritic).

A bulked-up Gyllenhaal, battling to regain custody of his young daughter, 
proved a strong draw, with a robust opening of £1.66m. That compares with a 
debut of just over £1m including £59,000 in previews for Nightcrawler last 
October. Prisoners, boosted by a top-billed Hugh Jackman, kicked off with 
£1.37m including £38,000 previews in September 2013. Even Prince of Persia: The 
Sands of Time, which benefited from audience familiarity with the videogame 
source material, opened smaller (£1.37m) thanSouthpaw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/southpaw>, back in 2010. For a bigger 
Gyllenhall opening, you’d have to go back to January 2006 and Jarhead, which 
began with £1.93m.

 Jurassic World: watch the trailer - video 
For the seventh weekend in a row, Jurassic World has achieved box-office 
greater than £1m. (Handy comparison: Avengers: Age of Ultron grossed £341,000 
in its seventh frame.) The dinosaur picture’s latest box-office addition pushes 
it past The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, making it now the ninth 
biggest film of all time in the UK, with £61.5m.

 The Legend of Barney Thomson: watch an exclusive clip from Robert Carlyle’s 
directing debut 
With a very decent £163,000 from 70 cinemas, Robert Carlyle has scored a nice 
directorial debut withThe Legend of Barney Thomson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-legend-of-barney-thomson>. Distributor 
Icon had a clear strategy to release widely in Scotland and much more modestly 
in the rest of the UK. This follows the pattern of past Scottish-skewing hits 
including Peter Mullan’s NEDS and Ken Loach’s The Angels’ Share. (Proclaimers 
musical Sunshine on Leith also evidenced a Scottish skew, but was released much 
more aggressively across the whole UK.) Icon’s Scottish strategy began with the 
film’s launch on the opening night of June’s Edinburgh international film 
festival. It’s adapted from Douglas Lindsay’s Glasgow-set novel The Long 
Midnight of Barney Thomson.

Half-year report

UK cinema admissions up 10% on back of 2015 blockbusters
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/24/uk-cinema-admissions-up-10-per-cent-first-half-2015-blockbusters-bfi>
Admissions numbers (number of tickets sold) are in for June, and they show a 
healthy 27% uptick on June 2014 – a month, it must be admitted, that was 
hampered by a relative dearth of strong titles due to a clash with the Fifa 
World Cup. Still, June 2015’s admissions tally is the strongest for the month 
for at least nine years. (The UK Cinema Association’s website doesn’t show 
monthly admissions prior to 2007.) Overall, admissions for the first six months 
of the year are 10% up on the same period in 2014, giving cinemas a very strong 
cushion in a year that appears to have a back-loaded release calendar with 
Spectre and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. So far, 2015 has already delivered 
two films – Jurassic World and Avengers: Age of Ultron – that are bigger than 
anything released in 2014, and Minions looks on target to provide a third. Add 
in Spectre and The Force Awakens, and that’s very likely five 2015 releases 
generating bigger grosses than 2014’s top hit (The Hobbit: The Battle of the 
Five Armies, with £41.3m).

 Trailer for Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation 
Thanks to the arrival of Inside Out and relatively strong holds from existing 
titles, takings are a decent 26% up on the previous frame and a tidy 72% up on 
the equivalent frame from 2014, when Dawn of the Planet of the Apes retained 
the top spot, ahead of new entrants Hercules and The Purge: Anarchy. For the 
coming session, cinema bookers have their hopes pinned onMission: Impossible – 
Rogue Nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/24/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-review-tom-cruise-just-wont-let-this-franchise-self-destruct>
, which has already earned rave reviews in the trade press. Tracking reports, 
however, suggest audience interest in the Mission: Impossible franchise has 
dipped now that it’s reached the fifth entry, 19 years after the original. 
Competition is offered by Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara in action comedy 
Hot Pursuit, which earned a rather soft $34.6m in the US. Also in the mix: Adam 
Sandler in The Cobbler; Belgian horror Cub; and family film Doctor Proctor’s 
Fart Powder.
