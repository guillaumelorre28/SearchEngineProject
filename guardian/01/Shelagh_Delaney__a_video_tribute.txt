As a major of revival of Shelagh Delaney's A Taste of Honey opens in Sheffield 
<http://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/event/a-taste-of-honey-12/>, it's time to 
remember the debt owed to the playwright, who died last year, by many writers – 
even the songwriter Morrissey.

A major dictionary of theatre on my bookcase, dating from the mid-1990s, 
doesn't even mention the Salford-bornDelaney 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/nov/21/shelagh-delaney>, who can seen 
here in Ken Russell's 1960 Monitor film on the writer and her town.

The lack of recognition from the theatre world is probably partly because, 
after 1960, she largely turned her attention to screenplays, eventually writing 
the 1985 filmDance with a Stranger 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/89141/dance-with-a-stranger>, in which 
Miranda Richardson played Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged for murder in 
England.

But A Taste of Honey 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2002/oct/11/artsfeatures12>, written when 
she was just 19, remains an extraordinary, unsentimental play about the hopes 
and dreams of its young, pregnant anti-heroine, Jo. It was staged by Joan 
Littlewood's Theatre Workshop andmade into a movie in 1961

But perhaps the greatest influence of A Taste of Honey was in its depiction of 
mother and daughter relationships in all their harsh reality – something that 
was seldom seen at the time. Delaney's play paved the way for works such as 
Sharman Macdonald's 1984When I Was a Girl, I Used to Scream and Shout 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2005/mar/17/theatre>, Charlotte Keatley 
<http://literature.britishcouncil.org/charlotte-keatley>'s My Mother Said I 
Never Should (first performed in 1987) and, most recently,April De Angelis 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/angelis>'s West End hit Jumpy.

So the next time you see a play about mothers and daughters, remember Delaney, 
whose A Taste of Honey wasas important as Look Back in Anger 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2012/feb/07/look-back-in-anger-godot>
 and deserves to be celebrated more. Delaney may have died in 2011, but her 
legacy lives on in the inheritance of women playwrights today. And it's not 
many playwrights or plays that inspire a song by the Smiths.
