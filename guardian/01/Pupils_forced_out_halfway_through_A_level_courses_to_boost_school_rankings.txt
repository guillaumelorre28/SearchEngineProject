Hundreds of teenagers are being forced out of school halfway through their 
A-level courses because their teachers fear their grades will lower the 
school's league table ranking.

Pupils who achieve less than a B grade in their AS-level exams, taken after 
the first year of A-level courses, are being persuaded to leave some 
high-performing comprehensives, as well as grammar and independent schools.

Some try to enrol at their local further education or sixth form college, but 
are turned away as they have followed a different syllabus. Colleges and 
schools say teachers are abusing the AS-level, which was meant to help pupils 
decide whether to continue a subject to a higher level.

Principals estimate that several hundred students with average or poor grades 
are being asked to leave each year.

Exam results published last month show that there were almost 267,000 fewer 
entries forA-levels <https://www.theguardian.com/education/alevels> this year 
than for AS levels last year.

High-performing private and grammar schools are known to restrict entry to 
A-level courses to pupils who achieve high grades. But the additional practice 
of filtering out underachievers is now increasingly normal, teachers say.

Ann Robinson, associate director of sixth form colleges at the Association of 
Colleges, said it was "quite common" and affected hundreds of pupils. "Some 
schools are saying that unless pupils achieve a B at AS [level], they have to 
go. This is hugely disruptive for the students."

Margaret Morrissey, founder of lobby group Parents Outloud, said: "This is 
happening because of the pressures put on schools to supply instant results.
Schools <https://www.theguardian.com/education/schools> are concerned about 
keeping their level of funding and aren't able to wait for youngsters to 
develop."
