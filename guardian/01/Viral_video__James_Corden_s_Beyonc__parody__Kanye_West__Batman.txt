have beencritically acclaimed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with>
 by many, but we love James Corden’s parody, Lemonjames 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsUge8AVaKs>. 


Batman fans are eagerly awaiting a new direct-to-video animated film 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grmyt1w1W_Y>, Batman: The Killing Joke, which 
features the voice talents of Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill and Tara Strong.

Check out Cassetteboy vs Jeremy Hunt 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK7DRJx9nbU>, as the battle between junior 
doctors and the UK’s health secretary shows no signs of abating. There are more 
political laughs with a plug for Sky News’s new show The Pledge which involves a
mash-up <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y5rwu4S-1s&app=desktop>of prime 
minister David Cameron and his leadership rival Boris Johnson.

If the world of politics seems a little surreal, it’s time to dip into the 
escapism of Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie. Yes,Ab Fab is back 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj3ZWhlmexw> and the new film reunites the 
talents of Jennifer Saunders as Edina and Joanna Lumley as Patsy, with Julia 
Sawalha as Saffy, Jane Horrocks as Bubble and June Whitfield as Mother.


We’ve also got Kanye West interrupting a wedding speech 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8cOXvqt3aY>, a new world record attempt 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXaP4xDOiRM> at two-finger pull-ups, and a

Depp and Amber Heard. Enjoy!
