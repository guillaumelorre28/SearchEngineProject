 The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Alan Beith, last night described as a 
"crushing blow" the sudden death of his son, Christopher, 23.
Mr Beith flew home from a parliamentary visit to Germany after learning that 
Christopher had been found dead at the family home in Berwick-upon-Tweed, 
Northumberland, on Monday.

Mr Beith, 57, whose wife Barbara died of cancer two years ago, said his son's 
death would be "felt by his many friends and by all the people who were in 
contact with him, in sport, his work and his social life".

Christopher, who was diabetic, was adopted by the couple as a baby, and also 
leaves a sister, Caroline, 20.

Mr Beith said: "We were very proud of Christopher, who had to face real 
difficulties, both his diabetes and the loss of his mum, both his grandmothers 
and his aunt in a short time. He was a lovely young man."

The cause of death was not known last night, though a diabetes-linked collapse 
or suicide have not been ruled out. A spokesman for Northumbria police said a 
preliminary postmortem had proved inconclusive. Further tests would be carried 
out.

The Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy, said: "I know Alan Beith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alan-beith> will have the support of all 
his parliamentary colleagues in dealing with this terrible personal tragedy."
