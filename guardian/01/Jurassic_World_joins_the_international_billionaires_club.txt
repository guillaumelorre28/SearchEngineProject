Big-opening comedies have been in short supply at the Indian box office in 
2015, with only Eros International’s romcom sequelTanu Weds Manu Returns 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGGmyaurjAI> hitting the mark in May. But 
another Eros film,Welcome Back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/06/welcome-back-review-anil-kapoor-bollywood-gangster-comedy>
, burst unmistakably into the upper echelons this weekend with a 524m rupee 
($7.8m) debut (unlisted on the Rentrak chart). That’s the third-highest 
domestic start this year, behind Baahubali (1.448bn rupees), Bajrangi Bhaijaan 
(1.026bn), and just scratching ahead of Brothers’ opening (521m) a few weeks 
back. Maybe the star of the latter, Akshay Kumar – who along with Katrina Kaif 
featured in theoriginal 2007 Welcome 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_%282007_film%29> – will be regretting 
not getting on board this time. Recycling the hot young lovers in the 
matrimonially themed series, withJohn Abraham 
<https://twitter.com/TheJohnAbraham> and Shruti Haasan 
<https://twitter.com/shrutihaasan> slotting in for the sequel, seems to have 
made no difference, with seasoned buffoons Anil Kapoor and Nana Patekar still 
crucially in place as matchmaking gangsters.

The critical consensus seems to be that trading up locations to Dubai has done 
a contrived sequelfew favours 
<http://www.hindustantimes.com/movie-reviews/welcome-back-review-this-is-brutally-unfunny/article1-1387634.aspx>
, but it should still finish inside the Indian top 10 for the year – though not 
as high as Welcome, which was 2007’s No 2 film behind the Shah Rukh Khan 
thriller Om Shanti Om. Welcome Back is in a tight race with Kumar’s punch-up 
orgy Brothers, not holding up especially well with a current 880m rupee running 
total and a hefty 1.15bn rupee budget to balance out. Welcome Back, in 
comparison, cost a mere 880m rupees; not as bling as it would have you believe.

 Jurassic World - video review 
Another auspicious landmark for Jurassic World: this week it became the fourth 
film to cross $1bn internationally, following Titanic, Avatar and Furious 7. 
Japan, the biggest overseas market for the first three Jurassics and typically 
the last one on release for JW, was the tipping point: even though it has 
dropped to the third biggest market (behindChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china>, $228.7m, and the UK, $99.7m), the 
current $63.1m gross there is still pretty lively. Given that the overseas 
billionaire club only has four members, it’s an incredible achievement for 
Universal to have managed two in a single year.

In some ways, Jurassic World is the outlier of the lot: one-off event movies 
Titanic and Avatar’s total worldwide grosses were so monstrous that they were 
virtually guaranteed to pass $1bn abroad; Furious 7, relatively weak in the US, 
was predicated on using franchise power to fire up foreign petrolheads. But
Jurassic World <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-world> was somewhere 
between the two camps: surprisingly strong for a franchise film in the US (the 
third-highest grosser of all time), but also a steady performer abroad where, 
arguably, it had to reawaken dormant memories of the Spielberg original in 
competition with leaner, fitter 21st-century franchises. Job done.


The bottom feeders

It’s not the most eventful box-office frame, it has to be said, and in the 
absence of big blockbusting carnivores, the hagfish and the sea cucumbers of 
the cinema world are out, hoovering up leftover fiscal nutrients. The 
Transporter Refuelled, in seventh place on the global chart, opened at $7.1m in 
the States, poorest of the series so far – in the same range as Hitman: Agent 
47’s $8.3m debut a fortnight ago, just to emphasise how these two genre nuggets 
are set up to make their money abroad. A mere $4m haul from 19 countries 
(though the figures haven’t been fully logged) for The Transporter Refuelled 
strongly suggest that Ed Skrein, taking over from Jason Statham in the lead, 
may only get a single shot at the role. A $22m budget takes the pressure off, 
but the possibility of a fifth film means approaching the third’s $77.3m 
overseas haul.Hitman: Agent 47 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/hitman-agent-47> is putting the hours in, 
meanwhile, climbing back up to fourth place with $11.4m scavenged from 72 
territories. It was a No 1 opening in Russia this week, matching the 2007’s 
original’s start in the country, in one of its best results. It’s closing on 
the first film’s $60.3m overseas, but it’ll have to hold up well beyond western 
Europe, where enthusiasm seems to have waned for the videogame-based property. 
Having the air of a full series relaunch, as opposed to a weary extra 
instalment for Transporter, might be what allows this bottom feeder to breed.


Beyond Hollywood

Zilch on the new-entries front this time. On the back of last week’s news that 
thefirst gay relationship in a Chinese film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/china-censor-approves-seek-mccartney-film-cinema-gay-relationship>
 has been officially approved, it’s good to see boundary-pushing thriller The 
Dead End – which reportedly also has a homosexual subplot – still in ninth 
place and doing so well there.

The future

While we’re refilling our quivers in wait for the final Hunger Games in 
November, fans of entertainingly youth-unfriendly YA material can settle for 
Scorch Trials, the secondMaze Runner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-maze-runner>, which joins Divergent in 
becoming an up-and-running franchise. It’s looking to build on the first film’s 
$340.8m worldwide and an unusually high – for a first entry – 69.9% overseas 
split that confirmed how firmly embedded everywhere the YA mindset is now. It 
soft-opens in 10 markets this weekend, including the UK and Mexico, before a 
wider launch in the second weekend of September. Elsewhere, China gets Mission: 
Impossible – Rogue Nation on 8 September, now over the $500m mark globally and 
puffing hard to match Ghost Protocol’s $694.7m. The major Bollywood release 
this week is the action romanceHero 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B5pRrXWFkI>, a remake of the 1983 film of the 
same name about a gangster who falls in love with the chief of police’s 
daughter – an occupational hazard in the Indian criminal demimonde, it seems. 
Newcomers Sooraj Pancholi and Athiya Shetty, both from local acting stock, make 
their debuts here, and it’s produced by Salman Khan – whose appearance in the 
film could boost interest on the back of barnstorming Bajrangi Bhaijaan.
