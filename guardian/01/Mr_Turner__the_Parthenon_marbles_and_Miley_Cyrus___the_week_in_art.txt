 Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, An Allegory with Venus and Time, c 1754-8. 
Photograph: The National Gallery, London 
Giovanni Battista Tiepolo – An Allegory with Venus and Time (c 1754-8)
Strictly speaking this painting should hang on the ceiling – it was painted to 
hang in the heights of a Venetian palace. Even displayed at eye height it lures 
you into an unreal world of dizzy perspective in which the action melts into a 
kind of abstract ecstasy.
