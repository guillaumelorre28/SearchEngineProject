This omission from our list prompted more comments than any other. Based on a 
novel of the same name,Strangers on a Train is the tale of a tennis player who 
meets a psychopath on a train and they agree to “exchange murders”.Tennis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> features heavily as Guy, the more 
naive of the protagonists, is forced to rush through a match in order to avoid 
being framed. stardust9 commented that he’d “always thought it wasthe classic 
tennis movie”. Malvu70 particularly enjoys the scene where “the crowd is shown 
left righting their heads to follow the ball until the camera rests on Robert 
Walker who is staring unmoving at Farley Granger”.

Another popular film suggestion was Bridesmaids. The rom-com has a tennis 
scene containing an oft-quoted put-down: one of the aforementioned bridesmaids 
plays in front of her stepson who, unimpressed, declares “I’ve seen better 
tennis playing in a tampon commercial.” ccmac10 and asadbutt suggested the 
film, both quoting that line.

Another readers’ suggestion was Annie Hall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/annie-hall>, in which comedian Alvy Singer 
reflects upon his relationship with the eponymous character. The two meet on a 
tennis court, and after, when packing away and leaving, racket small talk back 
and forth at one another. Alvy agrees to give Annie a ride, but during the 
interchange accidentally nudges into her with his tennis racket – a moment that 
sets the scene for the unremitting awkwardness thereafter.

Commenter jamie suggested the Enfield Tennis Academy (“ETA”) in David Foster 
Wallace’sInfinite Jest. This sprawling novel uses tennis as the focus of one of 
three interweaving plots, each designed to explore the incompatibility between 
human autonomy and playfulness. The book is open to interpretation, but Wallace 
seems to believe tennis involves the shedding of autonomy, thereby surrendering 
to the game and the set of choice-limiting rules that accompany it.

Barnaby and Me <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsa8Amhbb5Y> (Norman Panama,

Suggested by: asadbutt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/12/the-10-best-tennis-moments-in-culture#comment-53690589>


Commenter asadbutt bemoans the omission of, as he puts it, a “very surreal 
movie about a talking koala that features Sid Caesar playing tennis against 
John Newcombe... while disguised as a cold war defector”. The charming 70s film 
depicts a conman who’s thrown off a merchant ship. He winds up in the garden of 
a family with a talking koala bear – Barnaby. They join him on adventures, and 
one such adventure is indeed a tennis game against Australian (ex) tennis pro 
Newcombe.

Another omission picked up by commenter anabltc was The Witches of Eastwick. 
The film depicts three widows who fall in love with a mysterious new man – 
Daryl Van Horne – who disturbs their quiet, conservative community. In one 
scene at his house the three women and the newcomer play tennis: as the women’s 
jealousy over Daryl mounts, the three inadvertently cause a tennis ball to 
float in mid-air, revealing that they have magical powers.

Blow-Up includes one of cinema’s stranger tennis scenes. In Antonioni’s 
counter-cultural 60s classic, a photographer thinks he has discovered a murder: 
once he “blows up” a photograph he thinks he spots a dead body. Whether a 
murder has happened or not is left ambiguous. In the film’s final scene the 
photographer goes back to the site of the photo and, as commenter Sanguaro 
notes, there’s a “weird scene where some people are playing tennis without a 
ball”. In this surreal scene mimes play-act at tennis, and after spectating for 
a while the protagonist joins in.

M Hulot’s Holiday <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYErEoPiPeQ> (Jacques Tati, 
1953)

Suggested by PoppaAlcohol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/12/the-10-best-tennis-moments-in-culture#comment-53786752>

PoppaAlcohol writes: “Dear me, no mention of M Hulot?” In the French film, 
bumbling but lovable Mr Hulot causes calamity at a seaside resort. While there, 
he plays tennis and, though his technique is spectacularly odd (and despite 
wearing a peculiar home-made paper hat), winds up winning the match. 
PoppaAlcohol also bemoans the mispronunciation of the title, complaining: “When 
this film was shown a few years back at the local arthouse in Sheffield, the 
recorded announcement on their telephone line pronounced it ‘Em Hullet’s 
holiday’.”

One omission from our list, which reader tsw1957 calls “one of the funniest 
tennis moments ever” is a sketch from 70s/80s sketch showNot the Nine O’ Clock 
News, in which (ex) professional tennis player John McEnroe is mocked for his 
infamous “You can’t be serious”rant at a Wimbledon 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekQ_Ja02gTY> umpire. In the sketch the 
character portraying McEnroe, dressed in full tennis gear, leaps into furious 
tirades at his parents at the slightest provocation – an under-boiled egg being 
one example.

In the words of user Dangermaus: “How has Balls Out been overlooked here? Best 
film bar none on tennis. It is the classic underdog sports tale: it depicts an 
over-enthusiastic janitor’s attempt to transform misfit students into Nebraska 
State tennis champions.” The direct-to-video film featured Seann William Scott 
as Gary “The Beast” Housman and a supporting role by Randy Quaid.
