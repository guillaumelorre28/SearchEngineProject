The Blues Brothers are being resurrected in cartoon form for a new animated 
series from Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi’s widow, Judy Belushi.

The pair have teamed up with original Saturday Night Live

Burgers) doing the animation.

According to Deadline 
<http://deadline.com/2016/05/the-blues-brothers-animated-comedy-series-dan-aykroyd-1201748389/>
, the series will centre on Jake and Elwood Blues, the characters that Aykroyd 
and Belushi debuted on a 1976 episode of Saturday Night Live, and later 
embodied on the big screen in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. The animation 
will transplant the brothers to a contemporary setting to once again track 
their comedic adventures in Chicago. Each episode will show the pair playing a 
number of soul, blues and R&B hits, as well as new performances recorded 
exclusively for the series.

“The show will be the Blues Brothers living in America and utilising all-new 
technology to make and promote their own records, seek out and record new 
artists and avoid law enforcement – and all while fighting for truth, justice 
and a better breakfast sandwich,” Aykroyd told Deadline.

Aykroyd and Judy Belushi have allegedly been attempting to mount a Blue 
Brothers animated series for a decade. An earlier iteration was set to premiere 
in 1998, but never aired. That same year, the franchise reboot Blues Brothers 
2000, with John Goodman replacing the late Belushi, opened in cinemas.


The first Blues Brothers film was a major hit, grossing more than $115m 
worldwide. The belated sequel didn’t fare as well, making only $14m in the US.
