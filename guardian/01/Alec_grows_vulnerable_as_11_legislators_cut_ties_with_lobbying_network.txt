The storm surrounding the American Legislative Exchange Council, Alec, has 
gathered pace with the fresh defection of 11 Democratic state legislators who 
have cut off ties with the lobbying network.

The defections bring the number of Democratic representatives in state 
assemblies across the country 
<http://act.boldprogressives.org/survey/survey_ALEC_targets/> who have dumped 
Alec to 39.

The network, which brings together big corporations with local politicians to 
forward right-wing and anti-union legislation, has come under sustained 
pressure from campaigns such as the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

Of the 11 new defectors, eight are Democratic representatives in 
Pennsylvannia, two in Illinois and one in Iowa.

PCCC's state organising director James Ploeser said the new blow to Alec 
showed how pressure on the lobbying group was working. "This shows progressives 
won't tolerate Democrats lending bipartisan cover to Alec and its extreme 
rightwing, union-busting, voter-suppression agenda," he said.

In recent years Alec has become under mounting fire from progressive groups 
for what they see as its pernicious influence on the democratic process in the 
US. The network exists to forward what it calls "model" laws by drafting 
legislation that it then encourages to spread from state to state across the 
nation.

Among the highly contentious causes it has championed have been voter-ID laws 
that make it more difficult for older and black people to register to vote and 
stand-your-ground laws that give gun owners greater powers that have been 
condemned by critics as "shoot-first" laws.

The shooting of the unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida, the 
first state to adopt with Alec's help a stand-your-ground law, led to a 
powerful backlash against the lobbying network. Battered by the criticism, 
Alec's chairman David Frizzell last month announced that he wasclosing some of 
the network's most controversial legislative areas, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/17/alec-dismantles-controversial-taskforce>
 or "taskforces".

Despite the strategic retreat, Alec has proven to be vulnerable to the growing 
opposition to its work. Several large companies, including Coca-Cola, Kraft, 
Proctor & Gamble, McDonald's, Pepsi and Wendy's as well as the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation all bailed out of the network.

Now pressure is being put on other firms such as AT&T and Johnson & Johnson to 
follow suit and cancel their membership, with some 88,000 people signing aPCCC 
petition to that effect. <http://act.boldprogressives.org/survey/survey_ALEC/>

But the defections amount to a relatively small part of the network's total 
membership which still includes more than 2,000 republican politicians from all 
50 states and about 300 corporations and private-sector bodies.
