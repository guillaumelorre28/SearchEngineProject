The origin of ska is much contested. Did Jamaica's revolutionary, 
back-to-front beat originate from listening to rhythm'n'blues carried on AM 
radio signals all the way from Miami, or the New Orleans hits played with heavy 
bass by local DJs at 1950s soundsystems? Prince Buster claims it arrived when 
he instructed his studio band to "change gear". Others say "ska" refers to the 
music's offbeat guitar stroke. What's uncontested is that with Jamaican 
independence in 1962, ska took over the island, a celebration of youthful 
exuberance proclaimed by the likes of Prince Buster, Alton Ellis and Jimmy 
Cliff, and refined into a jazzier sound by the Skatalites, featuring trombone 
genius Don Drummond, on hits such as Eastern Standard Time.

No tropical society can live at ska-speed for long, and the pace soon slowed 
to rock steady and reggae. Ska's vigour was seized on by Britain's 2-Tone 
movement in the late 70s, as the Specials, Madness, the Selecter et al played 
old hits such as One Step Beyond and wrote new ones such as Too Much Too Young. 
The 2-Tone bands helped turn ska into a global brand.
