Perhaps it’s one of the effects of global warming or maybe it’s our increasing 
Euro-ness, but whatever the cause, it seems British cities, London certainly, 
are moving more and more enthusiastically towards the continental habit of 
closing down for August.

Once the luxury of only MPs, academics, teachers and hedge fund managers, the 
rise in the number of those taking much of the key summer month off is 
noticeable to reporters, who suffer when a large part of the working, quotable 
population is away from their respective desks at the same time.

 Fans all round for those left holding the fort 
Taking August off now seems to have spread - try raising the head of a 
charity, people in the arts or publishing, even business, government 
departments, unions, the City and religious leaders - a Mexican wave of 
absenteeism has swept personnel from Britain’s workplaces.

In Paris, Rome and New York the wealthiest have always slinked away to 
countryside retreats when the August heat threatens to boil them alive inside 
their well-cut suits, but in London? In Manchester? Edinburgh? Is it really 
getting that hot that you have to clear off? Surely your average Brit would 
rather have a sunshine break in miserable February or getting-a-bit-depressing 
November? School holidays clearly play a big part but is Britain ready for this 
to be whole heartedly adopted?

Is it yet another sign of our country’s growing inequality or can we all get 
in on it? Nobody must suffer more doing their job on a hot August day than a 
refuse worker. Or how about a month off for traffic wardens?

For commuters, the August effect totally changes the way our day starts. As a 
train commuter, used to being crammed in shoulder to shoulder with a mostly 
male crowd who wouldn’t dream of looking you in the eye but are perfectly happy 
for you to hear their tedious work plans for the day via loud mobile 
conversations, the seasonal change in fellow passengers is great. Humanity 
arrives to replace us intolerant commuter zombies. People going on holiday or 
on day trips fill up the seats of the August absentees. They smile. They even 
take their bags off empty seats and let you sit down - sometimes.

OK, their wheelie suitcases are a deadly hazard and heading to work through 
the slow drifting, shifting masses of people without the insistent tick of an 
office clock to march to is a challenge in tolerance. But, once one’s 
grumpiness is under control, the train is alive with conversation. People talk 
to each other. This morning a fire juggler was happily chatting away to an 
older couple about how he’d once had his face burnt when a fire marshall 
mistook a bucket of fuel for one of extinguishing liquid and threw it as his 
head. “It was quite funny really,” the sweet chap explained. That’s an 
only-overheard-in-August type of conversation.


So if a change is as good as a rest then a lonely August at your workstation 
has its benefits. But spare a thought for those poor souls still sweltering it 
out by their keyboards or at the checkouts, the so-called B-teams and the 
millions for whom any time off is an economic impossibility. And for you spoilt 
lot spending the month by some foreign pool, at least check your emails, there 
are a lot of despairing reporters out there.
