A New Zealand school production of Sweeney Todd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/sweeney-todd> was called off on opening 
night after two teenage cast members’ necks were cut with a prop razor.

Ambulance services were called to Saint Kentigern college in east Auckland 
just after 9pm on Wednesday night. Two 16-year-old boys were taken toAuckland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/auckland> hospital, one with serious and one 
with moderate injuries.

Both were acting in the school’s production of Sweeney Todd, Stephen 
Sondheim’s 1979 musical about “the demon barber of Fleet Street”, and were 
injured halfway through the second act about in a throat-cutting scene.

Fairfax New Zealand quoted an audience member who said

 she did not know there had been an accident until after the show.

“No announcements were made to the audience that the throat slitting was not 
all just fake blood,” she said. “The show went on, we never knew anything about 
the real blood being spilt until later.

“It is terribly sad what has happened. It’s a great show and I’d hate to see 
anything bad overshadow the quality of the show.”

Counties-Manukau police visited the school on Thursday, though a spokesman 
told the New Zealand Herald 
<http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11618132> it had 
not been “not a criminal injury”. “In this instance the play is not the 
reality,” he said.

Worksafe New Zealand <https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand>, the 
government service responsible for workplace health and safety, is 
investigating.

In a radio interview on Thursday, the Saint Kentigern college head, Steve 
Cole, said the prop razor had been blunted with a number of materials, 
including duct tape and foam, and the injuries were the result of a “very 
unfortunate mistake”.

“It’s normal for Sweeney Todd to have such an instrument [and it] clearly had 
been checked many, many times,” he said.

“It has been bound and cellophaned and all sorts of things. It had been 
blunted and had been through all sorts of health and safety checks. It was a 
very unfortunate mistake.”

Cole said he had “no idea” how the boys had come to be injured. He understood 
that both had been discharged from hospital.

He said the play had been rehearsed since January, and that particular scene 
had been practised “many, many times”.

Thursday’s performance would be postponed but Cole said he hoped the season 
could be rescued – “obviously, without those particular props”. “I’m very, very 
hopeful that we will have a full production Friday, Saturday and maybe Sunday, 
a matinee.”

Cole told other media that

, “in hindsight”, it might have been better to use a plastic prop.

A post to Saint Kentigern’s website on Tuesday 
<https://www.saintkentigern.com/addnews/college-senior-school-musical-sweeney-todd/>
, before opening night, said the choice of Sweeney Todd had “raised the bar and 
challenged our student actors, musicians and stage crew on many levels”.

“The biggest challenge of all, however, was the ghoulish murder scenes 
themselves, as Todd’s barbering skills cleanly dispatched victim after victim. 
Let’s just say there was ‘gore’ – and plenty of it!”
