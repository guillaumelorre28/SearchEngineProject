Nighty night

Well it’s time to saddle up and ride out of here. Thanks very much for your 
company tonight and through the week.

Let’s wrap today, Thursday:

 * Barnaby Joyce and Fiona Nash are the new nationals leadership team, after 
Warren Truss finally confirmed his intention to bow out of politics at the next 
election.

 * Stuart Robert – the besieged human services minister – remains on his feet 
despite days of parliamentary pounding, for now at least. We expected to learn 
his fate today with the release of the Parkinson review. That didn’t happen.

 * Now the Nationals ducks are in a row – we will get a frontbench reshuffle, 
either tomorrow or over the weekend. 
There was more, but right now, that’s enough. Bless Magic Mike Bowers. Bless 
the readers. Have a good evening.

Better than Warren Truss in any case. Here is the circle of political life in 
one frame.

Joyce is asked whether he’ll take up land rights, the rights of farmers. He 
says it has to be a balance. The mining industry should not be shut down. But 
there is the challenge of keeping prime agricultural land. Joyce says this 
isn’t a binary issue, it’s a complex one.

And that’s a wrap. I’ll share some more pictures shortly.

Joyce is asked how he wants to make a difference in politics. He proceeds to 
list the various interests of colleagues, fairer banks, cooperatives, effective 
irrigation. He says the challenge is to influence this at the cabinet level. 
For backbenchers, it is influencing the public debate. Joyce won’t be drawn 
beyond that on specifics.

Fiona Nash is asked what portfolio she’d like. She says she’ll do anything the 
leader requires of her.

Q: How will you be different from Warren Truss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/warren-truss>?

Fiona Nash:

That is one of the most obvious differences. I am a girl.

Q: Will there be ongoing division?

Joyce thanks Michael McCormack for not running tonight and putting the best 
interests of the Nationals first.

We are all in politics and we understand to have the greatest effect, you have 
to have the greatest purpose of your numbers and to have 21 people working as 
one gives you better bang for your buck than five different groups of four.

First question is whether Joyce intends to strike a new coalition agreement 
with the prime minister. The new deputy prime minister isn’t saying one way or 
another. He says the coalition agreement might need to be revisited, but 
nothing dramatic. The election is close, he says.

Q: What portfolio will you take?

He doesn’t answer that directly either. Joyce says he needs to consult his 
colleagues.

Q: Do you want the additional cabinet position?

(Yes.)

Joyce says this is the people’s excitement, tonight, the people that Nationals 
represent. On the farms,people in the weatherboard and iron and the brick and 
tile.

Fiona Nash:

I am humbled that my party has chosen to give me the honour of being their 
deputy leader. It is an exciting time to be a regional Australian.

We have in this party such a cross-section of people from right across rural 
and regional areas. We are real people who represent all of those out in rural 
and regional communities that need us to fight for them. We represent some of 
the most disadvantaged people across the country and we will never stop 
fighting for them, making sure that we look after them and that they get their 
fair share.

I must say, it is spectacular when you turn on the television and the nation 
is talking about the leadership of the National party.

The latest advice is no Parkinson review tonight. I stress I’m speculating 
when I say there must be a boil over aboutStuart Robert’s future, (because when 
you are reporting live, there’s not much time to make multiple calls), but I 
can’t see any other obvious conclusion to reach.

This report was supposed to be out hours ago.

The new Nationals leadership team is now calling on the prime minister with 
twenty of their closest camera wielding friends.

Barnaby Joyce, to Turnbull:

It is momentous and I am looking forward to showing Australians that they are 
in safe hands. We will be a great team and looking forward to working with you.

Turnbull to Joyce and Nash:

I am very pumped up. It is a great result and I think this will be a very 
formidable team. We haven’t got long to go to the election. Well done to the 
Nats. All the best. Well done.

Returning officer, George Christensen.

The vote was by secret ballot. And in the National party that means we don’t 
release the tally of votes. The ballot papers have been destroyed. Barnaby and 
Fiona will formally take office whenWarren Truss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/warren-truss> officially resigns.

Barnaby will be the new Deputy PM and we look forward to having Fiona in the 
Cabinet and I can assure you that both of them will be fierce advocates and 
fighters for rural and regional Australia.

Barnaby and Fiona will be holding a press conference in the National’s party 
room in about 15 to 20 minutes time. And can I finish by saying if there is one 
great legacy that Warren Truss has left the National party it is a sense of 
unity and loyalty and that will continue under this new leadership.

We are all very good mates and we will continue to be even though some people 
missed out tonight. Thank you and I will see you in 15 to 20 minutes time.

Let’s wrap today, Thursday:

 * Barnaby Joyce and Fiona Nash are the new nationals leadership team, after 
Warren Truss finally confirmed his intention to bow out of politics at the next 
election.

 * Stuart Robert – the besieged human services minister – remains on his feet 
despite days of parliamentary pounding, for now at least. We expected to learn 
his fate today with the release of the Parkinson review. That didn’t happen.

 * Now the Nationals ducks are in a row – we will get a frontbench reshuffle, 
either tomorrow or over the weekend. 
There was more, but right now, that’s enough. Bless Magic Mike Bowers. Bless 
the readers. Have a good evening.

Joyce and deputy Fiona Nash in his in Parliament House office in Canberra this

Pumped, says the prime minister.

Pumped.
 
Joyce is asked whether he’ll take up land rights, the rights of farmers. He 
says it has to be a balance. The mining industry should not be shut down. But 
there is the challenge of keeping prime agricultural land. Joyce says this 
isn’t a binary issue, it’s a complex one.

And that’s a wrap. I’ll share some more pictures shortly.
 
Joyce is asked how he wants to make a difference in politics. He proceeds to 
list the various interests of colleagues, fairer banks, cooperatives, effective 
irrigation. He says the challenge is to influence this at the cabinet level. 
For backbenchers, it is influencing the public debate. Joyce won’t be drawn 
beyond that on specifics.

Fiona Nash is asked what portfolio she’d like. She says she’ll do anything the 
leader requires of her.
 
Joyce is asked how he will divvy up the frontbench positions. He says he’s a 
collegiate fellow, despite some publicity to the contrary. Joyce says he will 
take soundings from the new team and fromWarren Truss.
 
Q: How will you be different from Warren Truss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/warren-truss>?

Fiona Nash:

That is one of the most obvious differences. I am a girl.

Q: Will there be ongoing division?

Joyce thanks Michael McCormack for not running tonight and putting the best 
interests of the Nationals first.

We are all in politics and we understand to have the greatest effect, you have 
to have the greatest purpose of your numbers and to have 21 people working as 
one gives you better bang for your buck than five different groups of four.
 
First question is whether Joyce intends to strike a new coalition agreement 
with the prime minister. The new deputy prime minister isn’t saying one way or 
another. He says the coalition agreement might need to be revisited, but 
nothing dramatic. The election is close, he says.

Q: What portfolio will you take?

He doesn’t answer that directly either. Joyce says he needs to consult his 
colleagues.

Q: Do you want the additional cabinet position?

(Yes.)
 
Joyce says this is the people’s excitement, tonight, the people that Nationals 
represent. On the farms,people in the weatherboard and iron and the brick and 
tile.

Fiona Nash:

I am humbled that my party has chosen to give me the honour of being their 
deputy leader. It is an exciting time to be a regional Australian.

We have in this party such a cross-section of people from right across rural 
and regional areas. We are real people who represent all of those out in rural 
and regional communities that need us to fight for them. We represent some of 
the most disadvantaged people across the country and we will never stop 
fighting for them, making sure that we look after them and that they get their 
fair share.
 
Joyce opens his press conference by noting this is an awesome responsibility.

I must say, it is spectacular when you turn on the television and the nation 
is talking about the leadership of the National party.
 
The latest advice is no Parkinson review tonight. I stress I’m speculating 
when I say there must be a boil over aboutStuart Robert’s future, (because when 
you are reporting live, there’s not much time to make multiple calls), but I 
can’t see any other obvious conclusion to reach.

This report was supposed to be out hours ago.
 
The new Nationals leadership team is now calling on the prime minister with 
twenty of their closest camera wielding friends.

Barnaby Joyce, to Turnbull:

It is momentous and I am looking forward to showing Australians that they are 
in safe hands. We will be a great team and looking forward to working with you.

Turnbull to Joyce and Nash:

I am very pumped up. It is a great result and I think this will be a very 
formidable team. We haven’t got long to go to the election. Well done to the 
Nats. All the best. Well done.
 
The glass eyed muppet donkey never gets old.

If it isn’t obvious, Fiona Nash taking the deputy’s spot means the prime 
minister will have another woman in the cabinet.
 
Returning officer, George Christensen.

The vote was by secret ballot. And in the National party that means we don’t 
release the tally of votes. The ballot papers have been destroyed. Barnaby and 
Fiona will formally take office whenWarren Truss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/warren-truss> officially resigns.

Barnaby will be the new Deputy PM and we look forward to having Fiona in the 
Cabinet and I can assure you that both of them will be fierce advocates and 
fighters for rural and regional Australia.

Barnaby and Fiona will be holding a press conference in the National’s party 
room in about 15 to 20 minutes time. And can I finish by saying if there is one 
great legacy that Warren Truss has left the National party it is a sense of 
unity and loyalty and that will continue under this new leadership.

We are all very good mates and we will continue to be even though some people 
missed out tonight. Thank you and I will see you in 15 to 20 minutes time.
