At the entrance to Thaungtan village there’s a brand-new sign, bright yellow, 
that bears the message: “No Muslims allowed to stay overnight. No Muslims 
allowed to rent houses. No marriage with Muslims.”

The post was erected in late March by Buddhist residents of the village in 
Myanmar’s lush Irrawaddy delta region who signed, or were strong-armed into 
signing, a document asserting that they wanted to live separately.

Since then a couple of other villages across the country have followed suit. 
Small but viciously insular, these “Buddhist-only” outposts serve as microcosms 
of the festering religious tensions that threaten Myanmar’s nascent experiment 
with democracy.

After decades of military rule, Myanmar has entered a new era. As state 
counsellor,Aung San Suu Kyi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi>
 is in charge, though key institutions remain under the army’s control.

Recent weeks, however, have brought a surge in nationalist activity. Scores 
rallied outside the US embassy in Yangon last month to demand diplomats stop 
using the wordRohingya <https://www.theguardian.com/world/rohingya> to describe 
millions of Muslims confined to internal displacement camps and villages in 
western Myanmar. Nationalists insist the group are illegal immigrants from 
Bangladesh.

The few public comments Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) 
has given on the issue have not been encouraging.

Aung San Suu Kyi reportedly instructed the new US ambassador not to use the 
term “Rohingya”. The new minister for religion, the former general Thura Aung 
Ko, recently called Muslims and Hindus “associate citizens”.

The fact that nationalist rhetoric has gone unchallenged – and has in some 
cases been echoed – by the new government has left some wondering what place 
the country’s minorities have in its future.

Thaungtan is a small village of about 700 people, mostly farmers. At the end 
of a long dirt road flanked by tall grass and banana trees, it is extremely 
isolated.

Recently, residents formed the Patriotic Youth Network, a nationalist group 
that says it is dedicated to developing the village – and keeping it out of 
“foreign hands”.

At the local monastery, a young monk with piercing black eyes named Ma Ni Ta 
sits unsmiling as villagers clamour to explain the new sign.

“The village has talked and seen that the NLD didn’t do anything on the 
religious matter,” he says. It has fallen to the village to handle the mission 
to “protect religion” themselves, he claims.

In early 2015 a stranger moved to Thaungtan.


According to the villagers’ version of events, he initially got along well 
with his neighbours. He said he was Hindu. Then he started buying land. That’s 
when they jumped to the conclusion that he must be Muslim.

“It’s like ghosts. We have never seen a ghost but we’re afraid,” says one 
villager, with a rueful laugh. He was part of a small minority who opposed the 
sign, he says, asking not to be named for fear of reprisals.


Members of the Patriotic Youth Network found that not all of the new arrival’s 
family had identity cards. “They might have sneaked in from Bangladesh,” claims 
Ma Ni Ta. “If we live together, we might have some problems with donations and 
religious ceremonies.”

Kyaw San Win was the stranger who came under suspicion. A stocky 28-year-old 
with large, long-lashed eyes, he stands in his cousin’s drinks shop in Yangon, 
three hours’ drive from Thaungtan.

He points at a small Buddha statue on a shelf and explains how his family 
follow both Buddhist and Hindu traditions.

Kyaw San Win says he was living in Yangon when his elderly father decided to 
retire to the countryside. Kyaw San Win’s cousin suggested his wife’s village: 
Thaungtan. They bought and renovated an old wooden house.

The monks and villagers were immediately unfriendly, he says. After they 
bought another piece of land, planning to open a teashop, he and his wife got 
an urgent call from his father.

“Please, my son,” he said. “Please come back to the village because the 
villagers and the monks, they don’t really want us to live here.”

At the monastery, they were told that residents didn’t want kalar, an 
offensive term for Muslims, in their village.

“I ate pork in front of them,” Kyaw San Win recalls with an exasperated laugh. 
“They said I was just pretending so I could do some mission, like jihad.”

Later he says members of the Patriotic Youth Network warned him: “Someone may 
come and burn your house down.”


Then groups of young men took to walking and running around the house at all 
hours. They revved motorbikes outside.

According to Kyaw San Win, the village administrator said he could not 
guarantee their security. So they left the village, eventually selling the home 
last month. Around the same time, pictures on Facebook showed members of the 
Patriotic Youth Network standing beside their new sign.

“Every religion, every person, should be able to live in every part of the 
country,” says San Htay, Kyaw San Win’s cousin. “Every person should be under 
the same law … The nationalist guys want to rule the village.”

“We’re really lucky we are Buddhist,” adds Kyaw San Win. “If we were Muslim 
there would be a conflict in that village.”


Recently it has seemed to some as though Myanmar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar> could again be teetering on the 
verge of religious violence. After the disappointment of last November’s 
election, nationalist groups, who backed the losing military-backed Union and 
Solidarity party, are again making noises.

“Now that the post-election dust has settled, it’s business as usual for 
religious extremists throughout the country,” says Matthew Smith, executive 
director of the human rights organisation Fortify Rights. “Without a stronger 
counter-movement, this brand of religious discrimination will continue to 
flourish. Violence is inevitable.”

The Patriotic Youth Network in Thaungtan denies links to extremist nationalist 
organisation Ma Ba Tha, which has waged an anti-Muslim hate campaign in recent 
years.

The firebrand monk Ashin Wirathu has been accused of inciting deadly riots 
through his Facebook page, where he posts unsubstantiated rumours about Muslims.

A spokesperson for the religious affairs ministry says he has not heard about 
“no-Muslim” villages. “Basically [complaints] should come from the regional 
level,” he said. He could not be reached to answer further questions.

The NLD is in a precarious position. Hatred of the Rohingya penetrates all 
levels of society. Recently, local magazine the Irrawaddy, which is run by 
human rights activists, published a cartoon that featured a dark-skinned 
half-naked man holding a sign that said “boat people”.

When students from the Yangon School of Political Science held a small peace 
march across the city, a few dozen men, women and children carried banners 
saying: “Accept Diversity. Promote Tolerance.” Police said they planned to 
charge the activists with unauthorised protest.

Nanda Kyaw, a Muslim taxi driver who was beaten outside Shwedagon Pagoda, from 
which Islamic vendors were evicted a few weeks earlier, says he is still 
getting headaches.

“I have to drive every day for my survival,” says the slight 31-year-old. At 
least once a day, he says, a would-be passenger waves him on when they see his 
goatee. But the attack in April came as a surprise.

A group of young people wound down their windows and shouted racist abuse, he 
said, they swerved in front of his car and beat him with iron rods. They left 
him bleeding from his mouth and head.

“Some people stopped their cars and watched a little bit. It’s because it was 
a problem between a Muslim guy and a Buddhist guy; they are afraid.”

He declines to have his picture taken, for fear of inflaming tensions.

Kyaw San Win feels the same. It’s the reason his family have not pursued 
charges against the people who hounded them from the village. Besides, he says, 
they wouldn’t want to move back now.

“The people, they are very narrow-minded, we don’t want to live with them,” 
his cousin says.
