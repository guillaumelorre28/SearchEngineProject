Senior commanders of Islamic State were killed in an Iraqi airstrike near the 
country’s border with Syria but the group’s leader,Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi>, was not among them, 
hospital sources and residents have told the Reuters news agency.

The Iraqi military claimed in a statement earlier that the raid had hit 
Baghdadi’s convoy as it travelled to a meeting in Karabla, a town in the 
western province of Anbar.

The whereabouts of Baghdadi, who has declared himself the leader of an 
Isis-controlled caliphate in Iraq andSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>, have been unknown for long periods.

Karabla is located on the Euphrates river, about three miles from the border 
with Syria. The statement did not make clear when the strike was carried out.


“Iraqi air forces have bombed the convoy of the terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 
while he was heading to Karabla to attend a meeting with Daesh commanders,” an 
Iraqi air force statement said, using the Arabic acronym for Isis.

Iraqi security sources have claimed in the past that Baghdadi has been injured 
or killed in strikes, but those claims have never been verified or were later 
denied. In April it was reported that he had been injured in a strike, but 
months later a voice recording claiming to be Baghdadi was released in an 
attempt to dispel the rumour.

This time, a statement was released by the “war media cell”, a structure that 
provides updates on the fight against Isis and speaks for the interior and 
defence ministries as well as the paramilitary Popular Mobilisation forces.


It said the operation was conducted in coordination with Iraq’s interior 
ministry intelligence services and the joint operation command centre that 
includes military advisers from the US-led coalition.
