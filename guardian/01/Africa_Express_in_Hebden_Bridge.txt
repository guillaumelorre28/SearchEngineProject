There was obviously something unusual going on in Hebden Bridge. Why else 
would there be such a queue outside the Trades Club at 11.30 on a Monday 
morning?

It was clearly something special when those queuing were seen to be issued 
with wristbands, whereas normally audience members just wander in and have 
their hands stamped. And why was the bar serving only soft drinks? The occasion 
was a lunchtime concert byAfrica Express <http://www.africaexpress.co.uk/>, who 
are touring the country by chartered train, and had stopped off at Hebden Bridge
en route for their evening concert in Middlesbrough.

The project, which comprises more than 80 performers, is part of the cultural 
Olympiad, raising awareness of African music, with western and African 
musicians playing together at both scheduled and pop-up venues. You can read 
rolling coverage in the Guardian here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/02/africa-express-rolling-coverage>.

Half-a-dozen musicians from the collective, headed by Reeps One 
<http://www.reepsone.co.uk/> and Afrikan Boy <http://afrikanboy.com/>, with 
Krar Collective <http://uk.myspace.com/krarcollective>, and Tamar Osborn 
<http://tamarosborn.com/> on sax, jammed with members of the Hebden Bridge 
Junior Brass Band 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/gallery/2008/mar/10/brass.band> in a packed 
room. Luckily, the local schools had not yet returned for the autumn term, so 
it was an ideal and unique end-of-the-holidays treat.

Since there had been no opportunity to rehearse, the programme relied on the 
considerable improvisational skills of the performers. Can this work, asked Tim 
Jonzeon the Guardian blog <http://www.guardian.co.uk/music>: 

a bunch of kids playing euphoniums while Reeps One attempts to beatbox over 
the top of it?

Well - yes! It was really great. At the end, a group photo was taken. The 
Junior Brass Band are no strangers to unusual gigs, performing annually at the 
MytholmroydDock Pudding contest 
<http://www.crow-pie.co.uk/archive_subjects/dock_competition_1.html> and also 
dressing in Victorian costume for carol concerts in the local beauty spot of 
Hardcastle Crags, but this was the first time they have been called upon to 
give a black power style salute.

All too soon, it was time for Africa Express to catch their train on to 
another pop-up event, down in Bradford, and probably time for the local kids in 
both the band and the audience to think about getting ready for the new term. 
We've hadplenty of challenges <http://www.hebdenbridge.co.uk/news/2012/128.html>
 in Hebden Bridge and the upper valley this year, but our summer holidays here 
have ended on a high note.
