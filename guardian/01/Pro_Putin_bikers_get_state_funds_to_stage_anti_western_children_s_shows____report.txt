The Night Wolves and their associates, all affiliated with biker leader 
Alexander Zaldostanov, have received 56 million roubles (about £730,000) in 
taxpayers’ money over the past 18 months,Navalny claims 
<https://navalny.com/p/4228/>, basing his figures on a comprehensive search of 
government websites <https://grants.oprf.ru/competitions/>. 

Zaldostanov, known as The Surgeon, is a personal friend of Vladimir Putin’s 
and has appeared in public with the Russian president several times. But little 
has been disclosed about how the group funds its grand-scale nationalistic 
performances, which include holiday concerts for children that suggest the west 
is bent on destroyingRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>.

“Russia must be deprived of freedom; Slavic peoples need to be chained; peace 
should be built on their blood; those who disagree must die,” recites a western 
character in one New Year’s show staged by the bikers.

Navalny’s report says the Night Wolves have received 12.5 million roubles from 
the official National Charitable Fund for their New Year’s shows over the past 
two years.

“Our goal is to create an alternative to the foreign dominance,” Zaldastanov 
was quoted as saying after the past New Year’s performance. “The educational 
goal of the show is very important.”

The holiday shows, known in Russia as novogodniye yolki or “New Year trees”, 
are a fixture of the winter holidays that dates back to the Soviet era, and 
have traditionally featured fairytale characters in stories about love and 
friendship.

But recent years have seen some changes. One production in the Russian city of 
Lipetsk this year featured American characters threatening Russia with 
sanctions and Russian characters boasting of their country’s nuclear arsenal 
and denouncing the “stupidity” of the west.

A show staged by the Night Wolves in 2013 featured a character representing 
the Statue of Liberty kidnapping Russia’s snow maiden, Snegurochka, in an 
attempt to ruin Russia.
The show ends with Russian forces triumphing and the hero proclaiming in a 
poem that the country will defeat its foes “no matter how hard foreign 
believers try”.

The Night Wolves recently tried to commemorate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/04/putin-motorbike-gang-night-wolves-germany-tour>
 the 70th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in the second 
world war by riding their motorbikes to Berlin, but Poland denied the group 
entry and the German government canceled the visas of some people believed to 
belong to the group’s leadership.
