I’ve been following on Twitter your anguished hunt for your ukulele, lost in 
transit. What’s the latest?
It’s not over until it’s over! Heathrow thinks it’s at Terminal 3, Virgin 
thinks it doesn’t exist, I want to believe Heathrow. Ten years ago, after a gig 
in London, three drunk teenage fans stole my ukulele from my dressing room, and 
I tweeted my despair. Three days later they showed up where I was staying, like 
frightened rabbits, holding my ukulele and apologising for having gotten drunk 
and stolen it. And I had such a wonderful time with them. I made them tea and 
sat them down and told them about my teenage shoplifting years, and it was a 
moment of true universal healing. And this is that ukulele, a $19 ukelele I’ve 
been touring with it for 10 years now, and it has seen some times. [Update: 
Palmer has since been reunited with her lost ukelele.]

What have you been doing in the UK on this visit?
I just wrote and arranged and recorded an entire album with Edward Ka-Spel 
<https://edwardka-spel.bandcamp.com/>, who used to be in a small cult band in 
the 90s calledthe Legendary Pink Dots <http://legendarypinkdots.org/> that I 
just worshipped. When I was about 19 years old, he and I happened to be at the 
same after-party for a show of the band’s, and he was listening to a demo tape 
of mine and told me that he thought I was a phenomenal songwriter and that I 
should keep going. And that was one of the life-changing moments where I really 
felt legitimised; this was my hero, telling little me that he actually thought 
I had talent.

Music has a practical purpose; we use it to celebrate and to mourn and to 
process and to grieve and to love

What’s the album like?
It’s really different from my usual stuff. It’s much more electronic, which is 
Edward’s MO. He’s an electronic, synthesiser kind of person, whereas I am a 
much more organic, piano person, but we married them together beautifully. It 
really felt like a bucket-list moment, to make that record.

And you’ve also made a record with your father. How did that come about?
It was another kind of bucket-list project that we got the idea for seven or 
eight years ago when I first invited my dad on stage to play a simple song with 
me. My dad is a good, solid amateur guitar player and a semi-professional 
choral singer. I first invited him to hop on stage at some of my solo shows 
because that’s theAmanda Palmer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/amanda-palmer> way; I always invite my 
friends and my family to play with me if they play.

And my dad was a really obvious one, because we had a faltering relationship 
all my life. He and my mom split up when I was a babe in arms, and inviting him 
on stage was one of the ways I opened our relationship back up. He and I had a 
far from intimate relationship until I was in my late 20s, and we started 
hanging out because I was touring.

What was the experience of working with him like?
Every time I would see my dad, we would chat about what we might do, and how 
we might do it, and what songs we might pick, and we got to bathe and linger in 
the beauty of the idea for a long time. That in itself was really healing – the 
fact that we had this musical common purpose we were building our relationship 
around. And by the time we actually walked into the studios together, I was 
pregnant, and at 39 I felt closer to my dad than I ever had as a child. There 
was something really profound about having a baby in my belly and going into 
the studio with my father to do this ultimate act of healing. It felt like it 
was all happening in its own time and in the right way.

You’ve also just released a cover of the Bat for Lashes song Laura.
That song was recorded two years ago in Australia and I’ve been keeping it in 
my back pocket. It took on extra special meaning because the widow of my best 
friend, Anthony, who died a year ago, is Laura. I played that song for her on a 
piano on her birthday, when we all gathered at Anthony’s brother’s house, and 
it became infused with a new meaning.

You had known Anthony for most of your life, and it was clearly an intensely 
painful loss. At the same time you were becoming a mother. How did that feel?
Anthony was my greatest mentor and teacher. He spent 20 years teaching me how 
to deal with impermanence. One of his biggest lessons to me was about 
non-attachment and the ability just to accept what is and sit with it. Not 
feeling the fullness of grief and the massive circle of the universe in terms 
of his death and this baby, not facing it head on, would be disrespectful to 
his memory.

You’re a keen advocate of the crowd-funding platform Patreon 
<https://www.patreon.com/>. Why does it work for you?
Because it pays me a little bit of money each time I make music, it all feels 
incredibly authentic. I’m able to make music with my family and music for my 
friends and cover songs that I feel like, and crank out a bunch of Bowie songs 
because I feel like it and a Prince song because I feel like it, and an album 
with my dad because I feel like it. I just get to do what I want! I feel like 
I’ve spent my whole career trying to find this particular utopia.

Tell me about those tributes to Bowie, and to Prince.
The beauty of Patreon means that I have an immediate disposable pile of 
capital to make music with, and so when Bowie died and I happened to be on the 
phone with Jherek [Bischoff <http://www.jherekbischoff.com/>, with whom Palmer 
recordedStrung Out in Heaven <http://amandapalmer.net/strungoutinheaven/>] and 
we dreamed up the idea of doing a really quick and dirty string quartet 
tribute, I thought why not? Music has a practical purpose; we use it to 
celebrate and to mourn and to process and to grieve and to love.

The same thing with Prince. Prince was my idol, and no better way to grieve 
and send a message than to get into a studio and wrap my mouth around the words 
that he wrote.

We live in pretty scary times. How do you deal with that?
The world has never not known its share of suffering, and we can get lost in 
it and lose hope, or we can just commit to compassion and then carry on without 
fear. And we need a lot of that nowadays, especially in the States. I stand 
committed to the idea of moving forward with as much fearlessness as possible. 
I told Neil I want to get a couple of T-shirts printed for me and the baby that 
say: “We are determined to enjoy ourselves.” As the shit hits the fan, as the 
globe warms, as Manhattan sinks into the ocean, we are determined to enjoy 
ourselves.
