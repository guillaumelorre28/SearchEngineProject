When were you happiest?
I am happiest now.

What is your greatest fear?
Anything bad happening to my children.

What is your earliest memory?
Packing socks into a bag and running away as far as the end of the road.

Aside from a property, what's the most expensive thing you've bought?
My bath. It weighs 56 stone (355kg) and had to come in through the window. 
It's an old French cast-iron one.

What is your most treasured possession?
My Morris Minor which my husband bought for me. I arrived home and said, "Can 
you believe what somebody's parked outside the house? It's so lovely!" And he 
threw the keys out of the window.

Where would you like to live?
I like living where I live, but in another life probably Marylebone, where I 
grew up.

What makes you unhappy?
A bad haircut; people spitting.

What do you most dislike about your appearance?
My bingo wings.

If you could edit your past, what would you change?
I would edit out the night my phone accidentally rang my mother at 3am when I 
was discussing something really quite rude.

What is your favourite book?
At the moment it's The Night Watch by Sarah Waters.

What would be your fancy dress costume of choice?
I've just been invited to Andrew Clover <http://www.andrewclover.com/>'s fancy 
dress party – he plays the clown in Ashes To Ashes – and the dress code is 
Keely Smith, the singer. Bizarre!

Cat or dog?
Dog. We have a dog called Nana. It's a coton de tulear, 
<http://www.comportamientoanimal.com/imagenes/razas_perro/razas_comp_coton%20de%20tulear_coton%201.jpg>
 which is a white, fluffy dog. It's small, but not too embarrassing for my 
husband to walk.

What is your guiltiest pleasure?
McDonald's, KFC – I love fast food.

What does love feel like?
My husband and children, or a Big Mac!

If you could go back in time, where would you go?
To the 40s, to the end of the war, to experience the amazing feeling 
of looking forward.

When did you last cry, and why?
When my three-year-old son Ralph asked me if I would stay with him for ever. I 
lied and said yes.

How do you relax?
With wine, knitting and in my bath.

How often do you have sex?
It depends if my husband is away or not – er that doesn't sound quite right! 
When we are together – quite a lot!

What keeps you awake at night?
Guilt: I can feel guilty about anything.

What song would you like played at your funeral?
Fix You by Coldplay <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBEYyHGbwto>.

Tell us a joke.
A little boy says to his daddy, "Daddy, where does poo come from?" "Well, your 
food goes into your tummy and your tummy does lots of things and then it comes 
out as poo." The little boy looks up and says, "So, where does Tigger come 
from?"
