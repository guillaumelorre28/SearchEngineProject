Night-time politics

 * Pauline Hanson has backed the referral of her party’s senator Rod Culleton 
to the high court for a ruling from the court of disputed returns. Former 
Family First senator Bob Day has also been referred on a deal regarding his 
electoral office.

 * Culleton has tabled the government solicitor general’s advice on his 
eligibility, which the government had tried to withhold. Culleton also tried to 
amend the government’s high court referral motion. He failed.

 * The Senate debate over the marriage plebiscite bill continues, with Liberal 
senator Dean Smith warning his government’s plans would irretrievably undermine 
parliamentary sovereignty.

 * Labor attacked the prime minister over when he knew of advice that Day’s 
office deal was possibly dodgy. Turnbull said he did not know the details of 
what happened under the former special minister of state Michael Ronaldson in 
2014. Turnbull said he found out in August 2016 when the new SMOS Scott Ryan 
found out.

 * The government used question time to focus on the CFMEU to push the case 
for the Australian Building Construction Commission and the registered 
organisations bill.

 * The Human Rights Commission has hit back at criticism from Turnbull for 
accusing the commission of “bringing a case” against the Queensland University 
of Technology students under section 18C. The commission did not bring the 
case, it was the complainant, Cindy Prior. This detail appeared to elude the 
PM. It will be worth watching 7.30, where Leigh Sales will interview HRC 
president, Gillian Triggs.

 * The chair of the government environment committee, Craig Kelly, talked 
about previous renewable energy policies which increase the cost of heating 
swimming pools at the same time as speaking of child drownings.

That is all, my friends. Thanks for your company today and thanks to the 
brains trust ofGareth Hutchens, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy and to my blogan 
co-conspiratorMike Bowers. 

I am off to lie in Reclined Goddess (yoga speak) and hope that tomorrow is a 
little more normal. Well, in terms of pace. I have given up hoping for normal.

Good night.

Asked if Pauline Hanson’s senior staffer James Ashby wants to parachute into 
his Senate seat, One Nation senatorRodney Culleton told Sky News:

Well he probably wants to parachute into a lot of places. But at the moment it 
would be very difficult to parachute into my seat because the West Australian 
people want me to stay there as a senator.

Is he accusing Ashby of being a political opportunist or was there a slur 
intended by that remark? You decide.


Culleton was far more civil about Hanson agreeing to the referral of his 
eligibility to the high court:


It is a different playing field here. I have to respect the party leader and 
the other senators.

The prime minister has commissioned an independent review into Australia’s 
intelligence agencies.


This is an opportunity to assess whether our current intelligence 
arrangements, structures and mechanisms are best placed to meet the security 
challenges we are likely to face in the years ahead.

Consistent with previous reviews conducted in 2004 and 2011, this process will 
examine how our intelligence community serves Australia’s national interest. 
The review will consider the ongoing suitability of legislative and oversight 
provisions.

 I have asked Professor Michael L’Estrange AO and Mr Stephen Merchant PSM to 
conduct the review and report to the government in the first half of 2017.

The terms of reference are here

Culleton says it would cost a lot of money to go to the high court. 

Everyone is confused [over the eligibility issue], it’s all a belief, I don’t 
want to be sent to an abattoir with a blunt knife, it’s got to be a clean kill.

One Nation’s Rod Culleton is speaking to Laura Jayes on Sky.

He calls the government referral an “ambush”. He says George Brandis has 
ambushed him.

He says the whole Senate process to refer his eligibility was rushed and did 
not represent procedural fairness.

Today is the first day of new Senate rules to allow photographers to take 
pictures of senators on the benches – in line with lower house rules.

Bowers was not like the dog that caught up with the car. When the Senate 
opened the doors, Bowers was there with bells on.

 Rod Culleton addresses the Senate on his eligibility to sit in the upper 
house. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian 
I thought you might like a substantial chunk of Pauline Hanson’s speech. 

It is a very difficult time for me and the party but even more so for Senator 
Culleton. He has been a man who has stood up to represent his electorate, the 
farming sector and many other issues. But this motion is on the floor now and I 
must address it. I have always stood for honesty, integrity and the truth. The 
people deserve no less, especially from this chamber. It goes to the very heart 
of our democracy. With this at hand, it is a question over Senator Culleton’s 
eligibility to hold his seat in this place.

I was of the opinion when he was nominated for Pauline Hanson’s One Nation as 
a Senate candidate that he stated that he was eligible to stand under the 
requirements of section 44 of the constitution. I took that to be his oath, and 
his signature was witnessed by a JP.

My fellow colleagues and I support Senator Culleton, but we have seen on too 
many occasions politicians in this place and the other place who have not been 
accountable to the Australian people and I will not stand here and be of the 
same ilk.

I believe that it should go to the high court to make their ruling on this 
matter. I hope their findings are in his favour and I would dearly love to see 
Senator Culleton take his place here again as a One Nation senator. I believe 
that they have the support of my other senators. I know that Senator Culleton 
will not be too happy with what I have just said …

I have fought for 18 years to be on the floor of this parliament as a 
representative of the people and I cannot sit back and disregard what may have 
been a wrong judgment. But I will leave it up to the court to make the final 
decision.

 She could make no other decision, in my opinion. But it was well executed.

One Nation’s Rod Culleton wants to adjourn the Senate until all evidence 
relating to the case is brought before the chamber. (He wants to pursue the 
aforementioned judges.)

Given he has a vote of one, his attempt fails.

The Senate is back on to the plebiscite bill.

Rod Culleton to moves to amend government motion

Pardon me. I may have lapsed into semi-consciousness.

The motion regarding Day and Culleton is back in the Senate now.

Nick Xenophon is speaking. 

He and the other Xenophones are supporting the high court referral.

He notes that the One Nation senator Rod Culleton plans to move an amendment 
to the government’s motion.

The Senate needs some more bodies in the chamber and the president rings the 
bells.

 * Pauline Hanson has backed the referral of her party’s senator Rod Culleton 
to the high court for a ruling from the court of disputed returns. Former 
Family First senator Bob Day has also been referred on a deal regarding his

of Technology students under section 18C. The commission did not bring the 
case, it was the complainant, Cindy Prior. This detail appeared to elude the 
PM. It will be worth watching 7.30, where Leigh Sales will interview HRC 
president, Gillian Triggs.

 * The chair of the government environment committee, Craig Kelly, talked 
about previous renewable energy policies which increase the cost of heating 
swimming pools at the same time as speaking of child drownings.

That is all, my friends. Thanks for your company today and thanks to the 
brains trust ofGareth Hutchens, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy and to my blogan 
co-conspiratorMike Bowers. 

I am off to lie in Reclined Goddess (yoga speak) and hope that tomorrow is a 
little more normal. Well, in terms of pace. I have given up hoping for normal.

Good night.
 
Asked if Pauline Hanson’s senior staffer James Ashby wants to parachute into 
his Senate seat, One Nation senatorRodney Culleton told Sky News:

Well he probably wants to parachute into a lot of places. But at the moment it 
would be very difficult to parachute into my seat because the West Australian 
people want me to stay there as a senator.

Is he accusing Ashby of being a political opportunist or was there a slur 
intended by that remark? You decide.


Culleton was far more civil about Hanson agreeing to the referral of his 
eligibility to the high court:


It is a different playing field here. I have to respect the party leader and 
the other senators.
 
The prime minister has commissioned an independent review into Australia’s 
intelligence agencies.


This is an opportunity to assess whether our current intelligence 
arrangements, structures and mechanisms are best placed to meet the security 
challenges we are likely to face in the years ahead.

Consistent with previous reviews conducted in 2004 and 2011, this process will 
examine how our intelligence community serves Australia’s national interest. 
The review will consider the ongoing suitability of legislative and oversight 
provisions.

 I have asked Professor Michael L’Estrange AO and Mr Stephen Merchant PSM to 
conduct the review and report to the government in the first half of 2017.

The terms of reference are here

.
 
Culleton says it would cost a lot of money to go to the high court. 

Everyone is confused [over the eligibility issue], it’s all a belief, I don’t 
want to be sent to an abattoir with a blunt knife, it’s got to be a clean kill.
 
One Nation’s Rod Culleton is speaking to Laura Jayes on Sky.

He calls the government referral an “ambush”. He says George Brandis has 
ambushed him.

He says the whole Senate process to refer his eligibility was rushed and did 
not represent procedural fairness.
 
Today is the first day of new Senate rules to allow photographers to take 
pictures of senators on the benches – in line with lower house rules.

Bowers was not like the dog that caught up with the car. When the Senate 
opened the doors, Bowers was there with bells on.

I thought you might like a substantial chunk of Pauline Hanson’s speech. 

It is a very difficult time for me and the party but even more so for Senator 
Culleton. He has been a man who has stood up to represent his electorate, the 
farming sector and many other issues. But this motion is on the floor now and I 
must address it. I have always stood for honesty, integrity and the truth. The 
people deserve no less, especially from this chamber. It goes to the very heart 
of our democracy. With this at hand, it is a question over Senator Culleton’s 
eligibility to hold his seat in this place.

I was of the opinion when he was nominated for Pauline Hanson’s One Nation as 
a Senate candidate that he stated that he was eligible to stand under the 
requirements of section 44 of the constitution. I took that to be his oath, and 
his signature was witnessed by a JP.

My fellow colleagues and I support Senator Culleton, but we have seen on too 
many occasions politicians in this place and the other place who have not been 
accountable to the Australian people and I will not stand here and be of the 
same ilk.

I believe that it should go to the high court to make their ruling on this 
matter. I hope their findings are in his favour and I would dearly love to see 
Senator Culleton take his place here again as a One Nation senator. I believe 
that they have the support of my other senators. I know that Senator Culleton 
will not be too happy with what I have just said …

I have fought for 18 years to be on the floor of this parliament as a 
representative of the people and I cannot sit back and disregard what may have 
been a wrong judgment. But I will leave it up to the court to make the final 
decision.

 She could make no other decision, in my opinion. But it was well executed.
 
Just on the plebiscite bill, we are expecting a vote on this either late today 
or tomorrow.
 
One Nation’s Rod Culleton wants to adjourn the Senate until all evidence 
relating to the case is brought before the chamber. (He wants to pursue the 
aforementioned judges.)

Given he has a vote of one, his attempt fails.

The Senate is back on to the plebiscite bill.
 
Pardon me. I may have lapsed into semi-consciousness.

The motion regarding Day and Culleton is back in the Senate now.

Nick Xenophon is speaking. 

He and the other Xenophones are supporting the high court referral.

He notes that the One Nation senator Rod Culleton plans to move an amendment 
to the government’s motion.

The Senate needs some more bodies in the chamber and the president rings the 
bells.

 
The report into the backpacker tax was expected today but the committee is 
seeking an extension until Wednesday. It is expected to go through the chambers 
shortly.
