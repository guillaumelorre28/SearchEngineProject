What is your greatest fear? 
Like any parent, anything happening to my child, Isaac, who is 15.

Which living person do you most admire, and why?
Sir Alex Ferguson <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sir-alex-ferguson> is 
the most impressive person I’ve met in terms of charisma and achievement.

What is the trait you most deplore in others?
Any form of assumed superiority over others for reasons of class or faith.

Property aside, what’s the most expensive thing you’ve bought? 
My car, a blue Lexus coupe. It was once stolen by thieves who made the mistake 
of parking it about 500 yards from my then partner’s parents’ house, so I 
simply stole it back.

What is your most treasured possession?
A signed Maradona <https://www.theguardian.com/football/diego-maradona> shirt.

What is your screensaver?
My dog Biba, who died last year. She looked a bit like Basil Brush.

What would your super power be?

Who would play you in the film of your life?
We played this game on holiday, and the consensus was Postman Pat.

What do you most dislike about your appearance?
My Scottish legs, according to my mother. They are good for balance on a ski 
slope, but are never attractive on a man. My mother said she expected my legs 
to grow with the rest of my body; they just stopped.

Which book changed your life?
Philip Roth’s The Dying Animal 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/dying-animal.html>, which is a dark take on 
life, and very interesting about how we over-rely on attachment to people and 
things.

What did you want to be when you were growing up?
When I was five I said I wanted to be either a funny man or on an advert.

What is the worst thing anyone’s said to you?
I took great offence at a journalist who called me blokeish. I have always 
seen myself as metrosexual and in touch with my feminine side.

What is your guiltiest pleasure?
Chart music on Radio 1: I listen to Taylor Swift 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift>, Rihanna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna> and Birdy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/01/birdy-review-indie-singer>.

Which living person do you most despise, and why? 
Anyone who maliciously sets out to ruin other people’s lives. I could mention 
tabloid editors likeRebekah Brooks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/rebekahwade>, Andy Coulson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/andy-coulson> and Piers Morgan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/piersmorgan>.

When did you last cry, and why?
England 1 Iceland 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/27/you-can-go-out-of-europe-iceland-commentator-england-euro-2016>

What is the closest you’ve come to death?
Three times, all drowning. Once in Australia on Manly beach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/may/05/sydney-from-a-blimp-a-birds-eye-view-of-australias-harbour-city>
, once in Greece and once scuba-diving off the Barrier Reef. You do feel as if 
God is trying to tell you something.

How would you like to be remembered?
With the correct pronunciation of my name.

Where would you most like to be right now?
At my house in Italy, eating pasta and white truffles.
