Presenter Fearne Cotton is to shadow four famous women, including Scarlett 
Johansson <https://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson> and Paris 
Hilton, for a new ITV2 series in which she will attempt to find out what makes 
them tick.

The four part series, Fearne and..., which will also feature Alesha Dixon and 
Peaches Geldof <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/peaches-geldof>, will see 
Cotton follow the stars at work and play through their daily lives as well as 
meeting their friends and families.

"I came up with the idea for this show because of my love of autobiographies," 
Cotton said. "The whole lifestyle behind the public image is fascinating. I 
love piecing together the jigsaw puzzle of what lies beneath the surface. The 
series will be a real chance to peel back the layers of certain celebrities' 
lives."

The ITV director of digital channels and acquisitions, Zai Bennett, who 
ordered the show along with commissioning editor for factual Diana Howie, 
added: "Fearne andITV2 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/itv2> are good 
friends so we're delighted she will be able to find out what really makes some 
of the most talked about women in the world tick."

The series, which is being made by ITV Studios, is executive-produced by 
Jonathan Levi and directed by Iain Thompson.
