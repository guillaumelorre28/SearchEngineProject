Governor Ali Roba said in a statement: “We have suffered yet another attack in 
Mandera and sadly we have lost six people.” Police chief Joseph Boinnet said 
there were 33 people in the compound when the attack took place.

The Islamist group said it had carried out the attack. “We are behind the 
Mandera attack in which we killed six Christians,” Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, 
al-Shabaab’s military operations spokesman, told Reuters, adding that they had 
also hit a police vehicle using a roadside bomb.

In several bus ambushes in the region, gunmen have separated passengers by 
religion, killing non-Muslims.


Al-Shabaab has fought to overthrow the internationally-backed government in 
Mogadishu since 2007, but turned its sights on Kenya when the army was sent 
into Somalia in 2011 to fight the Islamic insurgents. Since then al-Shabaab has 
carried out frequent attacks on civilians in different parts of Kenya,including 
a Nairobi shopping mall
