Kali was initially cautioned by the referee Danny Makkelie for kicking Ajax’s 
Lasse Schone on an ankle but the decision was changed within seconds into a red 
after intervention from the video assistant referee. It was the first time 
television assistance was fully used in on-field decision-making.

Pol van Boekel, a referee who was sitting in a small van with six TV screens 
at the Amsterdam Arena, scrutinised replays of the 60th-minute incident before 
communicating his verdict to the on-field official through a headset. Makkelie 
then increased the punishment.

The video assistant can review an incident when asked by the match referee as 
well as advise officials on the field about incidents they may have missed. The 
International Football Association Board, which oversees the rules of the game, 
is expected to decide in 2018 whether to authorise the use of video technology 
and include it in the laws.

But Wednesday’s intervention confused the crowd present for Ajax’s 5-0 victory 
in the first-round cup tie as they were not aware of the change. “We do hope 
that there will be some communication for the public in the future, they have a 
right to it,” Van Boekel said.

The two referees will swap roles on Thursday for the Dutch Cup match between 
Feyenoord and FC Oss, when the system will be further tested.

Video technology was used when France beat Italy in a friendly international 
in Bari last month, although it did not involve stopping the action to study 
replays.
