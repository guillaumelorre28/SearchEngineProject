The Olympic skeleton champion, Amy Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/amy-williams>, does not believe that 
boycotting the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi would be an effective way of 
challenging Russia's controversial anti-gay laws.

There have been a number of calls to boycott next year's Olympics in the Black 
Sea resort. The broadcasterStephen Fry wrote an open letter to the 
International Olympic Committee and David Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/18/david-cameron-stephen-fry-russia-gay-rights>
 urging action against Russia and accusing Vladimir Putin of "making scapegoats 
of gay people, just as Hitler did Jews".

The prime minister and Lord Coe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/10/sebastian-coe-winter-olympics-boycott>
, chairman of the BOA, have since confirmed Britain would not boycott the Games 
and said anti-gay prejudice is better tackled by participation rather than 
absence.

Williams has echoed those sentiments and the athlete, who is an ambassador for 
Team GB 2014 after retiring last year because of injury, claimed previous 
boycotts have not worked.

"As far as I know from the statistics, boycotting does not work," said 
Williams. "I did hear that boycotting in the past has proven to never work, it 
doesn't solve an issue.

"The athletes are staying out of it. They've worked their whole lives for an 
Olympic Games <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games> and, if things 
happen outside of your bubble, you let the right people deal with it and 
comment on it.

"You're focusing on your performance. Highlight the issue in other ways, 
through political leaders."

The new laws in Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>, passed by 
the Duma, prohibit propaganda in support of "non-traditional" sexual 
orientation. They also threaten heavy fines for anyone promoting homosexuality 
to under-18s.

Sochi will host a major sporting event for the first time next year and 
staging theWinter Olympics in the city will cost an estimated Â£35bn 
<http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2013/08/sochi-track-be-most-expensive-olympics-history/6614/>
, the most expensive in history.

The 1980 summer Olympics in Moscow were boycotted by a number of countries 
including the United States following the Soviet Union's invasion of 
Afghanistan, with the Soviet Union then boycotting the 1984 Games in Los 
Angeles.

In his open letter, Fry said: "The summer Olympics of 2012 were one of the 
most glorious moments of my life and the life of my country. For there to be a 
RussianWinter Olympics <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/winter-olympics> 
would stain the movement forever and wipe away any of that glory."

Williams, who will be a pundit for the BBC during the Sochi Games, argued that 
just because athletes decided not to boycott the Games it did not mean they 
were ignoring the issue.

"For the athletes, it's a shame that it's happening," she said. "Of course, it 
will be there in the background. It's not that the athletes are ignoring the 
issue, disagreeing or not disagreeing. The athletes are just working away, 
doing what they're doing."

On Thursday, Russia assured the IOC the anti-gay propaganda law will not 
affect the athletes and spectators at the Sochi Olympics. The IOC asked for 
clarifications regarding the law earlier this month.

"We have today received strong written reassurances from the Russian 
government that everyone will be welcome at the Games in Sochi regardless of 
their sexual orientation," the IOC president, Jacques Rogge, said in a 
statement.
