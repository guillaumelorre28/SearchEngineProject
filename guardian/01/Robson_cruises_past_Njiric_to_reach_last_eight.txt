Laura Robson, the junior Wimbledon champion, has beaten Silvia Njiric 
comfortably in straight sets, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the last eight of theAustralian 
Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> girls' event.

Robson broke Silvia Njiric in the ninth game of the first set, before 
surviving a brief resurgence from the Croatian in the second to pull through.

Having seen off Thailand's Kanyapat Narattana the previous day, she continued 
her impressive run of form to increase hopes that there will be at least one 
Brit to stand the heat in Melbourne, and the 15-year-old Londoner will now face 
Romania's Elena Bogdan.
