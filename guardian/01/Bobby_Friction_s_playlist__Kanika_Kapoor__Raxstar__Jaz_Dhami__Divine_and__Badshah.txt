Kanika Kapoor – Lovely

This is by far my favourite Kanika Kapoor song as it’s hypnotic in a robotic 
Donna Summer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/31/donna-summer-i-feel-love> kind 
of way. It drips with the implied sexual passion of so many Bollywood dance 
numbers and the repetition throughout the tune has a hazy, musically opiate 
feel to it. Required listening for fans of 21st-century Bollywood.

Rajeev B and Raxstar feat Mickey Singh – Signs

Raxstar, the poster boy of British Asian rap, delivers a tight track of love 
and loss in his trademark mix of English and Punjabi over minimalist beats from 
Rajeev B. The track also features rising global south Asian star in the making 
Mickey Singh, who as usual slays the song and makes it look effortless. Check 
this out for a true urban expression from a different demographic.

Jaz Dhami feat Ikka and Sneakbo – Pasina

Jaz Dhami, in my opinion, is the king of the next generation of bhangra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/10/strictly-bhangra-daytimers-british-asians>
 artists. He’s comfortable in any given musical situation andalways delivers a 
banger. His traditional bhangra tracks reek of authenticity as well as big bass 
lines while he’s also adept in the fusion/urban arena as evidenced by this 
track Pasina. It’s pure UK down to its DNA, but could also be dropped in New 
York, Toronto or Mumbai and still destroy speakers.

Divine – Jungli Sher

Forget the constructed, romanticised tales of Slumdog Millionaire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/09/slumdog-millionaire-review-danny-boyle>
, or Coldplaydancing in Mumbai 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/01/coldplay-beyonce-hymn-for-the-weekend-cultural-appropriation-india>
, Divine is the real deal – a A force of nature representing the real streets 
and slums of India’s most arcane city. His flow is 100% legit and his intense 
Hindi street slang is delivered like an angry diatribe from the pit of his 
stomach. His musical collaborators like Nucleya, who’s been getting enough love 
from people likeDiplo <https://www.theguardian.com/music/diplo>, have helped 
him stay linked to India’s cutting-edge electronic scene too.

Badshah feat Shraddha Pandit – Aaj Raat Ka Scene

Badshah is King Midas at the moment. Any track he makes or guests on is a 
success. He does it as Bollywood’s own in-house rapper, so hits like that tend 
to reach over a billion people! His lazily delivered flow, dressed with the 
same middle-class Chandigarh-to-Delhi accent that so many Indians aspire to, 
has found his worth spiral out of control in just a few years. It might be pop 
music, but it’s the soundtrack for a huge audience and it definitely rocks.
