As the helicopter lifted, Tjawina Porter murmured to herself in Ngaanyatjarra. 
It had been perhaps half a century since she set foot on the sacred site, a 
prohibitive distance away except by air.

The senior Ngaanyatjarra woman from Tjukurla had flown over the area in 2014 
and thought she’d relocated the site, Talykira. Now she would walk it.

Supporting her 80-something-year-old frame on a metal cane and accompanied by 
her daughter and niece, Porter whispered as she walked. The site did – and 
perhaps sometimes still does – hold water. There was none there now but still 
Porter was sure this was the place.

The three sat down and Porter told the story of the Bush Turkey Dreaming, 
crooking her finger to signify the protagonist, Nganurti. Talykira marks a 
significant site in the story of the Nganurti’s travels and antics across the 
land while seeking a source of fire. It also marks an important water source in 
this desert region.

Custodians rain fire from the sky to care for country

Talykira holds significant cultural importance for many if not all the 
Aboriginal people who gathered in September for a five-day dual-purpose camp in 
a remote part of the Central Desert, just east of the Western Australian border.

At night the men sang of Tjukurpa, the Dreaming, around a campfire. In 
daylight hours groups set off for site visits and burning trips.


Senior men and women from communities across the Northern Territory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory>, South 
Australia and Western Australia had convened to discuss business and visit a 
number of sacred sites within the Katiti-Petermann and Ngaanyatjarra Indigenous 
protected areas in the NT and WA, accompanied by anthropologists.

By confirming and noting the sacred sites, the Central Land and Ngaanyatjarra 
councils – which represent Indigenous groups in the Central Desert region – 
seek to equip itself with cultural information about traditional country, 
ownership and seniority. They can then help Indigenous groups protect and 
preserve their sites from any adverse affects from mining, tourism and 
development projects on the rest of their land.

Newberry, Ronnie Allen, Roy Yaltjanki, Josephine Napurrula, Pantjiti McKenzie,

While these site searches went on, senior people and young Indigenous rangers 
conducted burns from the ground and, instructed by Central Land Council 
experts, from the sky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/03/custodians-rain-fire-from-the-sky-to-care-for-country>
.


The burning clears patches of thick dry fuel in the lead-up to summer, but 
senior people must first find their stories in the landscape to ensure they 
won’t be destroyed by the fires.

“Burning trips guided by the elders are as much about fire management as they 
are about passing on valuable ecological and cultural knowledge to younger 
generations,” says the Central Land Council director, David Ross.

It also allows people to visit parts of their country they often couldn’t 
otherwise reach, explains the Ngaanyatjarra council anthropologist Bryony 
Nicholson.

“It is because the cultural focus has been supported, from the planning stage 
to the burning itself, that the Ngaanyatjarra rangers are so confident using 
the aerial incendiary machine,” she says.


“You don’t have to feel nervous about putting fire in the landscape when you 
have the level of knowledge held by these senior people underpinning 
operations. Without them, it’s a different story.

“The Ngaanyatjarra IPA [Indigenous protected area] really supports this focus 
because it is what is important for people in looking after country and it 
delivers positive land management outcomes as well.”

Talykira hadn’t been visited in decades. From this camp, only Porter had been 
there. Some of the men, including Simon Butler, had flown over it the previous 
day but not landed.

“That was really wonderful,” says Butler, who lives in the remote Western 
Australian community of Wingellina. “We’ve been in the helicopter, having a 
look around countryside, and we’ve been really proud of that country.”

On the eve of the final day they decided to visit Talykira the next morning 
and take the “newspaper lady” with them so they could share their story with 
the rest of the world.

Climbing into the helicopter, the first group – Joe Young, Jimmy Donegan, 
Albert Fox and Steve Mitchell – make jokes through the communications system 
and direct the pilot.

The aircraft lands in a clearing and the four walk towards the rise, matching 
snippets of song to bits of land and discussing the story, becoming more 
excited as they go.

“The turkey man stole the fire. He crossed through here,” Mitchell says, 
pointing. “All the way, right up to the seaside. Then they pull it out, they 
pull him outside and drag him away.”

traditional songs. Photograph: Helen Davidson for the Guardian 
Young explains the significance of the “mixed-up area”, important for many 
Indigenous desert people. “They’re using all this one reserve. It’s a big 
story, big culture.”

He says his mother and father took him around the country as a boy but not to 
this place, although he knew of it. His brother taught him to honour and share 
it. Young in turn brought his daughters on the trip. The land may be 
traditionally theirs but it is for everyone to visit, he says.

“My fathers and my mothers have all passed away, so have the elders,” he says. 
“I’m glad to see this place, my Dream site. This is for everybody, not just for 
myself and my brothers and sisters. This land, it’s for everybody. That’s why 
I’m here.”

Antony Whiting, an anthropologist with the Central Land Council, accompanied 
the men on many of their site trips over the week. He says they enables 
traditional owners to reconnect with their land and culture.


If Aboriginal people are forced off their land, who will pass down the 
stories? | Kelly Briggs

“The large number of people attending spoke to the significance of the site, 
as did the stories of the Tjukurpa they sung and spoke about,” he says. “They 
felt strong on the country, visiting the sacred sites and singing the songs for 
that country and felt that the country and sacred sites also became strong from 
their visit and their performance of the songs.”

Not everyone can make it out bush. Toby Farmer learns later of the group’s 
success while on dialysis in Alice Springs, receiving a photo from Whiting. He 
visited Talykira often as a child and finding the site again had been on his 
mind since he left for the Warburton mission to go to school.

“I was there with my family, my mother and father ... After rain we would go 
out,” he says. “Talykira, if you dig him up [the water] will come out quick.

“When I saw that photo, I thought, ‘Oh yeah! They found that place. Winner!’ 
Make me happy. It’s a really important place. Big story.”

The long-held memories of senior people reveal a mosaic of stories, Nicholson 
says. It begins with the most important one, the Tjukurpa. Then tales of the 
“early days people” are added and the experience of people such as Porter 
living and travelling around this country.

“In 2016, add to this the stories of travelling across country in a 
helicopter, visiting sites for the first time and patch burning with an 
incendiary machine,” Nicholson says.

“It’s just another story of lives and events played out on country but it’s 
what’s important when it comes to looking after it. Visiting country, actually 
being there, is to experience the real ‘telling’ of the story. It is what makes 
the mark or leaves the lasting impression that becomes the story for the next 
generation to tell.”
