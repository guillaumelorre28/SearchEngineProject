Droog

These Dutch godfathers of pragmatic, funny design use their Amsterdam flagship 
store (they also own a store in Las Vegas) to showcase their greatest and 
latest (re)inventions. Having achieved world renown for works like Tejo Remy's 
loosely bundled set of found drawers or his chair made out of strapped-together 
rags, Droog delivers dry commentary on the too-often all-surface/no-substance 
world of design by using discarded or unlikely materials to style familiar 
objects anew. A typical, recent addition to their collection isHeleen Klopper's 
Woolfiller <http://www.droog.com/store/wearables/woolfiller---natural///>, a 
revolutionary invention to fill holes (or hide stains) in woollen garments 
using nothing more than raw wool and Klopper's special needle.

Maison de Bonneterie

The less obvious of Amsterdam's two turn-of-the-century department stores (the 
other being theBijenkorf <http://www.debijenkorf.nl/amsterdam>, or "beehive", 
on Dam Square) started by 19th-century entrepreneurs from Amsterdam's 
then-flourishing Jewish community, this gorgeously skylit building presents a 
luxurious alternative to its gaudy and chaotic neighbours on nearby 
Kalverstraat. A pleasant refuge from the busy streets outside, it's worth a 
visit to just to bask in the atrium's brightness. With three floors of 
brand-name clothing (Tommy Hilfiger, DKNY, Polo) in a familiar store-in-store 
layout, the Bonneterie has served the preppier sections of Dutch society since 
1911. A small plaque along the monumental staircase commemorates the 68 Jewish 
staff members killed during the occupation.

LockStock & Barrel
 Lock Stock & Barrel 
A pleasant warren of streets (and canals) clustered west of the Dam Square 
heart of Amsterdam, the so-calledNine Streets <http://www.theninestreets.com> 
shopping district hosts some of the city's trendier restaurants (such asEnvy 
<http://www.envy.nl/> and its sibling wine bar Vyne <http://www.vyne.nl/>) and 
many independently owned businesses. On these busy byways, aside from the 
marvellous vintage finds atLaura Dols <http://www.lauradols.nl/uk/vintage/> on 
Wolvenstraat, LockStock & Barrel is the place to go for eclectic but 
well-curated clothing and accessories sourced from as far away as Japan 
(jewellery by Noguchi), Finland (Ivana Helsinki <http://www.ivanahelsinki.com>
's womenswear) and the US (Current/Elliott <http://www.currentelliott.com> 
jeans). Now there's a great way to preserve the spirit of the explorer 
merchants of the Dutch golden age!

Moooi
 Moooi 
The Jordaan neighbourhood just west of the Nine Streets is famous for being 
the most "authentic" part of Amsterdam (read: having preserved a nostalgic 
sheen of Dutch working-class culture). These streets have long been taken over 
by the chattering classes, which blessedly means there's more to do than just 
crowd into tiny brown cafes and be deafened by execrable Polderpop. Moooi 
(which roughly translates as "beooootiful") boasts 700 stark white square 
metres of joyous design products from world-class design fairs such as Milan. 
Aside from modern classics such asFreshwest <http://www.freshwest.co.uk> or 
Ingo Maurer <http://www.ingo-maurer.com>'s high-concept lighting, the space 
beautifully showcases the work of Dutch star designersMarcel Wanders 
<http://www.marcelwanders.com>, Studio Job <http://www.studiojob.nl> and 
Bertjan Pot <http://www.bertjanpot.nl>.

SPRMRKT
 sprmrkt 
Not to be confused with Marqt <http://www.marqt.com>, the high-end organic 
market on Overtoom 21, ex-supermarket SPRMRKT (and its outlet sibling SPR+ next 
door) has replaced the dairy and veggie aisles with vintage Eames and Panton 
furnishings, as well as racks of hipster couture. Though trendy and colourful 
in their dress, the Dutch aren't known for bold fashion choices – as they say, 
"being normal is crazy enough". But now Amsterdam's international allure and 
growing fashion industry have created a pocket cosmopolitan enough to allow 
even the more outrageous designs ofRick Owens <http://www.rickowens.eu>, Henrik 
Vibskov <http://www.henrikvibskov.com> and Martin Margiela to find favour with 
the young graphic design and public relations sets.

The American Book Center
 American Book centre 
Started in 1972 as an underground soft-core porn emporium, the American Book 
Center has long since grown out of those humble beginnings and become 
Amsterdam's default English-language bookshop. After its 2006 redesign, ABC's 
Spui location (a literary hub steps away fromWaterstone's 
<http://www.waterstones.com> and Athenaeum <http://www.athenaeum.nl/dag>) 
matches its dedication to fringe genres like sci-fi, crime and gay fiction with 
a clear, double-helix design that spirals shoppers past its well-stocked 
shelves as they wind up towards the fiction section. The enthusiastic staff 
offer great advice (and discounts to seniors and teachers). The benches outside 
are great for people-watching, and there's an alfresco book market here every 
Friday (10am-6pm).

No matter their political bent or fashion stripe, all Dutch people are united 
in their abiding love for HEMA, a chain of department stores with tentacles in 
each city in the Netherlands. Like Muji, HEMA designs and produces everything 
it sells, making for an astonishingly coherent shopping experience, whether 
you're in the market for a bicycle, arookworst (smoked sausage, served hot with 
spicy mustard), or some boxer briefs. For reasonably priced gifts, head to the 
kids' clothing section for cute but not cutesy cotton babygrows, or dip into 
the lower-priced end of Dutch design with HEMA's colourful napkins and 
tableware.

The Frozen Fountain

Incongruously located on one the city's stodgier canals, the Frozen Fountain 
presents an up-to-the-second snapshot of Dutch design. Through their close 
contacts with art schools around the country, this longstanding institution 
(founded in 1985) and its proprietors, Cok de Rooy and Dick Dankers have built 
a collection that artfully balances the world of art and design, as evidenced 
by the contemporary photographers (like Inez van Lamsweerde) gracing the walls. 
Aside from seminal works byPiet Hein Eek <http://www.pietheineek.nl/en> and 
Hella Jongerius <http://www.jongeriuslab.com>, we recommend their textiles, 
standouts of which areScholten & Baijings <http://www.scholtenbaijings.com> 
stripy neon blankets and Leendert Masselink's uber-cute gnome towels.

iittala

It's not entirely clear how the Dutch became such design lovers, though some 
suggest their efforts at winning land back from the sea have made them a tad 
hubristic about shaping the world around them. Still, all that quirky, 
pragmatic design can start to feel samey, and Dutch consumers have recently 
taken to Finnish glass and tableware masters iittala. With their modern lines 
and exceedingly high quality standards, the Fins are firmly entrenching 
themselves in the dishwashers of families or young professionals upgrading from 
their lighter, identikit HEMA or Ikea plates and glasses. The uncluttered 
displays showcase iittala's sturdy but never inelegant designs (let's disregard 
their cultish glass bird section).

Ennu

Amsterdam's "Old South", just below the Vondelpark, is home to the city's 
richest property developers and inside-traders, a natural luxury shopping 
destination. This kind of crowd means it should mostly be avoided, with PC 
Hooftstraat the axis on which wealthy Lowlanders congregate to air-kiss (three 
times, FYI) and gently bump SUVs. The one exception to this rule is Ennu ("now 
what?"), the only address for high-end men's and women's fashion in Amsterdam. 
Its smoky glass window hides the shop's moody, stark interior by architects
Doepel Strijkers <http://www.dsarotterdam.com/?lan=_uk>. Here you will find 
Michelle Obama favouriteRick Owens <http://www.rickowens.eu>, Flemish designer 
Ann Demeulemeester <http://www.anndemeulemeester.be>, the ever-alluring Alaïa, 
and Japanese stalwarts Comme des Garçons and Junya Watanabe.
