Your observation that "some aspects of the coalition's recording of civilian 
deaths appear unreliable" (Editorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/25/afghanistan-war-logs-guardian-editorial>
, 26 July) is an understatement.WikiLeaks' Afghan documents 
<http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010> bear out Amnesty's 
long-standing concerns that neither Nato nor the US have coherent, consistent 
systems for accounting for the numerous civilian casualties in Afghanistan. The 
documents support our concerns about improper reporting of civilian casualties, 
insufficient investigations into casualties that are recorded, and poor 
co-ordination between different national forces about incidents and 
investigations. The WikiLeaks disclosure must now galvanise the Nato and US 
command structures into effectively protecting civilians. Killings must be 
investigated in a transparent, consistent and coherent way across all forces, 
providing justice and compensation for victims and their families. As the 
WikiLeaks documents show, it is the Taliban and other insurgent groups that 
have killed the majority of civilians in Afghanistan. But coalition forces have 
proven reckless with their methods and accounting. This needs to end.
