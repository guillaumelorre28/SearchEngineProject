I find it tricky to buy the right amount of fruit: it's either all underripe 
or suddenly overripe. Can you help?Lucy Hall, Port Sunlight

That's the lottery of buying out-of-season fruit. With the advent of 
airfreight and temperature-controlled shipping, it is less clear as to whether 
a fruit is in or out of season. Even so, try to buy fruit in smaller 
quantities, little and often.

One way of testing some fruit for ripeness is to smell it: mangoes, melons and 
pineapples will smell perfumed when ripe and you should be able to easily pluck 
a small green leaf from the centre of a pineapple when ripe. Pears, if ripe, 
will yield to slight pressure at the stem. I find pear varieties such as Rocha, 
Comice and Williams tend to ripen well. Greenish bananas usually ripen within 3 
to 4 days of purchasing.

If it's too cold, fruit won't ripen, but central heating generally creates too 
warm and dry an atmosphere, which can spoil fruit.

Avoid arranging fruit together in a fruit bowl: it may look great but some of 
the fruits will ripen quicker than others, and there's always something fluffy 
in the bottom you'll miss. The best place for fruit is in a paper bag in a 
draft-free spot. You only need to refrigerate fruit if it is already ripe and 
you want to keep it for an extra day or two.

Fruits that won't ripen are best for stewing or poaching and can be turned 
into a warm winter fruit salad by adding figs, dates and dried apricots. Unripe 
mangoes or pineapples can be turned into salsa with the addition of chopped red 
onion, coriander and chilli. Overripe bananas can be mashed into a banana cake; 
shrivelled apples can be stewed and added to yoghurt for breakfast. Waste not, 
want not.
