Both sides recorded first-up group stage wins on Thursday, meaning the winner 
will be in pole position to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.

The UAE are looking to attend just their second World Cup, and their first 
since 1990.

Captain Ahmed Khalil scored both goals in a 2-1 away win to Japan that has the 
oil-rich nation off on the right foot.

Khalil called on local fans to fill the stadium, known locally as Al-Jazira 
Stadium after its tenant club, against the Socceroos.

“We say to the UAE fans that you are our No1 player,” he told local newspaper 
The National.

“We need you in the stands in front of the Australian team and we know you 
will not let us down.

“Our goal is to qualify for the World Cup ... the team [has] resolved to fight 
and to not shrink from anything because we are soldiers fighting for our 
country.”
