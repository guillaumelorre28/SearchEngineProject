When Emma Morano celebrated her birthday this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/worlds-oldest-person-last-living-human-born-in-1800s-prepares-to-turn-117>
, well-wishers used three number-shaped candles on her cake – rather than the 
117 regular ones it would have required otherwise.

Morano is the world’s oldest verified living person

, and the last person alive known to have been born in the 1800s. She lives in 
Verbania, northern Italy, and attributes her longevity to the number of eggs 
she eats (two a day, in case you’re wondering).


Whether or not eggs are the key to old age is a debate to be had elsewhere, 
but there is no doubt that reaching 117 is an extremely rare feat.


Robert D Young – the director of the Gerontology Research Group’s 
super-centenarian division, based in Atlanta, Georgia – provided the Guardian 
with a list of 2,115 people who have, to date, been verified (or are pending 
verification) as having lived to 110 or older.

A total of 1,103 people have been verified as reaching 111. Of those, just six 
reached the age of 117.

As of 1 December, Emma Morano was the oldest of 45 living individuals verified 
as reaching the age of 111 or older.


Just five other people, all women, have lived longer that Morano, the oldest 
of whom was French national Jeanne Calment, who died at the age of 122 years 
and 164 days in 1997 (she was born in 1875).

However, there are thought to be many more super-centenarians alive today. 
Young estimates that the “real number” of living individuals aged 110 or higher 
is likely to be around 1,000 worldwide, roughly a fifth of whom have documented 
proof of their longevity.

“Age validation is complicated,” Young says, noting that at the time these 
super-centenarians were born, birth certificates were not universally issued. 
He also notes that there can be a long time lapse between someone reaching 110 
and their age being verified as such.
