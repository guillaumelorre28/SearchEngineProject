When hard-partying clotheshorse Kate Moss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss> was led off an easyJet flight 
last week, the news prompted outraged headlines and popularised the term “basic 
bitch”. After being refused alcohol by cabin staff, the supermodel apparently 
swigged vodka from her own hand luggage and became “disruptive”. The pilot, at 
whom she is said to have aimed that much-discussed “BB” insult, phoned ahead 
and asked police to meet them at Luton airport, where Moss was escorted from 
the plane.

Here are some other famous in-fight fracas…

Alec Baldwin <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alec-baldwin>

The eccentric actor was removed from an American Airlines flight in 2011 for 
refusing to stop playing Words With Friends. Baldwin grew “extremely vocal” 
when cabin crew asked him to turn off his iPad and went to the bathroom to keep 
playing.

The undisputed queen of divas was barred from British Airways in 2008, when 
she flew into a rage and accused staff of losing her luggage. As she was 
escorted off the plane, she allegedly spat at a police officer and hit him with 
her mobile. It was five years before BA lifted the ban.

On a CityJet flight to Dublin in 2011, the then 62-year-old French thesp 
needed the loo but was told to remain seated. He took matters into his own 
hands by urinating on the cabin floor. Depardieu claims he was caught short, so 
peed into an empty bottle but spilled some.

Peter Buck <https://www.theguardian.com/music/peter-buck>

On a 2002 BA flight, the REM guitarist knocked over a trolley after trying to 
play a CD on it, raided booze from the galley, tried to steal a knife and threw 
yoghurt over staff. He was arrested but later acquitted because he’d taken a 
sleeping pill and drunk “small amounts” of wine.

Liam Gallagher <https://www.theguardian.com/music/liam-gallagher>

The mad-for-it Oasis frontman was banned from Cathay Pacific over a scone. 
Reports say the scone’s shape offended him on a 1998 flight and the resultant 
row saw him threaten the pilot with it. Liam said he’d rather walk to Australia 
anyway.
