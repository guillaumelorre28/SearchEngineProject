I cannot tell a lie. It has been a difficult few weeks. Arlene Phillips 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/17/arlene-phillips-strictly-come-dancing>
 was like a great-great-granny to me when I was a contestant on Strictly Come 
Dancing and now I've replaced her as a judge, she doesn't call me so often. 
Then she has the cheek to get papped atSimon Cowell's birthday party 
<http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a180303/cowell-invites-arlene-phillips-to-party.html>
! Still, Simon did send me a nice text the next day to say my invite must have 
gone missing in the postal strike.

Personally, I can't understand why everyone's going on about this ageism thing.
That Harriet Harman woman <http://www.harrietharman.org/> should spend more 
time concentrating on her driving. I mean, I know Arlene's fairly ancient, but 
it's not like I'm a spring chicken myself. At least not in celebrity years, 
because I've already had time for my own career to hit the skids at least once, 
and that's really all you need to be on a reality show.

I'll admit I found the judging a bit tough in the first few weeks because, as 
my two dogs will tell you, I always try to see the best in people. But I'm 
definitely getting the hang of it now. Telling Lynda "her walking lacked 
purpose" showed I can shoot from the hip, though she looked so upset I gave her 
7 to cheer her up. The other judges gave me a big thumbs up after last week's 
show. "I loved your comment that 'Jade has a good balance between personality 
and technique'," Brucie said. "I've always felt the same applied to you my 
love." Then he laughed uproariously. What a pro that man is – 189 years old and 
still going.
