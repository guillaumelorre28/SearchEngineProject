Acer's founder has given a sharp warning to Google's chairman Eric Schmidt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/eric-schmidt> that the benefits from 
Android's success need to be shared throughout the "value chain" of its 
suppliers, after complaining that Microsoft and Intel have gathered too much of 
the profit from the success of Windows.

There are also question marks over the future of Google's "Chromebooks" - 
laptops which run its limited ChromeOS operating system, essentially providing 
access to Google Apps through theChrome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chrome> browser – due to limited sales.

But Schmidt, who is on a tour of the Far East, insisted that "resources will 
be shared" among the members of theAndroid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android> ecosystem – though he declined 
to say whether Google would launch own-branded handsets using its acquisition 
of Motorola, which is due to complete early in the year.

The remarks from Shih <http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20111110PD204.html> and 
Schmidt <http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20111109PD219.html> appeared in 
Digitimes, the Taiwanese online business paper which follows the workings of 
the Far Eastern system builders.

Shih's remarks indicate that companies making Android systems are wary of 
being cornered in the way that businesses making Windows hardware have been, 
where operating margins on commodity PC hardware can be less than 5% while 
Microsoft and Intel enjoy monopoly profits on the software and processor.

Digitimes says that 

Shih noted that an enterprise's operating strategy should focus on allowing 
all its partners to enjoy profits and reach a balance, but some US enterprises 
value too much their own interests, ignoring the profitability of their 
upstream suppliers, channel retail partners and consumers, causing their 
operations to be unable to last long.

The warning to Schmidt - that Acer might opt out of the Google's ecosystems if 
it feels that the rewards are not sufficient or ifGoogle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> favours one company over 
another - may seem trivial, given that Acer is not a major player in the 
Android smartphone market, and has made little impact in the Android tablet 
market.

But Shih is almost certainly reflecting the sentiments of a number of Android 
systems builders who have so far failed to benefit from Google's efforts 
outside the smartphone business, where Google faces an uphill struggle to 
persuade system builders to back it.

Digitimes reports <http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20111109PD222.html> that 
Schmidt's attempts to persuade them to build "Chromebooks' using Google's 
Chrome OS have fallen flat:

due to demand for Chrome OS-based devices (Chromebooks) being lower than 
expected, PC players are taking a passive attitude toward opening projects. In 
June 2011, Acer and Samsung launched their Chromebooks ahead of other PC brand 
vendors, but by the end of July, Acer had reportedly only sold 5,000 units and 
Samsung was said to have had even lower sales than Acer, according to sources 
from the PC industry. However,Acer <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/acer>
 has declined to comment.

Google has not provided any figures for sales of "Chromebooks"; Larry Page, 
the chief executive,made only a passing mention 
<http://seekingalpha.com/article/299518-google-management-discusses-q3-2011-results-earnings-call-transcript>
 to them in his rundown of Google's third quarter results discussion:

Finally, Chromebooks have been available for purchase since mid-June, and 
we're beginning to see lots of interest and good uptake, both from the 
businesses and educational institutions.

It is not clear whether the slow sales of computers generally in the US and 
western Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/sep/08/gartner-pc-sales-forecast-slashed-2011>
 have put large organisations off acquiring Chromebooks, or whether the fact 
that the machines require connection to the internet to function effectively - 
because they use a minimal OS and do everything else through the browser - has 
put organisations off deploying them in favour of full-function laptops as well 
as tablets such as Apple's iPad, which has sold tens of millions of devices.

But the tensions between Google, Motorola and the Far Eastern system builders 
on whom Google relies have been made clear by Shih's words.
