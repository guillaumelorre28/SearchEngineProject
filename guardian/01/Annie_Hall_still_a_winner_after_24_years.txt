Two new movie lists have been published, one ranking the funniest films ever 
made, the other the top 10 scripts of all time. But only one film makes it on 
to both, Woody Allen's Oscar-winningAnnie Hall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/annie-hall>.

The American Film Institute has named what it calls the 100 funniest films of 
all time. The list forms the basis of the Institute's 100 Years,100 Laughs, a 
Channel 4 documentary to be broadcast next week.

The list was chosen by a panel of more than 1,500 people from 500 nominated 
titles. Some Like It Hot came out on top, followed by Tootsie, Dr Strangelove 
and Annie Hall. Britain's A Fish Called Wanda makes it on to the list at number 
21, while the most modern film on the list is There's Something About Mary at 
number 27.

Meanwhile, the Writers' Guild of America has announced its 10 top film 
scripts. Ananova reports that of the 10, just two failed to win Oscars 
(although they were nominated).

Citizen Kane heads the list, followed by Casablanca and The Godfather. Annie 
Hall, the most recent film of the ten, although it was made back in 1977, makes 
it to number eight.
