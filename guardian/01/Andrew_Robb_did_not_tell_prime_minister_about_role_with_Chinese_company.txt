operates the Darwin port.

Landbridge signed a $506m agreement with the Northern Territory government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/13/chinese-company-secures-99-year-lease-of-darwin-port-in-506m-deal>
 in October last year for a 99-year lease of the port.

Robb’s consultancy was reportedly announced 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-30/andrew-robb-joins-chinese-company-with-control-of-darwin-port/7978648>
 by the Landbridge Group on 2 September, two months after the 2 July election 
at which Robb retired as MP for Goldstein. Robb retired as trade minister in 
February 2016.


His appointment raises questions about whether his Landbridge role will 
contravene the statement of ministerial standards, which states ministers 
should not lobby or advocate with the government for 18 months after their 
political retirement. It also states they should not take personal advantage of 
information to which they had access in their ministerial role.

Asked whether Robb had spoken to him about the job, the prime minister said 
“he has not raised this particular role with me” but went on to praise his 
former minister.

“Andrew Robb was an outstanding trade minister,” Turnbull said. “I mean, it is 
hard to think of one that had more achievement. Those big free trade deals that 
he executed with Korea, Japan andChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china>
 alone, extraordinary.

“Not to speak of the [Trans Pacific Partnership], which of course awaits 
ratification. But Andrew’s left the parliament and he’s pursuing a career.”

Robb’s position comes a month after the former resources minister Ian 
Macfarlane announced he would beworking for the Queensland Resources Council as 
chief executive 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/27/ian-macfarlane-says-he-cleared-new-mining-industry-job-with-pms-office>
.

Macfarlane rejected the suggestion it was a lobbyist’s role 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/27/ian-macfarlane-says-he-cleared-new-mining-industry-job-with-pms-office>
 and said he ran it by the prime minister’s office, which had approved it.

The ministerial statement under section 2.24 says: “Ministers are required to 
undertake that for an 18-month period after ceasing to be a minister they will 
not lobby, advocate or have business meetings with members of the government, 
parliament, public service or defence force on any matters on which they have 
had official dealings as minister in their last 18 months in office.


“Ministers are also required to undertake that, on leaving office, they will 
not take personal advantage of information to which they have had access as a 
minister, where that information is not generally available to the public.”

Just after the election, Robb was appointed by the Liberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/02/liberal-party-announces-panel-to-review-poor-election-performance>
 to a four-member panel to review the Coalition’s poor election results. As a 
former federal director of the Liberal party, Robb joins the former NSW premier 
Barry O’Farrell, a cabinet minister during the Howard years, Chris Ellison, and 
former Brisbane city councillor and general secretary of the Queensland 
division of the Liberal party, Carol Cashman, to lead the inquiry.

When Robb gave his valedictory speech in May this year 
<http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2Fb610d191-4da6-422a-8c90-055755970d9e%2F0183%22>
, he said: “I will miss [parliament] but I am also excited about the next 
chapter. I look forward to maintaining strong contact and very strong support 
from my colleagues.”

The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/julie-bishop>, defended Robb and 
said politicians should be able to take up careers after parliament.

“There’s a ministerial code of conduct, Andrew Robb 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/andrew-robb> has said he’s aware of 
[it] and will abide by it,” she said.

“That provides constraints and restrictions on what cabinet ministers can do 
in their post-political life, but we shouldn’t get into a situation where a 
former trade minister is not allowed to take up post-parliamentary careers.”

Labor’s Andrew Leigh said Robb would have been involved in discussions over 
the Darwin port lease at the time it came to cabinet.

“It’s imperative that Australians know that sensitive data acquired in the 
public interest isn’t being used in the private interest,” Leigh said.

“The information would have flowed freely. And the 99-year lease over the port 
of Darwin was an issue which engaged all ministers at the time.

“It’s clear that Andrew Robb would’ve been involved in those conversations and 
it’s clear Andrew Robb held sensitive information, as he should have, as a 
cabinet minister.

“I think that Australians today are concerned about Malcolm Turnbull’s ethical 
standards aren’t being met.”

Greens senator Lee Rhiannon said in recent Senate estimates that the 
Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet confirmed the prime minister’s office 
had not asked for advice on Macfarlane’s appointment to the Queensland 
Resources Council.


“The prime minister ... needs to reveal his plan for ensuring that Mr Robb 
does not advocate for the Landbridge Group on trade matters for another year,” 
she said. “Doing so would be a clear breach of the standards.


“At the moment the standards are really only consulted or enforced when the 
government decides to, or when the opposition decides to whip up some outrage.

“These should be a vigorous set of standards used to hold ministers to a high 
standard of integrity, and they should be evenly applied and enforced.”

The Darwin port deal gives the Landbridge Group 100% operational control of 
the port and 80% ownership of the Darwin port land, facilities of East Arm 
wharf including the marine supply base, and Fort Hill wharf.

The remaining 20% is held by the Northern Territory government for the first 
five years before transferring to another Australian entity to ensure some 
local ownership is retained.

Robb’s office has been contacted for comment.
