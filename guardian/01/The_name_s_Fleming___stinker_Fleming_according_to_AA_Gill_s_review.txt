It has sometimes been tempting, over the years, to see a slightly soft 
critical approach from Wapping's culture squad when asked to criticise the 
latest effusion from Fox or BSkyB (also known as The Empire of Murdoch). But 
stow such unworthy thoughts away forever as you balance the Sky millions spent 
onFleming against AA Gill's Sunday Times review last week. "Rarely does a 
big-budget, high-production-values, bells, whistles, whole-damn-brass-band 
dramatic disaster arise so perfectly, fully formed and unaware, without a 
single redeeming feature …To say that Fleming [the man] is made to look 
unpleasant is to do a disservice to treading in dog shit with bare feet, or 
having a child puke into your lap at the start of a 10-hour flight".

In short, a "99.9% stinkeroo" – and a 100% Rupert Cross Medal for bravery.
