In the aftermath of the Trump election victory, politicians of all stripes 
would be well advised not to rely on quoting economic growth figures as a way 
of reassuring voters. Right now GDP growth and even the unemployment rate don’t 
agree with the real-world experience for many people.

If you want to see an example of politicians divorced from economic reality, 
you could do worse thanMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> last week.

The prime minister was asked by 3AW’s Neil Mitchell 
<http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2016-11-11/interview-neil-mitchell-3aw> whether he 
related to Australia voters, to which the prime minister responded by arguing 
he did because it was his job and “what Australians want to see from their 
government is strong leadership, in particular strong economic growth”.

When asked if that message was getting through, Turnbull replied: “Well Neil 
we have to look at the facts. We have 3.3% real GDP growth.”

If you eyes are not rolling by now, they should be. 

Another great example was given by the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop.

When asked by ABC’s Virginia Trioli 
<http://foreignminister.gov.au/transcripts/Pages/2016/jb_tr_161110f.aspx?w=tb1CaGpkPX%2FlS0K%2Bg9ZKEg%3D%3D>
 about the policy lessons for Australia from Trump’s victory, Bishop talked of 
the impact of the GFC in the United States and then noted, “of course, 
Australia didn’t go through a recession, Australia has had 25 consecutive years 
of economic growth”.

Ahh, 25 years of economic growth, get me some laurels, and let me rest. 

There is a bit of an obsession among Australian politicians to talk about 
economic growth and harp on about us not having had a recession in 25 years as 
though that is somehow a bulwark against extremism.

Of course, the 25 years of consecutive growth line only works if we include 
the impact of population growth, because in per capita terms, growth fell in 
2008-09:

In the December quarter of 2008, GDP per capita fell 1.2% and it took till 
September 2010 to get back to the level it had been in September 2008:

That’s two years where Australia’s economic output per head of population was 
lower than it had previously been.

That sounds like a recession to me. 

It was also a period where annual household consumption growth fell two 
quarters in a row – the first time that had happened since 1961, and soon after 
domestic demand also went backwards:

In the 12 months to June 2009, the unemployment rate also rose by 1.6% points 
– as fast as that which occurred in the 1982-83 recession.

Now this is not to suggest that the stimulus measures done during the GFC 
failed. As I havewritten previously 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jun/30/labors-stimulus-package-got-us-through-a-crisis-turnbull-saying-otherwise-is-silly>
, it’s pretty clear the mixture of both the stimulus and exports got us through 
the GFC relatively unscathed compared with the rest of the world, but scathed 
we still were.

And were we more realistic about having experienced a recession during the 
GFC, we might be a bit more ready to admit that our economy is fragile – and 
our political system more open to intrusion by extremists seeking to portray 
those in charge as out of touch.

Certainly the recession of 2008-09 was much shallower than that of the early 
1980s or 1990s, but, importantly for us now, it is having an extremely long 
tail.

One way to look at this is the decline in the average hours worked by adults 
since the GFC compared with after the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s.

The drop-off in average hours worked in the first 12 months of the GFC was 
actually faster than during the 1980s and 1990s recessions. But after the 
stimulus measures kicked in, hours worked increase before falling again at the 
start of 2011:

Adults on average work nearly five-and-a-half fewer hours a month than they 
did back in June 2008 – a worse drop-off than was experienced in the same 
period after the 1990s recession hit.

The drop in employment and hours worked since the GFC has also been quite 
disparate – not so bad in New South Wales and Victoria, but horrible elsewhere:

Just the type of disparity that is ripe for regionally focused, 
anti-“Canberra” political parties, especially if the government continues to 
talk about GDP growth as though it means something to people.

In June, as the prime minister noted, our GDP grew by 3.3%. In the past 30 
years there have been two other quarters where the economy grew by that exact 
amount – September 1995 and September 2005 – but the impact of that growth on 
people’s employment is markedly different now.

In both 1995 and 2005, when the economy was growing as fast as it is now, 
full-time employment grew by 3%; in the 12 months to June it grew by just 0.6%:

Turnbull was right when he told Neil Mitchell that GDP growth is important 
because “when the economy is growing, that means more firms are hiring than 
firing”, but right now that link is not evident.

And it feeds into the reason why people might think the government is not 
wholly attuned with their economic concerns, especially when you look at how 
disconnected even the measure of the unemployment rate has become.

In the past 12 months the unemployment rate has fallen by 0.4% points. Over 
the past 35 years such a drop would be associated with strong annual employment 
growth and also strong full-time employment – of around 2.5% on average. But 
not now.

Since 1979, when the unemployment rate had fallen by at least 0.4% points in a 
year, male full-time employment has never also fallen in that same period – 
until this year:

We are in a world where the big economic numbers mean less to real people than 
they ever did.

In 2005 when GDP grew 3.3%, wages grew 4.2% – double the 2.1% annual growth in 
June this year, despite the same economic growth.

Are we really to believe that talking up GDP growth is a winning argument? Are 
we to believe people will care that the unemployment rate is below 6% when 
full-time jobs are actually falling?

Economic data is very useful for alerting us to what is going on in the 
economy, but right now the big numbers are mostly good for making politicians 
who reflexively repeat them seem like they haven’t a clue what life is like for 
most Australians.
