The new ambassador of the United States to Myanmar said he would keep using 
the term Rohingya for the persecuted Muslim minority, even after the government 
– controlled by Nobel prize-winnerAung San Suu Kyi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi> – asked him to refrain 
from it.

Members of the 1.1 million-strong group, most of whom live in desperate 
conditions in a remote part of northwestern Myanmar, are seen by many Myanmar 
Buddhists as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The termRohingya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/rohingya> is a divisive issue.

Scot Marciel took over as the head of the US mission at a critical time after 
Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD)won a landslide victory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/13/aung-san-suu-kyi-wins-myanmar-landmark-election>
 in historic elections, following decades of pro-democracy struggle.

“The normal US practice and the normal international practice is that 
communities anywhere have the right, or have the ability, to decide what they 
are going to be called,” Marciel said on Tuesday, in response to a question on 
whether he intended to continue using the term Rohingya.

“And normally when that happens, we would call them what they asked to be 
called. It’s not a political decision, it’s just a normal practice.”

He added that this had been Washington’s policy before and the administration 
intended to stick to it.

Feted by many in the west for her role as champion of Myanmar’s democracy 
movement during long years of military rule,Aung San Suu Kyi has been criticised
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/why-is-aung-san-suu-kyi-silent-on-the-plight-of-the-rohingya-people>
 overseas, and by some in Myanmar, for saying little about the abuses faced by 
the Rohingya.

Speaking out for the group would carry a political cost at home. The group is 
widely disliked inMyanmar <https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar>, 
including by some in the NLD and its supporters, and she would risk losing 
support by taking up the cause of the beleaguered minority.

Because Myanmar does not officially recognise the Rohingya as an ethnic group, 
it denies most of them citizenship and basic rights. Conflict over land and 
resources in the western state of Rakhine, where most Rohingya live in squalid 
camps, caused deadly violence between Buddhists and Muslims, which later spread 
to other parts of the country.

More than 100,000 Rohingya have been forced to flee their homes and now live 
in poor conditions in decrepit camps for internally displaced people.

Why is Aung San Suu Kyi silent on the plight of the Rohingya people?

The previous military-linked government of former junta general Thein Sein 
referred to the group as Bengalis, implying they were illegal immigrants from 
Bangladesh, though many have lived in Myanmar for generations.

Last week, officials from the ministry of foreign affairs, which is run by 
Aung San Suu Kyi, told the media they had asked Marciel to refrain from using 
the term they dubbed “controversial”.

They said the Rohingya were not among the officially recognised ethnic 
minorities and that, in their view, using the term was not supportive of 
Myanmar’s national reconciliation process.

Zaw Htay, the spokesman of the state counsellor office, also run by Aung San 
Suu Kyi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/01/aung-san-suu-kyi-set-to-get-pm-type-role-in-myanmar-government>
, has refused to comment on the issue, directing all questions to the ministry 
of foreign affairs.

Marciel declined to say whether Aung San Suu Kyi had personally asked him not 
to use the term. “I prefer not to publicly talk about private diplomatic 
conversations,” he said.

But Myanmar foreign ministry official Aye Aye Soe acknowledged on Tuesday that 
her office had asked Marciel not to use the term.

“Yes, it is true that we told ambassador Scot Marciel when he came to 
Naypyitaw not to use the term Rohingya because it is not supportive in solving 
the problem that is happening in Rakhine state,” said Aye Aye Soe, deputy 
director general of the ministry’s political department. “And it can even 
worsen the situation there.

“This is his right to say or call whatever he wants, but this is not leading 
to a solution of the problems,” she said. “People are just fighting over this 
term instead of solving the problem. This can make things difficult for the two 
communities in Rakhine to gain trust again.”

A nationalist movement spearheaded by Buddhist monks has gained political 
influence by stirring up prejudice against Rohingya and Muslims in general.

Last month Buddhist monks joined several hundred protesters outside the US 
embassy in Yangon to demand it stop using the term Rohingya. The embassy had 
used the word in a statement of concern about their situation after dozens died 
when a boat they were on capsized.
