Q I am one of those unfortunate people who took out an endowment policy 
pre-1988 and am therefore not covered for compensation. There must be thousands 
of us out there. It is so wrong that we can't get help.

My endowment policy was taken out to enable me to have a lump sum as I didn't 
have any private pension cover and at no time and in no way was I ever informed 
this may not happen. Is there any association or organisation specifically for 
people in this position? Is anyone trying to lobby for a change in the law?

A  Taking out a policy before 1988 does not automatically mean that you are 
not covered for compensation, it only means that you cannot pursue an 
independent financial adviser (IFA) for compensation. Prior to 1988 they were 
not regulated by the Financial Services Act and, therefore, could not be 
accused of breaking the rules.

If the policy was sold to you direct by an insurance company, or its tied 
agent, you have a chance of pursuing a mis-selling complaint successfully, 
although it can be very hard going. It could be worth checking with one of the 
many specialist companies who offer to help with compensation claims in return 
for a percentage of any money they manage to obtain. But be wary - some of the 
companies can raise false hopes and take a larger than warranted share of any 
compensation received.
