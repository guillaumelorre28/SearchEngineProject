The Edinburgh international festival has been offering a wide and varied 
programme of music both classical and contemporary for those who can’t face the 
prospect of another fringe comedian asking the audience if they remember 
Spangles. And we’ve teamed up with the festival to bring you a series of 
exclusive short films of the very best performers at work.

We began last week with Anna Calvi and Heritage Orchestra

, but today it’s the turn of the German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, 
performing extracts from the first and third movements of Vivaldi’s Four 
Seasons. She’s accompanied by the Mutter Virtuosi, made of young musicians 
granted scholarships by the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation. “It is particularly 
difficult nowadays for highly talented young instrumentalists to receive the 
necessary support during the crucial early years,” Mutter says. “In addition to 
the huge sums of money spent on lessons, in many cases financing a suitable 
string instrument poses great problems as well. Along with high purchase costs, 
there are the necessary insurance fees. Also expensive are trips to the world’s 
great artists — contacts that are essential for the development of a young 
musician. The support of young artists presents a challenge to everyone to whom 
the future of musical life is as important as it is to me.”
