The hat has chosen! This time on the Reading Group we're going to be looking 
at Wind, Sand and Stars byAntoine de Saint-Exupéry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/antoine-de-saint-exupery>.

This was the choice of nilpferd 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18752300> who counsels 
us: "Take flight with Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's Wind, Sand and Stars… but 
don't forget your compass… "

S/he also includes a quote chosen by Robert Macfarlane in this splendid 
Guardian review 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/apr/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview30>:

It was a dark night, with only occasional scattered lights glittering like 
stars on the plain. Each one, in that ocean of shadows, was a sign of the 
miracle of consciousness. In one home, people were reading, or thinking, or 
sharing confidences. In another, perhaps, they were searching through space, 
wearying themselves with the mathematics of the Andromeda nebula. In another 
they were making love. These small flames shone far apart in the landscape, 
demanding their fuel. Each one, in that ocean of shadows, was a sign of the 
miracle of consciousness … the flame of the poet, the teacher, or the 
carpenter. But among these living stars, how many closed windows, how many 
extinct stars, how many sleeping men …

Yep, that sounds good to me. I'm really excited about this one, even if – as 
my lamentable fumbling over the pronunciation in the video above demonstrates – 
I hadn't heard of the book before this week.

I shan't say more now, not least because I'm still in a state of innocence and 
ignorance as regards the book's contents. As usual, however, any suggestions 
for questions we can tackle and paths we might take will be gratefully received.
