Thirty years ago South by Southwest was a small, new music seminar, a chance 
for young bands to showcase their sounds. Now it’s a huge, 10-day event 
enveloping music, film, technology and a tinge of politics. But for years the 
complaints have percolated that it’s too corporate, that branding is 
ubiquitous, that it’s too expensive for young bands, and that it’s antithetical 
to the local aspiration to, as the city slogan has it, “KeepAustin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/austin> Weird”.

On Friday night on Sixth Street in downtown Austin, however, there were still 
plenty of musicians and fans seizing the opportunity to hear and make new 
music. Even if they didn’t have official gigs, musicians from all over America 
arrived at Austin just to play street shows. We spoke to the street performers, 
aspiring rappers, Instagram stars, country music troubadours and indie kids of
SXSW <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sxsw>.

Paperboy Prince of the Suburbs, a rapper from Washington DC who lives in 
Brooklyn, regaled the crowd with his song Tiptoeing in my Jeremys, performed in 
underpants and a dressing gown. The rest of his clothes were thrown on the 
ground. He agreed to answer the Guardian’s questions on condition he can 
broadcast them with his microphone. He also asked for a hug (which he 
received). “It’s going amazing, look how sexy all these people are,” he told 
us. “My plans are just to spread love.”

 Tyler James from Nashville, Tennessee came down to play at SXSW with his indie 
folk band, Escondido. Photograph: Lizzie Chen for the Guardian 
Around the corner, Tyler James from Nashville was with his band Escondido. 
They had seven shows so far, and another scheduled the next day – which, he 
grimaced, was at the McDonalds loft. “It’s been really fun – it’s pandemonium 
down here.”

As to whether it’s a good place to play, James said that it’s only worthwhile 
for bands if they already have played a lot.

“You have to invest so much time and resources to get down here it’s nuts. We 
have six people in one hotel room because it’s so expensive. It probably cost 
us about $3,000, $4,000 to get down here so you hope you have some shows that 
pay you to offset it. A lot of bands don’t.”

Juliet Tango were playing in front of a waffle truck, having driven to Austin 
from Olympia, Washington – a distance of more than 2,000 miles. “We had a hell 
of a trip, we just got here this morning and rolled in on our last two dollars 
of gas,” said drummer Ripley Ty.

But was it worth it? 

“Absolutely! We’re going to be playing out here tonight and tomorrow night and 
hopefully make enough gas money to get home.”

Further down Sixth Street we came across three young women in tracksuits 
painted with their logo, Blushhh Music. They were happy to have their 
photograph taken, but reacted to an interview request like Dracula confronted 
with a crucifix. All interview requests, I was informed, go through their 
manager, Mathew Knowles. They are Blushhh Music – in other words, proteges of 
Beyoncé’s dad. They gave the Guardian a poster.

SXSW. This is his third time at the festival. Photograph: Lizzie Chen for the

Micky Munday was one of a number of rappers hanging out on the street – the LA 
native was set to play three shows including the Lit Lounge and the Eastern. 
“South by Southwest is dope,” he said. “It’s a beautiful thing. When you’re out 
here, everyone comes for new music, they come with open ears, so it’s a 
blessing.”

So how was he going down? “We rocking that motherfucker, man. We killing that 
shit. We’re jumping on couches and tables, kicking over drinks on the bar, 
spilling drinks on women, pouring champagne on ladies – you’ve got to do what 
you’ve got to do, man. We in the moment!”

Bud Wilmer and Linda McGuyer were “just hanging out”, having driven here from 
Houston.

“We’ve got no plans, we’ll just see what happens.” Big music fans? “Who

like to people watch. “And we haven’t got shot so far, so that’s good too,” he 
concluded.

There was uproar on Sixth Street: a bunch of people rapping and dancing to a 
sound system set up on the corner. A golf buggy drove into the fray, and a 
woman twerked in front of it. At the wheel was “entertainment specialist” 
Michael Blaylark, whose company is called “Go Stupid! Go Dumb!! Go VIRAL!!!”. 
He had no idea who the rest of the people were, but said he has a nose for a 
scene.

He hollered at the Guardian: “I have no idea who this is, but this is my 
family. I love music and I love our city and I hope you keep coming back.”

Sophia Gabrielson made the trip from Denver, Colorado. She first attended SXSW 
in 2014. “I come for the social environment as well as the music,” she said. 
“You get people from all over the world.”

She had just returned from an “awesome” free show by Vince Staples. Her 
approach to the festival is “random as hell”, she said. “I hear about a show 10 
minutes before and hop over.” She said the festival can be stressful because 
there’s so much going on and later on “people get a little loopy. I’m not gonna 
lie, they’re pretty drunk but it’s a lot of fun”.

Oflow Show was making a painting on the pavement further down the street. When 
asked where he was from, he said “the universe, without borders”.

He said he was here to share energy with the people around him, as SXSW was 
“very vibrant, very open minded. People want to see art”.

He hoped his mural would raise funds to form an artistic commune. He also 
raps. “I envision people to see that they can bring heaven upon this earth 
through sharing their presence and utilizing their moments.”

South Bronx rappers Conan and JECKZ5420 were hanging out on Sixth Street 
looking for some rolling papers – Jeckz’s tell-tale red eyes suggested that 
he’d found some local produce. “The atmosphere’s amazing,” he said. Both 
rappers played the Local Lounge, and their plans for the summer include two 
mixtapes, an album and a video.

 Jason Garcia: longs for the days of Jane’s Addiction. Photograph: Lizzie Chen 
for the Guardian 
Jason Garcia is no stranger to SXSW: he’s lived in Austin 23 years. He’s a 
tattoo artist at True Blue Tattoo, near the intersection of Sixth street and 
Red River. Garcia says the quality of music at SXSW has declined over the past 
five years.

“It doesn’t seem that a lot of really good bands play here any more. A couple 
of years ago Jane’s Addiction played a free show or Pixies or the Cult. But 
this year I haven’t really heard anything.”

Bethany Taylor was attending her second SXSW. “Usually I work it so I’m not 
necessarily the fan that everyone else is.” When asked whether it had declined, 
she replied :“It’s pretty much the same mess that it was last year.” She wasn’t 
going to any official gigs – just small bands and free shows.

Jared Driscoll moved to Austin from New Hampshire, as it was one of the few 
cities in America that are warm at this time of year. He’s seen a lot of bands 
on the British PC Music label. “It was awesome. I like that whole scene. And 
Paradise is like the newest Charli XCX and Sophie song, and that was the peak 
moment.”
