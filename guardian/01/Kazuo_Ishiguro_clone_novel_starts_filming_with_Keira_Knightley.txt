A word of warning to anyone who spies a harassed Keira Knightley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/keiraknightley> lookalike on the streets of 
London over the next six weeks. It could be her, or it could be a clone.

The Atonement star this week started filming on Never Let Me Go, a tragic 
romance adapted from the Booker-shortlisted novel byKazuo Ishiguro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/kazuoishiguro>. Never Let Me Go plays out in 
a dystopian parallel Britain where the citizens are cloned in order to supply 
the trade in donor organs. Knightley takes the role of Kathy H, who is about to 
embark on her lifetime's service but hears of a possible loophole in the 
system: clones may be able to avoid donating if they can prove they are in love.

"From the moment I finished the novel it became my dream to film it," director 
Mark Romanek told Screen Daily. "Ishiguro's conception is so daring, so eerie, 
so beautiful."

The drama is a co-production between DNA Films, Fox Searchlight and Film4, 
with a script by Alex Garland, author of The Beach. Knightley's co-stars 
include Sally Hawkins, Andrew Garfield, Carey Mulligan, Andrea Riseborough and
Charlotte Rampling <https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlotte-rampling>.

Ishiguro is no stranger to the film industry, having written the scripts for 
The White Countess and The Saddest Music in the World. In 1993 his 
award-winning novel, The Remains of the Day, was converted into an 
Oscar-nominated drama starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.
