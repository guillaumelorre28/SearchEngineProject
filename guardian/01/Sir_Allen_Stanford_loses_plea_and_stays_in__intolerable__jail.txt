The Texas-born financier and cricket impresario Sir Allen Stanford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/allen-stanford> has lost a fight for bail 
and has been ordered to remain in a US jail until his trial for fraud, which 
could be up to a year away. An appeal court in New Orleans upheld an earlier 
ruling that Stanford, 59, could be a "flight risk". The former billionaire, who 
denies defrauding US investors out of $7bn (Â£4.3bn), has been sharing a cell 
with about 10 inmates at a prison in Conroe, Texas, and his lawyer recently 
complained of "intolerable" conditions with temperatures reaching 38C (100F).
