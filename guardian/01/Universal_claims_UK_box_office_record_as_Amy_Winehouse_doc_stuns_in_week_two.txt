The winner 1: Universal

For the first time in the era of modern box-office reporting, a studio has 
taken the top three places in the chart. Universal achieved this feat at the 
weekend, withMinions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/minions-review-boisterous-and-cheery-despicable-me-spin-off>
,Ted 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/09/ted-2-review-mark-wahlberg-seth-macfarlane>
 andJurassic World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/10/jurassic-world-review-chris-pratt-steven-spielberg-dinosaur-movie>
.

The achievement continues a year of firsts for Universal. It is already the 
first studio to score four films with openings above £10m (Fifty Shades of Grey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/11/fifty-shades-of-grey-review>, 
Fast & Furious 7 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/02/fast-and-furious-7-review-diesel-statham>
, Jurassic World, Minions) in a calendar year. Previously, no studio had 
managed as many as three. And when Minions passes £30m – it’s already at 
£27.62m – Universal will be the first studio to deliver four films at that 
level in a calendar year. (Disney previously managed three £30m hits in 2013, 
withIron Man 3 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/22/iron-man-3-review>,
Monsters University 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/11/monsters-university-review> and 
Frozen <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/05/frozen-review>, although 
Frozen had yet to pass the barrier by the end of the calendar year.)

 urassic World - video review 
The contrast with 2014 is particularly stark. Last year, Universal failed to 
deliver any of the 10 biggest box-office performers, with its best effort,The 
Wolf of Wall Street 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/16/wolf-of-wall-street-review> 
(£22.7m), landing in 11th place for the year.Bad Neighbours 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/02/bad-neighbours-review-zac-efron-seth-rogen>
 delivered £16.0m, andMrs Brown’s Boys: D’Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/27/mrs-browns-boys-dmovie-brendan-ocarroll-review>
 managed £14.7m. Already in 2015, Universal has achieved four bigger hits than 
The Wolf of Wall Street, with Jurassic World (£57.1m so far), Fast & Furious 7 
(£38.5m), Fifty Shades of Grey (£35.0m) and Minions (£27.6m). On top of that,
Pitch Perfect 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/14/pitch-perfect-2-anna-kendrick-review>
 has added a nifty £17.4m, whileThe Theory of Everything 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/01/the-theory-of-everything-review-stephen-hawking-biopic-gravity>
 delivered £21.5m. Together, these six titles have produced box-office just shy 
of £200m.

The overall success has provided handy camouflage for Ted 2, which opened with 
£2.65m plus previews of £1.21m. That compares disappointingly with the original
Ted <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/02/ted-review> movie’s debut of 
£5.93m plus previews of £3.40m in August 2012. Since box-office for sequels is 
usually relatively front-loaded, Ted 2 should decay at a faster rate, and might 
not get far beyond £10m over the course of its lifetime, compared to a final 
tally of £30.4m for Ted.

 Ted 2 trailer: the return of Seth MacFarlane’s talking bear 
With £57.2m so far, Jurassic World is now the 11th biggest hit of all time at 
the UK box office, elbowing asideThe Dark Knight Rises 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/19/the-dark-knight-rises-review> 
(£56.3m). Next in its sights isThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/dec/13/artsfeatures.lordoftherings>, 
with £57.6m. (Both these earlier films achieved their totals with tickets 
priced lower than they are today.)

Now at £27.6m, Minions is slightly ahead of Despicable Me 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/27/despicable-me-2-review> (£27.1m) 
at the same stage of its run, after three weekends of play. However, Minions is 
showing more consistency in its performance: third-weekend takings of £4.15m 
compare favourably with £2.22m for Despicable Me 2 in its third session. 
Consequently, Minions looks on course to exceed Despicable Me 2’s final tally 
of £47.5m. Pixar’sInside Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/18/inside-out-review-cannes-film-festival-pixar>
, arriving 24 July, is the only fly in the ointment.

documentaryAmy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/16/amy-review-asif-kapadias-amy-winehouse-film-is-a-tragic-masterpiece>
 has delivered stunning second-weekend takings of £417,000 for a 10-day total 
of £1.31m. Helping that rise in box-office for the Amy Winehouse film was an 
expansion from an initial 133 cinemas to 214 venues. Amy’s total earns it 
seventh place in the all-time chart for non-concert film documentaries, behind 
Fahrenheit 9/11, March of the Penguins, Kapadia’s ownSenna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/02/senna-film-review>, Touching the 
Void, Bowling for Columbine andTT3D: Closer to the Edge 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/21/tt3d-closer-to-the-edge>. In 
fact, adding in Monday’s takings, Amy had already overtaken the TT3D film.

Amy’s success is not confined to the weekend. The film earned £350,000 from 
Monday to Thursday last week, not far behind the £396,000 achieved over the 
opening Friday-to-Sunday period.Amy <https://www.theguardian.com/film/amy> 
expands to about 270 cinemas from this Friday. Matching Senna’s £3.17m no 
longer looks such an outlandish prospect for the film.

The midweek achiever: Magic Mike XXL

 Magic Mike XXL star Channing Tatum: ‘I’ve plumbed the depths of my life as a 
stripper’ 
With a second-weekend decline of 37%, Magic Mike XXL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/29/magic-mike-xxl-review-strippers-channing-tatum>
 is showing reasonable traction in the marketplace, and has now delivered 
takings just shy of £4m. But it’s the film’s midweek performance that commands 
attention. The film opened with £1.58m including previews, and just took 
another £955,000 at the weekend. That means that it managed £1.47m during 
Monday to Thursday last week. This should not be so surprising. Weekend 
cinemagoing tends to be more a date-night activity. Friendship pairs and groups 
skew more towards weekdays. With its strong female skew, very evident in the 
marketing imagery, Magic Mike XXL always had its sights set on the buoyant 
“girls’ night out” audience, which tends to come to the fore midweek.

The disappointment: Love & Mercy

 Love and Mercy – video review 
Considering the warm reception for Brian Wilson biopic Love & Mercy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/09/love-mercy-review-the-two-lives-of-brian-wilson>
 – a 7.9/10 user rating at IMDb and an 80/100 MetaCritic score – decent 
box-office might have been anticipated. So the opening salvo of £106,000 from 
125 cinemas seems lacklustre. The challenge for distributor Sony is that Love & 
Mercy doesn’t quite qualify as properly mainstream, given a cast led by John 
Cusack, Paul Dano, Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti, but the conversation in 
the specialised market is currently dominated by Amy.

Irish animation Song of the Sea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/09/song-of-the-sea-review-beautiful-and-entrancing-animation>
 is another film that delivered a rather anaemic screen average, with takings 
of £72,000 from 103 cinemas, including previews of £14,600. It’s hard to decide 
if this is serving the family audience or the arthouse audience – but then the 
same might be said of films from Japan’s Studio Ghibli, several of which have 
achieved decent numbers in the UK for Song of the Sea distributor StudioCanal.

The future

Due to the relative lack of commercially potent new releases, takings are 14% 
down on the previous weekend. They are also 41% down on the equivalent session 
from a year ago, although that weekend tally was boosted by more than £8m in 
preview takings forTransformers: Age of Extinction 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/10/transformers-age-of-extinction-review-michael-bay>
, earned from an additional six days of play, as well as £4.86m in previews for
How to Train Your Dragon 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/26/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-review>
. Strip all the previews out from the current session and the year-ago 
equivalent, and the latest weekend is well ahead.
