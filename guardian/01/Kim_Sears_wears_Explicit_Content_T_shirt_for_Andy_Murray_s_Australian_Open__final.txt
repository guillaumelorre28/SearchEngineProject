Sear’s expletive-laden rant went viral on social media after Murray had broken 
back in the first set against Tomas Berdych. After the British No1 gestured to 
his courtside box, where Sears was sitting, she was seen mouthing what appeared 
to be the words “fucking have it you Czech flash fuck

” apparently in the direction of Berdych’s team.

 Murray ‘frustrated’ after losing to Djokovic in Australian Open final – video 
Much was written about her verbal volley and she appears to have taken the 
response with a pinch of salt, appearing at the men’s final in a T-shirt 
emblazoned with the Parental Advisory: Explicit Content logo that is more 
usually seen on album sleeves.

Murray was quick to defend Sears following the semi-final, saying the pressure 
of the occasion caused her outburst.

“When there’s a lot of tension surrounding something, which you [the media] 
created [by referring to the fact his former assistant coach Dani Vallverdu now 
coaches Berdych], then it’s completely normal,” he said.

“The whole first set everyone was tight. My physical trainer, physio, I’m sure 
for Dani it was uncomfortable. Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the 
court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah, in the heat of the 
moment you can say stuff that you regret. And, yeah, that’s it.”
