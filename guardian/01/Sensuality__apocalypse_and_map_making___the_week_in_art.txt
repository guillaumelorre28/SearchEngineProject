 Portrait of a Woman of the Hofer Family, ca 1470. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo
The superbly detailed black fly that crawls across this woman’s white 
headdress is both a proof of the unknown German artist’s skill and a sinister 
suggestion of mortality and decay.

 Nick Cave in Berlin. Photograph: Bleddyn Butcher 
Interviewed for our My Best Shot feature this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/17/bleddyn-butcher-best-photograph-nick-cave-berlin>
, Bleddyn Butcher told us about his lost weekend in Berlin with Nick Cave in 
1985. “Back then, no one thought his career would last so long. The Birthday 
Party were viewed as a goth band: just tight pants and doomy music. That’s not 
what I heard in it, though, and I felt frustrated. I wanted to show there was 
more to Cave than a tough guy with incredible hair.”
