Beyond Hollywood

On the official Rentrak chart, Chinese animated fantasy Monkey King: Hero Is 
Back, in ninth, and South Korean naval thriller NLL, in 13th, were still 
lingering from previous weeks. Not featured, and victims of Indian’s patchy 
box-office auditing, were Telugu behemoth Baahubali and Salman Khan 
tearjerker/image-rehabilitation projectBajrangi Bhaijaan 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nwAra0mz_Q>. The latter looks to have taken 
India’s No 1 spot this week, with an impressive 102.6 crore ($16.1m) domestic 
take and at least $2.5m in overseas readies that would put it just inside the 
global top 10.

Featuring the actor in do-gooder mode as a former wrestler pinning the Kashmir 
conflict by helping a mute six-year-old Pakistani girl back across the border, 
the film continues Khan’s domination of India’s Eid box-office window; possibly 
of little solace to the actor, whose appeal over a five-year sentence for the 
hit-and-run killing of a homeless manis still pending 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/08/salman-khan-bollywood-star-jail-term-suspended-reports>
. SS Rajamouli’s mightyBaahubali <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NQRhE772b0>, 
meanwhile, is striding somewhere between 300 and 335 crore ($47.1-52.6m) 
worldwide at time of writing, depending on which source you trust. That makes 
it the most successful Telugu film of all time by a long way, the fastest 
Indian film over 300 crore, and on current standing,the ninth highest grossing 
Indian film of all time 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_Indian_films>. The 
film’s technical prowess, dramatic dynamism and financial heft (the 
Hindi-language version alone has taken over 50 crore) are prompting some 
soul-searching within Bollywood – too heavily in hock to its bloated star 
system, according to some.

The winner

Evil – the yellow, burbling sort – edged out the superhero delegation this 
week, as Minions held on to the top spot despite the incursion of Marvel’s
Ant-Man <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ant-man>. No particular surprise, 
with the Universal film on release in nearly 20 more territories.
 Holding on ... Minions Photograph: Allstar/UNIVERSAL PICTURES 
The only new observation to make is that, with a steep 57% drop from last 
week’s $115.7m (£74m) US opening, the mindless Minions torrent may not quite 
have the same staying power as the more homily-rooted Despicable Me (-42% 
second week drop) or Despicable Me 2 (-47%). If that plummet continues, the 
latter’s $368.1m US gross (which made it No 4 film in 2013) will be tough to 
match, andMinions <https://www.theguardian.com/film/minions> will be left 
leaning on its (hitherto powerhouse) international performance to make up the 
slack. A month in, it’s already on $625.8m, with another eight territories and 
a possible Chinese release to come. So $1bn overall is still on the cards.


Minor Marvel

Ant-Man’s going to do OK for its size. The diminutive hero chosen by Marvel to 
close business on itssecond phase 
<http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Phase_Two> has been given a 
scaled-down budget: $130m, against Captain America: The First Avenger’s $140m, 
Thor’s $150m and Guardians of the Galaxy’s $170m, to compare it to the studio’s 
other first-instalment offerings.

Just as well, because Ant-Man’s $58m US opening – good, but still the lowest 
for an in-house Marvel offering – suggests Peyton Reed’s serviceable, 
intermittently inspired romp will not have the same level of impact as the rest 
of the stable. But this was probably a project with innate limitations: Ant-Man 
is a relatively obscure part of the Marvel canon, and lead actor Paul Rudd 
supplied only modest star traction ($19.2m for Role Models and $17.8m for I 
Love You, Man are histwo previous best opening 
<http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=paulrudd.htm>s where he was a 
key part of the package).

 Ant-Man - video review 
The good news – for the strength of the overall Marvel brand as much as 
anything else – is that Ant-Man is going toe-to-toe with other superhero new 
boys overseas. Taking this week’s top five markets – the UK ($6m), Mexico 
($5.6m), Russia ($4.9m), France ($4m) and Australia ($4m) – as comparison 
points, Ant-Man is outpacing the first Captain America, level with Iron Man, 
slightly under Thor, well under Guardians of the Galaxy.

Interestingly, the one region where it’s setting records next to the above is 
south-east Asia; possibly Marvel’s heritage, and its superhero pecking order, 
are less relevant here. So, overall, no danger of Ant-Man’s box office going 
sub-atomic. Marvel’sPhase Three 
<http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Phase_Three>, which begins with 
2016’s Doctor Strange, could be where the pressure is on: lots of unfamiliar 
faces to introduce to audiences, and more concerted competition as Warner Bros 
and DC finally get their act together with their own cinematic universe.


Monster Chinese weekend

Like February’s news that the monthly Chinese total had beaten the US one for 
the first time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/mar/04/will-smith-fifty-shades-of-grey-focus-birdman-from-vegas-to-macau-2>
, this felt like another one of those weeks where the eastern box-office tide 
lapped another few centimetres further up the strand. Two local films – 
CGI/live-action hybridMonster Hunt <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYB7L6YTySs>
 ($72m) and superhero spoofJian Bing Man 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj-gZdPLIgQ> ($61m) – each grossed more than 
the No 1 US film Ant-Man, and helped set a slew of records on the way. Counted 
across four days since its Thursday release, Monster Hunt – Shrek the Third 
co-directorRaman Hui <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_Hui>’s tale of a 
civil war in the monster kingdom – took $109m, beating road comedy Breakup 
Buddies’ domestic-film opening record from last year; it also set new highs for 
biggest opening day ($26.4m) and biggest single day ($29.8m).

Saturday saw the biggest-ever 24 hours at the Chinese box office ($68.3m), as 
part of its biggest-ever weekend ($185m), during its biggest-ever week ($282m). 
Jian Bing Man – which translates as Pancake Man, one of the gallery of goons in 
this meta-tinged superhero lampooning – is also in line to claim college drama 
So Young’s benchmark $118m gross for the most successful film for a first-time 
director. The Chinese Norris McWhirter presumably can’t keep up.

It comes as a huge boon for Chinese cinema: a sincere vote of confidence from 
local audiences who, during the late June/July blackout period for Hollywood 
films designed to artificially boost Chinese market share, have little choice 
but to gravitate back towards the homemade. But not with wild enthusiasm in the 
last few weeks. The successes of the last fortnight,performing-school drama 
Forever Young and Shanghai romancer Tiny Times 4.0 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/13/global-box-office-baahubali-minions-mad-max-fury-road>
, were run-of-the-mill entries from the school of contemporary twentysomething 
fodder that has dominated in recent years. But Monster Hunt – a pricey $35m 
affair from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon producerBill Kong 
<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0465067/reference> that is one of the country’s 
first CGI/live action combos – and Jian Bing Man – which lets online 
comedy-sketch sensation Da Peng loose on the superhero trend and ropes in a 
Jean-Claude van Damme cameo – seem even more commercially aggressive. They’re 
direct hacks of Hollywood forms that feel far more culturally attuned than the 
fusty period dramas and lavish but sometimes cloying martial-arts fantasias 
that have made up so much recent Chinese popular cinema. It’s the government 
that tends to back those, but asthe Uniqlo scandal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/16/uniqlo-sex-video-film-shot-in-beijing-store-goes-viral-and-angers-government>
 shows, its attitudes and tastes are far removed from the young urban 
middle-class driving the multiplex boom. Monster Hunt and Jian Bing Man are the 
latest signs that a change-up in top-down cinema development is long overdue.

Ant-Man shrinks the kids in 12 more territories, including India, Germany and 
Spain, whileInside Out <https://www.theguardian.com/film/inside-out> – on an 
emotional rollercoaster of a release schedule that lasts until October, perhaps 
a mark of how this cerebral title can stand on its own legs in individual 
territories outside of a simultaneous rollout – comes to the UK.

Sony’s Pixels, a rare 21st-century high-concept gig (“80s videogame favourites 
attack the Earth!’’), is opening wide, though – the studio hoping that retro 
arcade pleasures and indestructible lower-common-denominator A-lister Adam 
Sandler are the universal panacea that will speed the film into the most 
emergent of markets.

This week’s 40 territories are weighted heavily towards Latin America and the 
Middle East. Finding a comparison point for the $110m sci-fi action comedy is a 
tough one: perhaps 2012’s Wreck-It Ralph, which had a videogame hero but was an 
animated film; or maybe other concept-driven SFX-driven comedies such as Men in 
Black and Cowboys & Aliens.

Fox, meanwhile, will be hoping lightning strikes twice as they drop Paper Towns
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFGiHm5WMLk> in 32 territories – it’s another 
John Green adaptation, the author responsible for The Fault in Our Stars, the 
young-adult cancer weepie that took a surprising $307.2m for the studio last 
year. Robot & Frank director Jake Schreier oversees Cara Delevingne – fast 
leaving behind her rep as gurning LDN model du jour and building an eclectic 
filmography – as an enigmatic girl-next-door with a yen for revenge.
