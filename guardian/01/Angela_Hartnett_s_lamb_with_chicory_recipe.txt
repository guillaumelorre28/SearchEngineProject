The neck is a much underused piece of lamb. It's not just for slow cooking; 
there is a load of flavour in this cut and it's very tasty when cooked 
properly. Make sure you allow it to rest, and try it with rosemary and garlic 
if you want a bit of a change.

(Serves 2)
300g French or bobby beans
Vegetable oil
50g butter
500g lamb neck, cut into fillets
50ml olive oil
10ml white-wine vinegar
½ tsp Dijon mustard
1 chicory, sliced
1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley
6-8 anchovy fillets

Cook the beans in salted boiling water for about 10 minutes until soft. Drain, 
then refresh in cold water.

Put a dash of vegetable oil in a pan on medium heat, add the butter and allow 
to foam.

Season the lamb fillets, add them to the pan and saute for four minutes, 
turning halfway through, until they are cooked medium rare.

Remove and allow to rest.

Beat together the oil, vinegar and mustard, and toss with the chicory, cooked 
beans, parsley and anchovies.

Check the seasoning and serve with the lamb.
