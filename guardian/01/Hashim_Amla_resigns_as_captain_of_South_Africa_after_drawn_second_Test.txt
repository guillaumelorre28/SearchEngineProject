Hashim Amla <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/hashim-amla> made the shock 
decision to resign as South Africa Test captain following the drawn second Test 
with England in Cape Town on Wednesday, citing his belief that he will be of 
greater value to the world’s No1 side as a senior player.

The 32-year-year-old stepped down after Alastair Cook’s side had battled to 
159 for six on the fifth day before rain and bad light ruined any chance of a 
result, with the batsmanAB de Villiers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ab-de-villiers> immediately announced as his 
replacement for the rest of the series.

With South Africa 1-0 down and two Tests to play, Amla said he had been 
considering his position for a fortnight and admitted a recent battle for form, 
seemingly addressed by scoring 201 in his side’s first innings of 627 for seven 
declared, meant he was better off focusing on his batting.

“Naturally this decision is not an easy one but the more I think about it the 
more I believe I can be of greater value to the Proteas as a fully focused 
batsman and senior player at this time of rebuilding our team,” said Amla. “I 
felt someone else could do a better job. I made my decision two weeks before 
the first Test against England. This decision was not an easy one to make but I 
felt I needed to be true to myself.”

Amla took over from Graeme Smith in June 2014, overseeing four wins, six draws 
and four defeats in 14 Tests. But after eight Tests without a win, and a 3-0 
defeat in India, the pressure had increased in South Africa and led to 
suggestions his placid nature meant he was not suited to the role.

“My leadership style, with a young team, meant I felt someone else could do a 
better job ,” he said, “but there is no particular incident that led to this 
decision. Sometimes you get criticism but I always felt growing up you tend to 
get a thick skin and know which has value in it.”

Cricket <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket> South Africa confirmed De 
Villiers, the one-day captain, was now the frontrunner for the Test role 
permanently but with their next series not until August at home to New Zealand, 
a long-term appointment was not imminent.

The 31-year-old De Villiers, who admitted to concerns over his workload during 
the first Test amid rumours of an impending retirement, said: “It is an 
incredible honour to captain South Africa in any format. This has come at short 
notice and is the realisation of a lifelong dream.

“At the moment my priority and focus is placed on leading this team to what 
can be a memorable series win against England. This Test squad is motivated and 
determined to turn our performances around and I’m looking forward to taking up 
that challenge as captain.”

The news, announced when Cook was speaking to the media after the drawn Test, 
surprised the England captain, with three of his predecessors – Andrew Strauss, 
Michael Vaughan and Nasser Hussain – having all resigned following defeats at 
the hands of South Africa.

“It’s a shock,” Cook said. “I haven’t got anything to say, really. He played 
an outstanding captain’s knock in this Test match. It’s normally an England 
captain that goes against South Africa. I’ve outlasted a South African captain.”

After a fifth day in which England had been in peril at 116 for six before a 
stand of 43 runs over 22.2 overs between Moeen Ali and Jonny Bairstow saved the 
situation, Cook said: “It’s never an enjoyable day as a captain. We always 
seemed to be in a good position to save the Test but you would like it to be 
three or four wickets down.”

England posted 629 for six in their first innings, fired by a stunning 258 
from 198 balls by Ben Stokes and an unbeaten 150 from Bairstow but dropped 
catches in field cost them any chance of pushing for a victory at Newlands.

On Stokes, the 31-year-old captain added: “It was unbelievable batting. He’s a 
real gem who can turn games. I genuinely believe that was not a 
once-in-a-lifetime innings. Maybe not those numbers again but you have seen 
over the last 12 months the real development of a player.”
