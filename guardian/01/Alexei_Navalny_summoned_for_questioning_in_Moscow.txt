The Russian anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexei-navalny> was taken in for questioning 
on Friday, escorted by a dozen police officers who he said had intercepted him 
outside his Moscow apartment building.

Navalny, a vehement foe of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was 
convicted in late December of fraud and given athree-year suspended sentence

. The court said that until his appeals were exhausted he must remain under 
house arrest.

He has been allowed to leave his home in recent days, but has been followed by 
law enforcement officers posted outside his door.

Navalny posted on Twitter that he was met on Friday morning by 12 police 
officers and taken to the federal investigative committee, which had summoned 
him for questioning about his anti-corruption activities.

He said his detention was like a movie scene. “Three police are with me in the 
car and three in plainclothes in the car next to us. Too bad I didn’t bring my 
dark glasses,” he said.

The night before, police detained 13 people from about 100 at a protest in 
central Moscow in support of Navalny and his brother, who was sent to prison in 
the same case.

The protesters were confronted by a much larger group of pro-Kremlin 
activists, which led to scuffles. In St Petersburg, about 300 people rallied 
peacefully in support of Navalny.

The Kremlin has avoided jailing Navalny so as not to make him a martyr, but 
also seems determined to prevent him from organising any political opposition. 
Navalny played a leading role in anti-Putin demonstrations in Moscow in 2011 
and 2012 that drew hundreds of thousands.
