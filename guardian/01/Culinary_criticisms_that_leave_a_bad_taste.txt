Antonio Carluccio claims there is no such dish as spaghetti bolognese in Italy 
(Shortcuts

, G2, 12 October). Yet I have eaten it in Bologna. It was disappointing – made, 
as Carluccio says “without any herbs”. I have also eaten paella with chorizo, 
chicken and prawns in Spain (Jamie Oliver’s paella brings fractured Spain

• Tim Lott (Opinion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/no-small-talk-social-life-1950s-manners-truth>
, 7 October) is mistaken in supposing that small talk at dinner parties is a 
matter of politeness. The point, of course, is not to bore. “Ukip voters and 
Stockport welders” are by no means alone in thinking that too many 
“broadsheet-reading, Newsnight-viewing would-be sophisticates” are indeed – as 
he puts it – “all up themselves”.

• Finally! A realistic picture of the deer in Richmond Park, complete with the 
paparazzi they have to contend with every autumn (Standoff with stag, 13 
October). Are they really all “amateurs”? Commercial photography is forbidden 
in the royal parks without a special licence.

• In memory of Harold Godwinson, late of Wessex, known throughout the land as 
Harold II. He died at Hastings defending his country against a foreign invader
