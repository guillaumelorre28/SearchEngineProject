Night-time politics

 * The biggest news out of today is that Labor and the Coalition have come to 
an arrangement on the budget savings bill. Contrary to Coalition suggestion 
that they would find the crossbenchers easier to negotiate with, this coming 
together clears the way for Labor and the Coalition to do more deals down the 
track. You can argue over the specific policy items – such as cuts to Arena – 
but in my opinion the signs of compromise are a good thing. It breaks the 
deadlock on the shocking tribalism that inhabited the 43rd parliament under 
Tony Abbott as opposition leader. It clears the way for more centrist policies. 
It also is an acknowledgement that oppositions, present and future, can take 
part constructively in policy formulation. Labor thanked the Coalition. The 
Coalition thanked Labor.

 * The future of the plebiscite remains in doubt, notwithstanding the 
Coalition cabinet and party room ticking off on public funding for the yes and 
no cases, a committee system to dole out the funding and a date: February 11. 
Labor still hasn’t said whether it will vote against the plebiscite legislation 
even though it doesn’t support the poll and said it could cause suicides. The 
Liberal senator Dean Smith has flagged he could not support the plebiscite bill.
 * Late today, the parliament was arguing about the standing orders. These are 
the parliamentary rules. Labor has accused the Coalition of trying to change 
the rules after it lost the votes on September one. Christopher Pyne, leader of 
the house, says it is no such thing – the recommendations came from previous 
committee reports. 
I am going to have to leave it there ...

Thanks to the brains trust Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy and Gareth Hutchens. 
Mikey Bowers, take a bow. Thanks to readers too for all your help. All the 
contributions are gratefully accepted. You know who you are.

Tomorrow we should see the plebiscite legislation. 

Onwards and upwards.

Goodnight.

Christopher Pyne wants to deal with Albanese’s “canard”, that the changes were 
due to the loss of the votes in the last sitting week.

The events of September 1 – as we call them on this side of the House – had no 
bearing on the changes to standing order 132.

He first proposed them in August, says Pyne. 

All the way along I have tried to show my cooperation, says Pyne.

Albo shouts: “your a saint!”

It’s not often the member for Grayndler calls me a saint ... We want the 45th 
parliament to be good for Australia.

Pyne is justifying the convention of “misadventure” for MPs who miss votes as 
part of the changes. This would make certain allowances if members miss a 
division. Pyne cites the example of a MP in the past who had got “stuck in 
facilities” in the parliament. He explains that the MP got stuck because he 
thought it was a “push-pull door” rather than a sliding door.

The Speaker asked him to come to the point. Pyne admits to digressing. He 
suggests Albo often distracts him.

(I do love these two and their parliamentary parrying. It’s worth remembering 
they are friends and Pyne recently attended the launch of Albo’s biography.)

There is a division now.

Meanwhile Malcolm Roberts, One Nation senator, is giving us a science lesson 
in his first speech in the senate.

He has already told us that he got interested in politics when he became part 
of the “grassroots uprising” against the “carbon dioxide tax”.

Communities and families after suffering from the climate fraud, says Roberts.

Anthony Albanese is up arguing rules now.

I remember the group hug when Christopher Pyne on behalf of the opposition 
signed the agreement for a better parliament.

Albo is pointing out the difference between the 43rd parliament and this one.

We didn’t lose a vote in three years of a hung parliament, says Albo. This mob 
didn’t survive three days.

You may remember all those hours ago, Tony Burke opposed some of these 
changes. Labor and the crossbenchers wrote to the government with some other 
changes but Pyne hangs out a carrot. He says he will do the government ones 
first and then afterwards, he will consider the non-government ones.

These are the Labor/crossbench suggestions:

Briefly, we propose the following amendments to the Standing Orders:

1) Returning the membership of the Selection Committee to five Government 
Members, three Labor Members, two crossbench Members and the Speaker (or Deputy 
Speaker)as Chair;

2) Returning the power of the Selection Committee to recommend items of 
Private Members’ Business to be voted on;

3) Returning supplementary questions to Question Time;

4) Adopting a 10-minute Responses to Ministers’ answers or a so-called ‘take 
note’ session following Question Time for any Member to respond to answers 
given during Question Time for a maximum of 90 seconds;

5) Allowing the crossbench question during Question Time to have a time limit 
of 45 seconds instead of 30 seconds; and

6) Other amendments consistent with previous Standing Orders.

Opposition manager Tony Burke says Christopher Pyne is only trying to change 
the rules because the government’s MPs missed the vote in the last sitting week.

The leader of the house had a humiliation last Thursday and he is trying to 
promise the prime minister it will not happen again.

Christopher Pyne is now speaking to the house about the changes to the rules 
in the lower house.

He says he intend to “truncate constructive debate” but warns if it gets ugly, 
he will.

Essential touches on other issues as well. This one caught my eye. The summary 
is by Essential.

A majority of respondents were opposed to all forms of donations to political 
parties except for donations from individual Australian voters (50% should be 
allowed).

They were most strongly opposed to donations from foreign companies (74%), 
casinos (71%), property developers (69%), mining companies (68%) and energy 
companies (67%).

Liberal/National voters were more likely than Labor voters to think donations 
from different groups should be allowed (with the exception of unions).

 * The biggest news out of today is that Labor and the Coalition have come to 
an arrangement on the budget savings bill. Contrary to Coalition suggestion 
that they would find the crossbenchers easier to negotiate with, this coming 
together clears the way for Labor and the Coalition to do more deals down the 
track. You can argue over the specific policy items – such as cuts to Arena – 
but in my opinion the signs of compromise are a good thing. It breaks the 
deadlock on the shocking tribalism that inhabited the 43rd parliament under 
Tony Abbott as opposition leader. It clears the way for more centrist policies. 
It also is an acknowledgement that oppositions, present and future, can take 
part constructively in policy formulation. Labor thanked the Coalition. The 
Coalition thanked Labor.

 * The future of the plebiscite remains in doubt, notwithstanding the 
Coalition cabinet and party room ticking off on public funding for the yes and 
no cases, a committee system to dole out the funding and a date: February 11. 
Labor still hasn’t said whether it will vote against the plebiscite legislation 
even though it doesn’t support the poll and said it could cause suicides. The 
Liberal senator Dean Smith has flagged he could not support the plebiscite bill.
 * Late today, the parliament was arguing about the standing orders. These are 
the parliamentary rules. Labor has accused the Coalition of trying to change 
the rules after it lost the votes on September one. Christopher Pyne, leader of 
the house, says it is no such thing – the recommendations came from previous 
committee reports. 
I am going to have to leave it there ...

Thanks to the brains trust Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy and Gareth Hutchens. 
Mikey Bowers, take a bow. Thanks to readers too for all your help. All the 
contributions are gratefully accepted. You know who you are.

Tomorrow we should see the plebiscite legislation. 

Onwards and upwards.

Goodnight.

Christopher Pyne wants to deal with Albanese’s “canard”, that the changes were 
due to the loss of the votes in the last sitting week.

The events of September 1 – as we call them on this side of the House – had no 
bearing on the changes to standing order 132.

He first proposed them in August, says Pyne. 

All the way along I have tried to show my cooperation, says Pyne.

Albo shouts: “your a saint!”

It’s not often the member for Grayndler calls me a saint ... We want the 45th 
parliament to be good for Australia.

Pyne is justifying the convention of “misadventure” for MPs who miss votes as 
part of the changes. This would make certain allowances if members miss a 
division. Pyne cites the example of a MP in the past who had got “stuck in 
facilities” in the parliament. He explains that the MP got stuck because he 
thought it was a “push-pull door” rather than a sliding door.

The Speaker asked him to come to the point. Pyne admits to digressing. He 
suggests Albo often distracts him.

(I do love these two and their parliamentary parrying. It’s worth remembering 
they are friends and Pyne recently attended the launch of Albo’s biography.)

There is a division now. 
 
Meanwhile Malcolm Roberts, One Nation senator, is giving us a science lesson 
in his first speech in the senate.

He has already told us that he got interested in politics when he became part 
of the “grassroots uprising” against the “carbon dioxide tax”.

Communities and families after suffering from the climate fraud, says Roberts.
 
Anthony Albanese is up arguing rules now.

I remember the group hug when Christopher Pyne on behalf of the opposition 
signed the agreement for a better parliament.

Albo is pointing out the difference between the 43rd parliament and this one.

We didn’t lose a vote in three years of a hung parliament, says Albo. This mob 
didn’t survive three days.
 
You may remember all those hours ago, Tony Burke opposed some of these 
changes. Labor and the crossbenchers wrote to the government with some other 
changes but Pyne hangs out a carrot. He says he will do the government ones 
first and then afterwards, he will consider the non-government ones.

These are the Labor/crossbench suggestions:

Briefly, we propose the following amendments to the Standing Orders:

1) Returning the membership of the Selection Committee to five Government 
Members, three Labor Members, two crossbench Members and the Speaker (or Deputy 
Speaker)as Chair;

2) Returning the power of the Selection Committee to recommend items of 
Private Members’ Business to be voted on;

3) Returning supplementary questions to Question Time;

4) Adopting a 10-minute Responses to Ministers’ answers or a so-called ‘take 
note’ session following Question Time for any Member to respond to answers 
given during Question Time for a maximum of 90 seconds;

5) Allowing the crossbench question during Question Time to have a time limit 
of 45 seconds instead of 30 seconds; and

6) Other amendments consistent with previous Standing Orders.

Opposition manager Tony Burke says Christopher Pyne is only trying to change 
the rules because the government’s MPs missed the vote in the last sitting week.

The leader of the house had a humiliation last Thursday and he is trying to 
promise the prime minister it will not happen again.
 
Christopher Pyne is now speaking to the house about the changes to the rules 
in the lower house.

He says he intend to “truncate constructive debate” but warns if it gets ugly, 
he will.
