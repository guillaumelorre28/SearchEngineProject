Mark Ronson described the late singer Amy Winehouse as “one of the best 
lyricists of this generation” before his headline performance atSplendour in 
the Grass 2015 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/splendour-in-the-grass-2015>, 
which ended with a moving tribute to the late singer.

Speaking before he closed out Friday night at the festival with a cameo-laden 
set, the producer said he’d seen Asif Kapadia’s documentary Amy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/amy-winehouse-review-documentary> 
twice, and although it was “very emotional watching 80% of the movie,” he was 
pleased it showed Winehouse’s abilities as a songwriter.

“You see the lyrics on the screen, you remember how amazing they were, even 
the lyrics from before I worked with her, like Stronger than Me.” Ronson said 
Kapadia’s film as well-made and respectful, adding: “It’s a bit like hanging 
out with an old friend again.”

Ronson produced Winehouse’s Grammy-award winning album Back to Black 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/oct/15/shopping.popandrock1>, and the 
documentary includes footage of the recording of the album’s title song. He 
enjoyed watching that section in particular. “It was just fun, at the end when 
she goes: ‘Oh that’s a bit sad isn’t it.’ She would always crack a joke at the 
end.”

Although he remembered the otherwise unexceptional day, he had forgotten they 
had been filmed. “It just seemed so normal. We’d just gone to the Starbucks on 
the corner and we were in the studio in the West Village. You’re not ever 
thinking like: ‘Oh I’m recording one of the great, great vocals of this 
generation on this song that’s going to mean so much to everyone.’ You are just 
like: ‘Let’s go do vocals on Back to Black today.’”

Ronson said he and Winehouse only spent around 10 days on the record together. 
“I wish it was more time because I’d have more memories of it, but it was just 
a really wonderful, meeting someone, hitting it off right away and just being 
partners in crime.”
