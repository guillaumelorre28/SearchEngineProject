Indonesian navy divers have retrieved the black box flight data recorder from 
the wreck of an AirAsia passenger jet, a major step towards unravelling the 
cause of the crash that killed all 162 people on board.

But there was confusion about what happened in the final moments of flight 
QZ8501, which crashed off the Indonesian coast on 28 December, with one 
official saying the plane probably exploded before hitting the water and 
another disputing that theory.

The Airbus A320-200 airliner lost contact with air traffic control in bad 
weather less than halfway into a two-hour flight from Indonesia’s 
second-biggest city of Surabaya to Singapore.

“At 7:11, we succeeded in lifting the part of the black box known as the 
flight data recorder,” Fransiskus Bambang Soelistyo, head of the national 
search and rescue agency, told reporters at a news conference.

The second black box, containing the cockpit voice recorder, is located about 
20 metres away from where the flight data recorder was found, but divers have 
not yet been able to get to it.

“[The cockpit voice recorder] seems to be under a wing, which is quite heavy,” 
said Supriyadi, operations coordinator for the search and rescue agency. “So we 
will use air bags to lift it. This will be done tomorrow.”

The black boxes contain a wealth of data that will be crucial for 
investigators piecing together the sequence of events that led to the airliner 
plunging into the sea.

Supriyadi said the wreckage indicated that the plane likely “experienced an 
explosion” before hitting the water due to a significant change in air pressure.

He said the left side of the plane seemed to have disintegrated, pointing to a 
change in pressure that could have caused an explosion.

Supporting this possibility, Supriyadi added, was the fact that fishermen in 
the area had reported hearing an explosion and saw smoke above the water.

But another official disputed the likelihood of a blast.

“There is no data to support that kind of theory,” said Santoso Sayogo, an 
investigator at the national transportation safety committee (NTSC).

The flight data recorder was brought by helicopter to Pangkalan Bun, the 
southern Borneo town that has been the base for the search effort, and then 
flown to Jakarta for analysis.

The black box looked to be in good condition, said Tatang Kurniadi, the head 
of the committee.

Investigators may need up to a month to get a complete reading of the data.

“The download is easy, probably one day. But the reading is more difficult … 
could take two weeks to one month,” said the NTSC’s head investigator, Mardjono 
Siswosuwarno.

Over the weekend, three vessels detected “pings” that were believed to be from 
the black boxes, but strong winds, powerful currents and high waves hampered 
search efforts.

Dozens of Indonesian navy divers took advantage of calmer weather on Monday to 
retrieve the flight recorder and search for the fuselage of the Airbus.

Forty-eight bodies have been retrieved from the Java Sea and brought to 
Surabaya for identification. Searchers believe more bodies will be found in the 
plane’s fuselage.

Relatives of the victims have urged authorities to make finding the remains of 
their loved ones the priority.
