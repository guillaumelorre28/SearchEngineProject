How, in your experience, have internet technologies been employed to make the 
world a better place? 

The list is endless. Travel, relationships, banking, science, media…

And where for you are the real problem areas that remain that you think web 
technologies can help to tackle? 

Remote areas, accessibility, healthcare…levelling the playing field.

So what projects are you currently engaged in on a day to day basis and how 
does the internet fit into this? 

Education in remote areas for children. Self organising systems in primary 
education. Remote presence and education.

Who do you admire in this space? Who's inspiring you? Who's pushing the 
boundaries and how?

Freud, Tagore, Aurobindo, Montessori, Piaget and Vygotsky. They are all gone 
now. Today it is efforts like google, wiki, skype, moodle are what is pushing a 
new education.

And what can we expect from your presentation at Activate 09? 

The hole in the wall, the creation of SOLEs, self organising learning 
environments for children, SOMEs, self organising mediation environments for 
remote presence.

It is very good to have events like this in the UK. Events like TED, online 
EDUCA, European Schoolnet are taking the US and Europe into new grounds in 
education. We cannot afford to be left behind.
