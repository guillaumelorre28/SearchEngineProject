and his wife Priscilla are set to make up to £10m with their plan, announced 
today, to float their Italian restaurant chain on London's AIM stock market.

The 68-year-old Italian chef and author, and his wife, who is marketing 
director, own around 20% of the company they founded in 1999. The majority of 
the other backers are from venture capital groups.

The company plans to sell 49% of its existing share capital in the float on 
London's junior alternative investment market.

The 23-branch chain of cafes and delicatessens has been valued at up to £50m, 
but its precise valuation will not become clear until the prospectus is 
circulated on December 8.

Carluccio's managing director Simon Kossoff said the company was not being 
affected by the tough trading conditions reported by many of its competitors, 
and that sales growth was currently positive.

"We're not seeing anything like what is being reported on the rest of the high 
street," he told Reuters. "We've got a unique offering in our combination of 
restaurant and food shops, and we're trading from eight in the morning right 
through to midnight."

Carluccio's serves around 60,000 people a week and sales have climbed by 90% 
in three years.

Mr Carluccio, who picked fresh mushrooms and rocket for his mother when he was 
a child, came to England in 1975. After he married Priscilla, her brother, Sir 
Terence Conran, invited him to take over his Neal Street restaurant in Covent 
Garden.

In 1991, the couple opened an Italian deli next door to the restaurant. In 
1999 they opened the first of their Carluccio' s cafes.

The news follows last week's flotation of Gondola , the owner of PizzaExpress, 
ASK and Zizzi, with a value of £431m.
