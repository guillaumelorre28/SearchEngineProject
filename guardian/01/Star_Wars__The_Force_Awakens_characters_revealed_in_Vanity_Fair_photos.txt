 Star Wars: The Force Awakens - watch the trailer 
Ridley plays a character named Rey, and the fact that the character’s surname 
has not been revealed prompted speculation that she will be related to past 
heroes. Ridley is shown taking direction from Abrams, riding her speeder on the 
desert planet Jakku.

Finally, Nyong’o is revealed to be playing a CGI character, Maz Kanata, whose 
look remains secret for now. Her character is described as a pirate, and was 
created using mo-cap technology.

Fett, the mercenary who captured Han Solo for Jabba the Hutt in 1980’s The 
Empire Strikes Back, will headline Disney’s second “anthology” movie.

The studio, which bought all rights to the space opera saga in October 2012 
for $4.05bn, is producing a number of spin-off films as well as a new central 
trilogy. The Fett story follows the first spin-off Star Wars: Rogue One, which 
will hit cinemas in December 2016 with Godzilla’s Gareth Edwards directing, and 
The Force Awakens, which kicks off the new era this December.

Speculation has been rife that Fett would get his own film ever since Disney 
revealed plans to revisit some of the saga’s most iconic characters in 
standalone “origins” movies. Rogue One is rumoured to be about X-Wing pilots, 
and Han Solo, Yoda and Obi Wan Kenobi have also been tipped to get their own 
films.

According to The Wrap, the Boba Fett project is the same movie from which the 
Chronicle and Fantastic Four director Josh Trankexited on Friday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/02/star-wars-anthology-director-josh-trank-quits-to-pursue-creative-opportunities>
 over “creative differences”. Disney will now search for a new film-maker to 
bring the proposition to cinemas.

Fett, a Mandalorian warrior, was portrayed by British actor Jeremy Bulloch in 
The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. His back story was later told 
in 2002’s Attack of the Clones, in which it was revealed that Boba is a clone 
of his “father” Jango Fett, whose DNA was harvested for a clone army that would 
eventually become the imperial Stormtroopers.

The second Star Wars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> spin-off 
movie is reportedly due in 2018. Disney has not confirmed The Wrap’s report.
