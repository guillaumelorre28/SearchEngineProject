The publishing world has seen some fantastically crowbarred-in Olympics front 
covers over the last few weeks. Attitude, for instance, should be applauded for 
its London 2012 Special cover, which features atopless, trouserless rugby player
 <http://towleroad.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c730253ef016768a057d7970b-800wi> and 
the admirable coverline: "Thom Evans is not in the Olympics, but heis in his 
pants."

Even that is scooped by Look magazine, whose Best Of British issue features 
Alesha Dixon waving around a gigantic union flag

. The rather blunt point of all this is that Alesha could have represented the 
UK at the Olympics, if it weren't for all that "not being an athlete and in 
fact spending the last decade singing, shouting and applauding dancing dogs" 
business.

"Before I got into music, I studied sport and used to run for my county," she 
notes in the interview

. This might all seem a bit tenuous, but she also met Colin Jackson when she 
was 15, so some of that probably rubbed off too. Colin who? Don't worry, Alesha 
casually slips his CV into the convo. "I idolised former sprint and hurdling 
champion Colin Jackson," she says, in that way people don't actually say things.

But anyway she could, hypothetically, have been an athlete, in perhaps much 
the same way that Usain Bolt (that's "Jamaican sprinter and five-time World and 
three-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt" in Dixonspeak) could, if subject 
to a vastly different set of circumstances, been the lead singer in Mis-teeq. 
The music might not have been as good, granted, but the relationship with MC 
Harvey would have been a lot more interesting.
