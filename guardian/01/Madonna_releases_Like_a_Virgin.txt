Madonna <https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna> started 1984 a disco chick 
with a reasonably well-received debut album to her name. Then she released Like 
a Virgin. Although it also combined nightclub-friendly beats with catchy 
melodies, its tone was dramatically different. On the cover: a picture of the 
singer wearing a belt with the contentious slogan "Boy Toy". Inside: a handful 
of songs that set her apart from every female singer who had come before. One 
was Material Girl, which boldly stated that, in her world, love came a distant 
second to money; another was the title track, which, in the context of a 
euphoric love song, confidently referred to her sexual history, something 
mainstream pop girls simply hadn't done before.

A woman in control of her sex life and career was such a new idea that Madonna 
became the biggest thing to hit pop, and popular culture, in years. And she's 
stayed that way: her influence on the way women came to view sex, love and 
themselves was so great that some universities offered courses in Madonna 
studies. And she's also continued to make some of pop's most enduring singles.
