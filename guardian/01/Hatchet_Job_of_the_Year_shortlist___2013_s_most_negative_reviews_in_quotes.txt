Craig Brown on Distant Intimacy: A Friendship in the Age of the Internet by 
Frederic Raphael and Joseph Epstein in the Daily Mail 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-2290734/CRAIG-BROWNS-BOOK-OF-THE-WEEK-Review-Distant-Intimacy-A-Friendship-In-The-Age-Of-The-Internet-Frederic-Raphael-Joseph-Epstein.html#ixzz2qMlTIjWs>

"A few years ago Raphael emailed Epstein with the suggestion that 'there might 
be some fun, not to mention $$$' in emailing each other for a year, then 
publishing the results. And so they get going, each of them dutifully 
delivering between 1,500 to 1,800 words a week, every week for a year. The 
first thing to be said about their exchanges is how extraordinarily unpleasant 
they are [...] Anyone unfamiliar with the literary world will, I think, be 
astonished at the ease with which these grand old men of letters turn into 
queeny old hairdressers, furiously bitching about their younger, prettier or 
more highly regarded rivals.

Rachel Cooke on Strictly Ann: The Autobiography by Ann Widdecombe in the 
Observer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/10/strictly-ann-widdecombe-autobiography-review>

"When Ann Widdecombe <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ann-widdecombe> 
appeared on Strictly Come Dancing in 2010, the judges were not complimentary, 
describing her variously as "a dancing hippo", "a Dalek in drag" and "the Ark 
Royal". [...] Is Widdecombe's writing any better than her dancing? No. About 
the best you can say for her prose is that it is accurate. Her grammar is fine 
– Ann is a stickler for grammar – and her anecdotes make sense in that they 
have a beginning, a middle and an end. Her attention to detail is exemplary, if 
you're the kind of reader who really does long to know precisely where she 
stands on the matter of apostolic succession or Michael Howard's sacking of the 
former director of HM Prison Service, Derek Lewis. But in every other respect 
her memoirs bear a strong resemblance to her paso doble: no rhythm, no beauty, 
no humour and, above all, no feeling."

Lucy Ellmann on Worst. Person. Ever. by Douglas Coupland in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/25/worst-person-ever-douglas-coupland-review>

"[One must assume Coupland intends] Worst. Person. Ever. to be some sort of 
critique of mass culture. But if this book is satirical, it hides it well… 
Through total immersion in the banality it purports to expose, his new novel 
out-sarcasms itself. Like Chuck Palahniuk's Snuff, it's determined to gross you 
out, offering a barrage of sexism, homophobia, shit, vomit, sputum, and all the 
other stuff of adolescent humour. Worst. Person. Ever. can only appeal to 
people who like to hear women belittled, and everything trashed… There is 
racism here, and mockery of the old, the fat, the sick, the malformed and the 
ugly – but none of that nears the incessant quality of the book's misogyny."

AA Gill on Autobiography by Morrissey in the Sunday Times  
<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/books/non_fiction/article1330696.ece>
(paywall)

"There are many pop autobiographies that shouldn't be written. Some to
protect the unwary reader, and some to protect the author. In
Morrissey's case, he has managed both. This is a book that cries out
like one of his maudlin ditties to be edited. But were an editor to
start, there would be no stopping. It is a heavy tome, utterly devoid
of insight, warmth, wisdom or likeability. It is a potential
firelighter of vanity, self-pity and logorrhoeic dullness. Putting it
in Penguin Classics doesn't diminish Aristotle or Homer or Tolstoy; it
just roundly mocks Morrissey <https://www.theguardian.com/music/morrissey>, 
and this is a humiliation constructed by
the self-regard of its victim."

Peter Kemp on The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt in The Sunday Times (paywall) 
<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/books/fiction/article1327827.ece>

"Outdoing even The Little Friend, famously a decade in the writing,
The Goldfinch has taken 11 years to appear. These epic gestations are
attributed by awed Tartt admirers and devotees of websites such as
Donna Tartt Shrine to uncompromising perfectionism. 'It's because of
perfectionism that man walked on the moon and painted the Sistine
Chapel, OK? Perfectionism is good,' she has stressed. But it's hard to
spot much of it in this ineptly put-together book… no amount of
straining for high-flown uplift can disguise the fact that The
Goldfinch is a turkey."

Frederic Raphael on A Delicate Truth by John le Carré in The TLS 
<http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1249873.ece>

"Le Carré affects, as so often, to be making daring revelations about How 
Things Really Work. In the clever process, he stretches his thrills with mixed 
clichés, idiosyncratic phrases (can people "go faint at the knees"?) and 
witless dialogue whaleboned with "he retorted stiffly" and the like."

David Sexton on The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton in the Evening Standard 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/how-to-survive-a-superread-8912781.html>

"Let's concede that The Luminaries is a stunning feat of construction.
The Booker judges knew, whatever else its merits, they were giving the
prize to a tremendously technically accomplished piece of work. I
suspect some exhausted reviewers praised it for the same reason. It
doesn't necessarily make it any good, of course. A ship made of
matchsticks in a bottle is a feat of construction but not necessarily
a great work of art."

Hedley Twidle on The Last Train to Zona Verde by Paul Theroux, New Statesman 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2013/05/last-train-zona-verde-paul-theroux-how-not-write-about-africa>

"The rhetoric is so offensive and plain bizarre to anyone making her
or his life in 'Africa' that I had no option but to pretend that we
were in a different genre, to keep imagining the book as a comic novel
with a deliberately unlikeable narrator … this is a book I would
recommend only as a teaching aid or to someone interested in tracking
the final sub-Conradian wreckage of a genre, rusting away like the
hulks of tanks that so fascinate the narrator along the roads in
Angola. It is imbued not just with the narrator's old age but the
senescence of an entire genre."
