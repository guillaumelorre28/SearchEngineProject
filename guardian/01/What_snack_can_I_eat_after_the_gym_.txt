What is a quick, satisfying snack that I can have after the gym?

After exercise, the right balance of protein, fats, carbohydrate, vitamins and 
minerals are needed, but often hunger and tiredness can lead to poor food 
choices, so a little forethought is necessary. The trick is to 
prepare beforehand.

Chicken <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/chicken> is a simple, 
healthy source of protein and this flavoursome chicken dish improves overnight 
in the fridge. It goes really well with avocado – one of the fruits from my 
childhood that I still adore – along with lettuce and oven-dried tomatoes, like 
the sunblush variety which are really simple to do yourself and really 
intensify the flavour.

You will need: 2 chicken breasts, 6 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp mixed chopped herbs 
(easy on the mint), some salt and black pepper. Put the oil in a pan and let it 
heat gently. Season the chicken and add to the oil, scatter the herbs on top, 
cover and leave to cook slowly. Turn over and when the chicken is cooked, 
remove from the heat and leave to cool in the oil. When cold, refrigerate.

For the oven-dried tomatoes cut 20 cherry tomatoes in half through the core 
and put them in a bowl with 1 tsp chopped thyme, 1 tbsp olive oil, a good pinch 
of sugar and a small pinch of salt. Combine well and tip on to a baking tray 
cut-side up and cook for 2 hours at 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Cool before eating 
alongside the chicken.

Your carbohydrate source should reflect the amount of effort put into your gym 
session. If you're taking the snack with you, then it's delicious as a ciabatta 
sandwich. If you can wait until you get home, some plain basmati rice would be 
an excellent accompaniment.
