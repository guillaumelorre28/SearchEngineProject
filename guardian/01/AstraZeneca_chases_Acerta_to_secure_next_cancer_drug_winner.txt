AstraZeneca <https://www.theguardian.com/business/astrazeneca> has said it is 
in talks that might lead to the acquisition of privately held biotech firm 
Acerta Pharma, a potential $5bn-plus deal designed to build up its cancer drug 
portfolio.

 “AstraZeneca confirms that it is exploring potential strategic options with 
Acerta Pharma BV. There can be no certainty that any transaction will 
ultimately be entered into, or as to the terms of any transaction,” the company 
said in a brief statement.

The Wall Street Journal had reported on Friday 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/astrazeneca-in-talks-to-buy-cancer-drug-developer-acerta-pharma-1449856603>
 that the British drugmaker was looking to buy Acerta for more than $5bn 
(£3.3bn) to gain access to its experimental blood cancer drugacalabrutinib.

 Acalabrutinib works in a similar way to Imbruvica, which was developed by 
Pharmacyclics but is now controlled by AbbVie after the US drugmaker bought 
Pharmacyclics for $21bn earlier this year.

 Both drugs target an array of blood cancers and have the potential to become 
multibillion-dollar-a-year sellers, according to industry analysts.

 Given pharmaceutical companies’ current heated interest in oncology, 
Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said it was not surprising that Acerta, based in 
California and the Netherlands, was an acquisition candidate.

 It does not yet have a partner to help develop its leading drug, although it 
has agreed to testacalabrutinib in combination with Merck’s Keytruda.

 Acerta is running a wide range of cancer clinical trials, including two 
final-stage Phase III studies. Last week, it reported positive results in 
leukaemia.

 The decision to chase after Acerta reflects a determination by the 
AstraZeneca chief executive, Pascal Soriot, to use deals to boost his company’s 
pipeline as sales of older blockbusters, including cholesterol fighter Crestor, 
lose patent protection.

 Last month, Soriot agreed to buy ZS Pharma

, a specialist in treating high potassium levels, for $2.7bn.

 But the biggest hopes are pinned on oncology, where AstraZeneca already has a 
goal of bringing six new cancer treatments to market by 2020.

 Its new lung cancer pill Tagrisso, which it believes could make $3bn in 
annual sales, was approved last month and the company also recently launched 
Lynparza, for ovarian cancer.

 Buying Acerta would take AstraZeneca into the less familiar territory of 
blood cancers and some analysts said the move suggested a bigger commitment to 
this area of oncology than initially expected.

 Earlier this year, AstraZeneca signed a deal to co-develop another cancer 
drug,durvalumab, in blood cancers with Celgene because it said at the time it 
had limited experience in the field.
