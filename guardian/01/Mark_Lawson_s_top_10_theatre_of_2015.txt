1. Young Chekhov 
Chichester Festival theatre

Chekhov wrote so few plays, which are revived so often, that it seemed 
unlikely there could be new discoveries to be made in his work. However, the 
strategy of fashioning a trilogy from three early works – Platonov, Ivanov and 
The Seagull – provided a tremendous and revelatory eight hours of theatre in 
Jonathan Kent’s stagings of David Hare’s adaptations.

 As the work now known as Platonov was never staged in his life, Chekhov could 
never have envisaged this conjunction of productions. The effect is a sort of 
critical biography through performance, taking us inside the Russian 
playwright’s brain as he first sketches and then perfects types (trapped 
radicals, hopeless doctors, deluded schoolteachers) and situations (the 
insolvent homestead, the slow-burn love affair) that will ultimately put him in 
a tie with Ibsen for the title of the second greatest playwright after 
Shakespeare.

 The dialogue has a familiar Hare snap – “A ton of iron went into the 
construction of that face” – but maintains a sensible line between fidelity and 
modern idiom. Some actors appear in one or two productions – James McArdle 
doubling a doctor in Ivanov with a magnificent magnificent tragicomic turn as 
the romantic philanderer, Platonov – while others are in everything. Olivia 
Vinall, who had begun the year with a powerful performance as a young woman 
with doubts about atheism in Tom Stoppard’s critically underrated playThe Hard 
Problem 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jan/28/the-hard-problem-review-tom-stoppard>
, fulfilled her rich potential in what might be called a Masha-up of Chekhovian 
female roles, impressively finding different registers of desire and despair in 
each of the characters.

 A very strong year for Hare pieces – that also included a smart new play The 
Moderate Soprano

<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/20/the-blue-touch-paper-david-hare-review-own-worst-critic>

showing at the National Theatre in 2016.Read the review

characters, the Dean, the Bishop and the Canon Chancellor are exemplars of 
spiritual positions rather than formal biographical portraits. This creative 
leeway added to the power of a work that also avoided the most obvious routes 
of sentimentalising the protestors and satirising the clerics, accepting the 
sincerity of Anglican beliefs. In the best examination of the politics of faith 
since Hare’sRacing Demon

 Radical … Berliner Ensemble’s Waiting for Godot. Photograph: Brian Morrison 
Séan Doran’s enterprising annual celebration of the works of Samuel Beckett 
and one sympathetic other writer (this year, TS Eliot) offered the treat of a 
visit from the Berliner Ensemble, the Bayern Munich of European theatre, with 
their production of Waiting for Godot. Expecting no surprises from a play I’d 
seen a dozen times before, I was startled to find that the Germans had somehow 
persuaded the notoriously strict Beckett estate to allow the introduction of an 
extra character and several original bits of business. The core of the 
experience, though, was performances from actors who have been playing the 
parts for so many years that their characters have become not even a second 
skin but subcutaneous. The Enniskillen performance was almost even more radical 
than planned: Pozzo’s taxi had failed to turn up at the hotel and I gave him a 
lift just in time for the start.Read more

 Enthralling … Camelot: The Shining City in Sheffield. Photograph: Mark Douet 
For this ambitious and enthralling collaboration between the Slung Low 
company, the Crucible and Sheffield People’s Theatre, dramatist James Phillips 
adapted the Arthurian legend to a contemporary setting in which a rebel leader 
uses social media to foment a revolution. The first part ended with the 
Crucible “burning down”, and the audience being escorted outside, where the 
cast and 150 local extras carried the narrative into two different parts of the 
city. Turning out to be impressively prophetic of the anti-establishment anger 
that would drive Corbyn’s outsider landslide in the Labour leadership election 
just two months later, the production was a masterclass in how a theatre can 
engage with its community and stands as a highlight of the repertoire that has 
just won Sheffield artistic directorDaniel Evans

Guirgis’s savage comedy of multicultural distrust and the different definitions

Stephen Sondheim has often sounded somewhat equivocal about his 1959 musical, 
possibly because it is one of the few pieces for which he provided words for 
music by another composer (Jule Styne). However, this Chichester production by 
Jonathan Kent showed, during its acclaimed and award-winning West End run, that 
the frequent tension between Sondheim’s astringent lyrics and Styne’s soaring 
score make this a fascinating example of two different American showbiz 
traditions combining to dramatise a third – touring burlesque. As the ultimate

setting by charting the progress through treatment for addiction (to drink, 
drugs and possibly sex) of an actress who imploded during a Chekhov

disintegration, gave a name-making performance as a vulnerable woman whose 
claims (even about her own name) can never be trusted. In the US, this story 
would have ended with redemption; Macmillan was allowed to finish with a
