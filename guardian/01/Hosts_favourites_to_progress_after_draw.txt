Egypt must wait before making plans for the last eight after being held to a 
woeful goalless draw byMorocco <https://www.theguardian.com/football/morocco>.

The tournament hosts were roared on by an enthusiastic crowd at the 
International Stadium in Cairo, but Hassan Shehata's men failed to sparkle in a 
game of few clear-cut chances.

Morocco had a late claim for a penalty turned down when Ibrahim Said appeared 
to bring down substitute Ali Boussaboun inside the area, while Egypt's Emad 
Moteab missed the best chance of the game in the closing seconds when he 
mis-kicked horribly from in front of goal.

The draw means Egypt, who now have four points from their two games, are still 
favourites to follow Ivory Coast in advancing from Group A.

Morocco have to beat Libya in their final fixture and hope Ivory Coast can 
maintain their 100% record against Egypt if they are to stand any chance of 
going through.
