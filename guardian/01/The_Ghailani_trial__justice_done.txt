Contrary to what some have claimed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/18/al-qaida-terrorism>
, thetrial of former Guantánamo detainee Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/18/guantanamo-terror-trial-reaction>
 provides strong confirmation that the US civilian justice system works. Just 
consider the facts:
 
Ghailani was convicted of conspiracy in connection with the August 1998 
bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He now faces a minimum 20-year 
sentence, and possibly, life in prison. His future is akin to that of his 
co-defendants, who were tried in federal court nearly a decade ago and will be 
spending the rest of their lives in prison without the possibility of parole.
 
Trial by military commission – the alternative that some commentators support 
– would have meant unfair, weaker and less credible results. In all likelihood, 
moreover, the military alternative would have meant further delay in achieving 
justice. While supporters of military commissions like to tout them as swift 
and efficient, in the nine years since the commissions were first announced, 
only five cases have reached a verdict, three of them by plea bargain.

The federal courts, by contrast, have prosecuted hundreds of terrorism 
suspects during the same period – among them, convicted 9/11 conspirator 
Zacarias Moussaoui and convicted "shoe bomber" Richard Reid.
 
By making controversial decisions about the admissibility of certain evidence, 
the judge overseeing the trial took a crucial and necessary stand to uphold the 
fairness of the process and the credibility of the verdict. This may have 
contributed to Ghailani's acquittal on other charges, but those who criticise 
the court's decision to exclude testimony from a witness whose identity was 
obtained during Ghailani's abusive CIA interrogations ignore the fact that a 
system based on torture has no claim to legitimacy. And a verdict that lacks 
legitimacy is inherently unstable.
 
It is worth underscoring how a civilian verdict brings something that no 
military commission can offer: certainty and finality. The commissions' flawed 
and largely untested rules have yet to withstand appellate review, making their 
verdicts vulnerable to future reversal. 
 
Despite the doomsday rhetoric of pundits who have attacked the Ghailani 
verdict – part of a concerted campaign to keepthe upcoming 9/11 trial

 out of a civilian venue – we should recognise that trying Ghailani in US 
federal court was both the smart and the principled thing to do.

By now, we should know that respect for due process and the rule of law do not 
hinder the effort to fight terrorism. They advance it.
