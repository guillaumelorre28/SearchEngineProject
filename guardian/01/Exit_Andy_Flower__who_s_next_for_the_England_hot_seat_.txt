Ashley Giles

The inside candidate, having been in charge of the 50-over and Twenty20 teams 
since November 2012, although whether that is an advantage after this tour's 
disasters, which continued when the T20 series was lost in Melbourne on Friday, 
must now be doubtful. But players may welcome his lighter, less intense 
approach.

Gary Kirsten

Has the credentials, having taken India and more recently his native South 
Africa to the top of the ICC's world Test rankings. But does he have the 
hunger, having taken a lucrative IPL job and said when giving up the South 
Africa job last August that he wanted to spend more time at home with his 
family?

Mick Newell

Low-profile but high-achieving in more than a decade in charge at 
Nottinghamshire, first as coach and more recently the director of cricket. Has 
tasted the England set-up on Lions tours but has previous with Kevin Pietersen, 
and his lack of international playing experience is likely to count against him.

Paul Collingwood

Showed his leadership qualities last summer as Durham claimed a completely 
unexpected County Championship title in his first full season as captain. But 
an assistant role with Scotland this winter was his first move into coaching, 
and more likely to take over from Richard Halsall as the fielding coach.

Peter Moores

Has rebuilt the coaching reputation that was dented when Kevin Pietersen 
effectively ousted him from the England job in the winter of 2008-09, steering 
Lancashire to their first outright Championship title in 77 years in 2011. 
Remains highly regarded throughout the English game but it still seems unlikely 
the ECB would turn back the clock.
