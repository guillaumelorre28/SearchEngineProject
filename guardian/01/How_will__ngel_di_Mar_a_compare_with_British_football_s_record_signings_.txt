Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
have no excuses now. In the past 12 months they have spent £195.3m on Marouane 
Fellaini, Juan Mata, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo and Ángel di María. 
Their transfer record, which had stood since Dimitar Berbatov joined from 
Tottenham Hotspur on a crazy deadline day back in 2008, has been smashed twice 
in eight months.

United are no strangers to extravagance. Sir Matt Busby made Denis Law the 
most expensive player in the history of British football in 1962; Ron Atkinson 
broke the transfer record to sign Bryan Robson in 1981; and Alex Ferguson edged 
that figure ever higher during his 26 years with the club. Now Louis van Gaal 
has made Di María the most expensive player to grace the English game. How will 
he fare? Here is the formbook for record breaking transfers in the past 20 
years.

1) Fernando Torres, £50m, Liverpool to Chelsea, 2011

What was the view at the time?
Some Liverpool fans found their way on to Sky Sports News 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPrXm1XMm_I> and burned replica shirts to show 
how angry they were about the supposed betrayal from Torres but most supporters 
were left wondering if this could be an opportunity for the club. Mark 
Lawrenson summed up their mixed emotions well inan interview with the BBC 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/9380389.stm>. “It’s 
not really possible for Liverpool to replace him but they might with two 
players and I think that’s absolutely fine,” said Lawrenson. “On his day – and 
we have seen unbelievable days from him – he has been brilliant, as good as 
anyone in the world. But we haven’t seen him like that for a long time. We’ve 
seen flashes this season, but not too many. It’s a bit like when King Kenny 
left. When he went I think we probably replaced him with about 10 as he was 
that good.”

How did he fare?
As it happens, Liverpool did replace Torres with two players. On the day he 
left for Chelsea, the club signed Luis Suárez for £22.8m and Andy Carroll for 
£35m. Despite wasting £35m on Carroll,Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> did better from the deal than 
Torres, whose form has continued down the mournful road Lawrenson had foreseen 
at the time.

Torres is still paid around £160,000 a week by Chelsea (how crazy is that?) 
but he did not even make it on to the bench for their match against Leicester 
on Saturday. It’s embarrassing and even a little sad to write this, but he is 
now more famous for his misses – examplesA 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=AK1wGtIhKTc#t=175>, B
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG54o9b8844> and C 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pian1EERTa8> – than his goals. Type the word 
“Torres” into YouTube and the search engine will try to finish your sentence 
with the words “misses open goal”. No wonder the man is short of confidence.


What did he win?
The FA Cup, the Champions League and the Europa League. 


Was the move a success or failure?
Failure

Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images 
What was the view at the time?
Robinho wanted to join Chelsea in the summer of 2008 but the Manchester City 
owners had other ideas. When the £32.5m deal was finalised, Robinho told 
journalists he was off “to Chelsea”. The reporters corrected his mistake and he 
managed to express a modicum of excitement for the “project” but, even on his 
first day, he never seemed truly animated about the his new job. “Many people 
think thatManchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> 
are not a big club at the moment, but I think the opposite,” said Robinho, 
somewhat unconvincingly.

“The team don’t yet have many titles, but they are beginning a project now. 
Four years ago, Chelsea were seen in the same way. Of course, my goal had been 
to go to Chelsea because they were the only club that had made a proposal to 
me. But there was a fight between Real Madrid and Chelsea. Chelsea made the 
mistake of putting my name on their shirt without having signed anything yet. 
This hurt the pride ofReal Madrid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid>. Also, Chelsea didn’t reach 
the asking price.”

How did he fare?
Robinho served a purpose for City. He was a trailblazer who brought City to 
the attention of big players and their agents. He scored on his debut, knocked 
in a hat-trick against Stoke City a few weeks later and was even given the 
captaincy, but the love affair was fleeting.

His interest drifted and his enthusiasm wilted. Craig Bellamy wrote in his 
autobiography that Robinho and his fellow countryman Elano “formed a Brazilian 
clique and didn’t give a shit. They didn’t train with any intensity and if you 
tackled one of them, it was like you had committed a crime.”Robinho 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/robinho> would probably disagree with 
that assessment, but when he swapped City for a loan spell at Santos he 
admitted that his Brazilian style was incompatible with English football.


He left the club after 18 months, having played 41 games and scored 14 goals. 
By then City had moved on, with Carlos Tévez and Emmanuel Adebayor now scoring 
their goals and causing their problems.

What did he win?
Nothing

Failure

Jenkins for the Guardian 
What was the view at the time?
Andriy Shevchenko won the Ballon d’Or in 2004, two years before Roman 
Abramovich brought him to Chelsea. Shevchenko had been a frighteningly quick 
striker at Dynamo Kyiv, for whom he once scored a first-half hat-trick against 
Barcelona, and then he had improved at Milan, where he scored 127 goals in 208 
appearances on his way to winning the Serie A title, the Champions League and 
the Coppa Italia. He should have been a success atChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, but ...

How did he fare?
Shevchenko is Milan’s second highest goalscorer in their history, but he only 
scored nine league goals in three seasons at Chelsea. He is almost apologetic 
about it: “I left Milan when I was nearly 30 years old, and I had won 
everything. When I arrived at Chelsea, everyone expected me to repeat the same 
performances but that was impossible. I suffered many injuries and many other 
things. Chelsea rarely wanted to play with two strikers. Like it or not, 
criticism from people is part of our job, our world. Without all these endless 
discussions, football would not be football.”

What did he win?
The FA Cup and the League Cup

Manchester United in an awful suit. Photograph: Darren Walsh/Action Images 
What was the view at the time?
Spending £29.1m on a defender would be a big deal in 2014. Twelve years ago, 
the transfer fee was huge. Leeds were in need of some money, with debts of 
around £78m, and even their manager, Terry Venables, admitted the the offer was 
“perhaps impossible to turn down”.

Venables did not want to lose his captain but Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale 
could not refuse the cash: “When your captain says he wants to leave you have 
to listen. We’ve got the best price available I’m satisfied I’ve done the best 
job for Leeds United. If you invest £18m and get £30m you’ve done a good job – 
especially if the player says he doesn’t want to play for you again. He’s a 
great player and a nice lad and I’m sad he’s leaving, but he’ll go with our 
best wishes and we’ll spend the money wisely.”

How did he fare?
Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager who had sold Ferdinand to Leeds, had an 
interesting take on his transfer to Manchester United: “When Leeds came in with 
their offer, we couldn’t turn it down. Money like that enabled a club like West 
Ham to rebuild with a couple of players. Now Manchester United have done the 
same to Leeds. That’s the name of the game, I’m afraid. There’s always a bigger 
fish out there somewhere waiting to pounce. I always knew he would go to the 
top and he has. He’s at the top now with Manchester United. He’s without doubt 
the best defender in Europe, if not the world.”

Redknapp was not far wrong. Aside from the odd lapse in concentration in his 
early years and the eight-month ban for missing a drugs test, Ferdinand proved 
to be one of the best defenders in world football. His elegance combined 
perfectly with Nemanja Vidic’s relentless desire to win the ball and the pair 
led the club to three European Cup finals in four seasons.

What did he win?
Six Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> 
titles, two League Cups, the Champions League and the Fifa Club World Cup.

unveiling. Photograph: Gary M Prior/Getty Images 
What was the view at the time?
Contrary to popular belief, Paul Scholes did speak before he began working for 
every organ of the media in his retirement. Back in September 2001, when Verón 
had been at United for a few months, Scholes was asked to compare his new 
team-mate with Eric Cantona. “In terms of his all-round game, I think he’ll do 
more than Eric has done,” said Scholes. “I’m not sure he will have more of an 
influence on the team but he’s just a better player. Don’t get me wrong, I 
think Eric was amazing but I think Juan has just a bit more. He’s involved in 
the game all the time. He can create and score goals. He can just do anything.”

How did he fare?
Not as well as Paul Scholes had predicted. Verón was the old Dimitar Berbatov 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2008/dec/17/dimitar-berbatov-juan-sebastian-veron>
. A decade before Manchester United fans debated the merits of Berbatov, they 
had the same arguments about Veron – is he lazy or in possession of an 
insouciant cool? Does he slow the team down or add tactical control? Is he what 
the team need in Europe or their weakness in the league? In the end, he went 
the same was as Berbatov. Alex Ferguson lost patience with him and sent him off 
to west London at a reduced price.

What did he win?
The Premier League

Newcastle United fans. Photograph: Paul Barker/PA 
What was the view at the time?
Newcastle paid Blackburn £1.7m more for Alan Shearer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/alan-shearer> than Barcelona had just 
paid to take Ronaldo from PSV Eindhoven to the Nou Camp. They made Shearer the 
most expensive footballer in the history of the game. And the locals loved it. 
The club ran out of letters as their fans lined up to have the No9 emblazoned 
on the back of their shirts.


Kevin Keegan addressed the media from Bangkok, where Newcastle were playing 
the Thailand national team as part of their summer tour, and he was full of 
beans. “This signing is for the people of Newcastle,” declared Keegan. “It just 
shows you the ambition ofNewcastle United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited>. We are the biggest 
thinking team in Europe now. We’re not the biggest, most successful team, but 
we’re the biggest thinking club and we have tremendous support from above which 
allows me to buy players.”


How did he fare?
Shearer scored 25 league goals in his first season with Newcastle and remained 
prolific until his retirement in 2006. He is still the top scorer in the 
Premier League, with his remarkable total of 260 goals considerably higher than 
that of any other player. Andrew Cole is second in that all-time list, a full 
73 goals behind Shearer. Only nine players have scored half as many Premier 
League goals as Shearer managed.


What did he win?
Nothing

What was the view at the time?
As Liverpool and Everton battled it out to sign Stan Collymore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/stan-collymore>, newspaper columnists 
fretted about the gross wages football clubs were willing to pay players. 
Collymore was to earn £13,000 a week and the punditocracy wondered where it 
would end. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Collymore said he chose Liverpool over Everton for footballing and not 
financial reasons, telling Joe Royle that he had friends at the club. “As I 
understand it, it just comes down to the fact that he knows some of the other 
players over at Anfield,” said the Everton manager. “It was a personal thing. 
There is no ill feeling and I wish him well.”

Roy Evans thought his masterplan was coming together – “Stan is another piece 
in my jigsaw but at these prices I can’t afford too many more pieces” – and 
Collymore did his best not to think about the money. “Liverpool bought me to 
play football on the pitch, not to run around saying ‘I’m an £8.5m 
footballer’,” he said, while petitioning Nottingham Forest to cough up the 5% 
of the transfer fee he thought was owed.

How did he fare?
Things are always complicated with Collymore. He scored 28 goals in 64 
appearances for Liverpool, which is a respectable figure for any striker but, 
despite having all those friends at Liverpool, he didn’t settle well at the 
club. He missed training sessions. He sulked. And he had“reasonably loud sex” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/29/dating-sportsmen> with the 
boss’s daughter.


Neil Ruddock says Collymore could have been a world-beater, but in the end 
Liverpool were happy to let him go to Aston Villa after two season: “Stan 
didn’t make any attempt to get on with the lads and, although I used to sit 
next to him on the coach and try and make conversation with him, I could never 
claim to know him,” wrote Ruddock in his autobiography. “Nobody did. He’d turn 
up for training, do his work, get changed and go home. Not exactly conducive to 
good team spirit, so I think most of the lads were relieved when he was finally 
flogged off to Aston Villa.”


What did he win?
Nothing


Was the move a success or failure?
Failure

manager. Photograph: Tony Harris/PA 
What was the view at the time?
Dennis Bergkamp failed at Internazionale. But he was never going to succeed. 
Bergkamp, this product of Dutch total football who was raised by Johan Cruyff 
to prize the assist over the goal, ended up in a team led by Osvaldo Bagnoli, a 
coach who believed that the quickest way to the goal was the most efficient: “I 
used to say to the players: the fewer passes you make the better it is,” says 
Bagnoli of his tactics at Internationale. “I don’t like tick-tock football. I 
used to say even to the goalkeeper: if you have the ball and see the forward is 
free then give him the ball.”

Bergkamp was an island: a collaborator in a team that wanted to play the long 
ball. His strike partner, Ruben Sosa, was an individualist who attacked on his 
own. Bergkamp was on the outside. So he left for Bruce Rioch’s Arsenal.

The relationship was perfect from the start. At his unveiling the club 
broadcast a little video of his best goals and assists, withThis Is The One 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXfnZ7HYD_k> by the Stone Roses providing the 
soundtrack. He liked that. When he went on to the pitch for the press 
photographs, the head groundsman placed him on a wooden plank so he wouldn’t 
harm the grass. He loved that. When he went back to his hotel, he saw the story 
BERGKAMP JOINS ARSENAL was on pages 301 and 302 of Ceefax. That blew him away. 
He had found a home.

How did he fare?
They built him a statue. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/mar/08/fa-cup-arsenal-everton-gallery#/?picture=431596468&index=2>

What did he win?

Was the move a success or failure?

1995. Photograph: David Kendall/PA 
What was the view at the time?
When Rob Lee noticed that Andrew Cole was missing from Newcastle’s training 
session he thought his team-mate “was off on one of his London trips”. In fact 
Cole was signing for Manchester United, a move that would break the British 
transfer record and leave a defensive Kevin Keegan arguing with angry fans on 
the steps of St James’ Park.

Mark Hughes was on the wrong side of 30 and Manchester United needed fresh 
legs up front so Alex Ferguson set about finding a new striker. He called 
Nottingham Forest manager Frank Clark to enquire about Stan Collymore’s 
availability, but Clark had gone home with flu. So Ferguson turned his 
attention to Cole, whose relationship with Keegan had soured after a debate 
about his intensity in traning. Collymore heard rumours that Cole was signing 
for United and tried to contact his agent, Paul Stretford. Unfortunately for 
Collymore, Stretford was also Cole’s agent and by the time his calls were 
answered, Cole was on his way to Manchester and Stretford was on his way to the 
bank.


How did he fare?
Cole scored 93 goals in 195 appearances for Manchester United but he will 
always be remembered for his partnership with Dwight Yorke. “When we started 
playing together, it was like meeting a special woman and falling in love,” 
recalled Colein an interview with FourFourTwo 
<http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/andy-cole-one-one>. “Everything felt 
right. We never had a cross word. Our confidence soared and we thought we’d 
score every week. If one of us didn’t score, the other would. We could alter 
our play depending on the opposition: I’d go long, he’d go short. Nobody knew 
how to mark us. At times, we had so much space that we took liberties.” The 
pair scored 53 goals betwen them in United’s most successful season ever, 
includingthese beauties <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJ_VtDggpM> against 
Barcelona in the Champions League.


What did he win?
Five Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League.

Was the move a success or failure?
Success
