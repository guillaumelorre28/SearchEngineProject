I’d been vegetarian for 10 years when I began working for the BBC’s Natural 
History Unit on the series Human Planet. Over three years’ filming, I ended up 
eating sago grubs, monkeys, sloths, cuscus (a cute marsupial) and pig heart – 
all a massively unexpected departure from spinach and lentils.

These forays into meat all began in West Papua. After taking eight flights, 
travelling for two days by canoe and trekking for a day, we arrived in a remote 
village where we were planning to film the Korowai constructing a new house 40 
metres up in the tree canopy. Two weeks into our stay, they presented us with 
giant sago grubs on a cooked on a skewer as a special treat and watched 
expectantly as we devoured a massive bowlful. They are about as big as your 
thumb and leathery on the outside. As you bite into them, a fluid bursts out. 
One end of them (their mouth) is very chewy. Our hosts would have been upset 
had we not tucked in as they had spent a long time gathering and preparing 
them. The Korowai people have whole festivals devoted to these grubs.

At the end of filming, they killed a prize pig for a celebration meal. It was 
a massive honour, but having just about coped with the grubs, I found it hard 
to stomach pig’s heart and valves. Through all this though, I discovered that 
people around the world found the concept of being a vegetarian odd, confusing 
and sometimes offensive, so I had to swiftly get my head around eating meat.

My tastes have definitely been expanded by these experiences and I’ve since 
dined on rat, jellyfish and crocodile. And I must admit, I enjoyed them all.

Before I worked as a reporter for programmes like The One Show, I spent nearly 
five years working as a biologist in the tropics. Carrying out flora and fauna 
surveys in the tropical forests of Ecuador, Vietnam and Tanzania, I had the 
opportunity to see some astonishing wildlife and eat some frankly bizarre 
foods. In Vietnam particularly my palate was tested like never before, with 
porcupine curry (the animal was roadkill in my defence), famously smelly durian 
fruits, 1,000-year-old eggs and deep-fried, day-old chicks.

My worst experience by far came when I was leading a survey in remote forests 
close to the border with Laos. When a visitor arrives, the village people 
celebrate by slaughtering a pig. I had seen how these animals lived and what 
they ate on a daily basis, snuffling around in human refuse for food – in other 
words, the pigs were the clean-up squad for the village. One of the pigs was 
duly caught and dispatched with a quick slash of the throat. Apparently, a 
delicacy in Vietnam is to eat the coagulated pig’s blood with raw large 
intestines on top as an appetiser. Faced with insulting the community by not 
eating my bowlful, I braced myself for a mouthful, but the moment I tried to 
swallow the first spoonful my throat decided it wasn’t having any of it and 
ejected it forcefully.

After a frankly embarrassing meal, I had to sit down to discuss working with 
the community, which is fairly difficult with a shirt stained all the way down 
in pig’s blood!

A few years ago, I spent a few weeks on location in a remote part of the 
Republic of the Congo to film gorillas. We stayed in a camp deep in the 
rainforest, which required several days’ travel by aeroplane, 4WD vehicle, 
river pirogue and, finally, feet. The Ndoki area is about as far from 
civilisation as it’s possible to get. As you can imagine, we were surviving on 
minimal and basic rations, and quite hungry by meal times. We camped in a 
magical little clearing deep in the dense forest with a circular view of the 
heavens – stars and a brilliant milky way – directly above us in the evening.

One night, our French-Congolese chef, Marcel, made a huge pot of spaghetti for 
dinner which we were all thrilled about after trailing the gorillas all day. 
But we were all horrified to see a huge praying mantis descend out of the 
forest clearing and spin down directly on to our pot of spaghetti. It struggled 
in the gloop for a few moments and then – to our horror – it started to hatch 
something out of its rear end … We watched in silent amazement as the mantis 
apparently gave birth to what looked like a large white worm – itself writhing 
painfully out of its prison home. Only later did we realise that this must have 
been an intestinal parasite freeing itself from the doomed mantis’s gut. Marcel 
burst upon the scene visibly aghast at what was happening… “Oh nnoooo…!” he 
exclaimed, and before we could stop him he’d lifted the entire pan off the 
table and – to our equal horror – chucked the lot on to the camp fire with a 
loud sizzling sound. Relieved as we were not to be eating a mantis worm for 
dinner, we were heartbroken to lose our beautiful meal.

 Tom climbing a tree in Borneo while filming for Planet Earth. 
Curiously enough, some of my most outrageous meals were consumed not on trips 
filming wildlife for the BBC but when I was a child. Many parents struggle with 
their kids’ fussy eating habits, but that wasn’t a concern for mine. When I was 
about five years old my parents, both anthropologists at the time, took me to 
the Amazon jungle to live with a tribe they were doing field research with. I 
remember that on my first day in the forest, travelling by canoe upriver to a 
tribal settlement, the locals pulled out their blowpipes and began firing darts 
at monkeys in the trees along the riverbank. I was so shocked I began to scream 
to frighten the monkeys away and save their lives. It worked, but it didn’t go 
down well with the locals, who were living on the brink of starvation, 
constantly hunting for their next meal.

Monkeys, tapir, snakes, toucans, peccaries, ants, caterpillars and caiman were 
all part of my diet, and by the end I even had my own mini-blowpipe and bow and 
arrow.

So it was a strange experience when one of my first assignments for Planet 
Earth took me back to the Amazon and I found myself filming the animals I once 
used to hunt for food. I would keep saying to the cameraman, “They taste nice.” 
And I kept coming across familiar smells and tastes that evoked half-forgotten 
but vivid childhood memories.

 Tom in the Amazon aged about five with his pet marmoset on his head. 
My job has taken me all over the world and I have been served all sorts of 
exotic delights, from tortoise cooked in its shell to a jellyfish curry spiced 
with added sting, but the bizarre creatures I ate as a kid have enabled me to 
stomach most things. The only thing I can’t deal with is sago grubs – they made 
me retch uncontrollably as a child, and always will.
