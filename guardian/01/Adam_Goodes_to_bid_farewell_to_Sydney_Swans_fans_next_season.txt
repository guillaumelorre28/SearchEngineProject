Goodes announced his retirement in the sheds after Saturday’s semi-final loss 
to North Melbourne in Sydney, meaning supporters didn’t get the chance to 
acclaim him on the night.

It’s believed the 35-year-old dual Brownlow Medallist is taking holidays for 
around two months and therefore will not feature on grand final day.

That would spare both Goodes and the AFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> from the potential embarrassment of him 
being targeted for another round of the booing that has been dogged him through 
his 17th and final season.

The 26-point loss to the Kangaroos denied Goodes a shot at a preliminary final 
clash with West Coast in Perth, where he was booed so boisterously by Eagles 
fans in late July that he stood down from playing for a week.

“As soon as I came back after the West Coast game it was all about just 
getting things on my terms, just getting back and playing footy,” Goodes told 
the Nine network.

“I was just really happy to come back.”

Goodes won premierships in 2005 and 2012 and Saturday’s loss ended any chance 
he had of becoming the first Swan to play in three title-winning teams.

“There are not too many fairytales in footy and to finish the way we did last 
night is disappointing,” Goodes said.

Goodes, who played the first of a club record 372 AFL games back in 1999, was 
comfortable with the manner of his retirement announcement,

“I just wanted to do it on my terms and I think I’ve done that,” Goodes said.

He hasn’t indicated yet whether he will stay in the football industry, though 
there have been suggestions he may seek a political career.
