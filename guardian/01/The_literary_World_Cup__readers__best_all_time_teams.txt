Back when the World Cup was in those exciting and unpredictable first rounds, 
we were playing away atPenguin's imaginary books World Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jun/19/play-the-literary-world-cup-nominate-your-all-time-top-team>
, where an England with JK Rowling, George Orwell and Agatha Christie in attack 
and the likes of Shakespeare and Dickens in the midfield could possibly – 
possibly – have had a chance to win something.

The UK imprint imagined matches and footballing incidents on Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/penguincupnews?src=hash>, and we joined in the 
fun, asking for yourall-time favourite literary teams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jun/19/play-the-literary-world-cup-nominate-your-all-time-top-team>
. Now that the actual competition is coming to an end, here are our top five 
writers' XIs.

From "middlebrowfield" to a bonkers attack

TimFootman <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/2659910> offered an 
all-nationalities, all-time XI with Albert Camus as goalkeeper (because – "duh" 
– the French author played as a goalie while studying at the University of 
Algeria). He chose a pretty hard-core defence (Leo Tolstoy, Marcel Proust, 
Samuel Richardson and Vikram Seth) "because you need big guys at the back", 
went for a self-explanatory "middlebrowfield" with John Galsworthy, Arnold 
Bennett and Elizabeth Gaskell, and chose Bret Easton Ellis, Will Self and DBC 
Pierre in attack because, "as Mr Suárez proved, it's the scary, unpredictable, 
slightly bonkers ones who get results." No comment.

Beat this 4-2-3-1

tagomagoman gave an extensive justification 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/37229445> for this killer 
and eclectic XI, managed by "respected and innovative coach with a steely heart 
of darkness" Joseph Conrad. Some of our favourite picks:

James Joyce (centre-back): "The ultimate cultured centre-back famously left 
his native Ireland to learn his trade on the continent. It is a rare forward 
who can find a way past his impenetrable prose."

Cormac McCarthy (central midfield): "This tough tackling, no nonsense player 
patrols the border country between midfield and defence. If you thought the 
Comanche attack in Blood Meridian was brutal you should see what he does to a 
midfield runner who has the temerity to approach his territory."

F Scott Fitzgerald (central midfield): "Seen by some as a luxury player too 
keen to sit back and admire his own beautiful passes. Sometimes seems more 
concerned with his celebrity lifestyle with his glamorous wife than his career. 
But when he puts his mind to it, boy can he play. With the steely McCarthy 
beside him they form a formidable midfield."

William Burroughs (right midfield): "Old snake hips is one of the most feared 
wingers in the game. Has suffered with 'refuelling' issues in the past, but as 
long as he receives his 'vitamin supplement' before the game is a reliable 
asset. Famous for terrorising full-backs with his notorious cut-up technique 
that leaves them gasping for comprehension. Should score more goals, but 
suffers from a wayward shot."

Here come le French

neophil33 <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4566197> disagreed 
withPenguin's version <http://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/penguin-cup/#france> of 
the French team and offered the following instead (with Anatole France, 
François Rabelais, Alphonse Daudet, Marguerite Duras, Louis Aragon, François 
Mauriac as subs), which sparked quite a debate. "That midfield could be a bit 
flaky", saidshinerbock <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10020475>
. "I'd have Proust among the subs – just in case you needed to bring someone on 
to run down the clock", offeredAnotherBe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/2532682>. shinerbock 
<https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10020475> jumped in again: "You 
can't have Rimbaud and Verlaine in the same team together. Even on opposite 
wings. There's no discipline there. Bring them on as 'impact subs', when 
Baudelaire's been sent off for showing off."Etcetera

Almighty Ireland

"At last, a competition Ireland will dominate", ventured theundertone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4634643>. We had as many as 
four different Irish teams suggested – here's one bySanPaolo 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/37174208>: from Patrick 
Kavanagh ("weird loner, ideal keeper") to Oscar Wilde ("big target man, 
ex-boxer, great turn – of phrase) and Samuel Beckett ("mercurial forward, 
famously not many kicks") on the attack and of course Joyce at the midfield 
("creative, but tendency to overelaborate"). Although asSunburst 
<https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4272214> said, perhaps their 
star player would suffice: "between 11 best English novelists of the 20th 
century and one chapter of Ulysses, I'd confidently put my money on the latter."

Ancient Rome

And finally, how irresistible is this team from Ancient Rome suggested by 
Serdal <http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/37173676>:

Cicero (goalkeeper): "Reliable, can do everything, great reflexes, huge belief 
in his own abilities, can be a show-off, never to blame in his own mind."

Caesar (left-back): "Lean, efficient, fast, unfussy, able to influence 
referees with his propagandistic style."

Ovid (left midfield): "Great work-rate, though defensively suspect, the side's 
greatest technique and pacey as hell, should complement Caesar's qualities."

Virgil (central midfield): "Used to be a slim, tricky player, in his later 
days a player of gravity but lots of emotions, able to mix the rough and the 
magical."

There were so many other brilliant line-ups that we had to leave out – do take 
a look at the delightful thread, which included discussion ofreferees 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/37193535> and even a wink 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/37203565> to our own 
sports writers. And, as always, add your own or tell us what we’ve missed in 
the comments below. But let's close with a team fromMagnusson 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/37172216> which he 
promises will be "precise, efficient and beautiful in its simplicity":
