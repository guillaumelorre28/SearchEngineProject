Old Bottom, as the Marshwood Vale 
<http://www.imagesofdorset.org.uk/Dorset/005/intro.htm> was once called, has 
filled with autumn rain. Walking means slogging, ankle deep or more, through 
cold, claggy clay, navigating puddles of yellow water overhung with dripping 
trees. Time to escape the woods for higher, drier ground.

Hardown Hill <http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/mountaindetails.php?qu=S&rf=2902> 
is one of a circle of hills and forts ringing the vale. Steep sides of 
deciduous woodland and gaps of rough pasture run up to a flat top of heath where
nightjars 
<http://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/n/nightjar/index.aspx>
 call in summer. The summit is open, unfenced common land, home to sand lizards 
and occasionally Dartford warblers. Villagers used to cut the heath for fuel.
Gorse <http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/gorse> was particularly prized in 
bread ovens because it burned quick and hot before disintegrating into an 
insignificant pile of fine ash. In Dorset dialect, gorse was furze, pronounced 
“vurze”, just as fox was “varx”.

A hidden meadow alive with flowers and grasshoppers

I walk clockwise into the low sun shining sharp across the heath. Long wires 
of purple moor grass gleam metallically and the last few gold leaves on a 
silver birch flutter like tinsel against the hard blue sky. It’s raining in 
Devon out to the west, and the far hills are smoky purple under cloud shadow. 
North east lies Rogue Male country, where the unnamed hero ofGeoffrey 
Household’s classic thriller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/15/robert-macfarlane-household-rogue-male>
literally went to ground, burying himself in the damp tree roots of an old 
hollow way.

I skirt the old quarry workings, swamped in spring with bluebells and now 
swathed with rusty bracken. A last cricket chirps slowly like a smoke alarm 
with a near exhausted battery. The sea dazzles through a sudden gap and the 
sea-swell sound of traffic on the A35 washes up from below. Due east, the long, 
thin wedge ofPortland <http://www.dorsets.co.uk/Portland> floats impossibly 
high on the horizon.

Heading back west over the crest of the hill, I face the brunt of the wind, 
which rattles the heather. Three species grow here:ling 
<http://www.first-nature.com/flowers/calluna-vulgaris.php> (Calluna vulgaris), 
bell heather <http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/bell-heather> (Erica cinerea
) and cross-leaved heath 
<http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/plant_species/cross-leaved_heath> (
Erica tetralix.) The rain has caught up with me and a rainbow appears, arcing 
over the hill. I turn away and walk on; when I look back it’s gone, switched 
off abruptly as the shower moves east.
