. “The attacker is loaned from the English club, where he is under contract at 
this time. The loan has a term of one year, until 30 June 2017.”

The club’s sporting director, Marc Overmars, added: “I’ve been working on 
signing Traoré for over a year. It is now up to Traoré to show that Ajax is the 
right choice for him and Chelsea. He has many qualities. He is quick, targeted 
and it is an advantage that he knows the Dutch league. The presence of Peter 
Bosz was important to him, they worked well together at Vitesse.”

Traoré made 10 Premier League appearances for Chelsea last season, scoring 
twice.
