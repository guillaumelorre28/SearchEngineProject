Buffalo’s Bill house from the Oscar-winning 1991 thriller The Silence of the

. It boasts four bedrooms, a pool and a garage that fits four cars.

According to the Pittsburgh Tribune Review 
<http://triblive.com/news/fayette/8936263-74/film-bill-buffalo#axzz3jFKQu75K>, 
the house was purchased by a couple in the 1970s who were approached in 1989 to 
ask if their house could be used in the hit film. The film-makers shot the 
exterior as well as the foyer and dining room.

“They were looking for a home in which you entered the front door and had a 
straight line through,” home-owner Barbara Lloyd said. “They wanted it to look 
like a spider web, with Buffalo Bill drawing Jodie Foster into the foyer, into 
the kitchen, then into the basement.”

Diane Wilk is the estate agent looking after the property and she believes its 
notoriety could be a major selling point.

“People love to be scared,” she said. “I could see somebody doing something 
fun with this.”
