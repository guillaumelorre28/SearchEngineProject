The Greens have announced plans to increase research and innovation spending 
to 3% of GDP by 2025 and 4% by 2030.

The party leader, Richard Di Natale 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/richard-di-natale>, and the science 
and industry spokesman, Adam Bandt, are set to announce the policy on Friday in 
Melbourne.

Australia invests about 2.2% of GDP in public and private sector science, 
innovation and research which the Greens say is behind Korea (4.3%), Japan 
(3.6%), and the US (2.7%).

The Greens plan to boost research grants ($848m), restore funding to the CSIRO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/26/csiro-job-cuts-fewer-than-feared-but-climate-scientists-say-reduction-a-con>
 ($306.5m), reverse cuts to the sustainable research excellence program and 
increase university research ($1.3bn).

They also want to reverse cuts to research and development offsets ($690m).

The parliamentary budget office has costed the total spending commitments at 
$5bn over the next four years.

The Greens say they would pay for the policy by abolishing fossil-fuel 
subsidies, such as the diesel fuel rebate, which would raise $7bn a year.

Di Natale said: “Innovation isn’t just a buzzword Malcolm Turnbull can use to 
sell his corporate tax cuts. It underpins Australia’s future prosperity.

“We will increase funding, improve access to information, foster national and 
international collaboration, protect our key research institutions and deliver 
the research and innovation Australia needs to remain competitive.”

Bandt said: “The industries and jobs of the 21st century will rely on our 
minds, not our mines.

“The Greens will invest in science and research and foster a culture where 
experimentation, invention and innovation can flourish in Australia.”

Labor’s policies on science include providing 25,000 teaching scholarships 
over five years 
<http://www.100positivepolicies.org.au/new_graduates_into_stem_teaching> to new 
and recent graduates of science technology engineering and maths (STEM) degrees 
to encourage them to continue their studies and become a STEM teacher.

It has also promised to spend $127m over four years to help current teachers 
learn new STEM skills

In December the Turnbull government unveiled a national innovation and science 
agenda to cost $1bn over four years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/07/malcolm-turnbull-innovation-package-tax-breaks-school-focus>
, which included tax incentives for early-stage companies.

The innovation agenda also aims to ensure schools are encouraging problem 
solving, critical thinking and digital skills from an early age.
