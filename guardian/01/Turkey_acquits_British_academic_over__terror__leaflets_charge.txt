An Istanbul court on Thursday acquitted a British academic who has had his 
base inTurkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> for 25 years, and who, 
this spring, was accused of “making propaganda for a terrorist organisation”.

Chris Stephenson, a computer science lecturer at Bilgi University, was taken 
into custody on 15 March after being found with Kurdish leaflets printed by the 
pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic party. He was released the next day and 
deported but was later allowed to return to Turkey, where he rejoined his 
Turkish wife and daughter.

Stephenson, who had been facing up to five years in prison, was among 1,000 
scholars who signed a declaration denouncing military operations against 
Kurdish rebels in south-east Turkey. The declaration angered Turky’s president,
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan>, 
and led to legal proceedings against some signatories.

Stephenson declared during his trial that “wanting peace is not a crime”. He 
called for the release and acquittal of two journalists and another academic 
who were arrested this week after showing solidarity with a pro-Kurdish 
publication, Özgür Gündem, which has been subjected to multiple investigations 
and lawsuits.

On Monday, a Turkish court arrested Erol Onderoglu, the Turkey representative 
for Reporters Without Borders, Ahmet Nesin, a journalist, and Sebnem Korur 
Fincanci, an academic, for disseminating “terrorist propaganda”. The three had 
participated in a solidarity campaign that involved acting as chief editor for 
a day for a pro-Kurdish publication.

Growing conflicts between security forces and Kurdish rebels are occurring in 
Turkey’s south-east, adding to political polarisation.
