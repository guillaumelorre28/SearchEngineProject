 The long-delayed trial of Sean Hoey, 37, the South Armagh electrician accused 
of carrying out the 1998 Omagh bomb massacre, was halted after half an hour 
yesterday because the leading defence barrister is unwell.
Orlando Pownall QC apologised to Belfast crown court that he had not recovered 
after being in bed for two weeks and was awaiting medical test results.

The latest setback was condemned by relatives of the 29 victims of the Real 
IRA bombing. If Mr Pownall recovers, the trial will commence on September 18. 
If another senior counsel has to be appointed the delay could be far longer.
