Flying insects have had a wretched summer, but when the sun came out last 
month it triggered a great natural spectacle when swarms of flying black ants 
took to the air in their annual mating ritual. Virgin females fly off chased by 
countless smaller males desperate to mate with her, and afterwards the females 
drop their wings and start a new colony, although it's bad news for the males, 
which crawl away and die. The astonishing thing is how ants across the country 
all fly at roughly the same time, and although the weather is a key trigger for 
the mass flight it is not completely understood.

For anyone taking a holiday at the British seaside, this is a great time to 
watch for whales and dolphins. There are more than a dozen species of these 
creatures regularly seen in British waters, and some can even be seen from the 
shore. One of the best views is at New Quay in Cardigan Bay, west Wales where 
over 100 dolphins are resident and can be seen jumping and feeding. Another 
hotspot is Scotland's Moray Firth, with around 130 bottlenose dolphins. Harbour 
porpoises are also common at Scarborough, and Ilfracombe in Devon. And the 
Hebrides and north coast of Scotland are a favourite haunt for both whales and 
dolphins, with some recent dramatic sightings of killer whales close to the 
shore in Caithness, including an unprecedented pod of some 14 killer whales 
chasing fish in John o' Groats harbour.
