Rangers <https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> will be confident of 
booking their place in the Champions League group stage after second-half goals 
by Nacho Novo and Fernando Ricksen brought them a hard-earned victory in Cyprus.

Some of the gloss was taken off the victory by Nikolaos Frousos's reply, after 
a mistake by the debutant Julien Rodriguez, and the Rangers manager Alex 
McLeish warned his team against complacency in the second leg in a fortnight.

He said: "I won't say we are through. They made chances and will take 
positives into the game at Ibrox. We must respect Anorthosis. They showed they 
are a good team tonight."

Although McLeish had warned his players about picking up needless yellow 
cards, Michael Ball was booked for a rash challenge on Klimenti Tsitaishvili as 
Anorthosis, with Giorgi Kinkladze looking lively, made a strong start.

The first real chances fell to Rangers, Novo being denied by Antonis 
Georgallides and Ian Murray squandering an easy opportunity. Anorthosis nearly 
took the lead 10 minutes before the interval when Frousos outsmarted Marvin 
Andrews but his lob was punched away by Ronald Waterreus.

After the break Temuri Ketsbaia, the Anorthosis coach and former Newcastle 
United and Dundee player, was just wide with a low long-range effort.

However, Rangers drew first blood after 65 minutes when Ricksen's overhead 
kick was blocked by Georgallides but Novo pounced on the rebound.

They increased their lead six minutes later, Dado Prso playing in Ricksen, who 
calmly slipped the ball under the Anorthosis goalkeeper.

That spurred the home side and they scored within three minutes. Rodriguez, 
the French defender signed from Monaco, failed to control and Frousos fired 
past Waterreus.
