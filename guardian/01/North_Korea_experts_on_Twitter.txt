North Korea is probably one of the hardest places on the planet to tweet from. 
The web is severely restricted, with access to computers and mobiles phone 
available to an elite few 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/10/north-korea-internet-schmidt-visit>
. Most North Koreans only have access to a state controlled intranet, called
Kwangmyong, or bright 
<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/3/report-sheds-light-bright-north-koreas-internet/>
.


The country does have its own twitter account @uriminzok 
<https://twitter.com/uriminzok%20> (english translation available 
@uriminzok_engl <https://twitter.com/uriminzok_engl>), launched in 2010 
declaring <http://www.pcworld.com/article/203324/article.html> "The Web site 
'Our Nation' is on Twitter". At the time of writing the account follows three 
others: Vietnam, a Pyongyang propaganda site and Jimmy Dushku, a 25-year-old 
web developer and tycoon from Texas who is asconfused as the rest of us 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/jan/13/jimmy-dushku-north-korea-twitter%20>
 as to why.

In 2013 they opened up a 3G network, but only for foreign tourists. Associated 
Press journalist Jean H Lee (@newsjean <https://twitter.com/newsjean>) was the 
first person to Tweet and Instagram from it, closely followed by Dennis Rodman. 
Lee describedthe experience as liberating 
<https://soundcloud.com/officialsxsw/tweets-from-the-dmz-social>, moving on 
from the days where she had to leave her phone at the airport.

Journalists are still incredibly restricted as to what they can depict. David 
Guttenfelder, a photographer for Associated Press who, like Lee, enjoys more 
access than most,has to ask permission in writing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/09/instagram-north-korea-photography>
 everywhere he goes: "There are some very difficult discussions after the 
pictures are published - we often lock horns because they have a very different 
idea of how North Korea should be covered," he says.

Guttenfelder, who won a Time award for his Instagram coverage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/09/instagram-north-korea-photography>
, believes the secret to covering North Korea is in the mundane detail, "the 
piece off the puzzle that when you put them all together reveal something about 
the place".
