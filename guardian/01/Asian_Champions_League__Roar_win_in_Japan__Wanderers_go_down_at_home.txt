Brisbane Roar’s AFC Champions League campaign is back on track after an 
impressive 1-0 victory over J-League powerhouse Urawa Red Diamonds in Japan.


The Roar made a dream start at Saitama Stadium, scoring the decisive goal in 
just the second minute through young forward Brandon Borrello.


Borrello was fed in by Thomas Broich and unleashed a fierce drive from a 
narrow angle, the shot whizzing past Japanese international goalkeeper Shusaku 
Nishikawa at his near post.


It was all the Roar needed to seal their first ever victory in Asia and pick 
up a vital three points in Group G following their disastrous 1-0 loss last 
week to Beijing Guoan.


The hosts spent most of the second half on Wednesday night a player short 
after Daisuke Nasu was shown a straight red card for bringing Andrija 
Kaluderovic to the ground with a cynical rugby-style tackle, just as the 
Serbian striker appeared set to streak through on goal.


But unlike how they coughed up the ascendancy to a 10-man Beijing, this time 
Brisbane was able to seize the advantage.


It wasn’t all smooth sailing - the Roar’s inability to put Urawa to the sword 
with a second goal made for some nervy moments, but led by Luke DeVere, the 
defence was ultimately able to keep the Reds at bay.


Coach Frans Thijssen made four changes to the team that drew 2-2 in Perth at 
the weekend, with the most notable omission goalkeeper Michael Theo, who 
suffered a groin strain against the Glory and was named on the bench against 
Urawa.


Theo’s understudy Jamie Young started in the goalmouth while Henrique overcome 
a knee injury to take his place in the team - but there was no room for 
ex-Socceroo Adam Sarota, who was left on the bench for the second straight game.


Henrique spurned a great chance to make it 2-0 in the 35th minute, again on 
the back of a Broich through ball, but Shusaku was able to make the stop with 
his foot.


Young stood tall shortly after the interval, protecting Brisbane’s lead with 
an excellent save of his own to deny Urawa’s Koroki Shinzo, who was clear on 
goal and hovering around the penalty spot.


Minutes later, the home side was reduced to 10 men when Nasu needlessly felled 
Kaluderovic, turning the contest Brisbane’s way.


Substitute Tadanari Lee nearly equalised for Urawa at the death but his diving 
header flew just over the crossbar.

Guangzhou Evergrande striker Ricardo Goulart showed just why he’s worth his 
record-breaking price tag, scoring a hat-trick to inflict a 3-2 defeat on title 
holders Western Sydney in theirAsian Champions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/asian-champions-league> clash.


The 23-year-old new Guangzhou recruit, who in January became the first player 
in China Super League history to exceed a transfer fee of $20 million for his 
four-year deal, scored the winner in Guangzhou’s opening ACL match against FC 
Seoul last week and was their saviour again on Wednesday night.


Iacopo La Rocca and Romeo Castalen clawed two goals back at Parramatta Stadium 
for the Wanderers, who were unable to back up the 3-1 triumph of their campaign 
opener against Kashima Antlers last week.


After leaving goalkeeper Ante Covic, La Rocca and Brendan Hamill behind in 
their clash in Japan last week, coach Tony Popovic started all three on 
Wednesday night.


Assistant coach Ian Crook took the helm again with Popovic watching from the 
stands as he serves his two-game suspension for his role in the on-field 
altercation during the explosive quarter-final against Guangzhou Evergrande 
last year.


In a surging counter-attack the Wanderers had the first chance of the match 
with Nikita Rukavytsya putting Guangzhou keeper Zeng Cheng to work with only 
five minutes on the clock.


But it wasn’t long before the Wanderers paid the price for poor defending when 
the ball fell to a totally unmarked Goulart, the Brazilian slamming it home for 
the 1-0 lead in the 19th minute.


The hosts would find the equaliser in the 58th minute with La Rocca climbing 
high to head home. But just like that Guangzhou were in front again a minute 
later when Gao set up Goulart for the easy tap in.

The dangerous duo combined yet again moments later with Goulart scoring his 
third for the night, to put the visitors 3-1 up in the 64th minute.


The Wanderers thought they’d clawed one back four minutes later when Matthew 
Spiranovic headed home off a Yojiro Takahagi free-kick, only to be ruled 
offside.


Play was suspended for close to 14 minutes when Guangzhou keeper Zeng Cheng 
had a nasty collision with one of his defenders and needed to be stretchered 
off with a suspected broken cheekbone and replaced by Li Shuai.


The break resulted in an astonishing 17 minutes of injury time. With the clock 
winding down new Wanderers recruit Kerem Bulut, who scored a brace in Western 
Sydney’s opening win, was brought on.

But it was substitute Castalen who would get one back for the hosts in extra 
time, taking advantage of the new keeper. Bulut threatened in the final stages 
but it was too little too late.
