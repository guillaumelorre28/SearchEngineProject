Ho ho ho, it's that time of year again. The time when I recommend some 
Christmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> presents for 
your friends and relatives, based on topical celebrities from the year.

I can't quite remember how it works. I've been doing this column annually for 
10 years now (I've just checked, this is genuinely its 10th anniversary) and, 
even after re-reading nine previous versions, I still can't quite grasp the 
concept. It's a bit like a round fromI'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue.

But I think the gist is: you need Christmas gift ideas. Those magazine guides 
which recommend presents "for her", "for him", "for the kids" or "for the 
neighbours" simply aren't specific enough. They seem to work on the assumption 
that every man alive is interested in gadgets and golf calendars, or that all 
women want perfume and gloves.

So, in order to help you find something for a more precise and particular 
acquaintance, I have treated the celebrity world asour collective family. I 
work on the annual assumption that everyone has, for example, an uncle a bit 
like Cliff Richard. Or an aunt a bit like Cliff Richard.

I then work out what this Cliff-like uncle or aunt would want (for example: "A 
mocked up newspaper announcing that their Christmas single has gone straight in 
at No 1") and list it below, for your shopping inspiration.

Good luck out there! See you in 2014.

The wayward goddaughter


When she was born, you looked forward to being a racy godparent. Even as you 
stood at the font, you giggled inwardly about the idea of "renouncing Satan" as 
you secretly imagined being the first person to buy her a lipstick, give her a 
brandy and let her watch 18-films at midnight.

Well, the culture moved faster than you did. Now 14, she's got a full 
Brazilian and goes to school in hotpants.

She explains that this is a feminist statement, shaking up society's 
expectation for young women to be uniformed ie compliant.

You say: "Good… Brilliant… er… and do the boys appreciate this political 
statement, or are they just pleased to see you've got your bum out?"

For Miley Cyrus

: Marks and Spencer "classic tweed skirt", £39.

The reformed godson

Funny; this was the one who always used to cause the trouble. Barely a day 
went by without him getting up to no good, saying the wrong thing, breaking the 
rules. You were forever consoling his mother after yet another awkward phone 
call from school.

But he seems to have gone quiet, this year. He's combing his hair and doing 
his homework. He's hardly said a word out of place. You can't help suspecting 
that this is all part of someterrible secret plan.

In a way, you hope it is. You don't want him to turn out boring. So, you'd 
like to give him a present that reflects your hope of developing his social 
conscience, while encouraging him to keep the mischief alive.

For Boris Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris>: a DVD of 
Blackfish 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/11/blackfish-seaworld-backlash-killer-whales>
and a pack of smoked salmon.

The moody grandfather

Good old grandad. It's always lovely to see him at Christmas, with his cheeky 
smile and shiny shoes, jigging about under the tree. He can get a little 
confused, but he's generally chirpy. Everything goes swimmingly – until he 
opens a cracker, misreads the joke and snaps at people for not laughing.

Still, he's a staple. It wouldn't be the same without him.

For Bruce Forsyth 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/strictly-come-dancing/10469709/Bruce-Forsyth-raises-doubts-over-his-future-with-Strictly-Come-Dancing.html>
:Statler & Waldorf  <http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Statler_and_Waldorf>mug, 
£9.95 from Amazon (dishwasher safe).

The rich sister

Ooh, she's gone places. No longer the frumpy London schoolgirl, these days 
your big sis is all jet set and diamonds, hobnobbing and perfect makeup.

Hard to shop for, though, isn't she? All year round, she's happily buying 
herself bejewelled chandeliers and designer stock for that shoe wardrobe that 
is bigger than your entire flat.

Better check the posting dates; you won't actually see her over the festive 
season. She's abroad with that ghastly husband.

Fine: you don't need him around the place, spoiling the mood. Last year, when 
your mum made a small suggestion for changing the arrangements, he had her shot.

For Mrs Assad 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408054/As-Syria-implodes-Mrs-Assad-splashes-chandeliers-Western-food-fitness-fads-Bizarre-shopping-spree-British-beauty-holed-bunker-vile-dictator.html>
: a homemade jam. (If the jar breaks in the post, whevs.)

The straight sister-in-law

Obviously, you're delighted that your brother married someone so responsible, 
sober and polite. She's charming to your relatives, with an old-fashioned 
deference to the old folk on family occasions. She's always smiling, always 
tidy and never drunk.

Now she's become a mother herself, she's more demure and well-behaved than 
ever. You never catch her in a foul mood with one boob hanging out and sick on 
her shoulder. This is all terrific, even if you do want to grab her by the 
elbows and scream: "Live a little!"

For Kate Middleton <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/duchess-of-cambridge>: 
Swarovski shoe-customising crystals (prices vary). To jazz those nude courts up 
a bit.

The vicar

Lovely old chap. It would be nice to give him a little token, to say thanks 
for all his work in the community. He's always welcoming, always twinkling.

Very twinkling. Boy, can that guy twinkle. Sometimes you wonder if he's a 
littletoo twinkling? Twinkle twinkle twinkle. What's up with this guy? Stop 
twinkling already! It's freaking me out!

For the Rev Paul Flowers <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-flowers>: 
Christians Have Fun Too, by Ron Kealey. £1.88 for e-book. (If you're trying to 
get your kid into the faith school, give him the Kindle as well.)
