A man from Northern Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> 
has died hours after being rescued from a lake in the Irish Republic, it was 
confirmed on Friday. One of the dead man's friends remains missing in the area 
around Lough Ree on the river Shannon.

A third man from Northern Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland> 
remains critically ill in hospital after their boat sank on the lough in 
Ireland's largest river on Thursday afternoon.

The trio were members of a County Armagh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/armagh> angling club and had gone fishing for 
carp when their boat got into difficulties as they made their way to camp at an 
island on the lough. Conditions were stormy with strong winds on the lough when 
the anglers set out.

The Irish coastguard and the RNLI lifeboat service resumed their search for 
the missing man yesterday morning.

Damien Delaney, RNLI operations manager at Lough Ree, said: "We'll go back to 
the search area again, where we left off yesterday evening, start again at View 
Point, we'll be assisted by people from Athlone sub-aqua [club] and 
Lanesborough sub-aqua and some local anglers," he said.

"There was a lot of debris in the water, fishing stuff and containers 
floating. There was quite a long trail of debris leading right across the lake 
for a distance of about two miles, so we'll be following that trail area."

Delaney said the search teams were holding on to the hope that the missing man 
had made it ashore. "We'll be concentrating on the shore area as well. We're 
reluctant to speculate; we just live in hope that he's alive somewhere."
