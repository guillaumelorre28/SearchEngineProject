 Fiona Ryder: A new voice for Norfolk 
Mustard TV, which has been on air as an IPTV channel since January 2013, will 
make its TV screen debut at 5.30pm with the inaugural broadcast of Mustard News.

Fiona Ryder, Mustard's managing director, said: "We want to redefine what 
people think of as local television. We hope to engage the community in ways 
that other stations covering wider patches just can't... Mustard TV will 
provide a new voice for the people of Norfolk."

Archant owns more than 130 local newspaper and magazine titles, plus 
associated digital channels. Its choice of the station's name is a nod to the 
Colman family, one of whom helped to found Archant.

NB: London Live <https://www.theguardian.com/media/london-live>, the largest 
of the local TV franchises, is to launch the following Monday (31 March). It is 
owned by the group that publishes the Independent titles and the London Evening 
Standard. Read more about that in Monday's Media Guardian.
