Near the centre of Nanyuki, the 265 prisoners of the town's jail are busy 
making clothes, building furniture, and now, thanks to an initiative sponsored 
by the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture (SFSA), they are farming 
their own crops.

In a project developed by SFSA in conjunction with the prison's policy of 
rehabilitating prisoners through education and reintegration with their 
communities, prisoners and wardens have been taught how to start up and manage 
a farm. Fruit and vegetables are grown across 40 acres of open land and in a 
greenhouse the inmates built and now manage under supervision. The produce is 
then cooked and consumed by the inmates, as well as being sold outside the 
prison.

Seedlings for fruit trees are also sold, encouraging a more co-operative 
relationship between ex-offenders and the local community. "Initially there was 
a hostile reception towards exâ€‘offenders," explains Samuel Kiprop, deputy 
officer in charge of the prison, "so now we have what we call an open door 
policy, whereby the public can come and partner with us."

The farm manager, Mr Kanyete, believes the project solves one of the bigger 
problems agriculturalists have in Kenya. "People have their resources, their 
space, their land, but the knowledge of introducing a business venture like 
this, maybe they don't have that." Thanks to the training they have received, 
however, the prisoners will possess the knowledge that so many others are 
lacking in order to make the most of their land once they have returned home.
