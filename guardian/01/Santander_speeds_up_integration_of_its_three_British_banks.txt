 to take charge of its 254 branches and telephone network, in addition to her 
responsibilities for the branches of Abbey and Bradford & Bingley.

The branches of A&L, Abbey and B&B are owned by Spanish bank Santander.

Abbey and A&L said in a joint statement that there were "no current plans" to 
merge A&L's branches and telephone network with those of Abbey and B&B.

"The decision accelerates the integration process," the two banks said.

Brittain, an executive director, replaces Chris Rhodes, A&L's current director 
of retail distribution, who has decided to leave the business. He will stay on 
at A&L until March to ensure a smooth handover.
