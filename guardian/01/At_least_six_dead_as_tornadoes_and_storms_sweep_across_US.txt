At least six people have died after a storm system forecasters called 
“particularly dangerous” swept across the country on Wednesday.

Tornadoes touched down in Indiana and Mississippi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mississippi>, where three were killed. A 
tree blew over onto a house in Arkansas, killing an 18-year-old woman and 
trapping a one-year-old child inside, authorities said. Rescuers pulled the 
toddler safely from the home. Two others were killed in Tennessee.

Authorities in Mississippi did not have details of those dead after multiple 
tornadoes hit the state.

In Benton County, where two deaths occurred and at least two people were 
missing, search-and-rescue crews were doing a house-by-house search to make 
sure residents were accounted for.

A tornado damaged or destroyed at least 20 homes in the north-west part of the 
state. Clarksdale’s mayor, Bill Luckett, said the only confirmed casualty was a 
dog killed by storm debris. Planes at a small airport overturned and an unknown 
number of people were injured.

“I’m looking at some horrific damage right now,” the mayor said. “Sheet metal 
is wrapped around trees; there are overturned airplanes; a building is just 
destroyed.”

Television images showed the tornado appeared to be on the ground for more 
than 10 minutes. Interstate 55 was closed in both directions as the tornado 
approached, the Mississippi Highway Patrol said.

After an EF-1 tornado struck the south Indianapolis suburb of Greenwood, 
television stations showed pictures of damage including a portion of a roof 
blown off a veterinary office.

The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed on Wednesday night that two 
people were killed in severe storms. Officials said the deaths, one male and 
one female, occurred in Perry County. No further details were available.

The biggest threat for tornadoes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/23/southern-us-braced-for-tornadoes-thunderstorms-and-flooding>
 was in a region of 3.7 million people in Mississippi, Tennessee and Arkansas 
and parts of Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky, according to the national Storm 
Prediction Center in Oklahoma. The center issued a “particularly dangerous 
situation” alert for the first time since June 2014, when two massive EF4 
twisters devastated a rural Nebraska town, killing two people.

The greatest risk for a few “intense, long-tracked tornadoes” will be through 
Wednesday night.

About 120 miles (193km) east of the tornado, Brandi Holland, a convenience 
store clerk in Tupelo, Mississippi, said people were reminded of a tornado that 
damaged or destroyed more than 2,000 homes and businesses in April 2014.

“They’re opening all our tornado shelters because they say there’s an 80% 
chance of a tornado today,” Holland said.

In the small coastal town of Loxley, Alabama, Mandy Wilson watched the angry 
gray sky and told drivers to be careful as she worked a cash register at Love’s 
Travel Stop.

“It’s very ugly; it’s very scary,” Wilson said. “There’s an 18-wheeler turned 
over on I-10. There’s water standing really bad. It’s a really interesting way 
to spend Christmas Eve eve.”

In parts of Georgia, including Atlanta, a flood watch was posted through 
Friday evening as more than 4 inches (102mm) was expected, the National Weather 
Service said.

The threat of severe weather just before Christmas is unusual, but not 
unprecedented, said Greg Carbin, a meteorologist at the national Storm 
Prediction Center.

Twisters hit south-east Mississippi exactly a year ago, killing five people 
and injuring dozens of others. On Christmas Day in 2012, a storm system spawned 
several tornadoes, damaging homes from Texas to Alabama.

Emergency officials in Tennessee worried that powerful winds could turn 
holiday yard decorations into projectiles, the same way gusts can fling patio 
furniture in springtime storms, said Marty Clements, director of the Madison 
County Emergency Management Agency in Jackson, the state’s largest city between 
Memphis and Nashville.

In Arkansas <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arkansas>, Pope County 
Sheriff Shane Jones said the 18-year-old woman was killed when a tree crashed 
into her bedroom. The woman and her 1 ½-year-old sister were sleeping in a 
bedroom of the house near Atkins about 65 miles (105km) north-west of Little 
Rock, when winds uprooted the tree that crashed through the roof.
