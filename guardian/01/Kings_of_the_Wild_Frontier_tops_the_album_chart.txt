Stuart Leslie Goddard was the bass player in pub rock group Bazooka Joe when 
they headlined over a fledgling Sex Pistols in late 1975 â€“ after which he threw 
himself into punk, creating Adam and the Ants. But while punk was all about a 
return to authenticity, half the fun was in the dressing up. So Adam daubed 
some white paint across his face, paid Malcolm McLaren to tell him about 
Burundi drumming, and Kings of the Wild Frontier hit No 1.
