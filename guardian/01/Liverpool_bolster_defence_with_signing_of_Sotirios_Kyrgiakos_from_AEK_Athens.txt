Liverpool have gone some way to alleviating their defensive crisis with the 
£2m signing of Sotirios Kyrgiakos fromAEK Athens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aekathens>. The 30-year-old today passed 
a medical before putting pen to paper on a two-year deal.

Krygiakos, who once had spell with Rangers, will go straight into the squad 
for Liverpool's match against Aston Villa at Anfield on Monday, and is expected 
to take the place of the youngster, Daniel Ayala, who made his full debut in 
Wednesday's 4-0 win over Stoke City. Liverpool's manager, Rafael Benítez, is 
optimistic the Greece international will fit seamlessly into his side.

"He has had experience in Scotland with Rangers, and in Germany with Eintracht 
Frankfurt as well as with the Greek national side," he said. "He is strong and 
good in the air, and we were looking for experience and he is the perfect 
answer."

Benítez's defence has been beset by injuries in the lead-up to the season, 
with Martin Skrtel breaking his jaw in the 2-1 defeat to Tottenham last Sunday 
and Daniel Agger requiring surgery on a troublesome back injury. The Brazilian 
left-back, Fabio Aurelio, has also been sidelined with a foot injury.

Kyrgiakos is Liverpool's third signing of the summer, following the earlier 
arrivals of Alberto Aquilani and Glen Johsnon from Roma and Portsmouth 
respectively. The defender, capped 50 times by Greece, described his move to 
England as "the biggest challenge of my career".
