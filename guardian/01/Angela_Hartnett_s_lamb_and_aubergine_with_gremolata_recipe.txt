Some food marriages just work. Lamb 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lamb> and aubergine are a delicious 
combination to start with – but once you add mint and lemon, nothing tastes 
better.

(serves 4)

8 lamb chops
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tbsp of chopped mint
1 tbsp of chopped flat-leaf parsley
Rind of 1 lemon
½ tsp English mustard
150ml olive oil
100g feta cheese, crumbled
1 small aubergine, sliced lengthways

Season the lamb chops, place them in a large tray under a hot grill, for three 
or four minutes on each side, making sure the fat renders down to become nice 
and crispy.

Meanwhile, mix the garlic, lemon rind, mint, parsley and mustard with about 
four tablespoons of oil.

Remove the lamb chops and rest them somewhere warm.

Add the rest of the oil to the grill pan. Season the aubergine and grill on 
medium for a few minutes either side until soft (if necessary, give them a 
couple of minutes in the oven at 180C).

Place the chops and aubergine on a serving dish, scatter the feta on the 
aubergine, then spoon the mint and parsley dressing over the whole dish.
