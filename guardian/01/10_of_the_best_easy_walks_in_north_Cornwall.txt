Land's End to Sennen Cove


Distance 1.3 miles
Start Sennen Cove Car Park, grid ref SW354263. Finish Point Lands End –

Sennen Cove draws a vast number of visitors to its golden sand, but many miss 
the great vistas afforded by a brief walk up to the old coastguard lookout – 
and the opportunity to wander a little further to get the most amazing views of 
Land's End without the associated car chaos. There is a great cafe on the beach 
and a good pint in the Old Success Inn (oldsuccess.com 
<http://www.oldsuccess.com/>). If the tide is out, you can also walk north and 
scramble over the rocks towards Gwenver, you must check the tides as the 
shallow nature of the beach means it can come in pretty quick.

The area around St Just was a hub for Cornish mining activity, the remains of 
which are clear to see along this stretch of coastline. To me the specific 
appeal of this area is difficult to put your finger on, there are just so many 
things to see and wonder at: industrial archaeology, brutal natural landscape 
and loads of interesting wildlife. My favourite view is looking south to Cape 
Cornwall, jutting out into the Atlantic with the white water crashing around 
its base. There are many options for short walks around the area but I prefer 
the route north from Cape Cornwall up to theLevant Mine 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/history/view-page/item506928/258708/> with its 
steam engine, lovingly restored by the Greasy Gang volunteers.

<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/things-to-see-and-do/view-page/item502106/258626/>

This beautiful valley is like a time machine. Walking around you will jump 
between pre-historic, medieval, industrial revolution and second world war 
periods. Sitting proud on the highest point is Bosigran iron age castle, 
enjoying views westwards to Pendeen Watch and eastwards to Gurnards Head. The 
ramparts of the castle are clearly visible, if you peek between them to the 
opposite side of the Zawn you are looking at one of the British Commando's 
cliff assault training areas. Commando Ridge cuts a distinctive line out of the 
sea and this route still provides an adventurous experience even with modern 
climbing equipment. A reasonable (deceptively long) walk east rewards the weary 
rambler with a pint at the wonderful Gurnards Head pub (gurnardshead.co.uk 
<http://www.gurnardshead.co.uk/>).

Zennor is steeped in both history and marvellous tales: there is a mermaid in 
the church; theQuoit burial chamber 
<http://www.cornwalls.co.uk/history/sites/zennor_quoit.htm> on the high moor; 
and the steep sided beach valley evokes stories of illicit smuggling 
activities. This area was widely used by a number of west Corwall artists –
Patrick Heron <http://www.artcornwall.org/profiles/Patrick_Heron.htm>'s house 
sits above the village to the east. There is very pleasant walking through 
fields, along the coastal path and up onto the moor, all of which work up a 
good thirst to be slaked in the Tinners Arms (tinnersarms.com 
<http://www.tinnersarms.com/>), a great little pub with a pleasant garden right 
in the centre of the village.

The beautiful little village of St Agnes is at the centre of an amazing area 
to walk in and explore the wealth of natural riches. Most spectacular is Carn 
Gowla (rock lookout in Cornish) – on a clear day you can see the area's vast 
coastal landscape from here. From Mesolithic hunters to second world war 
ammunition stores, St Agnes Head is steeped in history, and is also home to 
rare heathland and important seabird colonies. Chapel Porth beach is a hidden 
gem, unveiling itself as you come round the coastal path. At low tide there is 
a large expanse of golden sand – well worth a stroll to look back at the 
imposing outcrops and caves. Chapel Porth also has a great little beach cafe to 
restore you for your hike back out of the valley.

Although Newquay itself doesn't evoke thoughts of great walks, the area around 
it is a gem. The coastline just south of Newquay is incredibly varied with 
fantastic displays of arable flora in summer. At West Pentire, see whole fields 
scarlet with poppies and other rare meadow plants. There's also lots of sandy 
grassland, rich in wild flowers like cowslip and pyramidal orchid. The dunes 
behind Holywell Bay are the home for hundreds of different insects and great 
for bug hunting. This is truly an area for all seasons; visit in autumn for a 
privileged view of grey seal pups and winter to find migrant birds in the 
fields. Both Crantock and Holywell beaches are well worth a visit with Penhale 
Point offering amazing vistas for those who are prepared to stretch their legs 
a little further.

The Coastal path around the Camel estuary is one of Cornwall's most well known 
areas, and the transition from the comparatively soft estuary to the wild rocks 
of Pentire Point is quite striking. The shifting sand bar at the mouth of the 
estuary has given its name to one of Cornwall's most prolific exports – Doom 
Bar beer. But it is the geological diversity, which makes this place very 
special to me; climbing expeditions onto the intimidating black rock of Pentire 
Point have been indelibly etched on my memory. For a slightly tamer yet no less 
interesting experience Lundy Bay, looking out to the island some 80 miles 
distant, holds a treasure trove provided by a collapsed sea cliff cave and rock 
pools galore.

Tintagel to Boscastle harbour

Most famously associated with King Arthur, Tintagel also has links to the 
sainthood. The area between here and Boscastle has links to St Nectan and St 
Pirran with a cave and a well respectively. The Boscastle area was a favourite 
of Thomas Hardy, who wrote about it as Castle Boterel: "a region of dream and 
mystery". He met his first wife, Emma Gifford, here in 1870. The coastal path 
is steep and strenuous but the views are well worth the effort – Boscastle is 
now fully recovered from the terrible floods and has a number of good watering 
holes to receive and replenish the weary traveller.

<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/local-to-you/south-west/view-page/item525546/>

Explore a stunning stretch of north Cornwall's coastline on a walk that leads 
you from Crackington Haven's sandy beach, to magnificent vistas of Cambeak 
headland and the cliffs beyond, before returning by the sheltered woodlands of 
Ludon Valley. Intriguing rock formations and varied wildlife are just some of 
the highlights you'll discover on the way. The Coombe Barton Inn (
thecoombebartoninn.co.uk <http://www.thecoombebartoninn.co.uk/>) provides a 
pleasant stop-off with amazing views. It is worth noting that the Strangles 
beach is an amazing secluded spot yet it has very strong currents which can 
catch the unsuspecting bather off guard.

<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/local-to-you/south-west/view-page/item607531/>

This gentle clifftop walks encompass breathtaking views of north Cornwall's 
coast. You'll come across a beautiful church, believed to date back to Saxon 
times, and of courseHawker's Hut <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker%27s_Hut>, 
the refuge of poet Reverend Robert Hawker. When you take a good look at this 
part of the coast, you can clearly see why Hawker spent so much of his time 
looking after shipwrecked sailors. The outcrops in this part of the county are 
brutal, and it is worth keeping dogs under close control as the drops are 
unforgiving. On a clear day, Lundy Island can be seen out in the Bristol 
Channel.
