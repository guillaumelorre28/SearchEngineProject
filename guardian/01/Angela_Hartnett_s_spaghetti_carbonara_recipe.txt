This is a classic dish and everyone has their own version of it. Mine is 
adapted from my friend Lisa's recipe â€“ she makes the best carbonara I've ever 
had. The most important thing you can do to elevate the recipe is get the best 
possible bacon and cheese.

(serves 2)

250g dried spaghetti
3 tbsp olive oil
200g streaky bacon, in horizontal strips
1 small leek, washed and finely chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed
Pinch of dried chilli
100ml double cream
2 medium eggs
Sea salt and pepper
Handful of parmesan shavings
1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped

Add the spaghetti to a large pan of salted boiling water, stir after a minute, 
then cook as instructed on the packet.

Gently heat the oil in another large pan, add the bacon and cook it until it 
starts to colour. Add the leek and garlic and saute for about 5 minutes, 
without colour. Sprinkle in the dried chilli, remove the pan from the heat and 
leave to one side.

Beat the cream and eggs together with a fork.

When the pasta is ready, toss in a colander to remove excess water.

Put the bacon and vegetables back on a gentle heat, then add the pasta, eggs 
and cream. Remove from the stove and allow the residual heat to cook the eggs.

Season with salt and pepper and finish with the parsley and parmesan.
