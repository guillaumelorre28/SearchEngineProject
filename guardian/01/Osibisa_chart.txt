Saxophonist Teddy Osei, his trumpet-playing brother Mac Tontoh and drummer Sol 
Amarfio came from Ghana; they were joined by Grenadian Spartacus R on bass, 
Trinidadian Robert Bailey on keyboards, Antiguan Wendell Richardson on lead 
guitar and Nigerian Lasisi Amao on tenor sax. They met in London in 1969 and 
formed Osibisa, playing music that fused African and Caribbean styles with 
jazz, rock and R&B, leading to claims that they deserve to be called the first 
"world music" band. And in 1971 their debut album went to no 11 in the UK.
