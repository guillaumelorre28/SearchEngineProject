Rafael Nadal <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal> has progressed to 
another grand slam final after beating fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco in 
Melbourne this afternoon.

Nadal required five sets to overcome Verdasco, who beat Andy Murray earlier in 
the tournament, eventually prevailing 6-7, 6-4,7-6, 6-7, 6-4. The world No1 
will now faceRoger Federer <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> on 
Sunday in a repeat of the epic tussle that took place between the men at the 
final of Wimbledon last year.

It will be the 19th time the pair have squared-up and the seventh in a grand 
slam final with the Spaniard leading 12-6 and 4-2 respectively.

Verdasco's extra power looked capable of causing an upset throughout today's 
match as he hit an incredible 95 winners. But Nadal made a key breakthrough in 
the 10th game of the fifth set to finally secure victory in five hours and 14 
minutes.
