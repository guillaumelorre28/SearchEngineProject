This has to be one of my favourite summer treats – and so simple. I love a 
bean salad and when you add a top-quality tuna, it's delicious. It works really 
well with cherry tomatoes too. Make sure you cook the beans enough, use a good 
tuna and serve it at room temperature.

(serves 2)
250g yellow beans
250g green French beans
250g runner beans
1 small clove of garlic, crushed
25ml red wine vinegar
½tsp Dijon mustard
100ml olive oil
1 bulb fennel, trimmed and sliced thinly
300g top-quality tinned tuna (Ortiz is a good sustainable option)

Put the yellow beans in a large pan of salted boiling water, followed by the 
green and runner beans two minutes later. Cook until soft, drain and refresh in 
cold water, drain again and leave to one side.

Add the garlic to the vinegar, combine with the mustard and oil and beat until 
emulsified.

Drain the tuna and add, along with the fennel, to the beans.

Add the vinaigrette, make sure it's mixed through thoroughly and serve the 
salad at room temperature with some good bread.
