Night time politics

 * We finish where we began. Grassroots is as grassroots does. Cory Bernardi 
is starting a cross-party political movement Australians Conservatives through 
his website, asking people to sign up. He insists he is not leaving the Liberal 
party but wants a grassroots conservative movement. A number of Liberals have 
suggested to me in the past 24 hours that they need something to counter the 
unions and GetUp. Is it this or is it a foundation for a Cory party? Cory says 
nope nope nope. He wants to work from within the Liberal party.

 * Grassroots 2: The Nats, via an external consultant’s report reported in The 
Oz, are claiming their grassroots campaign was tops when compared with the 
Liberals. There seems to be some question over the report because neither 
Barnaby Joyce’s office nor senior National Darren Chester know about it. But it 
was instructive that the Nationals’ president Larry Anthony came out to make 
the contrast between the two parties. That would suggest that it was a 
strategic play for the party organisation - as opposed to the parliamentary 
wing. I put in a call to the organisation but it was not returned.

 * Treasurer Scott Morrison backed up the prime minister’s point this morning 
that the Medicare campaign run by Labor took hold because of previous (broken) 
promises by the Coalition on health.

 * Recriminations within the Liberal party continued today. Canning MP Andrew 
Hastie criticised the Liberal’s national campaign and its pollster Mark Textor. 
He called on Malcolm Turnbull to have a party room meeting to get feedback from 
MPs before he makes any deal with the independents.

 * A One Nation WA senate candidate Rod Culleton 
<https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/31991608/one-nation-wa-senate-candidate-rod-culleton-on-stealing-charge/>
 may not be eligible if the party wins the seat as he is awaiting sentencing 
for a criminal offence in New South Wales. If he does not take up the seat, his 
brother in law is number two and his wife is number three on the ticket.

That’s your lot for today. Thanks to my brains trust, Paul Karp, Gareth 
Hutchens, Katharine Murphy, Greg Jericho and Helen Davidson. Thanks for your 
company and we shall continue blogging with the vote continues. That means I 
will be here tomorrow.

Goodnight.

Tony Abbott has been doorstopped.

According to the ABC’s Andrew Greene, Abbott was lunching in Canberra with the 
federal director,Tony Nutt. Abbott told the ABC he was confident that the 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> would form 
government.

Q: Do you think you might have done better with you in the top job?

It is important for all of us to look forward, not backwards. I will certainly 
not speculate on that. The important thing now is that we have the best 
possible government with the strongest possible program, and obviously, that is 
aMalcolm Turnbull Coalition government.

Q: Would it benefit having you on the frontbench? Do you have skills to bring? 

I will not speculate on who might be on the frontbench of a return government. 
As I have said throughout this campaign, I am running to be the member for 
Warringah. I am extremely grateful to the people of Warringah for giving me 
their trust yet again. I am very disappointed for the good colleagues who will 
no longer be with us in this parliament.

Helen Davidson

The NT chief minister is brushing off the continued talk around his government 
being to blame for theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> losing both federal 
seats on Saturday.

Ahead of the Territory election in August, Adam Giles has picked up on the 
“Mediscare” backlash, and tried to ward off an NT Labor trip down the same 
campaign path with accusations the CLP will privatise the PowerWater company.

Giles has taken to Facebook, and put a call out for help with a hashtag 
(despite having a highly paid social media manager).

We need a new name for the Labor lies around Power and Water and any ideas of 
a sale. Now some people are talking about #pooscare, some are talking about 
#electrifright, but I know Australians and Territorians can come up with a much 
better name.

A privatisation scare campaign from NT Labor may gain more traction than its 
federal counterpart. The NT government has actually privatised a few things 
during its term, and some of them, in particular the sale of the Territory 
Insurance Office, have been pretty unpopular.
Adam Giles (@adamgiles) 
Sewerage will remain in government hands. No shit. Power & Water won’t be sold.

Bill Shorten is asked whether Labor would put a separate marriage bill to 
bypass the plebiscite bill.

We think there should be a vote in the parliament. Everything Malcolm seems to 
have a tricky idea on seems to turn to mud.Malcolm Turnbull should go back to 
the oldMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull>. I think more 
Australians like that. He knows the best options for this parliament and for 
Australia is to have a conscience vote in the parliament in this term, we’re up 
for that. I think that we need less division in our society and more unity.

Cory Bernardi: I am not leaving the Liberal party

Katharine Murphy

The Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> is 
nursing cuts and bruises after the weekend election result, but at least one 
Liberal appears to be having the time of his life:Cory Bernardi.

I’ve just had a short conversation with the Liberal senator who has lead the 
public recriminations from conservatives since voters gave the government the 
thumbs down last weekend.

Cory Bernardi <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/cory-bernardi> 
insists he is not leaving the Liberal party but says he is intent on 
establishing a grassroots movement to unite conservative voters. He’s been 
saying since Sunday that the Coalition has been captured by fringe issues and 
needs to return to a conservative agenda.

Bernardi told Guardian Australia on Wednesday he was n-o-t leaving the Liberal 
party. “My intention is to make theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> stronger.”

Unity. Liberty. Fraternity. Something like that, anyway.

Bill Shorten praises the Australian Electoral Commission.

I want to acknowledge the work of the AEC and all the vote counters. They’re 
doing the best they can. Postal votes are still to be counted, absentee votes 
to be processed. We live in a marvellous country where we settle our 
differences at the ballot box. I’m patient. I understand Australians want to 
know the outcome. Trust me, I do too, but I recognise the process is 
complicated and votes have to be counted.

Bill Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> says 
the last Coalition budget won’t stand the test of parliamentary scrutiny.

The government and some MPs are running away from Malcolm Turnbull’s 
leadership and openly undermining him. I think Labor’s promises and platform 
would provide a good platform for work in the 45th parliament. We will keep 
pushing for a royal commission into the banks. We believe it’s appropriate to 
have a parliamentary vote on marriage equality and we think it is long overdue 
to take proper action on climate change.

Shorten is asked about the importance of the vote in Tasmania.

I have no doubt on the Saturday night passed, as the results came in from 
Tasmanian polling booths the nation sat up and thought maybe, just maybe, Mr 
Turnbull’s confidence was misplaced but he had this election in the bag three 
weeks ago as he arrogantly declared.

Bill Shorten arrives. He is in Tasmania.

If Mr Turnbull does scrape home, his problems have only just begun. In the 
House of Representatives, he’ll be hostage to Mr Abbott and the rightwing of the
Liberal party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> and in 
the Senate he’ll be hostage to Senator Hanson elect and other rightwing 
senators in the Senate.

Australian Electoral Commissioner: look at the facts Daily Tele

Tom Rogers, AEC Commissioner, is over all the criticism. He has put out a 
statement.

I strongly refute several assertions made in the Daily Telegraph editorial 
titled ‘Need for speed in democracy of 21st century’. The author’s statement 
that the count is proceeding ‘at an apparently glacial pace’ is incorrect: the 
AEC counted over a million votes yesterday (a mix of new votes added to the 
count and a further check of votes already counted), and this was just one 
crucial step of the AEC’s conduct of the largest, most complex election in 
Australia’s history.

I take my role as the electoral commissioner extremely seriously; as an 
independent statutory officer I protect, defend and support the processes that 
ensure the will of the Australian people is accurately recorded.

Anyone who has an issue with the Electoral Act is absolutely able to raise it 
with the Australian parliament, and I suggest this would be more productive 
than criticising the hard work of the many thousands of ordinary Australians 
who are delivering the election ...

He continues on in that vein with a series of facts 
<http://aec.gov.au/media/media-releases/2016/07-06e.htm>. But his main point is 
this is L-A-W.

Dear conservative reader, Cory Bernardi needs you

The South Australian Liberal senator has sent an appeal to conservatives via 
his blog <http://www.corybernardi.com/uniting_australian_conservatives>. It is 
more of the same analysis that we have seen over the past few days plus an 
appeal to his followers. He wants a cross-party movement – presumably to build 
a base for a new party if he so desires. Will he resign and launch into the 
minor party constellation? I will let you be the judge. We shall also put in a 
call to him.

It’s a disaster.”

They’re the words many conservatives use to begin their election analysis. And 
they’re right, when you consider the national interest and the possible 
implication of a hung parliament and an even more fragmented Senate.

Even though the results are not yet finalised, it looks unlikely that either 
party will be able to form government in their own right.In effect, we are 
right back where we were in 2010, with the party roles reversed. We shouldn’t 
really be surprised when the same chain of events took place during a popularly 
elected first-term government.

In my youth I was told that the definition of madness was doing the same thing 
over and over and expecting a different result. That axiom has borne out once 
again.

However, the votes have been cast and there isn’t much we can do about it now 
except learn from the experience. The Australian people have spoken and 
basically said that neither side of politics is doing a good enough job to 
secure their trust. Accordingly they have parked their vote with minor parties 
and independents.

As of writing, over 1.7 million votes were cast for right-of-centre or 
conservative parties rather than theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party>. From my 
perspective, that was the Liberal base expressing their unhappiness with past 
events.

Irrespective of the final election result, the clear mission now is to bring 
people together for the good of the country. That is going to take the 
formalisation of a broad conservative movement to help change politics and to 
give common sense a united voice.

With that in mind, I’d ask all of you to read and consider my address to the 
National Press Club about this subject in 2014. You can do so at my website by
clicking here 
<http://www.corybernardi.com/national_press_club_address?e=85fc474105297f4ea5acc5f7e310ff5d&utm_source=conservative&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=wdcs_160706&n=1&test_email=1>
. I hope you will agree that the words and sentiments are even more relevant 
today.

It’s more important than ever that we unite Australian Conservatives, who 
share many views, regardless of their party affiliation. If you believe in 
limited government, traditional values, defending our culture and heritage, 
lower taxes, a stronger nation, a stronger economy and plain old common sense, 
then you have a lot in common with millions of others.

Now is the time to gather together. You can help kick start the movement by 
going towww.conservatives.org.au 
<http://www.conservatives.org.au/?e=85fc474105297f4ea5acc5f7e310ff5d&utm_source=conservative&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=wdcs_160706&n=2&test_email=1>
 and registering your interest.

It’s the next step in making sure our voice is never taken for granted again.

 * We finish where we began. Grassroots is as grassroots does. Cory Bernardi 
is starting a cross-party political movement Australians Conservatives through 
his website, asking people to sign up. He insists he is not leaving the Liberal 
party but wants a grassroots conservative movement. A number of Liberals have 
suggested to me in the past 24 hours that they need something to counter the 
unions and GetUp. Is it this or is it a foundation for a Cory party? Cory says 
nope nope nope. He wants to work from within the Liberal party.

 * Grassroots 2: The Nats, via an external consultant’s report reported in The 
Oz, are claiming their grassroots campaign was tops when compared with the 
Liberals. There seems to be some question over the report because neither 
Barnaby Joyce’s office nor senior National Darren Chester know about it. But it 
was instructive that the Nationals’ president Larry Anthony came out to make 
the contrast between the two parties. That would suggest that it was a 
strategic play for the party organisation - as opposed to the parliamentary 
wing. I put in a call to the organisation but it was not returned.

 * Treasurer Scott Morrison backed up the prime minister’s point this morning 
that the Medicare campaign run by Labor took hold because of previous (broken) 
promises by the Coalition on health.

 * Recriminations within the Liberal party continued today. Canning MP Andrew 
Hastie criticised the Liberal’s national campaign and its pollster Mark Textor. 
He called on Malcolm Turnbull to have a party room meeting to get feedback from 
MPs before he makes any deal with the independents.

 * A One Nation WA senate candidate Rod Culleton 
<https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/31991608/one-nation-wa-senate-candidate-rod-culleton-on-stealing-charge/>
 may not be eligible if the party wins the seat as he is awaiting sentencing 
for a criminal offence in New South Wales. If he does not take up the seat, his 
brother in law is number two and his wife is number three on the ticket.

That’s your lot for today. Thanks to my brains trust, Paul Karp, Gareth 
Hutchens, Katharine Murphy, Greg Jericho and Helen Davidson. Thanks for your 
company and we shall continue blogging with the vote continues. That means I 
will be here tomorrow.

Goodnight. 
 
Tony Abbott has been doorstopped.

According to the ABC’s Andrew Greene, Abbott was lunching in Canberra with the 
federal director,Tony Nutt. Abbott told the ABC he was confident that the 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> would form 
government.

Q: Do you think you might have done better with you in the top job?

It is important for all of us to look forward, not backwards. I will certainly 
not speculate on that. The important thing now is that we have the best 
possible government with the strongest possible program, and obviously, that is 
aMalcolm Turnbull Coalition government.

Q: Would it benefit having you on the frontbench? Do you have skills to bring? 

I will not speculate on who might be on the frontbench of a return government. 
As I have said throughout this campaign, I am running to be the member for 
Warringah. I am extremely grateful to the people of Warringah for giving me 
their trust yet again. I am very disappointed for the good colleagues who will 
no longer be with us in this parliament.
 
The NT chief minister is brushing off the continued talk around his government 
being to blame for theCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> losing both federal 
seats on Saturday.

Ahead of the Territory election in August, Adam Giles has picked up on the 
“Mediscare” backlash, and tried to ward off an NT Labor trip down the same 
campaign path with accusations the CLP will privatise the PowerWater company.

Giles has taken to Facebook, and put a call out for help with a hashtag 
(despite having a highly paid social media manager).

We need a new name for the Labor lies around Power and Water and any ideas of 
a sale. Now some people are talking about #pooscare, some are talking about 
#electrifright, but I know Australians and Territorians can come up with a much 
better name.

A privatisation scare campaign from NT Labor may gain more traction than its 
federal counterpart. The NT government has actually privatised a few things 
during its term, and some of them, in particular the sale of the Territory 
Insurance Office, have been pretty unpopular.
Adam Giles (@adamgiles) 
Sewerage will remain in government hands. No shit. Power & Water won’t be sold.

The Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> is 
nursing cuts and bruises after the weekend election result, but at least one 
Liberal appears to be having the time of his life:Cory Bernardi.

I’ve just had a short conversation with the Liberal senator who has lead the 
public recriminations from conservatives since voters gave the government the 
thumbs down last weekend.

Cory Bernardi <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/cory-bernardi> 
insists he is not leaving the Liberal party but says he is intent on 
establishing a grassroots movement to unite conservative voters. He’s been 
saying since Sunday that the Coalition has been captured by fringe issues and 
needs to return to a conservative agenda.

Bernardi told Guardian Australia on Wednesday he was n-o-t leaving the Liberal 
party. “My intention is to make theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> stronger.”

Unity. Liberty. Fraternity. Something like that, anyway.

 
Bill Shorten praises the Australian Electoral Commission.

I want to acknowledge the work of the AEC and all the vote counters. They’re 
doing the best they can. Postal votes are still to be counted, absentee votes 
to be processed. We live in a marvellous country where we settle our 
differences at the ballot box. I’m patient. I understand Australians want to 
know the outcome. Trust me, I do too, but I recognise the process is 
complicated and votes have to be counted.
 
Bill Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> says 
the last Coalition budget won’t stand the test of parliamentary scrutiny.

The government and some MPs are running away from Malcolm Turnbull’s 
leadership and openly undermining him. I think Labor’s promises and platform 
would provide a good platform for work in the 45th parliament. We will keep 
pushing for a royal commission into the banks. We believe it’s appropriate to 
have a parliamentary vote on marriage equality and we think it is long overdue 
to take proper action on climate change.
 
Shorten is asked about the importance of the vote in Tasmania.

I have no doubt on the Saturday night passed, as the results came in from 
Tasmanian polling booths the nation sat up and thought maybe, just maybe, Mr 
Turnbull’s confidence was misplaced but he had this election in the bag three 
weeks ago as he arrogantly declared.
 
Bill Shorten arrives. He is in Tasmania.

If Mr Turnbull does scrape home, his problems have only just begun. In the 
House of Representatives, he’ll be hostage to Mr Abbott and the rightwing of the
Liberal party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> and in 
the Senate he’ll be hostage to Senator Hanson elect and other rightwing 
senators in the Senate.
 
Tom Rogers, AEC Commissioner, is over all the criticism. He has put out a 
statement.

I strongly refute several assertions made in the Daily Telegraph editorial 
titled ‘Need for speed in democracy of 21st century’. The author’s statement 
that the count is proceeding ‘at an apparently glacial pace’ is incorrect: the 
AEC counted over a million votes yesterday (a mix of new votes added to the 
count and a further check of votes already counted), and this was just one 
crucial step of the AEC’s conduct of the largest, most complex election in 
Australia’s history.

I take my role as the electoral commissioner extremely seriously; as an 
independent statutory officer I protect, defend and support the processes that 
ensure the will of the Australian people is accurately recorded.

Anyone who has an issue with the Electoral Act is absolutely able to raise it 
with the Australian parliament, and I suggest this would be more productive 
than criticising the hard work of the many thousands of ordinary Australians 
who are delivering the election ...

He continues on in that vein with a series of facts 
<http://aec.gov.au/media/media-releases/2016/07-06e.htm>. But his main point is 
this is L-A-W.
 
The South Australian Liberal senator has sent an appeal to conservatives via 
his blog <http://www.corybernardi.com/uniting_australian_conservatives>. It is 
more of the same analysis that we have seen over the past few days plus an 
appeal to his followers. He wants a cross-party movement – presumably to build 
a base for a new party if he so desires. Will he resign and launch into the 
minor party constellation? I will let you be the judge. We shall also put in a 
call to him.

It’s a disaster.”

They’re the words many conservatives use to begin their election analysis. And 
they’re right, when you consider the national interest and the possible 
implication of a hung parliament and an even more fragmented Senate.

Even though the results are not yet finalised, it looks unlikely that either 
party will be able to form government in their own right.In effect, we are 
right back where we were in 2010, with the party roles reversed. We shouldn’t 
really be surprised when the same chain of events took place during a popularly 
elected first-term government.

In my youth I was told that the definition of madness was doing the same thing 
over and over and expecting a different result. That axiom has borne out once 
again.

However, the votes have been cast and there isn’t much we can do about it now 
except learn from the experience. The Australian people have spoken and 
basically said that neither side of politics is doing a good enough job to 
secure their trust. Accordingly they have parked their vote with minor parties 
and independents.

As of writing, over 1.7 million votes were cast for right-of-centre or 
conservative parties rather than theLiberal party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party>. From my 
perspective, that was the Liberal base expressing their unhappiness with past 
events.

Irrespective of the final election result, the clear mission now is to bring 
people together for the good of the country. That is going to take the 
formalisation of a broad conservative movement to help change politics and to 
give common sense a united voice.

With that in mind, I’d ask all of you to read and consider my address to the 
National Press Club about this subject in 2014. You can do so at my website by

. I hope you will agree that the words and sentiments are even more relevant 
today.

It’s more important than ever that we unite Australian Conservatives, who 
share many views, regardless of their party affiliation. If you believe in 
limited government, traditional values, defending our culture and heritage, 
lower taxes, a stronger nation, a stronger economy and plain old common sense, 
then you have a lot in common with millions of others.

Now is the time to gather together. You can help kick start the movement by 
going towww.conservatives.org.au

 and registering your interest.

It’s the next step in making sure our voice is never taken for granted again.
