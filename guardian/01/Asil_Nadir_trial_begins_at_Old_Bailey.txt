The former business tycoon Asil Nadir 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/asil-nadir> will go on trial at the Old 
Bailey today accused of stealing Â£34m.

A jury of four women and eight men was sworn in on Thursday. The case is due 
to last at least four months and will be heard before Mr Justice Holroyde.

Nadir, 70, of Mayfair, central London, denies 13 counts relating to theft from 
his Polly Peck business empire between 1987 and 1990.

He has been on conditional bail since returning to Britain in September 2010 
from northern Cyprus, 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/aug/26/asil-nadir-tycoon-bail> where 
he had been living since May 1993.
