They have staged protests, walked out on strike, kidnapped their bosses and 
threatened to pour toxic waste into the river Seine. But, despite their efforts 
to avert closures and job losses, tens of thousands of French factory employees 
have fallen victim to the gloomy economic climate.

Now one angry worker who was made redundant this year has found a new, poetic 
way of venting his rage: a rock song that has become aYouTube 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/youtube> hit.

Christian de Mitri, a 49-year-old karaoke king from the eastern region of 
Lorraine, has become an unlikely hero of the workers' movement after a song he 
wrote and recorded at home was launched on the internet.

The song – an anthem to his former colleagues at the steel plant of Gandrange, 
which closed its gates in March – is a furious tirade against those who pulled 
the plug on the factory. Marchand d'Acier: Tueur de Région (Steel Merchant: 
Region Killer) has been watched more than 18,000 times sinceits arrival on the 
video-sharing website <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ksua0DJvRLY>two weeks ago.

"I wanted to let out a cry of anger," said de Mitri. "[The steel industry] is 
a vital product for Lorraine. It's our lifeblood. Now, with relocations and job 
cuts, they're taking it all away from us."

The dispute at the plant in Gandrange, a small town near the eastern city of 
Metz, has, for many, come to symbolise the desperation of those facing 
redundancy.

When it was first suggested that steelmaker ArcelorMittal might be intending 
to close the site and cut more than half its workforce,Nicolas Sarkozy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy>, the French president, 
vowed to workers that the state would not let the plant close. On a visit in 
February 2008, he told assembled staff that "with or without Mittal, the state 
will invest in Gandrange".

But, just over a year later, the factory was closed, with 571 redundancies. A 
gravestone has been erected near the site, bearing the words: "Here lie the 
promises of Nicolas Sarkozy."

The president, who had avoided returning to the plant, made an unexpected 
visit this month, but union leaders said the announcement of a €300m contract 
was a reworking of a deal already signed.

De Mitri, who worked at Gandrange from 1989 until 2001 and was made redundant 
from by his subsequent employer in March, has been congratulated by the town's 
Socialist mayor, Henri Octave, who said his song could become the 21st century 
equivalent to Bernard Lavilliers' 1976 workers' anthem Fensch Vallée.
