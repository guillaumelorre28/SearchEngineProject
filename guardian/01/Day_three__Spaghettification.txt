I was gutted, for a while. She texted me once or twice with gig dates. I said 
I was busy and began to feel better. But I started seeing her band more and 
more in newspapers and magazines. I heard their lyrical summer song on the 
radio, her vocals husky and mellow. The reviews mentioned her more than the 
other two: she had something.

I saw her again three months later. It was the middle of the afternoon in a 
hot summer, the gallery was quiet. She walked in. She looked over her 
sunglasses and said: "Mr Art Gallery Man, you havetotally vanished 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2008/dec/10/black-hole>. I do believe 
you've been avoiding me."

"Me? No. I just don't go anywhere as exciting as you."
She took her glasses off and grinned. 
"You should let me take you, then."
I shook my head.
"Come on," she said, "Can't we be friends?"
She tilted her head to the side and smiled again. I thought: this is a bad 
idea.
"Come on, I could do with a friend. Let me take you out for dinner."

It's strange remembering this now: we went out for pasta to some chain 
restaurant, and no one bothered her. She twirled spaghetti around her fork and 
told me about her love life: one boyfriend gone, a new one installed. And Jules 
and Frankie were at each other's throats again, over some man, or maybe a girl, 
or maybe both.

"You're a good listener," she said as we left, "we should do this again. 
Pasta, wine, me telling you my problems."
And though a voice inside me said "you like her too much. Stop, now," I said:
"I'd like that".
