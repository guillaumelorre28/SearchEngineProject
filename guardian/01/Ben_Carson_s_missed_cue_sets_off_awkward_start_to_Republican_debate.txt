The Republican debate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/07/republican-debate-new-hampshire-marco-rubio-chris-christie-donald-trump-ted-cruz>
 got off to a slapstick start on Saturday night, when former neurosurgeon Ben 
Carson seemingly refused to take to the stage.

The debate, broadcast on ABC, began normally. New Jersey governor Chris 
Christie <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chris-christie> was introduced 
and walked out, waving at the audience.

That normality lasted for all of four seconds. Carson was introduced by David 
Muir and Martha Raddatz. He was supposed to head to his podium.

But instead of striding out confidently onto the stage, the former 
neurosurgeon idled awkwardly in a corridor. For over a minute. While all the 
other candidates walked past him.

Initially, the ABC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/abc> camera zoomed in on 
Carson, as if trying to lure him out of his hiding place. But he remained fixed 
in his position, smilingly benignly.

Things became more absurd when the next candidate, Ted Cruz, was introduced. 
Cruz walked out from backstage and appeared momentarily baffled by Carson’s 
loitering. Carson looked at the Texas senator and ushered him through with a 
wave of the hand.

Cruz walked past and took his place on the stage. Still Carson stood. Waiting.
A producer leaned around the curtain from backstage and desperately gestured 
Carson towards the area where the debate was going to take place. Carson 
turned, looked at the man, saw the gesture, then remained rooted to the spot.

On social media it was suggested that Carson may not have heard his name 
called. Whatever happened, it was as awkward to watch as it must have been for 
him to be standing there.

Donald Trump was called 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/donald-trump-waterboarding-republican-debate-torture>
. He idled behind Carson. Neither of them headed to the stage. They looked like 
two old men waiting for a bus.

Next, Marco Rubio’s name was called. He skipped past both Trump and Carson. 
Jeb Bush did the same.

Carson remained in place. 

Finally, one minute and 18 seconds after he was summoned, Carson walked on to 
the stage.

Trump followed him.

Cue sighs of relief all round. The embarrassment was over.

Except it wasn’t quite. The ABC hosts had forgotten to bring Ohio governor 
John Kasich onto the stage.

It took Chris Christie to remind Muir and Raddatz. 

“What about Kasich? Can I introduce Kasich?” Christie asked.

Finally Kasich arrived on stage, and the debate could begin. It would run for 
two-and-a-half hours. But the moment that will surely stick in people’s minds 
occurred in those first two minutes. Specifically: that one minute and those 18 
seconds.
