1 Source d’Argent, Seychelles


As if a beach like this needed any enhancement, pink-hued sand ups the ante in 
the picture-postcard stakes at Source d’Argent, a secluded cove on La Digue, 
the Seychelles’ third-largest island (in an archipelago of 115). Huge, 
weathered granite boulders bookend the shore, and there are nearby restaurants 
for sampling Creole-inspired cuisine.

This beach is Europe’s tallest dune at over 100 metres. It’s an hour’s drive 
from Bordeaux and is literally dazzling. You will shield your eyes as much from 
the shimmering heat haze as the pristine sand. After you’ve taken in the 
panoramic views over the Atlantic and pine forests behind, there are miles of 
beaches to explore along the Bassin d’Arcachon. Take a ferry from Arcachon pier 
to Cap Ferret for the best view of the dune. To eat, head to the oystercabanes, 
where fishermen set up tables and serve oysters, prawns, paté, bread and rosé 
wine.

There is no shortage of beautiful beaches on the smallest of the Balearics but 
everybody seems to want to cram on to Illetes and Espalmador. Much better to 
hire a bike or moped in the main port, La Savina, and head a few kilometres 
across the island to Cala Saona. It has perfectly clear water, white sand and 
dramatic red cliffs on both sides. It faces west, so is the ideal spot for a 
sundowner at, say, the charmingly simple Cala Saonachiringuito.

A beach made from years of dumped litter sounds like a hellhole but, at Glass 
beach, on the Mendocino coast in California, the result is quite beautiful. 
From 1906 to 1967, glass, appliances and even vehicles were chucked into the 
sea. A clean-up programme removed all the metal and non-biodegradable waste, 
and the waves broke down the glass and pottery, which washed up as jewel-like, 
translucent stones. Nowadays, the beach is part of MacKerricher state park, and 
visitors are forbidden for removing the sea-glass baubles.

Panama has three archipelagos: San Blas is pricey to get to, the Pearl Islands 
are pricey to stay on, but Bocas del Toro, just south of Costa Rica on the 
Caribbean side, puts virgin beach utopia within a backpacker budget. From the 
funky town hub of Bocas on Isla Colón, boat taxis cross between the 10 
inhabited islands and some 300 islands and islets, although this protected 
beach, gloriously decorated with a liberal smattering of starfish, is on Colón 
itself.

More of a cove than a beach, backed by cliffs and dense woods, with white 
sands and pebbles and clear blue waters – is Fakistra on the Pelion peninsula 
(mainland Greece), below Tsagarada village. It’s a steep walk down but it’s the 
sort of place that, apart from in July and August, you may well have to 
yourself.

If asked to design the perfect tropical beach, Playa Flamenco on Culebra 
island, off the east coast of Puerto Rico, is probably what you would come up 
with. It’s a U-shaped cove with white sand, warm turquoise water, palm trees, 
lush vegetation and a peaceful lagoon. The island’s undeveloped state is partly 
thanks to the US military, which used to use it as a gunnery range – a rusting 
Sherman tank remains in the middle of the sand. It makes a day trip by ferry 
from Fajardo on the Puerto Rico mainland ($4.50 return): a shuttle bus runs 
from the ferry port. Culebra has an excellent government-run campsite right on 
the sand at the western side of the bay. It’s quite basic, with showers open 
only three hours a day, but pitch your tent under mangroves ($20 for up to six 
people), stock up on water, pina coladas and local snacks (comida criolla) and 
you may never want to leave. If you do, though, there are bikes to hire.

Choosing the best beach in Thailand is a near impossible task. But one Thai 
island that’s still relatively peaceful is Koh Kradan, near busier Koh Lipe, in 
the Andaman Sea. With powdery sand, excellent snorkelling on a reef just off 
the beach, hammocks and crystal-clear water, it would suit those who don’t want 
to drink buckets of spirits under a full moon. You can kayak round the whole 
island – 90% of which is part ofHat Chao Mai national park 
<http://www.dnp.go.th/parkreserve/asp/style1/default.asp?npid=209&lg=2> – in 
three hours to more isolated spots, and take longtail boat trips to Ko Waen, Ko 
Chueak and Ko Muk’s Emerald Cave.

An underground beach sounds like the stuff of legend, but the Marietas 
Islands, where Hidden Beach lies, were used as a military testing ground by the 
Mexican government in the early 1900s, and it’s suspected that a bomb may have 
created the crater in which it sits. Access to this crescent within a gaping 
circular hole in the landscape, is by swimming or kayaking through a long 
tunnel. Many operators run boat trips here from Puerto Vallarta ($76 with
ecotoursvallarta.com <http://www.ecotoursvallarta.com/marietas-islands/>), but 
the sea is rough and you have to swim in beside treacherous rocks. But it’s 
stunning – Jacques Cousteau was a fan – with the bonus of possibly spotting a 
humpback whale on the way.

A three-hour drive from Sydney, Greenfield beach sits next to Jervis Bay’s 
calm waters and blindingly white sand. It is about 500m north of the more 
famous Hyams beach, so crowds tend to gravitate away from it and framed by a 
dense forest of gum trees and a small sandstone cliff. It’s a walk from

Sugar sand, palms, breeze, sea that’s 26-29C year round and the colour of 
peppermint mouthwash... Bora Bora is a cliched vision of the heavenly beach. 
Even if you never get to go, this is one for the mental image bank at least – 
use it when meditating. Matira has to win as the only public beach on the 
island, and somewhere you could mingle with locals. TheBora Bora Hotel Eden 
Beach <http://www.boraborahotel.com/Bungalows.html> (bungalows from £1,852 a 
week half-board including transfers, boraborahotel.com), built on its own coral 
isle, has its own private beach that may be a grain prettier, for its view of 
beautiful rock peak Otemanu.

Greece has no shortage of gorgeous beaches, but when it comes to accessible 
and child-friendly options, the Cyclades island of Naxos is hard to beat. One 
of the best bets for families can be found within a five-minute walk of Naxos 
Town (Chora). The warm, shallow waters of St George beach are perfect for 
paddling and snorkelling but there’s plenty to keep older children happy, too. 
At theFlisvos Sport Club <http://www.flisvos-sportclub.com/index.php>, you can 
sign up for windsurfing, wakeboarding or waterskiing, hire a mountain bike, or 
play a game of beach tennis or volleyball. The beach is lined with laid-back 
tavernas and beach clubs which hire out sun loungers.
• A week self-catering for two at Kalergis Studios, a stone’s throw from the 
beach, costs £667

Even in summer, the beaches of the rugged Crozon peninsula remain relatively 
quiet. In a sheltered bay, where the peninsula meets the mainland, is the 
seaside town of Morgat, with its crescent of pine-fringed sand. At low-tide, 
it’s a great spot for rock-pooling and, at high tide, the peninsula’s sea caves 
can be explored on a boat trip from the harbour (vedettes-sirenes.com 
<http://www.vedettes-sirenes.com/>). There are surf and dive schools, bikes and 
kayaks to hire, and sailboats to rent. Refuel at one of the many creperies on 
the harbour – Atao Aman (34 Boulevard de la Plage) serves savoury and sweet 
versions.

In the far west of the Algarve, the fishing village of Salema has somehow 
escaped the large-scale development that blights much of Portugal’s southern 
coast. Fishermen tend their nets on the sandy Blue Flag-certified beach, and 
dinosaur footprints can be found preserved in the limestone rocks. The gentle 
waves are perfect for a spot of boogie boarding under the watchful eye of the 
lifeguards on duty in the summer. There are sun loungers and umbrellas for 
hire, toilets and showers, and a good choice of restaurants and cafes.

Picture a beach holiday and Finland is not the first country that springs to 
mind, yet this Nordic country is home to one of the finest stretches of sand in 
northern Europe. Yyteri beach, near the city of Pori, is a 5km stretch of 
powder-soft sand backed by dunes and pine forests. In late summer, the shallow 
waters of the Baltic are surprisingly warm and the offshore breezes attract 
surfers from across Scandinavia. There are wetsuits, surf- and stand-up paddle 
boards for hire from the Yyteri Surf Centre (purjelautaliitto.fi 
<http://www.purjelautaliitto.fi/>). Facilities are low-key: a couple of coffee 
and ice-cream stalls, picnic tables, a children’s play area, toilets and not 
much else.

It’s not difficult to find a stunning beach on Sardinia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/02/holiday-guide-sardinias-best-beaches-restaurants-hotels>
, but finding one that caters for families on a modest budget is more of a 
challenge. Cala Gonone ticks all of the right boxes. White pebble-and-sand 
beaches, with sun loungers and parasols for rent, calm, turquoise waters for 
swimming and snorkelling, a long seafront promenade lined with low-key 
trattorias – and none of the bling that accompanies the glitzier Costa Smeralda 
to the north. When the charms of Cala Gonone’s two small but perfectly formed 
beaches pall, there are daily boat trips to the Bue Marino caves and more 
remote beaches, such asCala Luna <http://www.calagononecrociere.it/> and Cala 
Fuili <http://www.calagononecrociere.it/>, further south.

Just a short hop from the ferry port at Santander on Spain’s north coast, the 
genteel seaside town of Comillas is popular with Spanish families but largely 
overlooked by foreign tourists. The town has two fine beaches: Playa de 
Comillas, which has a sprinkling of cafes and a small fishing harbour, showers, 
ice-cream stalls and rock pools to explore; and the wilder Playa de Oyambre, 
backed by a beautiful nature reserve and the snow-capped Picos de Europa 
mountains.

Sandy beaches are outnumbered by pebbly ones in Croatia, but the car-free 
island of Lopud, a 40-minute ferry ride from Dubrovnik, is the exception. 
Locals ferry visitors in golf buggies from the port to Sunj beach, a 1km strip 
of sand sloping gently into limpid, shallow waters on the island’s south coast. 
There are two restaurants, both of which rent deck chairs and beach umbrellas, 
and a choice of activities from beach volleyball to tennis.

With its ochre sand and deep blue sea, Ramla Bay on Gozo is one of Malta’s 
most enticing spots. Facilities are minimal – toilets, showers, a couple of 
cafes, an ice-cream van, umbrellas and deck chairs, a statue of the Virgin Mary 
– but that’s all part of the charm. Don’t forget to bring your snorkelling 
gear; the sea life and water clarity are up there with the best in the Med.

Menorca has some of the most family-friendly beaches in the Med but they are 
often busy in July and August. To escape the crowds, head to Es Grau on the 
island’s quieter north-east coast. This horseshoe-shaped beach is a popular day 
trip for residents of the capital Mahon but the absence of any hotels has kept 
things pleasantly low-key. The tranquil bay with a natural, undeveloped 
backdrop, is like a vast, shallow paddling pool and you can hire kayaks and 
paddleboards from local operatorMenorca en Kayak <http://menorcaenkayak.com/>. 
From the beach it’s a short stroll into the village which has a handful of 
family-run restaurants and gift shops.
• Owners Direct <https://www.ownersdirect.co.uk/rentals/spain/es-grau/r2361> 
has several local villas close to the beach, from £520 for cottage sleeping four
• Accommodation prices for family beaches stated are for July-August peak 
season

It seems invidious to choose only one Pembrokeshire beach – Barafundle and 
Whitesands are both hard to resist – but Marloes is very special. The half-mile 
cliff walk puts the crowds off, and there are no facilities at all. Yet you 
have a mile of broad sweeping sand dotted with towering rocks that stand in 
large low-tide pools flickering with tiny fish and shrimps. The firm, flat sand 
is perfect for beach games or galloping horses (Snow White and the Huntsman was 
filmed there in 2011). There’s plenty here to keep the whole family amused, 
assuming they don’t regard amusement as something that comes in arcades. The 
south-facing aspect bodes well in summer, but check the tides and wind.

East and North Yorkshire have some tremendous coves and beaches, but Runswick, 
near Whitby, gives a concentrated dose of all that is on offer: superb views 
from the cliffs, then a sharp walk down via a tangle of cottages to a mile of 
beach that is mixed sand and shingle, with good cafes. Look out for fossils and 
jet, the two treasures of these parts, but if venturing beyond the beach under 
the cliffs, check the tide times. The Cleveland Way coastal path passes along 
the beach. As for the water temperature, locals say it’s fine, “once you’ve 
numbed up.”

Up a little cul-de-sac road from the A832 coastal road, this delightful 
sheltered sandy beach has great views across Gruinard Bay. The regulars have 
been keeping this place quiet for half a century, a task made easier by the 
croft campsite’s determination to remain simple – don’t expect hot showers, 
shops or any facilities. It’s a friendly, tranquil location perfect for a few 
days under canvas. There are other beaches to explore nearby, plus the renowned 
Inverewe Gardens, but the real pleasure is just to play on the beach or fish 
from the rocks either side.

Northumberland has several gorgeous expanses of sand backed by wonderful play 
areas, also known as dunes, but Bamburgh is the pick of the lot. Brooding over 
it is one of England’s finest castles, an impressive ring of towers and 
crenellations around a Norman keep. It’s a handy back-up for days when the 
weather turns nasty. Nearby are the Farne Islands, accessible via boat trips 
from Seahouses, a three-mile walk south, mostly along the sands. Surfers love 
the place, as do dog walkers, horse riders, anglers and kite fliers. There is 
so much space that one thing you will never find is crowds.

The far west of Cornwall is a land of stone circles and tiny coves. Superb 
tidal sands reach from Logan Rock to Porthcurno and form a vast sand bar that 
traps and warms seawater in shallow lagoons. There are rocks to dive from and 
you can wade or swim to several smaller coves. The beach is semi-naturist, and 
a tricky final descent over rocks keeps it wild and special. There is a tiny 
cafe in Treen village serving breakfast and local breads. On wet evenings you 
can hole up in the ancientLogan Rock Inn <http://www.theloganrockinn.co.uk/>.

Ilha do Mel, or Honey Island, is a car-free place where nothing happens in a 
hurry, though that’s not to say nothing happens at all. Mile after mile of 
gorgeous beach can be found up and down the island, some good for surfing, 
others for lounging and one or two for hiking. A decent trek from the main drag 
of hostels, bars and restaurant takes you to a well-preserved sea fort on the 
north-east shore that’s great for photos. It’s perhaps best to go there on the 
first day while you still have some energy – Ilha do Mel has a helluva party 
scene.

On the east side of the Malay peninsula lies Tioman, one of south-east Asia’s 
more tranquil islands. It doesn’t attract as many Singha-and-mushroom-fuelled 
backpackers as its Thai cousins, but if you want a hammock and a chance to 
relax, this is the place to be. The beaches are clean and the snorkelling top 
class, with gear available from hostels and shops just back from the shore. In 
the evenings, barbecues and low-key parties break out along the beach.

With more than 7,000 islands and more than 22,000 miles of coast, the 
Philippines is not short of great beaches, but there aren’t many better than 
Sabang on western Palawan. El Nido in the north gets thousands of visitors 
through the year, but further south the wilder, emptier Sabang is the 
definition of a tropical beach. Towards the village, colourful (and noisy)banca 
boats take tourists to the handful of resorts, but head round the peninsula to 
the north and a pristine shore awaits. Not far from there, you’ll find 
mangroves and, with a guide, the sensationalPuerto Princesa Subterranean River

When you think of Kyoto you understandably think of a busy city, shrines and 
temples, but the name applies to the entire prefecture that has borders that 
stretch all the way to the Japan Sea. It’s there you’ll find the sensational 
Amanohashidate, the “bridge to Heaven”. This two-mile-long sandbar is covered 
in pine trees and has been revered for centuries. Most visitors walk across, 
then take a funicular up a hill on the far side, but stray from the path and 
you’ll have the beaches to yourself, with crystal-clear waters gently lapping 
on golden sands, nudging pine cones down the coast.

Puerto Ayora, the largest and most populous town in the Galapagos, is a fairly 
charmless place, but it’s also just a 20-minute walk from Tortuga Bay, one of 
the world’s very best beaches. Follow a path out of town, past bushes filled 
with Darwin’s finches and lava lizards scuttling across rocks and you emerge on 
to talcum powder sand. The rough water is great for surfing, but a challenge 
for swimmers, so instead take in the pelicans, marine iguanas and the feeling 
that you’re first to discover this amazing place.

You could almost pick any beach off the ocean side of Vancouver Island, but 
Chesterman has the edge. It’s the kind of place where you might see kids 
pedalling along barefoot with a surfboard under one arm. With a bit of luck, 
and keen eyesight, you might spot orcas out beyond the breakers. Easier to find 
is the Carving Shed, where local craftsmen turn out exquisite sculptures and 
traditional canoes. At low tide a sandspit, the Tombolo, gets you out to Frank 
Island, with great views back to the beach.
• The Wickaninnish Inn <http://www.wickinn.com/> at the north end of the beach 
is famous, with summer prices to match (from £260). Or Chesterman Beach B&B

You might roam the globe for years and never find better beaches than those of 
the Scottish western isles, and none of them would ever be crowded. Gigha has 
its fans, Harris too, but real lovers of solitude should try this one on the 
island of Ceann Ear in the small group known as the Monachs, eight miles off 
the coast of North Uist. The soulful songs of the seal colony will haunt your 
trek across the white sands – that is assuming you can get there: there are no 
ferries, no flights, no people. A boat is first requirement. Fortunately
Hebridean Cruises 
<http://www.hebridescruises.co.uk/cruising-area/monach-islands> does take in 
the Monachs on several of its voyages, spending a night offshore and ferrying 
guests ashore to wander around the beaches and explore crofts that were finally 
abandoned in the 1930s.
• A 10-day remote island tour with Hebrides Cruises 
<http://www.hebridescruises.co.uk/cruises/far-flung-islands-mingulay-shiants> 
costs from £1,895pp all-inclusive

A four-day kayak paddle will get you to Nemto from Nusa Island 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/08/papua-new-guinea-kayaking-holiday>
 off the north coast of New Ireland, 600 miles east of Papua New Guinea. It is 
an astonishing journey, taking in fine beaches, sunken second world war planes 
and pristine reefs. But Nemto is the big treat: an island with the population 
of two, surrounded by white sands shadowed by palms that cackle with parrots. 
The reason this island is untouched lies with local superstitions about strange 
beasts that inhabit the interior. And if that sounds like King Kong and it 
means nobody comes near the place, all the better.

A single-file tunnel through the mountain takes you to Jagodna Bay, a 
different world from the swankier east side of Hvar, where those rare migrants, 
billionaires with good taste, hang out. Near Kamp Lili, a tightly packed but 
friendly campsite, a footpath leads to a beach barely bigger than a tennis 
court. It is, however, a jewel: clear water with plenty of fish, rocks to dive 
off and swim out to, and other coves to explore further along the coast. Above 
the beach, in the pines, there is a small restaurant-bar.

A private yacht would be handy for getting here. Failing that, take the weekly 
flight from Fiji’s capital, Suva, to this craggy, elongated pinch of paradise. 
There are a few gorgeous sandy stretches, and if another visitor appears, you’d 
be very surprised. The population is just 1,200 and, in a good year, they get 
about two dozen visitors. Picnic on the sand, snorkel on magnificent reefs 
where sea shells the size of Bluebeard’s treasure chest gape up at the rays and 
sea snakes. As you’d expect, local cuisine relies on seafood, including a giant 
crab that cracks coconuts as if they were hazelnuts.

Each December, surfers compete for the coveted Pipeline Masters surf title. 
All the action takes place in cavernous barrelling waves that come close to 
shore. Oahu’s north coast also sees the world’s best big-wave competition: the
Quiksilver Big Wave Invitational 
<http://quiksilver.co.uk/surf/events/eddie-aikau/>, in memory of local surfer 
Eddie Aikau. It’s held only when the waves are more than six metres high. 
There’s an opening ceremony on 1 December each year, but the actual contest has 
run just nine times in 31 years.

With its warm water and hazard-free beach bottom, Freights, on the south coast 
of Barbados, has some of the world’s best beginner-friendly waves, though 
clearly it will cost you a bit more to learn there than back home in Croyde. 
When the swell hits, the long peeling, left-hand waves break at under a metre 
high, making it the ideal place to master surfing along the open face of a wave 
rather than straightlining back to the beach. The vibe is super-chilled, with 
friendly locals and some of the world’s best rum punch.

the big blue, a three-kilometre swim along the Jurassic coast is the perfect 
test. It’s a Unesco heritage site and offers one of the most picturesque 
tidally assisted swims in the world.

Although set within a nature reserve, this small haven of sun and sand comes 
with a soundtrack of gently thudding bass drums, because it is licensed to 
party until just after sunset. As the sun dips towards the horizon, bikini-clad 
dancers mingle with sunbathers on the ticklishly soft sand. (Those in search of 
something quieter will be happy to know that the secret beaches of Punta de Ses 
Portes are a short stroll along a footpath from the far end of the beach.) For 
an afternoon of classic, bouncy house, try Melon Bomb DJs’ secret parties at

Pristine water, jaw-dropping scenery, intermediate waves and no crowds. This 
is a typical day at Hoddevik beach in Norway’s Fjordlands, which is still 
tantalisingly under the radar. A friendly local surf camp run by champion 
snowboarder JP Solberg offers guiding, all-in accommodation and board hire. Is 
it cold? Take three degrees off Cornwall’s water and air temperature and you’ll 
be about right.

Rio is home to two of the world’s most famous beaches 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/mar/04/going-dotty-on-the-beaches-of-brazil-in-pictures>
 but Copacabana’s star has long since faded. Ipanema-Leblon is the place to be, 
for beach culture and nightlife. Arpoador, the easternmost tip, ends in a rocky 
headland offering stunning views of the whole length of Ipanema to the Dois 
Irmãos mountain at the west. A favourite spot with surfers, bodyboarders and 
families by day, it is lit up at night, so perfect for a moonlit dip in Rio’s 
sweltering summers. It also has one the best places in Rio for a sundowner. Ina 
city with so many great beaches and bars

players, but it really comes into its own at dusk. It’s then that Vancouverites 
stroll in to sit on the huge blanched logs that wash up here and gaze out at

Stanley Park are within easy reach, and it’s a prime spot for watching the

One of the world’s best city beaches, Durban has everything going for it: a 
whacking great sweep of sand, cafes, art deco architecture, street life and, in 
season (June-November), a strong possibility of sighting whales and dolphins as 
they feast on migrating sardines. (You’ll also spot locals filling buckets with 
the fish.) There is also top-notch surf and, even if you don’t tackle it, the 
views from the piers of the experts in action are inspirational. The 2010 
football World Cup led to a big clean-up along the beachfront, reviving the 
area’s fortunes. These days it’s an absolute gem.

Margate’s golden sands have long attracted holidaying Londoners. Now that 
vintage pleasure parkDreamland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/24/dreamland-margate-kent-fairground-theme-park>
 has reopened right next to the beach, there is even more fun to be had. The 
kitsch, retro-themed park, with heritage rides such as 1930s caterpillars, 
1940s carousels, 1970s chair-o-planes and the UK’s oldest roller coaster, marks 
its first anniversary on 18 June by hosting Dreamland Sound Clash, billed as 
the “Notting Hill Carnival, but with a Margate Twist”. Rides aside, Margate’s 
beach, sea and skies inspired more than 100 of JMW Turner’s paintings. The 
Turner Contemporary opened in 2011 on the seafront, on the site of the 
guesthouse the artist stayed in when he visited, and new hotels, shops, bars 
and restaurants have also sprung up.

Barcelona’s not really a city of big parks, so most locals use the beach as a 
playground. Barceloneta beach is right in the centre but often packed with city 
dwellers, tourists and blokes selling tat. Do what the locals do and jump on a 
train heading up the coast. The beach in the almost-suburb of Ocata is more 
than a kilometre of golden sand. It’s also famous for its chiringuitos (beach 
bars) selling delicious salads, tapas, homemade burgers and more.
