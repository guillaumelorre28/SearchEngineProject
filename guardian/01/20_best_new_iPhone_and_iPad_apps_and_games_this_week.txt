APPS

Loopimal (£2.49) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/loopimal-by-yatatoy/id964743113?mt=8>
As ways to get your children into music-making go, Loopimal is one of the most 
creative and fun apps around. It’s a colourful mini-sequencer where children 
drag shapes onto a looping timeline to create sounds, accompanied by dancing 
animals. Simply marvellous.
iPhone / iPad


Alexi (Free) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/alexi/id995309486?mt=8>
Everyone and their Spotify-playlisting aunt is banging on about “curation” in 
2015. Alexi applies the idea to books, with its own team and special guests – 
authors including David Mitchell, Sarah Hall and Bret Easton Ellis – creating 
themed lists of books for you to swipe through in search of new reading 
material. What’s missing (for now) is a direct way to buy them. But there are 
bookshops for that...
iPhone


Detour (Free + IAP) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/detour/id886455839?mt=8>
If you’re looking for an app to get you out and about looking at the real 
world, Detour is well worth a look. It’s a collection of “audio walks” that has 
just gone global – initially a guided tour of San Francisco haunts, it now 
includes walks for London, Berlin, Barcelona, Paris and Marrakech, sold as 
in-app purchases.
iPhone


Relook (£2.99) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/relook/id990928352?mt=8>
You’re spotty and ugly! But Relook can make you beautiful. Is the message I’m 
taking from this clever photography app, which “enhances natural beauty” by 
editing out your grease, wrinkles and pimples, as well as plumping up your 
eyelashes and putting a sparkle in your eyes. Sadly, no filter for ‘British 
teeth’ yet…
iPhone / iPad


The Pink Panther (£2.29) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id997283009?mt=8>
De-dum de-dum. De-dum. De-dum de-dum de-dum de-dum DA-DAAAAAH. De-dum-dum-dum. 
The Pink Panther theme tune is iconic (albeit slightly less-so written down), 
and this is an interesting idea: a sheet-music app to help you learn to play it 
on the piano, slowing down the pace if necessary.
iPad


Sago Mini Boats (£2.29) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id971329287?mt=8>
A good week for iOS-owning parents, with Sago Mini Boats the second playful 
app for kids. Launched by developer Sago Sago, this has a nautical theme as a 
dog named Harvey sets sail in a range of boats and ships, meeting friends as he 
goes. With no goals, it’s relaxing pre-school fun.
iPhone / iPad


Vee for Video (£1.49 + IAP) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/vee-for-video/id994113588?mt=8>
There are (probably) more apps for shooting and sharing video now than there 
are professional broadcast camera operators. Vee is the latest looking to help 
people tell their stories, with slick editing features, filters and the ability 
to upload to social services in the background.
iPhone / iPad


Machinima (Free) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/machinima/id323165885?mt=8>
Machinima is one of the popular multi-channel networks finding an audience on 
YouTube. Now it’s doing it through an app too: obviously it serves up the 
company’s videos – mainly focused on gaming – but comments and community are 
also big features, along with the ability to share your own videos, images and 
GIFs.
iPhone


Ramadan Legacy (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ramadan-legacy/id991358750?mt=8>
Muslims are preparing for the month of Ramadan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/17/eight-apps-muslims-observing-ramadan>
, which begins on Wednesday. Here’s a new app that aims to be a companion for 
the annual event: a mixture of planning, information and social tools to 
complement the month ahead.
iPhone / iPad


WantList (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/app/wantlist-fashion-discovery/id489554189?mt=8>
Previously known as Styloko, this relaunched app is all about fashion – and 
specifically, shopping for it. The latest app to take a leaf out of Tinder’s 
book with its “swipe left to reject and swipe right to approve” interface, it 
serves up an array of products to tempt your wallet.
iPhone / iPad

GAMES

Tiki Taka Soccer (Free + IAP) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tiki-taka-soccer/id866690975?mt=8>
If you, like me, grew up on the Sensible Soccer games, Tiki Taka Soccer’s 
pixelly graphics will give you a bolt of nostalgia. Thankfully, this is a 
worthy successor in gameplay too: an inventive touchscreen football game with 
light management features. AND you can share replays of your hoofs from the 
halfway line into the top corner onto social networks...
iPhone / iPad


You Must Build a Boat (£2.29) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/you-must-build-a-boat/id811397653?mt=8>
There’s a lot of buzz building around You Must Build a Boat, and justifiably 
so: it’s brilliant. A sequel to the fun 10000000, yes it does involve building 
a boat – but also battling monsters, recruiting a crew and wielding magic by 
matching tiles – with no in-app purchases in sight.
iPhone / iPad


Fallout Shelter (Free + IAP) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fallout-shelter/id991153141?mt=8>
Console game Fallout 4 is coming later this year, and a lot of people are very 
excited about it. To fill the months until then, Fallout Shelter is an 
intriguing mobile strategy game – a bit like an underground Tiny Tower, set in 
the world of Fallout. It’s freemium, but not aggressively cash-grabbing.
iPhone / iPad


Hitman: Sniper (£3.99 + IAP) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hitman-sniper/id904278510?mt=8>
This is the latest game based on the Hitman console brand: and unsurprisingly, 
it’s all about the long-range shooting. There are more than 150 missions to 
snipe through, bagging new rifles as you go. A neat companion to the excellent 
Hitman Go game.
iPhone / iPad


Transistor (£7.99) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/transistor/id948857526?mt=8>
Originally released in 2014 for PC and PS4, Transistor is a beautifully 
crafted action-RPG with a science fiction theme, as you battle your way through 
a futuristic city. It looks lovely, as on other platforms, but there’s real 
depth of gameplay and story here too.
iPhone / iPad


Angry Birds Fight! (Free + IAP) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/angry-birds-fight!/id933958078?mt=8>
The latest freemium Angry Birds game takes its cues from mobile hits like 
Puzzle & Dragons and Best Fiends, as you match birds in the bottom half of the 
screen to battle enemies at the top. It may sound cynical, but actually this is 
good fun.
iPhone / iPad


AlphaBetty Saga (Free + IAP) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id814434907?mt=8>
Saga? Yes, this is the latest from Candy Crush publisher King, and as the rest 
of its title implies, this is a word game. Your job is to link letter-tiles to 
make words as you work through more than 100 levels – with the familiar system 
of boosters and in-app purchases for when you get stuck.
iPhone / iPad


Terminator Genisys: Revolution (Free + IAP) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/terminator-genisys-revolution/id958680034?mt=8>
Glu Mobile has had a huge hit with its Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game, but now 
it’s turning its attention to another aspect of Hollywood: killer robots from 
the future. This tie-in to the new Terminator film is an entertaining, 
guns-blazing third-person shooter.
iPhone / iPad


Robbery Bob 2: Double Trouble (£2.29 + IAP) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/robbery-bob-2-double-trouble/id981819100?mt=8>
The original Robbery Bob was a clever mix of action and strategy, as you snuck 
around a bunch of houses trying to burgle them without being caught. This 
sequel is just as fun: 60 new levels and lots of new gadgets to help you avoid 
the long arm of the law (or the sharp teeth of the dog).
iPhone / iPad


Battles of the Ancient World III (£2.29) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/battles-ancient-world-iii/id988445574?mt=8>
Finally, something fun for hardcore wargame fans out there. This turn-based 
hex title eschews the usual wars in favour of conflicts between 1457 BC and 378 
AD – think chariots and legionaries – as you strategise your way through 
campaigns for hours on end.
iPhone / iPad
