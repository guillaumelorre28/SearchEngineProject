What is your app called and what does it do?

It's called the Red Bull Racing Spy 
<http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/red-bull-racing-spy/id504350767?mt=8> app and 
it tells Formula One fans about what's going on behind the scenes in the 
world's premier motorsport series.

What devices is it on, and what are your plans?

Currently it's on iPads and iPhones but fear not Android fans, we have plans 
to bring you your own version very shortly.

What's the business model and why have you chosen it?

It's pretty much a combination of James Hunt meets Loose Women. Fast living 
and highly educated opinion meets glamour and fast cars.

What's innovative about the app – what sets it apart?

We have the usual F1 fare: lap times, results, championship standings, 
calendar… but also a whole load of gossip and insider information about people 
who have run away with the circus we like to call 'The F1 Paddock'.

What's the competition – who else is out there in this area?

There are lots of apps including the official Formula 1 timing app which tell 
the tale of what happens on the track, we like to think we're the only one 
which goes to races but doesn't actually concentrate on the racing.

What are your future plans for the app?

The Android version is a bit of a priority as is uncovering salacious gossip. 
I'm joking. Just giving the fans the best insight we can.

Tell us more about the company behind it…

It's a collaboration between Red Bull UK and the current Formula One world 
champions Red Bull Racing. It was made by Holler and our friends at theRed Bull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/red-bull> Media House also lent a hand. But 
basically it was the Spy's doing. Who is he? It's a secret, but he's also on 
Twitter (@redbullf1spy).
