Great Britain maintained their successful start in Group I of the Fed Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/fed-cup> Euro/Africa Zone when Judy Murray's 
team followed Wednesday's 3-0 defeat of Portugal with a 2-1 victory over the 
Netherlands in Eilat, Israel.

Anne Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> lost the 
opening match 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3 to Bibiane Schoofs but Elena Baltacha 
levelled the contest with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Michaella Krajicek. Laura 
Robson and Heather Watson capped the comeback with a 7-5, 7-6 (7-5) doubles 
success over Kiki Bertens and Schoofs.

Murray said: "I am absolutely delighted and very, very proud of them. It was a 
fantastic day. It was a tough match for Anne first up. It was very windy and 
very tricky against an opponent who was playing very well.

"She was very close and there wasn't very much in that one at all, and going 
into the second singles one down, "Bally" really rose to the occasion.

"She is a true No1. She knew she had to go out and get the job done and she 
just went out and blitzed it. She was tactically perfect and fought her heart 
out, which she always does.

"And then our kids went straight in there against an experienced Dutch pair 
who play very good doubles and they whooped them. They came from behind in both 
sets and I'm absolutely delighted."

Great Britain face Israel in their third and final group match on Friday 
afternoon, seeking the win which will make sure they finish top of their pool 
and earn them a place in Saturday's promotion play-offs.
