Night time politics

It has been such a long rollercoaster day that it is hard to think about the 
sum of the day’s news. But here goes:

 * Turnbull cabinet secretary Arthur Sinodinos had a message for Cory 
Bernardi, that is the prime minister “loves all members of the Liberal party”. 
This was designed to rein in and reassure the South Australian senator. 
Sinodinos delivered the message because Malcolm Turnbull was too busy loving 
Queensland independent Bob Katter. They met in Brisbane and Turnbull emerged 
with a verbal agreement that Katter would support supply if it were necessary. 
This was in return for an as yet nebulous list of demands perhaps involving the 
Hell’s Gate dam, Indigenous land title, and Galilee rail project (think 
Carmichael mine). Standard and Poor’s rating agency put Australia’s credit 
outlook on the watch list, which is the step towards negative if you don’t pull 
your socks up. Treasurer Scott Morrison used it to tell the new parliament, 
whoever they may be, we need to get our budget through. Which sounded like he 
had not listened to the recent election. I think it is back to the drawing 
board for ScoMo.

 * Bill Shorten continued his victory lap, this time in Perth. He will hold a 
party room meeting tomorrow where the Labor party will officially open 
nominations for seven days for a leadership spill. (These are the rules Kevin 
Rudd insisted on.) Since Anthony Albanese ruled out his inclusion, Shorten’s 
return to the leadership should be a formality. But never say never.

 * John Howard came out to defend his legacy after the Chilcot report 
comprehensively pulled apart the reasons for the US, UK and Australian invasion 
of Iraq. He, not surprisingly, disagreed with Chilcot’s findings. We believed 
the intelligence at the time, he said. But Andrew Wilkie, former intelligence 
officer and now independent MP begged to differ. He said John Howard and 
Alexander Downer should be held accountable and argued Howard, Tony Blair and 
George W Bush should be before an international court. Howard just said meh. 
The Greens will introduce a bill to try to give the parliament power to make 
the decision to go to war, rather than the executive government.

 * Peter Dutton, king of talkback, offered the sage election analysis that the 
Coalition was the “victim of its own success” – given they had stopped the 
boats etc. 
That’s it from me. Thanks to the brains trust, Katharine Murphy, Gareth 
Hutchens, Paul Karp, Ben Raue and Nick Evershed.

Bridie Jabour will be with you tomorrow and depending on the electoral lay of 
the land, I may see you back with #politicslive next week.

Goodnight.

A new ReachTel poll has found that 65% of voters hope to see more investment 
in renewable energy from the new government.


Even a majority of Nationals (65.5%) and Liberal (50.4%) voters supported 
investment in renewable energy.

GetUp environmental justice campaign director, Sam Regester, said renewable 
energy is not a partisan issue, it’s just a popular one.


“This election global warming deniers and blockers like Andrew Nikolic, Jamie 
Briggs and Peter Dutton have either lost their seats or suffered huge swings 
against them,” Regester said.

“If Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> hadn’t sought to 
cut a billion dollars from renewables, he may not have lost as many voters as 
he did at the recent election.”

Ben Raue

There’s some interesting, if not VERY EARLY, movements in the Tasmanian Senate 
vote. I will letBen Raue explain from his post on his Tally Room blog 
<http://www.tallyroom.com.au/29758>. 

Here is Ben: 

There is a lot of below-the-line votes reporting for Lisa Singh and Richard 
Colbeck, who have the potential to be the first candidates to win seats off the 
back of below-the-line votes, potentially defeating their party’s preselected 
ticket. This data also suggests that Labor and the Greens may only get six 
seats, whereas the party totals suggest seven.

We are now, slowly, starting to see a few polling booths processed, so that 
informal votes have been correctly assessed and below-the-line votes are 
assigned to the individual candidate. I’ll look at Tasmania both because there 
are only five seats to examine, and because of the talk around major party 
candidates Lisa Singh and Richard Colbeck overcoming their unwinnable ticket 
position on the back of below-the-line votes.

I should stress that this sample is very small – we only have the divisional 
office pre-poll from three out of five seats, and one of the special hospital 
booths from each of these three seats. We’re talking about 1,000 votes out of a 
total of 280,000. I’ll repeat this exercise in coming days to see if it stands.

Firstly – the informal rate drops from 4.7% for the rest of the state to 1.6% 
in these booths.

Secondly, Lisa Singh and Richard Colbeck appear to be getting enough 
below-the-line votes to have a chance of overtaking their party order. Singh is 
currently polling 12.2% of the total Labor vote, and Colbeck is polling 11.5% 
of the total Liberal vote. As a comparison, in 2013 no candidate on either 
major party ticket polled over 5% of the party’s vote in Tasmania. It’s also 
the case that the vast majority of below-the-line votes usually go to the 
party’s lead candidate, yet Singh is polling 2.4 times the vote of the Labor 
lead candidate, and Colbeck is polling 1.6 times the vote of the Liberal lead 
candidate.

If you assume this proportion of the vote stays for the rest of the count, 
Singh would poll 0.54 quotas in her own right, with the rest of the Labor 
ticket polling just under 4 quotas. If this is the case there would be no votes 
left for Labor No 5 candidate John Short, and Singh would have a good chance of 
winning the seat, and would be the beneficiary of any Labor above-the-line 
preferences.

If we do the same exercise for Colbeck, he would poll 0.474 quotas, and the 
rest of the ticket would poll 3.65 quotas. This could possibly lead to both the 
fourth Liberal (Bushby) and Colbeck to win seats, possibly at the expense of 
either Singh or Greens second candidateNick McKim.

Shorten says the S&P statement is a vote of no confidence in Turnbull and 
Morrison:

The fact that the ratings agencies are putting our credit rating on negative 
watch, it shows that the last three years, this country has stood still. In 
many ways the rating agency’s decision to put the triple A credit rating on a 
negative watch is a vote of no confidence in Mr Turnbull, in Mr Morrison and 
the way they have been handling the strained economy. The fact that they are 
relying upon measures that will never pass parliament shows that the ratings 
agency think this country has not been well run.

Labor is not ruling out a full inquiry into the Iraq invasion.

I think it does highlight for Mr Howard as the prime minister of the time took 
us to war that he needs to answer questions, if we went to war on the basis of 
errors of information ... Labor is not ruling out a full inquiry, we will 
consider our position carefully.

<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party>, compared with the 
Coalition.

I couldn’t ask for any more support than I have received.

Bill Shorten, who has toured his new seats in Western Australia, is doing a 
presser in Perth. A reminder of Turnbull’s description of independents.

I’m sure Turnbull is eating his words when he said that the independents – he 
called them, dysfunctional, unstable, chaotic and I think he attackedNick 
Xenophon <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/nick-xenophon> as a loner.

Bob Katter has also raised the issue of land title for Indigenous owners in 
his talks with Turnbull. That is, to address the problem that Indigenous 
communities cannot get freehold title over land. This was his answer.

There is no guarantees, there’s no quid pro quo, there is no written 
agreements here and there can’t be ... What I want to know is if I give you 
that backing, what is the intentions of your government or put it another way, 
what is the intentions of your government and I will decide what I’m going to 
do with my vote. I came away comfortable that there is very serious and real 
commitment.

(You understand my reluctance to be definitive on any deal.)

Malcolm Turnbull: these exciting times that remain exciting

 * Turnbull says it was a good and constructive decision with Katter. 

 * He says the S&P statement was a reminder of the need for budget repair. 

 * He remains confident of forming a majority. 

 * He maintains a commitment to surplus in four years. 
We will unite the nation in a common purpose to continue to ensure that we 
have strong economic growth, we continue successfully to transition from the 
mining construction boom that is in a manner that is fair and offers 
opportunities, strong opportunities for these very exciting times which remain 
exciting. Perhaps exciting [in] different ways but they are exciting. They are 
at times of opportunity, a great challenge, and S&P has reminded us that budget 
repair and responsibility for the public finances are critical.

It was a short statement. No questions.

It has been one hell of a day really and there are still lots of rats and mice 
to clean up. I promised to go back to theScott Morrison-Chris Bowen press 
conferences on Standard and Poor’s among other things.

The S&P statement basically downgraded the credit outlook – as opposed to the 
credit rating. It was putting everyone on notice. Get your house in order, so 
to speak.

Housing loans also got an honourable mention.

This is from the S&P statement:


That said, Australia’s high stock of external debt and structural current 
account deficits are mostly generated by the private sector and they reflect 
the productive investment opportunities available in Australia, foreign 
investor confidence in Australia’s rule of law, the high creditworthiness of 
its banking system and the positive yield available on highly rated debt.

A portion of Australia’s external debt has also funded a surge in unproductive 
household borrowing for housing during the 1990s and 2000s, which was 
intermediated by the banking sector.Household debt (including debt for small 
businesses) now stands at more than 180% of household income.

Morrison was asked about tax reforms, specifically relating to housing, given 
Labor had proposed changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts. 
He would not answer.

You’re raising issues of politics, not policy. The Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> wanted to increase 
taxes and that seemed to be popular. I dispute that for a start and I made 
comments on the election yesterday so I don’t intend to go over those again 
here today.

It has been such a long rollercoaster day that it is hard to think about the 
sum of the day’s news. But here goes:

 * Turnbull cabinet secretary Arthur Sinodinos had a message for Cory 
Bernardi, that is the prime minister “loves all members of the Liberal party”. 
This was designed to rein in and reassure the South Australian senator. 
Sinodinos delivered the message because Malcolm Turnbull was too busy loving 
Queensland independent Bob Katter. They met in Brisbane and Turnbull emerged 
with a verbal agreement that Katter would support supply if it were necessary. 
This was in return for an as yet nebulous list of demands perhaps involving the 
Hell’s Gate dam, Indigenous land title, and Galilee rail project (think 
Carmichael mine). Standard and Poor’s rating agency put Australia’s credit 
outlook on the watch list, which is the step towards negative if you don’t pull 
your socks up. Treasurer Scott Morrison used it to tell the new parliament, 
whoever they may be, we need to get our budget through. Which sounded like he 
had not listened to the recent election. I think it is back to the drawing 
board for ScoMo.

 * Bill Shorten continued his victory lap, this time in Perth. He will hold a 
party room meeting tomorrow where the Labor party will officially open 
nominations for seven days for a leadership spill. (These are the rules Kevin 
Rudd insisted on.) Since Anthony Albanese ruled out his inclusion, Shorten’s 
return to the leadership should be a formality. But never say never.

 * John Howard came out to defend his legacy after the Chilcot report 
comprehensively pulled apart the reasons for the US, UK and Australian invasion 
of Iraq. He, not surprisingly, disagreed with Chilcot’s findings. We believed 
the intelligence at the time, he said. But Andrew Wilkie, former intelligence 
officer and now independent MP begged to differ. He said John Howard and 
Alexander Downer should be held accountable and argued Howard, Tony Blair and 
George W Bush should be before an international court. Howard just said meh. 
The Greens will introduce a bill to try to give the parliament power to make 
the decision to go to war, rather than the executive government.

 * Peter Dutton, king of talkback, offered the sage election analysis that the 
Coalition was the “victim of its own success” – given they had stopped the 
boats etc. 
That’s it from me. Thanks to the brains trust, Katharine Murphy, Gareth 
Hutchens, Paul Karp, Ben Raue and Nick Evershed.

Bridie Jabour will be with you tomorrow and depending on the electoral lay of 
the land, I may see you back with #politicslive next week.

Goodnight. 
 
A new ReachTel poll has found that 65% of voters hope to see more investment 
in renewable energy from the new government.


Even a majority of Nationals (65.5%) and Liberal (50.4%) voters supported 
investment in renewable energy.

GetUp environmental justice campaign director, Sam Regester, said renewable 
energy is not a partisan issue, it’s just a popular one.


“This election global warming deniers and blockers like Andrew Nikolic, Jamie 
Briggs and Peter Dutton have either lost their seats or suffered huge swings 
against them,” Regester said.

“If Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> hadn’t sought to 
cut a billion dollars from renewables, he may not have lost as many voters as 
he did at the recent election.”
 
There’s some interesting, if not VERY EARLY, movements in the Tasmanian Senate 
vote. I will letBen Raue explain from his post on his Tally Room blog 
<http://www.tallyroom.com.au/29758>. 

Here is Ben: 

There is a lot of below-the-line votes reporting for Lisa Singh and Richard 
Colbeck, who have the potential to be the first candidates to win seats off the 
back of below-the-line votes, potentially defeating their party’s preselected 
ticket. This data also suggests that Labor and the Greens may only get six 
seats, whereas the party totals suggest seven.

We are now, slowly, starting to see a few polling booths processed, so that 
informal votes have been correctly assessed and below-the-line votes are 
assigned to the individual candidate. I’ll look at Tasmania both because there 
are only five seats to examine, and because of the talk around major party 
candidates Lisa Singh and Richard Colbeck overcoming their unwinnable ticket 
position on the back of below-the-line votes.

I should stress that this sample is very small – we only have the divisional 
office pre-poll from three out of five seats, and one of the special hospital 
booths from each of these three seats. We’re talking about 1,000 votes out of a 
total of 280,000. I’ll repeat this exercise in coming days to see if it stands.

Firstly – the informal rate drops from 4.7% for the rest of the state to 1.6% 
in these booths.

Secondly, Lisa Singh and Richard Colbeck appear to be getting enough 
below-the-line votes to have a chance of overtaking their party order. Singh is 
currently polling 12.2% of the total Labor vote, and Colbeck is polling 11.5% 
of the total Liberal vote. As a comparison, in 2013 no candidate on either 
major party ticket polled over 5% of the party’s vote in Tasmania. It’s also 
the case that the vast majority of below-the-line votes usually go to the 
party’s lead candidate, yet Singh is polling 2.4 times the vote of the Labor 
lead candidate, and Colbeck is polling 1.6 times the vote of the Liberal lead 
candidate.

If you assume this proportion of the vote stays for the rest of the count, 
Singh would poll 0.54 quotas in her own right, with the rest of the Labor 
ticket polling just under 4 quotas. If this is the case there would be no votes 
left for Labor No 5 candidate John Short, and Singh would have a good chance of 
winning the seat, and would be the beneficiary of any Labor above-the-line 
preferences.

If we do the same exercise for Colbeck, he would poll 0.474 quotas, and the 
rest of the ticket would poll 3.65 quotas. This could possibly lead to both the 
fourth Liberal (Bushby) and Colbeck to win seats, possibly at the expense of 
either Singh or Greens second candidateNick McKim.
 
Shorten says the S&P statement is a vote of no confidence in Turnbull and 
Morrison:

The fact that the ratings agencies are putting our credit rating on negative 
watch, it shows that the last three years, this country has stood still. In 
many ways the rating agency’s decision to put the triple A credit rating on a 
negative watch is a vote of no confidence in Mr Turnbull, in Mr Morrison and 
the way they have been handling the strained economy. The fact that they are 
relying upon measures that will never pass parliament shows that the ratings 
agency think this country has not been well run.
 
I think it does highlight for Mr Howard as the prime minister of the time took 
us to war that he needs to answer questions, if we went to war on the basis of 
errors of information ... Labor is not ruling out a full inquiry, we will 
consider our position carefully.
 
Shorten says he is confident of Labor candidate Anne Aly winning the seat of 
Cowan.

He is pleased at the unity in the Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party>, compared with the 
Coalition.

I couldn’t ask for any more support than I have received.
 
Bill Shorten, who has toured his new seats in Western Australia, is doing a 
presser in Perth. A reminder of Turnbull’s description of independents.

I’m sure Turnbull is eating his words when he said that the independents – he 
called them, dysfunctional, unstable, chaotic and I think he attackedNick 
Xenophon <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/nick-xenophon> as a loner. 

 
Bob Katter has also raised the issue of land title for Indigenous owners in 
his talks with Turnbull. That is, to address the problem that Indigenous 
communities cannot get freehold title over land. This was his answer.

There is no guarantees, there’s no quid pro quo, there is no written 
agreements here and there can’t be ... What I want to know is if I give you 
that backing, what is the intentions of your government or put it another way, 
what is the intentions of your government and I will decide what I’m going to 
do with my vote. I came away comfortable that there is very serious and real 
commitment.

(You understand my reluctance to be definitive on any deal.)

 * Turnbull says it was a good and constructive decision with Katter. 

 * He says the S&P statement was a reminder of the need for budget repair. 

 * He remains confident of forming a majority. 

 * He maintains a commitment to surplus in four years. 
We will unite the nation in a common purpose to continue to ensure that we 
have strong economic growth, we continue successfully to transition from the 
mining construction boom that is in a manner that is fair and offers 
opportunities, strong opportunities for these very exciting times which remain 
exciting. Perhaps exciting [in] different ways but they are exciting. They are 
at times of opportunity, a great challenge, and S&P has reminded us that budget 
repair and responsibility for the public finances are critical.

It was a short statement. No questions.
 
It has been one hell of a day really and there are still lots of rats and mice 
to clean up. I promised to go back to theScott Morrison-Chris Bowen press 
conferences on Standard and Poor’s among other things.

The S&P statement basically downgraded the credit outlook – as opposed to the 
credit rating. It was putting everyone on notice. Get your house in order, so 
to speak.

Housing loans also got an honourable mention.

This is from the S&P statement:


That said, Australia’s high stock of external debt and structural current 
account deficits are mostly generated by the private sector and they reflect 
the productive investment opportunities available in Australia, foreign 
investor confidence in Australia’s rule of law, the high creditworthiness of 
its banking system and the positive yield available on highly rated debt.

A portion of Australia’s external debt has also funded a surge in unproductive 
household borrowing for housing during the 1990s and 2000s, which was 
intermediated by the banking sector.Household debt (including debt for small 
businesses) now stands at more than 180% of household income.

Morrison was asked about tax reforms, specifically relating to housing, given 
Labor had proposed changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts. 
He would not answer.

You’re raising issues of politics, not policy. The Labor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> wanted to increase 
taxes and that seemed to be popular. I dispute that for a start and I made 
comments on the election yesterday so I don’t intend to go over those again 
here today.
