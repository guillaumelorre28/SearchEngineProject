Bashar al-Assad’s London-based fixer, a businessman with technology interests 
called Soulieman Marouf, has held at least six luxury flats in London worth 
nearly £6m through British Virgin Islands (BVI) companies, the Panama Papers 
reveal.

As the civil war escalated, he carried out shopping errands for the Syrian 
president’s London-educated wife, Asma. In March 2012, the Guardianpublished a 
series of leaked emails

 in which Asma placed orders with Marouf for goods worth thousands of pounds 
from Armani and Harrods.

Marouf used offshore companies to hold a portfolio of London homes, including 
a £1m riverfront luxury flat in St George Wharf in Vauxhall, a £1.2m apartment 
at the Norman Foster-designed Albion Riverside building in Battersea, and a 
£1.3m home in St John’s Wood. Using offshore companies to hold property can 
lawfully cut tax bills. Until recently, such structures were exempt from stamp 
duty and capital gains taxes for non-UK residents.

In October 2012, Marouf’s assets were frozen in Europe. The sanctions

The freezing order meant Marouf could not sell or otherwise deal with his 
London flats without first obtaining a licence. His lawyer said licences were 
“obtained when required” from the Treasury.

Most of the restrictions were short-lived. With backing from William Hague, 
then foreign secretary, his name was removed from the European Union blacklist 
in June 2014. Restrictions have since been lifted from Marouf’s properties.

He is still actively investing in UK property. The latest files show that 
since September 2014 he has registered two new companies in the BVI, both named 
after London addresses: 59 Regent Court Investments Limited and 7A Regents Gate 
Limited. In November 2014, Marouf’s offshore company acquired a flat at 59 
Regent Court in St John’s Wood for £500,000.

A lawyer for Marouf said: “There are a number of reasons for utilising 
offshore companies, including the desire for privacy. Full disclosure has been 
given to [the] Treasury and/or HMRC [Revenue & Customs] and the UK tax 
authorities have acknowledge that these companies are compliant with UK tax 
laws. The UK authorities are fully aware that our client is the beneficial 
owner of these companies.”
