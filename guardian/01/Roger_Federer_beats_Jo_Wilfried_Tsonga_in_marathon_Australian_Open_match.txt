Roger Federer fended off a tough challenge from the Frenchman Jo-Wilfried 
Tsonga <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jo-wilfried-tsonga> to prevail 7-6, 
4-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3 in the Rod Laver Arena and reach the semi-finals of the 
Australian Open on Wednesday.

Tsonga unleashed a barrage of brilliant shots to level the match at two sets 
apiece but the Swiss was composure personified as he captured the decisive 
break at 2-1 in the fifth.

Battling for survival, Tsonga saved four match points when serving to stay in 
the match but Federer closed out the match on the fifth with an overhead smash, 
qualifying for his 10th straight semi-final at Melbourne Park.

Federer will play Andy Murray for a place in the final as he continues his bid 
for an 18th grand slam title and fifth at Melbourne Park.
