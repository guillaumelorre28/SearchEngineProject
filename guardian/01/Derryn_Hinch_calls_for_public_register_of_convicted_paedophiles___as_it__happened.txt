Night-time politics

 * Well it has been quite some first speech by the Justice party senator 
Derryn Hinch. Having said he would not use parliamentary privilege to behave 
like a cowboy, he named convicted paedophiles and sex offenders to call for a 
national register of sex offenders. He gave a passionate address defending free 
speech while denouncing Islamic terrorism, domestic violence, genital 
mutilation and live exports. It was a clear sign that Hinch will continue to 
act inside the parliament exactly the same way as he has outside the 
parliament. Watch out.

 * The Coalition has revealed its cost-benefit analysis of moving the 
Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) to the deputy 
prime minister’s electorate of New England has itself cost $272,000. Joyce had 
earlier suggested he would not release the analysis but the treasurer, Scott 
Morrison, said it would be up for cabinet consideration tonight.

 * In question time Labor attacked Malcolm Turnbull’s record in the prime 
ministership while the Coalition attacked Bill Shorten’s handling of the Sam 
Dastyari affair.

 * Two sides of the Liberal party argued over marriage equality, specifically 
whether the “yes” and “no” cases should be funded. After a number of church 
representatives suggested Turnbull offered to fund the cases, conservatives 
tried to push the PM into funding the cases. At the same time, Labor and the 
crossbenchers brought marriage equality private member’s bills before the 
parliament.

 * The auditor general reported to Labor that he had reviewed the public 
information relating to the Liberal software company Parakeelia and there was 
nothing to see here. It was not an audit, just a review, though we did find out 
Parakeelia had loaned $200,000 to the party to help with a cash flow problem. 
They need to pay it back this financial year. Federal director Tony Nutt said 
considering the finding, Bill Shorten and frontbencher Brendan O’Connor should 
withdraw their statements and apologise to the Liberal party. 
That’ll do pig. One day down. Three more sitting days to go. Thanks to the 
brains trustKatharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens. Mike Bowers, take 
a bow.

Thank you for your company. Tomorrow we have party room meetings and more 
first speeches.

I’m Gabrielle Chan and that’s life. Goodnight.

Hinch has been hurried up by the Senate president, Stephen Parry. It’s a 
20-minute speech and you have taken 45 minutes.

Hinch finishes the speech with his old sign off:

Derryn Hinch is giving his first speech. The Human Headline is speaking to the 
Senate, noting he had been sacked 16 times.

They hire me because of what I say and they fire me because of what I say, he 
says.

I won’t be PC – politically correct.

I’ve spent half a century as a journalist trying to keep the bastard honest. 

Hinch says if it is necessary to name “human vermin” who abuse children, he 
will name them. He names two offenders already.

Leyonhjelm: 'I’ve never known a straight guy yet that hasn’t discriminated 
against ugly girlfriends'

Paul Karp

Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm has been grilled on Sky News about 
his proposed marriage equality bill, which would allow florists and bakers and 
others to refuse to provide goods and services to gay weddings. The other bills 
only allow ministers of religion to refuse to conduct gay weddings.


Leyonhjelm said he was in favour of discrimination law where it prevented a 
publican from refusing to serve a beer to an Aboriginal person.

Asked what the difference was, Leyonhjelm said: 

We generally distinguish between discrimination on the basis of who you want 
to marry, which is a sort of lower level.

He said refusing to provide services to a gay wedding was a “substantially 
lower order” than discrimination based on race – because you’re born with your 
race but “you’re not born with the desire to get married to someone of the same 
gender”.


The difference was between “material discrimination and nice not to do 
discrimination”.

I’ve never known a straight guy yet that hasn’t discriminated against ugly 
girlfriends – we all discriminate, it’s part of life. The question is where we 
impose the law in that. Discrimination is normal, it is what we all do as human 
beings.

 * Well it has been quite some first speech by the Justice party senator 
Derryn Hinch. Having said he would not use parliamentary privilege to behave 
like a cowboy, he named convicted paedophiles and sex offenders to call for a 
national register of sex offenders. He gave a passionate address defending free 
speech while denouncing Islamic terrorism, domestic violence, genital 
mutilation and live exports. It was a clear sign that Hinch will continue to 
act inside the parliament exactly the same way as he has outside the 
parliament. Watch out.

 * The Coalition has revealed its cost-benefit analysis of moving the 
Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) to the deputy 
prime minister’s electorate of New England has itself cost $272,000. Joyce had 
earlier suggested he would not release the analysis but the treasurer, Scott 
Morrison, said it would be up for cabinet consideration tonight.

 * In question time Labor attacked Malcolm Turnbull’s record in the prime 
ministership while the Coalition attacked Bill Shorten’s handling of the Sam 
Dastyari affair.

 * Two sides of the Liberal party argued over marriage equality, specifically 
whether the “yes” and “no” cases should be funded. After a number of church 
representatives suggested Turnbull offered to fund the cases, conservatives 
tried to push the PM into funding the cases. At the same time, Labor and the 
crossbenchers brought marriage equality private member’s bills before the 
parliament.

 * The auditor general reported to Labor that he had reviewed the public 
information relating to the Liberal software company Parakeelia and there was 
nothing to see here. It was not an audit, just a review, though we did find out 
Parakeelia had loaned $200,000 to the party to help with a cash flow problem. 
They need to pay it back this financial year. Federal director Tony Nutt said 
considering the finding, Bill Shorten and frontbencher Brendan O’Connor should 
withdraw their statements and apologise to the Liberal party. 
That’ll do pig. One day down. Three more sitting days to go. Thanks to the

Thank you for your company. Tomorrow we have party room meetings and more 
first speeches.

I’m Gabrielle Chan and that’s life. Goodnight.

Hinch has been hurried up by the Senate president, Stephen Parry. It’s a 
20-minute speech and you have taken 45 minutes.

Hinch finishes the speech with his old sign off: 

I’m Derryn Hinch and that’s life. Goodnight.
 
Hinch talks about justice for Indigenous people and is critical of the white 
and Indigenous people who have ripped them off. He names the former head of the 
former body the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (Atsic) Geoff 
Clark.

Hinch also decries genital mutilation and Islamic terrorism. Now he is on to 
freedom of speech. We are covering a lot of ground here. Stay tuned. He is 
doing a press conference straight after.
 
Hinch praises the New South Wales premier, Mike Baird, for his greyhound ban 
and hopes it spreads nationwide.
 
The public has a right to know. Parents who are trying to protect their kids 
have a right to know.

Hinch says a national public register should be called Daniel’s law, after 
13-year-oldDaniel Morcombe who was killed 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-21/brett-peter-cowan-appeal-verdict-on-daniel-morcombe-killing/6484394>
.

Hinch says he will continue to work to ban for live exports. It described it 
as “money for morality”. He says he took his first petition on live export to 
Canberra in 1981.
 
Hinch calls on the parliament to pass euthanasia “dying with dignity” 
legislation.

He moves on to his call for a public register for convicted sex offenders. His 
“walk for justice” was the start of the Justice party.
 
Hinch was diagnosed with terminal cancer and had a liver transplant. He says 
he would have been dead five years ago. Hinch met his donor’s family and 
thanked them and the surgical team which performed the operation.
 
Hinch wants to change the rules to allow photographers into the Senate more 
often, will continue to campaign for better justice for child sex offenders, he 
will work to change the organ donation rules to make it easier (he received 
one) and the speech continues ...
 
Derryn Hinch is giving his first speech. The Human Headline is speaking to the 
Senate, noting he had been sacked 16 times.

They hire me because of what I say and they fire me because of what I say, he 
says.

I won’t be PC – politically correct.

I’ve spent half a century as a journalist trying to keep the bastard honest. 

Hinch says if it is necessary to name “human vermin” who abuse children, he 
will name them. He names two offenders already.
 
Josh Wilson, new MP for Fremantle, is giving his first speech too. He is 
tearing up, asAnne Aly did.
