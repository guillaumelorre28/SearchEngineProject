Elena Baltacha and Anne Keothavong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> will represent Great 
Britain at the Olympics in doubles as well as singles.

The pair were given wild-cards into the singles tournament last month, with 
Laura Robson and Heather Watson entered in the doubles, but an injury to 
Romania's Monica Niculescu has forced her to withdraw along with her partner 
Irina-Camelia Begu.

The International Tennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Federation 
have given the place to Baltacha and Keothavong, both of whom have been 
stalwarts for Britain's Fed Cup team for years.

The host nation will also have two pairs in the men's doubles, with Andy 
Murray and Jamie Murray, and Colin Fleming and Ross Hutchins, earning places on 
their rankings, while Andy Murray will be the sole representative in the 
singles.

The mixed doubles entries will be decided when the players sign in for the 
tournament, which begins at Wimbledon on 28 July.

Niculescu has also been forced to withdraw from the singles and has been 
replaced by Hungary's Timea Babos.
