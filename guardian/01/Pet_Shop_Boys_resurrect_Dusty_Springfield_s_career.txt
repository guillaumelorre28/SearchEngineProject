The Smiths were the first to collaborate with an iconic 60s female singer – 
Sandie Shaw – but the Pet Shop Boys struck gold by hooking up with arguably the 
most revered vocalist of her generation –Dusty Springfield 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/dusty-springfield>. Their single together, 
What Have I Done to Deserve This?, was a win-win situation: the band got kudos 
for enticing Springfield into recording what was the classiest record the PSB 
ever made, her career got a new lease of life, and it reached No 2.
