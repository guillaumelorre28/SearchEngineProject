It is almost four decades since Armistead Maupin's much-loved Tales of the City
 <http://www.armisteadmaupin.com/BooksTOTC.html> saga began its life as a 
newspaper serial in the San Francisco Chronicle.

In a rare visit to London, Maupin will talk to John Mullan about the very 
first novel in the series. San Francisco, 1976. Mary Ann Singleton, a naïve 
young secretary from Cleveland, Ohio, moves into an apartment on 28 Barbary 
Lane. Through her friendship with a rich cast of characters, including 
eccentric marijuana-growing landlady, Anna Madrigal and quiet young gay man 
Michael Tolliver (known as Mouse), Maupin's sparkling comedy chronicles Mary 
Ann's adventures in 70s San Francisco.

The ninth Tales of the City novel, The Days of Anna Madrigal 
<http://www.transworldbooks.co.uk/editions/the-days-of-anna-madrigal/9780857521286>
, will be published in January 2014.
