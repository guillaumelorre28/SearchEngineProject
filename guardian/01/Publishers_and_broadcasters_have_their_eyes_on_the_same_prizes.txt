One quote – much praised last week by Denise Turner, the gloriously titled 
director of insight for Newsworks, the national newspaper marketer – looks set 
to spark much discussion throughout the autumn. It came fromAlan Rusbridger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/alanrusbridger> as he stepped down from 20 
years ofGuardian editorship for a quieter life in non-Augean Oxford. “We still 
tell stories in text and pictures,” he said, “but the words are as likely to be 
in the form of live blogs as stories. We have learned to use moving pictures as 
well as stills. We work in interactives, data, graphics and any combination of 
the above. We distribute our journalism across multiple channels, platforms and 
devices, including live discussion and debate. We’re on the iWatch; we’re in 
bed with Facebook; we’re still in the corner shop.”

A crisp, clean summation, with a problem attached. If newspapers are this 
dynamic, innovative, and future-obsessed (and many of them are), much of the 
ground they seek to possess already seems to belong to broadcasters - such as 
the BBC, of course, pushing out from its studio past. Two swirling, whirling 
concepts set for a clash? You might suppose that Fleet Street was the aggressor 
here; or Broadcasting House. It’s much fairer, and sensible, to think about 
peace treaties, not mutually assured destruction.
