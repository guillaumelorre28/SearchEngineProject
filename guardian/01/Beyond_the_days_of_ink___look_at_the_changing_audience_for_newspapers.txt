Here's an interesting exercise - a graphic compiled by Will Sturgeon on The 
Media Blog - that attempts to showthe changing audience for British national 
newspapers. 
<http://themediablog.typepad.com/the-media-blog/2011/05/media-readers-twitter-social-infographic.html>

It combines ABC print sales figures (coloured grey) with ABCe online user 
figures (light blue) plus the numbers of social media fans and followers of 
named publication accounts (dark blue).

As Sturgeon readily concedes, it's only a snapshot. But it is revealing all 
the same. Note, for example, theDaily Mail's enormous reach in print and online 
compared to a relatively small social media (Facebook and Twitter) following.

The Guardian, by contrast, has almost as many social media fans and followers 
as it has daily visitors to its website. Its reach is, arguably, more 
penetrating.

So, says Sturgeon, compared to the Mail's runaway success The Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian> is "clearly growing a smaller 
but arguably more loyal, more engaged and more focussed community of online 
readers (even if we assume a high number of its social media followers are 
lapsed or rarely active)."

He goes on to draw a further important distinction. The Guardian's online 
content reflects the same values as those of its print newspaper while the 
Mail's online content "has changed the brand values its traditional readers 
would associate with the paper in order to court the pure numbers the media's 
evolution can deliver."

He is kind enough not to point to The Times's  poor showing. Will its sister 
title,The Sun, really dare to go behind a paywall too?
