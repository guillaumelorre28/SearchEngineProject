The Reserve Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/reserve-bank-of-australia> has room 
to cut interest rates again if global investors continue to panic and the 
uncertainty sweeping financial markets hurts the Australian economy, governor 
Glenn Stevens has said.

As Australian shares fell again on Friday in the wake of more selling in 
Europe and the US overnight, Stevens said that continued low inflation meant 
the bank had the flexibility to ease rates further.

Speaking at a House of Representatives economics committee hearing in Sydney, 
Stevens said: “With inflation unlikely to cause a problem by being too high 
over the next year or two, the statement after the recent meeting indicted that 
the board retains the flexibility to ease further, should that be helpful.”

 Stevens said that investors were “dropping their bundle” and policy makers 
would have to wait to see how that plays out.

“One key question will be whether the recent financial turbulence itself will 
have a material negative effect on aggregate demand – in Australia or abroad,” 
he said.

“I don’t expect that we will be able to answer that question for a little 
while yet.”

The ASX/S&P200 fell more than 1% on Friday morning as the world’s markets 
continued to struggle against a wave of bearish sentiment.

It recovered by lunchtime to stand 0.38% lower, or 18 points down at 4,802 
points.

In Japan, where shares have been crushed since the central bank moved to 
negative interest rates last month, trading resumed after a public holiday on 
Thursday and immediately plunged again. The average was nearly 4% lower at 
lunchtime on Friday with investors unnerved by the rising yen, which has 
undermined government attempts to stimulate exports and inflation.

The FTSE 100 index in London lost more than 2% on Thursday and the Dow Jones 
was down 1.6% in New York as investors dumped stocks and sought the safe havens 
of the yen, gold and government bonds.

Banks and companies exposed to lower commodity prices were among the biggest 
losers in London. Falling oil prices also dragged the market lower with New 
York crude hitting a 13-year low of $26.34. Gold was the beneficiary, ticking 
up to a 12-month high of $1,235 an ounce.

Stevens told MPs that fears of a global recession were “overdone” and pointed 
to therecent strength in Australia’s labour market  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/strong-employment-figures-may-convince-rba-not-to-cut-interest-rates>
as a positive sign.

“If it turns out that the strength is just temporary, then the outlook is 
still for moderate growth, but no near-term acceleration.

“If, on the other hand, recent trends were to continue, the income gains 
coming from higher employment may start to feed into stronger demand growth, 
which would probably lead in due course to higher levels of investment.

“Alternatively, if demand growth were to be in areas that require relatively 
little capital to support the labour employed, then the apparent weakness in 
capital spending outside mining could be of less concern anyway.”

Stevens noted forecasters now expect a bit less growth in the global economy 
than they did a few months ago although expectations for Australia’s trading 
partner group remain for growth to be a bit below average.

Inflationary pressures around the world looked subdued and interest rates 
would still be very low, even if short-term rates moved up in the United 
States, he said.
