Harley Bird, 14, Tring, UK

An actor’s life is hard: it’s just one audition after another, and you have to 
grow a wall-thick skin to deal with all the rejection. For Bird, however, 
things went a little differently: she was signed to the Alphabet Kidz agency 
just before her sixth birthday and two weeks later beat hundreds of other young 
actors to land the lead role in a £1.4bn show.

She is the voice of Peppa Pig, the eponymous piglet who enjoys dressing up and 
jumping in muddy puddles. Bird, who in real life has two pet pigs (called, of 
course, Peppa and George), has now voicedPeppa Pig 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/peppa-pig> for eight years. Early on, 
she was too young to read the scripts, but that didn’t stop her winning a Bafta 
at nine.

The show, while simple in its format of five-minute episodes, has taken the 
world by storm and is now shown in 180 territories and broadcast in 40 
different languages. Not bad for a first role. Were there any clues that this 
one audition would lead to a starring role in a global franchise? Bird has said 
she doesn’t understand it herself. “I just auditioned and they said my voice 
matched. because it is quite husky.”

Some teens might be grossed out by a bowl of bananas starting to rot and 
attract flies; high school student Garimella came up with a potentially 
life-saving idea. The “flybot” – a tiny, flying robot that avoids obstacles by 
mimicking the way a fruit fly avoids threats and moving obstacles – could be 
used in search-and-rescue missions in dangerous environments, and went on to win
the Google Computer Science award in 2014 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PszuBGqLCew>. Garimella has since turned his 
hand to everything from robotic violin tuners to algorithms that could help 
doctors diagnose brain tumours.

When Banerjee turned his Lego bricks into a braille printer for the blind for 
a school science project, it wasn’t just the famous toy company that was 
singing the then 12-year-old’s praises. The product, which made computing more 
affordable for millions of visually impaired people, also caught the attention 
ofIntel 
<http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/boards-and-kits/intel-edison-boards.html>
, and the award-winningBraigo Labs <https://www.braigolabs.com> (an 
amalgamation of Lego and braille) was born. “He’s solving a real problem, and 
he wants to go off and disrupt an existing industry,” Edward Ross, director of 
inventor platforms at Intel, has said. “That’s really what it’s all about.”

While chatting with her friends on social media, this Saudi teen living in 
Germany realised there was no emoji to represent her, so she designed one. Now 
she’s campaigning to get it added to phones (it’s currently being considered by 
the Unicode Consortium). “In this day and age, representation is extremely 
important,” Alhumedhi said. “People want to be acknowledged. There are so many 
Muslim women in this world who wear the headscarf. It might seem trivial, but 
it’s different when you see yourself on the keyboard around the world.”

she spent the summer working on the till in a seafood shack (even if secret

This year, as South Africa suffered its worst drought since 1982, a 
Johannesburg schoolgirl came up with a potential solution. Nirghin found an 
orange peel mixture had better water-retaining properties than existing 
“super-absorbent polymers”, which are usually expensive and non-biodegradable.
Her invention

, which aims to help farmers save both money and crops, is made up of waste 
products from the juice manufacturing process, including discarded orange and 
avocado peel; it won Nirghin a $50,000 scholarship at the annualGoogle Science 
Fair <https://www.googlesciencefair.com/en/>.

Sick of being cooked “kid food” by his parents, McGarry took matters into his 
own hands with a little bit of help from The French Laundry Cookbook. By 11, he 
was hosting a supper club in his mum’s kitchen, cooking “progressive American 
cuisine”; at 15, he was charging $160 a head for his eight-course tasting menu. 
He has now taken up residency in New York espresso bar Kava, under the name 
Eureka, where his 16-course feasts are becoming the stuff of legend.

Gavin Grimm, 17, Virginia

Grimm didn’t plan to become the poster boy for a national fight for equal 
rights for transgender students, but when his school wouldn’t allow him to use 
the boys’ toilets, a long legal battle ensued. The result, now in the hands of 
the supreme court, could have implications for young trans people all over the 
US. “That I have the opportunity to ensure that, hopefully, fewer kids – or 
anybody – will have to go through this in the future makes me feel good,” Grimm 
said.

In 2015, Nithiyanandam won the Google Science Fair prize for developing a test 
to diagnose Alzheimer’s 10 years before any symptoms appear. An antibody is 
injected that then attaches to proteins present in the earliest stages of the 
disease; the injection contains fluorescent particles that can be picked up on 
a brain scan.

“This early diagnosis could help families prepare for the future and ensure 
that existing drugs are used to better effect,” Nithiyanandam explained. The 
Surrey schoolboy is now tackling the treatment of triple negative breast 
cancer, a rare form found in 15-20% of women with breast cancer. It doesn’t 
respond to drugs, and must be treated with a risky combination of surgery, 
radiation and chemotherapy. “Most cancers have receptors on their surface that 
bind to drugs like tamoxifen, but triple negative doesn’t,” Nithiyanandam 
explained. Working at home and in his school lab, he has found a way to block a 
protein that prevents those receptors from forming, thus turning this type of 
breast cancer into one that responds to drugs. “Science isn’t about your age, 
it’s about ideas,” he told Wired magazine.

Impossible Rush <http://impossiblerush.net/> (a colour-matching game) that was

success allowed him to secure just under $2m in funding from major Silicon 
Valley investors, move to Manhattan and launch his own startup,Flogg 
<https://flogg.com/>. He had noticed that friends were increasingly selling 
unwanted items to people they knew through Facebook, rather than to strangers 
on Gumtree or eBay. Yet Facebook “wasn’t really doing anything to look after 
their user experience”. So he created an app that allows users to buy and sell 
items through their Facebook connections with a swipe left or right;the Sydney

 Lewys Ball started his own YouTube channel. Photograph: Courtesy of Lewys Ball 
Ball was 14 when he became interested in beauty, but could only find makeup 
tutorial videos aimed at girls; finding what he wanted in Boots was an ordeal. 
“I was so embarrassed, I didn’t even look at shades and just picked the first 
products I had seen YouTubers talk about,” he said. So Ball decided to start 
his own YouTube channel, Looking For Lewys, with tutorials aimed primarily at 
men. By the time he was 16, he had had over 1.2m views; he now has more than 
115,000 subscribers. As well as makeup and fashion tips, Ball shares his 
favourite music, DIY projects and even anecdotes, in between revising for his 
A-levels.

Male beauty is having a major moment, and brands are waking up to it. Ball 
recently signed toGleam Futures <http://www.gleamfutures.com/>, the talent 
agency with clients such as YouTube megastarsJim Chapman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/27/vlogger-style-guru-jim-chapman>
 andZoella <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/zoe-sugg>; in the US, male 
beauty blogger James Charles was namedCoverGirl’s first CoverBoy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/11/covergirl-james-charles-first-cover-boy-makeup-artist>
 in October. “I think brands have realised that makeup isn’t just for girls,” 
Ball has said. “It’s for everyone.”

he has played for Scotland’s youth team this year, but has since been snatched

the strongest, youngest climbers of all time. Earlier this year, on a spring 
break to Japan a week before her 15th birthday, she was the first woman and 
youngest person ever to climb a V15 “boulder problem” (the V scale system

and gender politics. She has an African American mother, a Danish father, and 
identifies as non-binary, saying “the concept of gender is not really real”. In 
2015, she was named “one of the most incendiary voices of her generation” by 
Dazed magazine, 
<http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/25798/1/amandla-stenberg-the-new-agenda>
 and feminist of the year bythe Ms Foundation for Women 
<http://forwomen.org/feminist-celebrity/>.

Though Stenberg had been performing music since childhood, and appeared in 
feature films since 2010 (including a memorable performance as Rue inThe Hunger 
Games <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/16/hunger-games-review>), more 
recentlyshe has been making waves on social media 
<https://twitter.com/amandlastenberg?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author>
. She was just 16 when she posted a school project video,Don’t Cash Crop My 
Cornrows <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1KJRRSB_XA>, that promptly went 
viral. In it, she asked, “What would America be like if we loved black people 
as much as we love black culture?” Beyoncé invited her to appear onher visual 
album Lemonade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with>
, which was filmed in secret last year. “I just got this phone call,” Stenberg 
recalled. “It was like, ‘Go to New Orleans; Beyoncé wants you there.’” When 
Beyoncé met Stenberg, she said, “I just wanted to tell you, I want Blue Ivy 
[her daughter] to be just like you.” High praise indeed.
