In October 2015, the commission 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission> ordered the Netherlands 
to recover up to €30m (£26m) in taxes from the coffee shop chain. Because of 
favourable tax treatments available in the Netherlands, tax planners atStarbucks
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/war-of-words-eu-us-tax-avoidance-starbucks-apple-amazon>
 had been keen to ensure as much of the company’s income as possible was 
channelled through the country.

At the same time as the Starbucks decision, the commission told Luxembourg to 
recoup up to €30m from carmakerFiat <https://www.theguardian.com/business/fiat>
. Both cases involved the use of similar tax avoidance structures. Income from 
many other countries was shifted to the Netherlands and Luxembourg via 
interest, royalties and other intra-group payments.

Announcing the Fiat and Starbucks rulings, the European competition 
commissioner,Margrethe Vestager 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/margrethe-vestager>, said: “I hope that, 
with today’s decisions, this message will be heard by member state governments 
and companies alike. All companies – big or small, multinational or not – 
should pay their fair share of tax.”

arrangements. Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images 
In January this year, the commission told Belgium to recover around €700m from 
35 companies. According to reports, they included oil groupBP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/bp> and AB InBev 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/anheuser-busch>, the brewer behind the 
Stella Artois brand, due to their participation in a tax scheme that breached 
EU competition rules.

Belgium had introduced a scheme under which multinationals could reduce their 
corporate tax bases by up to 90%.

 Amazon’s tax deal with Luxembourg is under investigation. Photograph: Sarah 
Lee for the Guardian 
The commission is currently scrutinising Amazon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon>’s tax deal with Luxembourg. 
Brussels believes the 2003 deal could have allowed Amazon’s European 
headquarters to lock in a preferentially low tax rate, using a system of 
internal royalty payments. According to a Reuters report, Amazon could be 
ordered to repay €400m. However, the US company has said it does not receive 
preferential treatment from Luxembourg and is not based in the Grand Duchy 
solely for tax reasons, and it has more than 1,000 employees based there.

McDonald’s
 McDonald’s’ tax affairs need to be ‘looked at very carefully’, says Vestager.

In December, Vestager announced an investigation into a deal between 
McDonald’s and Luxembourg. She said the US fast food chain had not paid any 
corporate taxes in Luxembourg or the United States on royalties paid by 
franchisees inEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and Russia 
since 2009. She said: “A tax ruling that agrees to McDonald’s paying no tax on 
its European royalties either in Luxembourg or in the US has to be looked at 
very carefully under EU state aid rules. The purpose of double taxation 
treaties between countries is to avoid double taxation — not to justify double 
non-taxation.”

McDonald’s denied any wrongdoing, while Luxembourg said the fast food group 
had not received preferential treatment. As with theApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> ruling, the commission can rule 
that a tax arrangement constitutes illegal state aid if it has not been offered 
to other companies.
