Richmond, the former centre of Melbourne’s rag trade, filled with old 
warehouses and tiny workers cottages, wasn’t always a dining destination.

Good eating in Richmond tended to be thin on the ground with the exception of 
a few stalwarts like legendary gastro pubThe Grand 
<http://www.grandrichmond.com.au/>. 


But a swathe of new apartments, led by the redevelopment of the former 
Dimmey’s building, are bringinga new generation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/oct/10/top-10-budget-restaurants-melbourne>
 of diners to Richmond.

The discount clothes stores are shutting up shop and moving to suburban 
factory outlets making space for a culinary reinvention.

For restaurant owners, rents are cheaper than the CBD while the suburb is 
still close to the city and well served by public transport.

It helps that Richmond has always been the Switzerland of Melbourne. 

Those who live south side and refuse to travel too far north to eat will 
happily head to a restaurant in what is considered Melbourne’s neutral 
territory. If you’re north of the river Richmond isn’t too far by fixie. Here 
are the five top new restaurants that are part of Richmond’s restaurant 
renaissance.

Minamishima 

Japanophiles in Melbourne are smitten with the unassuming Minamishima which 
opened late last year. In the small and minimalist dining room you can order 
the omakase (chef’s choice) of chef and owner Koichi Minamishima. It doesn’t 
come cheaply at $150 a head for the 15 course menu but it’s worth it – 
particularly when you’re eating one of the world’s more unusual looking shell 
fishes, the geoduck and delectably fatty aburi otoro. It’s all about the 
quality of the seafood and the skilled knife work of Minamishima. The best 
seats are at the bar where you can watch Minamishima’s brilliance up close and 
personal.

Anchovy

Fusion food can be a dirty word but not in the hands of owner-chef Thi Le 
who’s serving up modern Asian Australian food at this Bridge Road restaurant. 
Le has a storied pedigree having worked at Cumulus and The Town Mouse and she’s 
hit the ground running at her first solo venture. Le’s food is fun and 
adventurous. Her Vietnamese-style blood pudding has already achieved the status 
of a cult dish with critics raving about the dense meaty treat which comes 
wrapped in cosberg lettuce and laced with pickled ginger and fresh herbs.

Mister Jennings

Chef and owner Ryan Flaherty is putting the mod back into Oz at Mister 
Jennings. Named after his favourite children’s author (Paul Jennings), Mister 
Jennings showcases Flaherty’s serious cooking skills honed via stints at The 
Fat Duck and more recently as the former co-owner of the Estelle. Flaherty’s 
food is experimental and brave but not fussy. Case in point is Mister Jenning’s 
signature frozen kangaroo. It’s made of spiced icy shavings of kangaroo that 
melt in your mouth changing temperature and texture at the same time. The roo 
is teamed with a wasabi and avocado puree for added kick and a glistening veal 
and red wine jelly. It’s a little like eating a science experiment, but a tasty 
one.

Kong BBQ 

Serial restauranteur Chris Lucas has an uncanny ability to know exactly what’s 
on trend and Kong ticks all the boxes. Kong is loud and constantly packed but 
still manages to serve up damn tasty Korean BBQ. Go for the kimchi which chef 
Benjamin Cooper makes in huge vats which ferment away for a year. You’ll also 
want to try the spicy pork belly enveloped in soft doughy buns with some 
slivers of pickled cucumber and a dousing of chilli. It’s no bookings so get in 
early or be prepared to wait.

Saint Urban

The newest addition to Richmond’s dining scene is a bistro from the team 
behind CBD veteran Punch Lane. The name plays homage to the patron saint of 
wine but there’s also beer on tap and a neat list of cocktails on offer. The 
food here is designed to go well with drinking. Think pork trotter croquettes 
with a crisp exterior, oozing as you bite into them and a classic Wagyu bavette.
