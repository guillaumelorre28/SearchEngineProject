The deluges of rain have brought out masses of earthworms, slugs and snails, 
making a bonanza for hungry hedgehogs as they snuffle around at night. But the 
downpours have also waterlogged many hedgehog nests, often made from piles of 
leaves and twigs that are prone to flooding.

The earthworms are making rich pickings for badgers, and indeed they are their 
favourite food. In fact, earthworms are surprisingly nutritious, full of 
protein as good as prime beef, with little fat and plenty of minerals, and 
badgers that eat lots of earthworms tend to be bigger and stronger than those 
that don't get many worms.

The recent bonanza of earthworms has come at just the right time to wean this 
year's cubs â€“ these were born in early February and stayed underground in their 
setts until late April, when the cubs start to be weaned.

But the badgers are also facing the threat of flooding of their setts in the 
rain, especially in burrows dug into river banks or near lakes and ponds.

The wind and rain has been a disaster for bees, butterflies and other winged 
insects, and so few are to be seen that it has left our native birds with 
little to feed on, just as they are nesting. Added to that, the chicks have 
been soaked in the rain or their nests blown out of trees by the winds. But if 
the weather improves, the fortunes for both insects and birds should get better.
