I’ve spent a lot of time with indigenous peoples in remote places. So when I 
argue that the best way – or at least the cheapest way – to stop climate change 
is to grant land rights to indigenous communities, you might suspect I’m not 
coming from an entirely objective viewpoint. You’ve probably also heard various 
industry spokespeople saying the best and cheapest way to stop climate change 
is through windfarms, solar panels, electric cars and cavity wall insulation. 
But while I may be biased, and may even have “gone native” now and then, I’m 
not trying to sell you anything.

From the Nile to the Amazon, climate change threatens hydropower

On a global scale, one of the main causes of climate change is land-use 
change, and particularly changing land from forest to agriculture.Stopping 
deforestation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/20/death-by-a-thousand-cuts-documentary-charts-the-dangers-of-deforestation>
 is the most economically efficient way of preventing carbon emissions because, 
in simple terms, all it amounts to is not flooding forests for dams or cutting 
down and burning them for agriculture.

The efficiency of not cutting down trees as a climate change mitigation 
strategy is fairly well-established. The UN is pushing the international 
community tocooperate on an agreed plan to stop deforestation and its 
associated emissions <http://www.un-redd.org/>, which add up to about the same 
level as road transport and haulage emissions.

But this is where a beautifully simple idea becomes complicated. How exactly 
do you stop deforestation? How do you compensate industries reliant on the 
agriculture that entails deforestation? And how do you compensate them in a way 
that doesn’t create perverse incentives and unforeseen consequences?

What is the value of a forest and the land it stands on? There’s the value of 
the timber it can produce, and after that, the crops that could be grown. Or 
the value of an Amazonian valley flooded for a hydroelectric dam.

Then there’s the forest’s value if we don’t chop it down. Its value as a 
carbon sink, its value as a biodiversity reservoir, its value as a weather 
maker and regulator, its value as a source of oxygen and air purifier. All the 
things that are invisible to accountants but vital to humans.

And forests also have a value that even environmental scientists can miss, but 
is very, very real to forest peoples. As the environmentalist David Suzuki 
says: “The way we see the world shapes the way we treat it. If a mountain is a 
deity, not a pile of ore; if a river is one of the veins of the land, not 
potential irrigation water; if a forest is a sacred grove, not timber; if other 
species are biological kin, not resources; or if the planet is our mother, not 
an opportunity – then we will treat each other with greater respect.”

This is why indigenous peoples are the forests’ greatest conservationists. 
They can cut through the Gordian knot of the UN’s interminable processes. They 
see and understand the value that enlightened, developed cultures are blind to, 
and which modern science is only beginning to rediscover.

Major Amazon dam opposed by tribes fails to get environmental licence

Translating that value into the hard currency we value is difficult. The World 
Resources Institute <http://www.wri.org/our-work/project/securing-rights> has 
taken a step in that direction, with a study of the environmental and economic 
costs and benefits of governments granting indigenous land rights in Brazil, 
Bolivia and Colombia. It reports that giving indigenous people land rights 
leads to the preservation of forests as carbon sinks. And, as a means of 
storing carbon, it is between five and 42 times more cost-efficient than 
fitting carbon capture and storage systems to fossil-fuel power stations.

If we are unwilling to spend money on protecting rainforests, their 
spectacular biodiversity, indigenous cultures, their ecosystems and their 
ineffable beauty and meaning, then we’ll have to spend a lot more sucking from 
the atmosphere what was once a rainforest, and burying it in the ground.

There is a test case going on right now in Brazil, home of the world’s biggest 
rainforest. The country’s official body for looking at indigenous people’s land 
rights,FUNAI <http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/funai>, is due to 
decide this month on whether to grant them to theMunduruku people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/major-amazon-dam-brazil-opposed-by-tribes-fails-get-environmental-license>
. They live in the Tapajos basin, an area in the heart of the Amazon being eyed 
up for the construction ofmore than 40 hugely destructive mega-dams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/15/brazil-giant-hydropower-dams-risk-destroying-amazon-greenpeace-tapajos-river>
.

The Munduruku can protect their bit of the Amazon for us, as they have done 
for centuries, preserving its amazingly varied flora and fauna and saving us 
the money we’d have to spend on taking carbon out of the atmosphere if industry 
is allowed turn it into carbon emissions.

The Munduruku have been campaigning for their rights for decades. The 
Brazilian constitution says they should be given them. A cold, hard, financial 
cost/benefit analysis says they should be given them. And if the Munduruku 
don’t get their land rights, there’s an industrial-scale queue of people 
waiting to trash their beautiful home. While many of us have yet to fully 
understand this, the truth is, their home is also our home.
