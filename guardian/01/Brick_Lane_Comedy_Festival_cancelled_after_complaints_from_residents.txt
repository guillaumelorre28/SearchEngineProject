A comedy festival due to feature Al Murray, Alan Davies and Ed Byrne  
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/mar/16/ed-byrne-what-i-see-in-mirror>
has been cancelled with less than month's notice after residents complained.

London's Brick Lane Comedy <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy> 
Festival had already been forced to relocate from the Old Royal Naval College 
in Greenwich, after four years at the venue, and subsequently lost funding from 
Greenwich council worth Â£15,000. Now, following protests from residents over 
proposals to host the festival in a park near Brick Lane, organisers have 
cancelled the event.

Other comedians previously announced for the festival, due to take place on 
10-14 July, included Adam Buxton, Edinburgh comedy award winner Tim Key and 
Peep Show star Isy Suttie

.

In a statement <http://www.bricklanecomedyfestival.co.uk/>, organiser Cass 
Biggs said this year's festival "has been burden by problems totally outside of 
our control".

"As you may know we were forced to leave our previous home in Greenwich with 
little time to find a new location. Due to this last minute relocation we had 
no choice but to go on sale while the licence application was taking place," 
explained Biggs.

"Despite the event having the full support of the borough [Tower Hamlets 
council], we ran into heavy opposition from local community groups and 
residents that have proved impossible to overcome in the limited time before 
the festival starts."

Biggs added that the organisers hope to revive the Greenwich Comedy Festival  
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/sep/06/tim-minchin-greenwich-comedy-festival-review>
 next year, in addition to planning another event in Tower Hamlets.

Ticket holders for this year's cancelled festival will receive a full refund.
