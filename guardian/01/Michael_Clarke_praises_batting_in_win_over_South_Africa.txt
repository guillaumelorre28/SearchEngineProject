Mitchell Johnson was named man of the match for Australia against South Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/16/michael-clarke-australia-south-africa-test>
 but Michael Clarke suggested plaudits should be shared around the team, 
praising some impressive batting performances at Centurion.

Shaun Marsh and Steve Smith shared in a 233-run partnership in the first 
innings after their side had slumped to 4-98, while David Warner and Alex 
Doolan put on 205 runs together in the second dig. They were both record stands 
at the venue for the fifth-wicket and second-wicket respectively.

Clarke noted Johnson was outstanding but that it could have been a very 
different Test had Marsh, Smith, Warner and Doolan not made substantial runs.

“Our batters deserve a lot of credit, being able to make the runs they did on 
quite a tough batting wicket,” Clarke said. “That was quite a nasty wicket, to 
be honest, and I would’ve hated to see any team having to bat on it on day 
five. So fortunately, a nice toss to lose.”

Opposing captain Graeme Smith <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/graeme-smith> 
admitted his indecision at the toss had been costly.

“I was very undecided on day one and, obviously in hindsight, I definitely 
would have made a different decision,” Smith said. “But I made a decision that 
the team felt was best in terms of what we knew of the wicket.”

Clarke praised the grit of Marsh and Doolan as fine examples of the side’s 
relentless attitude.

“Marsh walked out and batted in that second innings after scoring 148 in the 
first dig. He still started his innings [with caution] ... he wanted to make a 
big score and contribute,” he said. “Alex Doolan in that second innings, I 
don’t think he’ll play a tougher innings than that throughout his career.

“You’re playing against a fantastic bowling attack, the best attack that I’ve 
played against in my career, on a wicket that was going up and down. To be able 
to play like that on debut, he deserves a lot of credit.”
