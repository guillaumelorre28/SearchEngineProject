The first person to spot a clown, the patient zero in the current epidemic 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/us/creepy-clown-sightings-in-south-carolina-cause-a-frenzy.html>
 of threatening clowns sightings spreading across the US, was a little boy at a 
low-income apartment complex in Greenville, South Carolina.


He ran to his mother, Donna Arnold, and told her what he had seen: two clowns 
in the woods, both brightly dressed and made up. One with a red fright wig and 
the other with a black star painted on his face. They whispered something to 
the boy.

“They were trying to lure him to the house,” his mother told me, pointing 
toward the woods.

A path into the woods led down into a shaded hollow, at the bottom of which 
was a small pond. Beside it sat a house that seemed abandoned. Someone had 
boarded up the windows, and the balcony sagged. New bags of potting soil sat 
near the basement door, though. And a modern security system looked recently 
installed.

After sunset a car approached the house; a gleaming white, new-model Mercedes 
that looked as out of place as any clown car. The driver stepped out and said 
she had recently bought the old house as an investment because it sits on five 
acres in an otherwise densely populated area. “You think it looks bad now, you 
should have seen it before I came in,” she said.

While we talked she wore an in-ear headset, so it wasn’t always clear whether 
she was speaking to me or someone on her phone.

No, she didn’t want to give her name, she said. 

Yes, she had heard about the clown sightings. 

She gestured toward the apartment complex through the trees. “Every one of 
them has a phone, and can work it better than I can,” she said. “And yet 
there’s not a single video of a clown?”

I followed the path back to deliver the good news to Donna Arnold. The clowns 
weren’t real.

“Ha!” she said. One sharp stab of laughter. “Come around to the back.”

Her apartment backed up to the same patch of overgrown woods where the clowns 
had appeared. Arnold pointed to a dented spot in her door where the paint had 
recently been chipped away. “The clowns hit it with a chain,” she said, with 
complete conviction. “I saw them. They hit it and ran off into the woods just 
as I came out. They’re trying to scare us.”

From this patch of woods, the word of prowling clowns began to spread. On the 
other side of Greenville, first. Then down in South Carolina’s low country. 
Then North Carolina. Florida. Kentucky. Beyond the south to Pennsylvania, 
Wisconsin, New York.

And, finally, my little girl’s school.

Nobody laughs at clowns any more.

Maybe antiquated proto-clowns did make people smile. But the legendary Chinese 
jester Yu Sze and the imperial Roman stupidus would be unrecognizable to us 
today.

The first clown who fits our description – painted face, frilly collar – was 
Joseph Grimaldi, who entertained Londoners in the 19th century but had a 
decidedly dark side. “I am Grim-all-day,” he told people.

A young Charles Dickens ghost-wrote Grimaldi’s memoirs, a saga of abuse, 
addiction and agony. “A tale of unmitigated suffering, even when that suffering 
be mental, possesses but few attractions for the reader; but when, as in this 
case, a large portion of it is physical,” Dickens wrote, it “grows absolutely 
distasteful”.

Clowns hold up a mirror on society … to be afraid of them is ultimately to be 
afraid of yourself
David Kiser, Ringling Bros 
Dickens recognized, even with the very first modern clown, that what 
fascinates us is not the exaggerated painted face, or the dull face of a man 
underneath. It’s the tension between the two. The dissonance between what is 
and what appears to be.

That conflict plucks at some ancient strand of human genetic code. 

“Since caveman days, people would smear ashes on their faces to make each 
other laugh,” said David Kiser, a talent recruiter for Ringling Bros circus 
company. “Other times they would smear ashes on their faces to scare each 
other.”

I recently received an automated call from my daughter’s school, in Fairhope, 
Alabama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama>. It was intended to calm 
parents, but the missing details spoke more sharply than the ones included.

“Hi, this is Fairhope middle school calling with an important message,” the 
cheerful voice began. “Please rest assured that your students are safe and the 
school is taking necessary precautions due to rumored activity. The school 
perimeter is secured and the police are on campus.”

The call was meant to prevent worried parents from calling the school.

I called. The woman who answered hesitated to describe what had happened.

“Well, it’s …” she said. “It’s the clowns.”

Apparently the alarm had started in a neighboring county, where two schools 
had gone into lockdown after disturbing threats from someone calling himself 
Flomo Klown.

Flomo had a Facebook page. The profile picture showed a balding clown with 
red, stringy hair and a rubber nose. His shirt was drenched in blood. His bio 
read simply, “I kill people for a living.”

Flomo made posts targeting a specific town – Flomaton, Alabama – along with 
more gory clown photos and little gun and knife emojis.

People, in a word, flipped out. 

“I rebuke this evil in the NAME of JESUS!!!! YOU are from the Pits of Hell!” a 
local woman wrote on Flomo’s page. “Everyone let us pray as believers over this 
act of evil against us.” She immediately followed through by writing a lengthy, 
heartfelt, terrified Facebook prayer.

Some people appealed to heaven. Some speculated on the best ammunition to 
bring down a clown. Some advocated restraint – maybe just paint balls? – and 
others reached for .45-caliber pistols.

All of it might seem silly but something about the arched eyebrows and garish 
smile skipped a signal right to the base of people’s brains.

They had lost all capacity for critical thought.

People in Flomaton don’t go in for subtext. Their town sits on the 
Florida-Alabama state line, so they named it after “Florida” and “Alabama” and 
“town”.

Long ago it served as a railroad hub for timber, but its population has since 
dwindled to 1,400 people who work at Flomaton high school, Wadkins autos or the 
old train museum. People are polite. Most attend one of several churches. And, 
it turns out, they don’t tolerate blood-soaked clowns.

After Flomo’s scary posts, police locked down the schools and swept classrooms 
for clown-related evidence.

Within minutes the fear spread to other schools, particularly middle schools, 
where kids were old enough to access social media but still young enough to 
hyperventilate over clowns.

The picture showed a clown with red, stringy hair and a rubber nose … His bio 
read, 'I kill people for a living'

Sociologist Robert Bartholomew at Botany College in New Zealand has studied 
mass hysteria for decades, and said the current clown scare is a result of two 
rising forces in the US: social media, and a fear of otherness, whether it 
arrives in a white Mercedes or a refugee boat.

“Social media plays a pivotal role in spreading these rumor-panics which 
travel around the globe in the blink of an eye,” he said. “They are part of a 
greater moral panic about the fear of strangers and terrorists in an 
increasingly urban, impersonal, and unpredictable world.”

That afternoon back in my town, Fairhope, students sprinted through the 
hallways from one classroom to the next. In class they stared at cellphones and 
traded stories about how Flomo Klown had killed two boys in Flomaton, and was 
now moving from school to school.

“Good grief,” teacher Kendra Small said. “Please save me from being trapped in 
a school with middle schoolers who aresure that clowns are coming to get them.”

It started as a satisfying teenage drama, but spiraled into something serious 
enough to warrant calling the police to make sure the “perimeter is secured”.

Later, I showed my 13-year-old daughter a picture of a young woman.

“Who is this?” she said.

Police say that’s Flomo Klown, I told her. Her real name is Makayla Smith, 
she’s 22, and police in Flomaton arrested her and two juveniles for allegedly 
making “terroristic threats” as Flomo.

My daughter studied the photo with forensic intensity, almost touching it with 
her nose. “But she seems like a normal person,” she said.

The man who answered the door at Smith’s last known address said he didn’t 
know her, and Smith is banned from using any internet-capable electronics while 
she’s on bond. Her friends didn’t respond to requests for help reaching her. 
But her Facebook page outlines clearly enough a life beginning to spin.

In September she posted a picture of a positive pregnancy test, and a block of 
enigmatic text:


“Well everyone I have some news to announce, it’s scary yet exciting. It looks 
like around May 2017 I’ll have a little one of my own. Reason I say it’s scary 
is because of what happened in 2011 after that I really thought I couldn’t have 
anymore. I’m so nervous about this but I will be taking things day by day. 
Please don’t judge or say anything out of the way.”

Two days later she allegedly created the Flomo Klown persona and posted, “I 
love kids.”

Reports of scary clowns have come and gone every few years. This time, though, 
the rumors seem to have reached such a velocity that they have escaped the 
orbit of imagination and landed in real life.

In Kentucky, police recently arrested a 20-year-old man hiding in a ditch, 
wearing a clown costume. Police in Virginia arrested two teens for wearing 
clown outfits and chasing children. Meanwhile police in Winston-Salem, North 
Carolina, arrested a man for falsely claiming he had seen a clown trying to 
lure children and chased it into the woods. He had made it all up, he told 
police.

It’s a tough moment for clowns. But David Kiser, Ringling Bros’ clown expert, 
said they will never disappear completely.

“They will have to evolve,” he said. “But clowns hold up a mirror on society, 
so we can see the absurd in ourselves. So to be afraid of them is ultimately to 
be afraid of yourself.”
