Newspapers <https://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers> and magazines with 
apps on the iPhone and iPad will soon be able to report traffic figures 
alongside print and website figures.

The Audit Bureau of Circulations, which reports the audience figures of most 
of the UK's national and regional media, began measuring smartphone app 
activity on 1 May – a sign of the booming importance of mobile publishing.

All of the UK's major national newspapers have iPhone apps, with most also 
having a product for the iPad. On Thursday, the Daily Telegraphlaunched an 
updated iPad app

using Apple's strict subscription scheme.

It is not clear how many publishers have signed up to the scheme, or how many 
intend to report app traffic on a monthly basis, alongside website and print 
statistics.

ABC will measure how many "unique devices" – like unique users, but one user 
might mean more than one device – access the app, page impressions, the average 
duration of app visits, as well as ad impressions requested by each device.

Most national newspapers report their print circulation and website traffic 
monthly, although News International titles – the Times, Sunday Times, Sun and 
News of the World – pulled out last year ahead of launching website paywalls. 
Magazines report their circulation on a half-yearly basis.

ABC in the US began measuring iPad apps alongside regular magazine editions in 
March last year
