Channel 4’s feature-film-making arm Film4 Productions has scored an 
unprecedented 15 Oscar nominations across six movies, including a best picture 
nod for Room, six nominations for Carol, and a best actress nod forCharlotte 
Rampling <https://www.theguardian.com/film/charlotte-rampling> in 45 Years.

Carol, the lesbian romance adapted from Patricia Highsmith’s The Price of Salt 
and starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, was the best-performing of Film4’s 
list, earning acting nominations for Blanchett and Mara (as best actress and 
best supporting actress respectively) as well as costume design, original 
score, cinematography, and adapted screenplay for Phyllis Nagy. Surprisingly, 
however,Carol <https://www.theguardian.com/film/carol> received neither a best 
picture nomination, nor one for its director Todd Haynes.

 Carol - video review 
Room, the kidnap drama inspired by the Fritzl case and adapted from Emma 
Donoghue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/31/room-author-emma-donoghue-situation-horrible-but-story-not>
’s bestselling novel, picked up four nominations: picture, actress for Brie 
Larson, director for Lenny Abrahamson and adapted screenplay for Donoghue.

Both these films have been heavily tipped for awards, as has Amy, the Asif 
Kapadia-directed study of musician Amy Winehouse, which duly collected a best 
documentary Oscar nomination to add to its Bafta nomination in the same 
category. The Oscars have also righted what many commentators felt was amajor 
oversight from the British Academy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jan/08/baftas-nominations-2016-reaction-snubs-charlotte-rampling-tom-courtenay>
 by nominating Rampling for best actress for her superbly understated 
performance in the Andrew Haigh-directed marital drama45 Years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/45-years>. 

More surprising, perhaps, was the recognition for sci-fi fable Ex Machina, 
which scored a best original screenplay nomination for its writer-directorAlex 
Garland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/11/alex-garland-ex-machina-interview-the-beach-28-days-later>
, as well as best visual effects for a story that revolved around a digitally 
altered Alicia Vikander playing a robot called Ava. Youth, directed by Italian 
film-maker Paolo Sorrentino, also received a nomination for best song, for 
music written by David Lang. Youth features Michael Caine as a composer who 
resists overtures from the royal family to conduct a birthday concert for 
Prince Philip.

 Ex Machina - video review 
David Kosse, the recently appointed director of Film4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/04/universal-david-kosse-film4-director>
 said: “Fifteen nominations ... is an amazing validation of our belief in the 
potential of these bold, inspirational stories ... I am delighted to see so 
many of our friends and partners honoured today.” Kosse took over Film4 in 2014 
from Tessa Ross, who had become head of Film4 in 2003.

Film4’s triumph is all the more remarkable because of its dismantling and 
near-closure in 2002 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jul/12/2002inreview.artsfeatures>, as 
well as its existence as a standalone unit being put in doubt by its parent 
company. However, under Ross’s leadership it survived and thrived, with its 
marque gracing such award-winning films as 127 Hours, The Iron Lady and 12 
Years a Slave.

The Oscars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars> ceremony takes place on 
28 February at the Dolby theatre, Los Angeles.
