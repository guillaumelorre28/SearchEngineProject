Did you recognise your date?
Yes, he was lurking by the entrance and I guessed he was my date. He had 
disappeared by the time I parked my car, so I thought he had done a runner when 
he saw me. He hadn't.
First impressions? He's very Italian.
What did you talk about? His romantic love life. His new house and kitchen. 
Depression, marriage, divorce and fungi.
Any awkward moments? I felt pretty idiotic when I arrived.
Good table manners? Impeccable. Lovely old-fashioned courtesy all round.
Best thing about him? His lovely old-fashioned courtesy and confidence 
with waiters over food.
Did you go on somewhere? Nope. Both too busy.
Marks out of 10?
I wouldn't dream of giving any human being marks out of 10 on two hours' 
acquaintance.
Would you meet again? Highly unlikely. I think he prefers a younger model.

Antonio Carluccio <http://www.antonio-carluccio.com/>, 73

Chef and author of 13 cookery books, he is former director of the Carluccio's 
<http://www.carluccios.com/> chain of delis and restaurants and continues to 
work with the team on development. He has been single for two years.

Did you recognise her? Yes, I recognised her immediately.
First impressions? Well, I knew her from performing, but not very well. We'd 
never met before. But I knew what she was about and thought she's lovely. I 
could see she is really a great woman.
What did you talk about? Different things: about me, about her, about 
depression, about a lot of things. We knew a little bit of each other and we 
covered a range.
Any awkward moments? No, not at all. 
Good table manners?
Oh yes, yes, yes. She's lovely. A dame.
Best thing about her? Her sophisticated simplicity.
Did you go on somewhere? No, she had to rush away to some appointment. She's 
very busy. She told me all that she does, and it's remarkable.
Marks out of 10? 9. It was very, very nice meeting her.
Will you meet again?
Oh yes. Not to lead to anything special, but as good friends probably. She's 
invited me to see the show she is in.
