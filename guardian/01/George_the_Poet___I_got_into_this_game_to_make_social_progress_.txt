In his peppy new track What do You Reckon?, George the Poet outlines some of 
the unlikely victories of his life so far. Often they came at times when he 
didn’t have the blessing of the people closest to him: family, friends, school 
teachers. They span from his early verse-writing days in St Raphael’s Estate, 
in Harlesden, London – back when he was just plain George Mpanga – to the quads 
of the University of Cambridge, where he’d make a new name for himself on the 
spoken word scene.

Tell me about your first week at Cambridge. 
I was just excited, man. It was my first day at Hogwarts. Everyone was 
fresh-faced and nervous, but I got really stuck in. A lot of moments I remember 
and cherish were performance-related. In my first month at Cambridge I 
performed poetry for the first time, and obviously that set me off on the path 
that I’m on now. That was magical. That was special to me.

Do you remember which poem it was?
I’d written two poems. I had one called Powerless, and the other one was like 
an introduction to who I am. It was like I was saying: “Hi, my name’s George, 
I’m in Cambridge, I’m feeling a little awkward, let’s be friends.” And everyone 
really liked it.

How did your time at university change you?
I really, really, really became a social commentator in Cambridge because I 
was reading so much sociology, so much economic and social theory, that made me 
want to tell people about it. I wanted to tell people: “Wow, all the problems 
that we see, people wrote about it already, there are explanations, and there 
are structures and mechanisms to why these things self-perpetuate.”

I do have political aspirations, but with a small 'p'

 Which books made the biggest impression?
Let me give you an example of something I was reading just before this 
interview. There’s a book by an economic theorist Ha-Joon Chang, a bestseller 
called Bad Samaritans; it’s about globalisation, and how rich countries lie 
about how they got rich, and give poorer countries bad advice on getting rich. 
I read that at uni, but I saw it in Foyles the other day and I just grabbed it 
again.

Reading it now, it’s like even more stuff is opening up to me. I realise that 
it’s similar even to rap music. Some rappers will tell you about how they sold 
drugs to make their money on the streets, and that’s all they will tell say. 
What they won’t tell you is the emotional process; why they did it. Like one of 
those poorer countries, they don’t let kids make informed decisions about their 
lives.

One of your lyrics to Cat D goes: “Don’t put me on a pedestal...” But as you 
expressly set out to influence young people, don’t you put yourself on one?
For me, I’m trying to have a conversation, and conversations are an 
egalitarian affair. It’s like all of us standing one floor, speaking to each 
other. If the people standing around me start turning to my direction as I 
start speaking, that doesn’t mean I’m on a raised platform. That’s why you 
don’t see me in some silly tabloid pages. There’s nothing to gossip about me 
because all I got into this game to talk about is social progress.

So what would you see as success?
To organise a community out of my listeners. A socially-motivated community of 
problem-solvers. I think that’s possible. Like I said, if we’re all having a 
conversation and good ideas emerge, and we’re able to organise ourselves 
because we’re united by this poetry that I’m creating, then we can impact 
society.

Which explains all your community work...
I recently became ambassador for the Lifeskills 
<https://www.barclayslifeskills.com/about/> programme, which is about 
empowering young people with skills they need in the 21st-century workplace; 
tricks of the trade you won’t necessarily be taught in school. This is a 
natural extension of why I decided to do poetry. Poetry is a powerful medium 
because you can discuss the realities of life that can’t quite get captured in 
the classroom or put down in a textbook. So these schemes represent that. I’m 
keen to collaborate with anyone that is inclined to really impact society in a 
constructive way.

You often sound like a politician. Could you see yourself in a green seat?
[Laughs.] I get asked that all the time – the irony is I went into Cambridge 
with the expectation of becoming an MP or a civil servant. But the more I 
really analysed the mechanics of parliamentary politics and party politics I 
realised it was too restrictive to the conversation. Take Jeremy Corbyn, for 
example: his policies and his approach are often regarded as laughable, because 
it’s so far from the mainstream. Whereas if he were a poet, people would 
entertain it. They’d be interested in having a discussion. I do have political 
aspirations, but with a small “p”.

You went to a grammar school. Where do you stand on the current debate about 
them?
This is the weird thing for me: I’ve never said this publicly but I think 
there is a skewed perception of what a grammar school is. Now, one gripe that I 
did have with the system is that it promoted an overtly middle-class white 
ideology at the expense of my personal identity. The school implicitly told me 
that some of what I brought from the outside was unwelcome. But it was diverse. 
We, as a whole wave of second-generation immigrants, had Oxbridge opportunities 
with that school.

So you’re in favour?
They’re not all like mine was, especially outside of London. I can see where 
the challenge comes in. But I think those challenges can be overcome with 
education policy that seeks to include, to preempt inter-community division 
that sets in because of poverty, the lack of access to information … but that’s 
another conversation.

A lot of nervous students are starting university this month. What would be 
your message to them?
I’d say think about what you’re trying to do in life, why you’re putting 
yourself in this position to access all this information. You have infinite 
opportunities to impact the world.
