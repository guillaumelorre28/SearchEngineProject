Can you recommend a few easy meals to cook on self-catering holidays with 
nothing in the larder and limited facilities and equipment?

Tanya Gudgin, Peterborough 

Home or abroad, as a chef I love immersing myself in local food scenes so I 
always self-cater. However, as the facilities are often basic, I always try to 
take a large, oven-safe, nonstick pan with a lid and a sharp knife. Bring olive 
oil, vinegar and mustard for dressings; salt, pepper, stock cubes and dried 
herbs. Then hit the markets ...

One-pot cooking is always good on holiday – no one wants piles of washing up. 
For a light, one-pot meal, you'll need: 4 chicken supremes; 1 fennel bulb cut 
into eight pieces; 2 red peppers cut into strips; 1 large onion, diced; 
8 cloves garlic, peeled; fresh parsley and thyme; 3 potatoes peeled and sliced; 
olive oil and chicken stock.

Seal the chicken breasts in oil and cook under a lid for 5 mins. Remove, then 
brown the potatoes. Now add the rest of the veg on top of the potatoes. Add the 
herbs and enough chicken stock to cover the potatoes. Cook until they're soft, 
then place the chicken breasts back in and cover and simmer until they are 
cooked through.

Or you could use a cut that takes longer to cook, such as pork shoulder, lamb 
shanks or diced chuck steak. Bung your pot in the oven while you're on an 
afternoon excursion. When you return, remove the meat and cooked veg and boil 
down the liquid to make a sauce. Simple and satisfying.

Lastly, don't be afraid of the barbecue! Especially if you're in an area with 
fabulous fish or large shellfish.
