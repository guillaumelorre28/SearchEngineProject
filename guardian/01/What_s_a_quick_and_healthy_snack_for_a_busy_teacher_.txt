I teach at a middle school and I don't have much time to eat during breaks, 
but it's draining and I need to fuel up. Do you have any tips for healthy, 
quick snacks I could take to work?

Our love of the snack has moved manufacturers to produce a dizzying array of 
products. The majority promote some health-giving property but all are designed 
to make the manufacturer and retailer a high margin. So why not make your own – 
personalised to your taste and at a fraction of the cost?

You can't go wrong with flapjack. Melt 75g unsalted butter, 30g soft dark 
brown sugar, 1 tbsp golden syrup and a couple of drops of vanilla essence, and 
stir in 125g of oats. Then go crazy with your customised flavours: add 100g of 
your choice of dried fruit or nuts and seeds and bake in a lined tray at 
180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 20 minutes.

If you would rather have a savoury snack, mushroom pâté is ideal and will keep 
for 3-4 days in the fridge. You will need 300g of mushrooms (chestnuts are 
ideal), 1 small goat's cheese, 2 finely chopped shallots, 1 crushed garlic 
clove and a teaspoon of chopped tarragon.

Wipe the mushrooms with damp kitchen paper and roughly blitz in the food 
processor. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil and sweat the shallots and garlic. 
When they have softened, add the mushrooms, season and, over a medium flame, 
cook until the mushrooms are quite dry. Add the tarragon and leave to go cold.

Soften the cheese in a bowl with a wooden spoon, add the mushrooms and mix 
carefully. Adjust the seasoning if needed. This can be eaten with breadsticks 
or spread on oatcakes with cornichons.
