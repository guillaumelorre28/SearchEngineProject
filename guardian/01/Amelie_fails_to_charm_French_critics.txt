· Jean-Pierre Jeunet's wildly successful Amelie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/amelie> has been dealt a stinging snub by 
French critics. Despite taking the top prize at last weekend's European Film 
Awards and being selected as France's official contender for next year's best 
foreign film Oscar, the winsome Parisian fable was notable by its absence from 
the shortlist for the annual Prix Louis Delluc critics prize. Another notable 
omissions is Eric Rohmer's The Lady and the Duke. The shortlist of six pictures 
are Patrice Chereau's Intimacy, Claire Denis's Trouble Every Day, Manoel 
Oliviera's I'm Going Home, Jacques Rivette's Va Savoir, Benoit Jacquot's Tosa 
and Claude Lanzman's Sobibor; October 14; 1943; 4pm. The award will be 
presented on December 10.

· Mark Wahlberg is facing a $2m (£1.40m) lawsuit from a former bodyguard who 
claimed that the actor assaulted him outside a Manhattan restaurant. 
Ex-Wahlberg employee Leonard Taylor has filed a civil lawsuit claiming that the 
Planet of the Apes star "maliciously and intentionally, and without just cause 
or provocation, assaulted, beat and bit" Taylor in a fit of rage. The claim 
breaks down as $1m (£703,000) for medical bills and another million for the 
emotional trauma caused by the attack.

· Never one to rush himself, Chris Noonan has confirmed that he will be 
directing the romantic comedy The DisAssociate for MGM next May. It will be 
Noonan's first time in the director's chair since helming the successful family 
favourite Babe way back in 1995. Someone had better brush the cobwebs off.
