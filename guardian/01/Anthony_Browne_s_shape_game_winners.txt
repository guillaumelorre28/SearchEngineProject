Back in July, we asked readers to take part in Anthony Browne's Shape Game 
competition <http://Shape Game competition> – improvising a new picture from a 
set shape printed in the Observer Magazine – to be judged by the children's 
laureate. We were overwhelmed with hundreds of entries from people of varying 
ages and abilities, but we are pleased to announce that the winner of the 
one-off Quentin Blake drawing is Holly Garside, aged four, from the West 
Midlands. "It was an extremely difficult to judge an overall winner and I was 
very impressed with the standard of all the artwork," explains Browne. "Some 
pictures were obviously created by artists and illustrators who had spent many 
careful hours creating their compositions. Some adults probably hadn't drawn 
since their childhood but managed to produce brilliantly expressive drawings. 
And then there were the children. I chose Holly Garside's Pelican because it's 
beautiful, and because it seems to epitomise everything that I love about the 
creativity that we all possess, but most of us lose." The auction of drawings 
by celebrities, including Sir Peter Blake, Emma Thompson and Harry Hill, raised 
£11,500 for theRainbow Trust charity <http://Rainbow Trust charity>.
