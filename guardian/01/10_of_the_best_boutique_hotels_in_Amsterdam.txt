Seven One Seven 
 Seven One Seven 
Originally built as a sugar trader's opulent residence in the 17th century and 
later developed into a 19th-century complex that included a sugar mill and 
neighbouring warehouses, this private canal guesthouse now offers guests an 
all-in experience that exceeds most other hotels' promises, including not just 
breakfast (served on the patio on sunny summer days), but also afternoon tea, 
all manner of wine and drink. Its nine bright rooms are named after writers and 
composers, and each is individually decorated in feisty tones. Attention to 
details such as candles, fresh flowers and refreshments on arrival make Seven 
One Seven's prestigious address one to discover Amsterdam from in style.

Amstel Hotel
 Amstel Hotel 
Just as Paris has the Ritz, Vienna the Sacher, so Amsterdam has the Amstel. 
This grande dame dates back to an era when hotels were just that, grand. And 
it's not just their guestlist, which includes the Queen, Audrey Hepburn and 
Walt Disney – the Amstel's palatial facade, soaring archways and sparkling 
chandeliers all have a time-travel effect. Its 79 rooms and suites (half of 
which face the river it is named after) are decorated with period furniture, 
while bouquets of fresh tulips add a touch of freshness. Just up the river are 
the equally prestigiousCarré Theatre <http://www.theatercarre.nl/EN/home> 
(which showcases acts as diverse as Spamalot, David Sedaris and Tori Amos) and 
theHermitage Amsterdam <http://www.hermitage.nl/en/pers/> museum.

Grand Hotel Amrâth 
 Grand Hotel Amrâth 
Though it has only been open for five years, the Grand Hotel Amrâth's roots 
run deep. Finished in 1916, the building – then called the Scheepvaarthuis – is 
the first landmark of the Amsterdam School of architecture. The shipping 
companies that commissioned it chose the site for its historical associations – 
the place from which in 1595 Dutch ships first sailed for the East Indies. 
Maritime motifs decorate the elegantly ribbed art deco facade, as well as the 
monumental skylight over the four-storey staircase. The 165 rooms do not shy 
away from the weight of history either, highlighting architectural woodworking 
and sticking to a dark, colonial colour scheme. A vast wellness and pool area, 
as well as the Seven Seas restaurant, complete this remarkable package.

Lloyd Hotel
 Lloyd Hotel Photograph: Alamy 
As Amsterdam spills over on to its former docklands, guests of the Lloyd Hotel 
are perfectly positioned to see the area's architectural transformations. Just 
a tram ride from the cramped city centre and just across the waterway from the 
up-and-coming Java/KNSM islands, this former detention centre has been 
wonderfully converted into 117 playfully different rooms, rated from one- to 
five-star. At the higher end, this means a grand piano or a 4m-wide bed, while 
the 1- or 2-starred rooms have shared bathrooms or quirky showers in the corner 
of the bedroom. The MVRDV architects that rebuilt the Lloyd and created the 
audacious design are no strangers to the IJ river docklands, as they also 
designed the redeveloped Westerdokseiland and the Borneo Houses on the 
Stokerkade.

The College Hotel
 The College Hotel 
Even without its website boasting about VIP guests like Jamie Oliver and 
Fatboy Slim (some might say despite of), the College Hotel is an attractive 
proposition. The renovated 19th-century school hardly calls to mind the 
drudgery once inflicted on kids. Instead, it exudes a cool brand of luxury 
packaged in beige and tan. Yet it's still true to its educational vocation, as 
the able staff are assisted by a gaggle of ambitious hotel management students 
eager to train at one of the classiest hotels in town. Those looking for good 
food need not make their way back to the city centre, as the former school 
gymnasium now hosts the restaurant with an open kitchen.

nH Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky
 nH Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky 
Though you wouldn't know it from its bleak facade, the nH Grand Hotel 
Krasnapolsky has a gorgeous belle epoque winter garden restaurant, and 
imagining one is surrounded by corseted Merchant Ivory characters while having 
breakfast is half the pleasure of staying here. The other half is its central 
location, directly opposite the Royal Palace on Dam Square, which features 
prominently in all manner of national events, from championship celebrations to 
political protests. On quieter days, it still makes for a great perch, as the 
palace, the fancy Bijenkorf department store, and the Warmoesstraat sex shops 
all attract fascinatingly different crowds.

Hotel De Filosoof 
 Hotel De Filosoof 
Just off the Vondelpark, Amsterdam's green heart, De Filosoof's 38 rooms and 
enclosed garden form cosy hideaways from the nearby tourist streams heading to 
theVan Gogh Museum <http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp> or the 
Rijksmuseum <http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/index.jsp?lang=en>. True to the hotel's 
name, the rooms and suites are dedicated to noted philosophers, from 
Wittgenstein (apparently an orange/grey/black kind of thinker) to Socrates and 
even Bataille, whose Tears of Eros inspired a red and gold scheme. Those not 
philosophically inclined are but minutes away from jogging the bendy Vondelpark 
paths, enjoying a cup of tea and slice of apple pie at theBlauwe Theehuis 
<http://www.blauwetheehuis.nl/theehuis.html>, or drinking an afternoon toast in 
the park at theVertigo café <http://www.vertigo.nl/index1.html>.

Hotel Okura 
 Hotel Okura 
Okura's was designed in 1971 as part hotel, part 23-storey barometer. Green 
lights along the top of the tower still mean bad weather tomorrow, blue means 
sunny skies. Ciel Bleu, then, is the name of the top-floor restaurant, a 
two-star Michelin pick. Down on the ground-floor, the Yamazato restaurant also 
has a Michelin star. The rooms, as one expects, are of the highest grade, 
offering subtle, unshowy luxuries galore (British sockets, for instance). 
Should the hotel's four restaurants or Japanese styling prove too refined, the 
nearbyAlbert Cuyp market <http://www.albertcuypmarkt.com> offers plenty of more 
populist distractions.

Hotel Pulitzer 
 Hotel Pulitzer 
A coagulation of 25 (!) buildings on one city block between the Prinsengracht 
canal on one side and the Keizersgracht canal on the other, the Pulitzer is a 
pleasantly labyrinthine hotel that prizes itself on its great service. Some of 
the 16th- and 17th-century buildings that make up this architectural collage 
were built by wealthy barley or indigo merchants, and spending the night in 
their quarters means truly experiencing a taste of Amsterdam's rich history. 
Being a short stroll from theAnne Frank House 
<http://www.annefrank.org/en/Museum/> and right in the heart of the Nine 
Streets shopping district <http://www.theninestreets.com> makes the Pulitzer a 
great starting point for either historical sightseeing or contemporary 
consumerism.

Kamer 01 
 Kamer 01 
The most intimate lodgings on this list, and likely of any Amsterdam hotel, 
and not just because Kamer 01 has only two rooms, each occupying an entire 
floor of the slender 1585 building. Each room has a sitting area overlooking a 
crook of the Singel canal, with the sumptuous sleeping area and smartly 
designed bathroom in the back. Guests are welcome to help themselves to snacks 
and drinks from the well-stocked kitchen, which also serves an elegant and 
delicious four-course breakfast. The hosts' personal though not intrusive 
service and exemplary attention to detail make this canal-side hotel unique in 
a city too full of sub-par options.
