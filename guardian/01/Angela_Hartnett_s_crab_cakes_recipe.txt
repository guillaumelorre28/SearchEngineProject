We have delicious crab in the UK but at the moment we are shipping much of it 
abroad; it's time we embraced it ourselves. Most supermarkets sell little tubs 
of pasteurised crab meat that are ideal for using in this dish if you can't 
face prepping your own.

(serves 2)

300g white crabmeat
75g brown crabmeat
2 spring onions, sliced
½ tsp fresh ginger, grated
1 tsp chopped chilli
100g flour
2 egg whites, beaten
100g breadcrumbs
50ml vegetable oil
2 ripe avocados
Splash of Tabasco sauce
1 tsp chopped coriander

Mix the white and brown crabmeat with the spring onions, season, then add the 
ginger and half of the chilli. Shape the mixture into about six moulds and 
refrigerate for about five minutes.

Meanwhile, divide the flour, egg white and breadcrumbs into three shallow 
bowls. Dip each cake into the flour, then egg white, and finally, the 
breadcrumbs.

Heat the oil in a shallow frying pan on medium high, add the crab cakes, 
turning until golden brown – this should take about four minutes.

Meanwhile, mash the avocado with the coriander, the remaining chilli and a 
dash of Tabasco. Check the seasoning and then serve the crab cakes with the 
avocado on the side.
