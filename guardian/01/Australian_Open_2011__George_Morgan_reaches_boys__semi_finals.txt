George Morgan today moved into the semi-finals of the boys' singles at the 
Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> after a 
three-set win over Jeson Patrombon.

The 17-year-old from Bolton, who squeezed past Mate Delic 10-8 in the third 
yesterday, was pushed once more by Patrombon of the Philippines before coming 
through 5-7, 6-2, 6-3.

Morgan, the No4 seed, is considered one of Britain's best hopes after winning 
the prestigious Orange Bowl â€“ one of the most important junior tennis 
championships in the world. He will meet the No1 seed, Jiri Vesely, in the last 
four.

The event has comfortably been his most successful grand slam tournament in 
his junior career, having been knocked out early on his two visits to Wimbledon 
and at the junior US Open.
