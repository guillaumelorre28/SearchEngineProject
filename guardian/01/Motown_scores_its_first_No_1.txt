The US postal service might not seem like the most romantic of subjects for a 
pop record, but Motown could inject magic into any situation. The Marvelettes's 
debut single, Please Mr Postman – later covered by the Beatles and the 
Carpenters – described the high anxiety that comes with any teen love affair 
and gave Motown its first US No 1, only a year after Berry Gordy had merged his 
Tamla and Motown labels and changed the group's name from the Marvels to the 
Marvelettes. It was no fluke – during the next decade the Detroit label scored 
dozens of top 10 hits, thanks to the likes of Smokey Robinson, the Supremes and 
Marvin Gaye. And while the Marvelettes never reached No 1 again, they notched 
up two further US top 10 hits (Playboy and Don't Mess With Bill in 1962 and 66 
respectively), though neither captured the trials of adolescence quite like the 
fervent Please Me Postman.
