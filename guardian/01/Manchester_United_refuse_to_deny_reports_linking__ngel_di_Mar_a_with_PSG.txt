 in Santa Clara.

Reports in France claimed the forward could have a medical in New York on 
Monday, ahead of United’s meeting with PSG in Chicago on Wednesday. Old 
Trafford executives on Saturday did not take the opportunity to dismiss reports 
Di María could depart.

Although Di María is still expected to link up with United, Javier Hernández 
and Marcos Rojo have now joined the tour party. The Mexican had been injured 
while the Argentina international Rojo was resting after his participation in 
the Copa América.
