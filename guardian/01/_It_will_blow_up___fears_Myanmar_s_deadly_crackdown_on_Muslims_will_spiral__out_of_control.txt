“The situation is really bad here,” he says, sitting in a bamboo hut inside an 
internment camp on the outskirts of Sittwe, capital of Myanmar’s troubled 
Rakhine state.

The 77-year-old Rohingya Muslim community leader, a former lawyer, was jailed 
numerous times for political activities under Myanmar’s former military 
governments. He is used to scrutiny. But, this time, he says it is different.

“The military came and they are warning everybody not to keep any strangers,” 
he says.

Rohingya in the camps, where tens of thousands have been confined since 
communal violence in 2012, have stopped gathering in groups to avoid attracting 
suspicion. In at least one village they were ordered by the army to demolish 
fences surrounding their homes.

There is good reason to be afraid. A few dozen miles north, in northern 
Rakhine’s Maungdaw township, a conflict is raging between the military and the 
Rohingya population. A series ofdeadly attacks on security forces

The army has framed the fighting, which broke out on 9 October after nine 
police and five soldiers were killed at three border posts, as an “invasion” 
and announced plans totrain and arm 
<http://www.firstpost.com/world/myanmar-police-to-arm-train-non-muslims-in-conflict-torn-region-reuters-3085626.html>
 Buddhist civilians to protect their villages.


Ensuing security sweeps have killed dozens of alleged attackers. Last weekend, 
more than 30 died after soldiers fired from helicopters on a mob of men they 
say were armed with guns, knives and spears.

But human rights groups say scores of Rohingya civilians may be among the 
casualties. Images and video circulated on social media appear to show the 
bodies of men, women and children with gunshot wounds, while satellite images 
published by Human Rights Watch show villages razed to the ground. Rohingya 
women in several areas have accused soldiers of rape.

The army denies this. The authorities consider Rohingya to be illegal 
immigrants from Bangladesh, although many trace their heritage in Myanmar for 
generations. State media says they fabricated the rape allegations and burned 
down their own homes. And because the area is off-limits to foreign journalists,
it has been very difficult to verify the competing claims

.

Rohingya in Sittwe say they know nothing about any militant group. Many 
believe the episode is a creation of the army, which still wields tremendous 
power despite a handover to civilian government led byAung San Suu Kyi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi> earlier this year. But 
some warn that oppression of the minority is heading towards breaking point.

A recent report by Physicians for Human Rights documented how restrictions on 
movement, land confiscation, pervasive surveillance and extortion in northern 
Rakhine since the 2012 clashes had left some 120,000 displaced.


“Now, it’s been four years with people in these conditions and suffering; many 
young people spending their teenage, adult years with nothing to do,” says Kyaw 
Hla Aung.

Asked whether he thinks there is an insurgency, he says: “No, no, but they are 
suffering and suffering and suffering, so they cannot bear, so it will blow up.”

In a statement published a few days after October’s attacks, the government 
blamed a previously unknown armed group of “extremists”, Aqa-Mul-Mujahidin, 
whose leader, named as Haviz Tohar, allegedly trained with the Pakistani 
Taliban. Aung San Suu Kyi later appeared to walk back on some of those claims, 
saying they were based on information that may not be credible.

Meanwhile, videos posted online by a group calling itself the Faith Movement 
show a contingent of young men, and some boys, armed with swords and some guns, 
claiming to be Rohingya freedom fighters.

According to analysts from the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium 
(Trac), at least seven videos were posted between 10 and 27 October. None 
mention Aqa-Mul-Mujahidin or Haviz Tohar. Instead, some introduce a “chief” 
named as Abu Ammar Junooni, a bearded man sitting in the centre of a small band 
of men.

“Each video calls for an armed struggle,” says Veryan Khan, editorial director 
at Trac, while three “specifically call for a jihad”.


Some of the clips give a list of demands, including the restoration of 
Rohingya ethnic rights, and stress their “self-defence” is focused on the 
military. An English-language “press statement” says the group is “free from 
all elements of terror but seeks fundamental rights for all Arakanese [people 
of Rakhine state]”.

Tin Maung Shwe, a senior Rakhine state official, says security had been 
boosted across the country. “This is a murder case,” he says. “We will take 
action against everyone who committed this. If they are living inMyanmar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar>, they have to follow Myanmar’s 
constitution, whatever their race is.”

Militancy in Rakhine state is not a recent phenomenon. Muslim movements 
demanding an autonomous region in northern Rakhine cropped up throughout the 
latter half of the 20th century. These included the Rohingya Solidarity 
Organisation (RSO), thought to have been defunct since the 2000s.

A transcript of an audio recording obtained by a source familiar with the 
Rohingya diaspora and shared with the Guardian features a man saying the people 
involved are “not only RSO”.

The man, believed to be an ethnic Rohingya living abroad, describes the 9 
October attacks as a “big success”.

“These are our people and the system of the people is working well,” he says, 
stressing that “help” can be sent through an underground network of individuals.

“They [Myanmar military] looked down on us, ignored us and kept silence by 
saying that our kalars [a derogatory term for Muslims] do not have anything. 
Insha Allah, we succeeded.”

Speaking a few days after the release of the government statement, Ehsan Ullah 
Batth, Pakistan’s ambassador to Myanmar, said he had received no “actionable 
information” about Pakistani involvement.

Of an alleged accomplice the government named Kalis, purportedly Pakistani, he 
said: “I don’t find any such name in Pakistan.”

While connections to international organisations may be uncovered, the demands 
of the videos are locally focused: liberation of Rohingya from the camps, 
restoration of citizenship and property.

Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based political analyst, says: “I think what is 
important to stress is that so far the modus operandi of the attackers has been 
similar to the old RSO and other insurgent groups, not terrorism – that is, 
attacks have been on security targets, not civilians or religious sites.”

Matthew Smith, founder and chief executive of non-profit Fortify Rights, 
agrees. “The militants don’t appear to be well-organised or well-armed, and 
they’re tiny compared to dozens of other armed groups or militias in the 
country,” he says.

We fear the military will unleash an unprecedented wrath on northern Rakhine 
State
Matthew Smith, founder, Fortify Rights 
“If this [Rohingya militancy] is a strategy to negotiate with the army, and to 
have a seat at the table alongside other ethnic armies in the peace process, 
it’s profoundly ill-conceived.

“We fear the military will unleash an unprecedented wrath on northern Rakhine 
state, and that won’t bode well for Rohingya rights.”

In the displacement camp outside Sittwe, Kyaw Hla Aung says Rohingya leaders 
were recently called to a meeting with the military. “We submitted to them 
that, in Sittwe, our people didn’t involve in this case.”

Past the army base and razor-wire fences that divide the camps from Rakhine 
Buddhist neighbourhoods, the Muslim ghetto in downtown Sittwe is racked with 
fear.

“We are doing security for the quarter by ourselves,” says one Rohingya leader 
during a few snatched moments of conversation out of sight of a plainclothes 
police officer.

“We are not sleeping at night, we sleep in the morning, wake up in the 
evening. After the Maungdaw attacks, we are afraid someone will take revenge.”
