The brother of brain cancer patient Ashya King has released a video showing 
his progress after treatment in theCzech Republic

Brett and Naghmeh King triggered an international search when they removed 
their five-year-old son from Southampton general hospital in August without 
medical consent.

They entered a protracted legal battle to get him to the Proton Therapy Centre 
(PTC) in Prague, with a high court judge approving the move only after the 
couple had been released from police custody in Spain.

The Kings recently said they would be reluctant to return to the UK and were 
considering moving to Spain.

Ashya’s older brother, Naveed, 20, has posted a video on YouTube showing the 
boy undergoing physiotherapy and speech therapy sessions.

In the video, Ashya grabs plastic bricks, spells out his name and demonstrates 
with his fingers how to play a piano. The youngster, who has bald patches, is 
seen smiling when he is praised by the therapists.

Naveed wrote on Facebook to accompany the video: “Pictures and words can only 
go so far. So thought it would be lovely to post another video of his progress. 
This is of today’s date whilst doing Physio and Speech Therapy! I bet you can 
all see his progress!”

The PTC has said proton therapy is more effective than radiotherapy as it 
limits the collateral damage of radiation to other vital organs, such as the 
heart and liver in Ashya’s case. This would lead to less severe long-term 
side-effects including heart and breathing problems.

The therapy is not available for him on the NHS, although the health service 
has since agreed to fund Ashya’s treatment.
