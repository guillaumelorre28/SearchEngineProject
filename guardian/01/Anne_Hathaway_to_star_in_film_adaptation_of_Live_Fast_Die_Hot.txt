Anne Hathaway is set to star in a film adaptation of Live Fast Die Hot 
<http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/529758/live-fast-die-hot/>, a bestselling essay 
collection about motherhood and responsibility by humorist Jenny Mollen.

In the book Mollen, who writes about inviting her drug dealer to Passover 
seder to prevent him feeling left out, describes her attempts to become more 
responsible after she and her husband, Jason Biggs, were joined by their son, 
Sid. It was described by publisher Doubleday as “heartfelt and devastatingly 
honest”.

The film, which is being produced as part of a Warner Brothers push to develop 
more female-led projects, is the latest in a string of upcoming releases 
featuring Hathaway. The actor, an Oscar-winner for her role in Tom Hooper’s 
screen version of Les Misérables, hassigned up to play a drone pilot in Grounded
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/06/anne-hathaway-to-play-air-force-pilot-in-drones-drama>
, a drama based on an off-Broadway play in which she starred. In addition, 
she’s set to be part of the ensemble cast of an all-female Ocean’s Eleven 
spin-off and will also appear in Colossal, a sci-fi drama in which her 
character leaves her job and boyfriend behind in New York after establishing a 
psychic connection with a giant monster that is destroying South Korea. That 
film premieres at next month’s Toronto film festival.
