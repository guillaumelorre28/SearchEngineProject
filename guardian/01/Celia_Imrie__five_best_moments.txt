years after the first episode aired.Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/29/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie-review-absolutely-fatuous-thank-god>
 reunites Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley as heavy-drinking fashionistas 
Edina and Patsy and brings back an impressive array of supporting players, 
including Celia Imrie as bitchy PR maven Claudia Bing. Imrie’s career has 
blossomed post-Ab Fab and it’s set to continue, with roles in Bridget Jones’s 
Baby, Louis CK-penned sitcom Better Things and evil spa horror A Cure for 
Wellness.

But after 40 years in the business, what have been her greatest roles?

Celia played half of this film’s answer to Thelma and Louise when she took on 
the role of Una Alconbury, the best friend of Bridget’s interfering mum Pam in 
this hit comedy. While her role in this film may be small, it’s certainly 
memorable and Una does far more than just stir the gravy at Pam’s annual 
post-christmas turkey curry buffet. Her interest in Bridget’s love life, her 
marriage to ‘Uncle’ Geoffrey, and her ability to throw memorable Tarts and 
Vicars fancy dress parties mean that Una is one of the characters fondly 
remembered in the film.

comes when posing for a photo using cakes to cover her modesty, co-star Helen 
Mirren’s character shouts “We’re going to need considerably bigger buns!” Imrie 
has said that people still affectionately call her Bigger Buns in the street 13 
years on.

Teatime with Mrs Quickly in Nanny McPhee <https://youtu.be/VEUMol5hT8Q> 
She plays Mrs Quickly in the now iconic children’s favourite, a horrible woman 
that is due to marry Cedric (Colin Firth) to stop his family from becoming poor 
at the hands of his late wife’s aunt Lady Adelaide. As the clip shows, her 
ability to play such a mean and disliked character whilst letting her own 
personality shine through made the character both a favourite of Imrie’s and 
the audience.

In this surprise hit (that spawned an unlikely franchise), Imrie plays Madge 
Hardcastle, a woman on the search for yet another husband after several 
unsuccessful marriages. Her on screen flirtatious chemistry with Richard Gere 
in the sequel of the film, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has proven to 
be a hit with viewers.

Celia Imrie: ‘All the parts I’m writing are parts I’d like to play’

This comedy about a divorced couple, Kate (Emma Thompson) and Richard (Pierce 
Brosnan), forced to come together again to retrieve his lost pension fund, 
received mixed reviews. Imrie plays their neighbour Penelope, who along with 
husband Jerry (Timothy Spall) come along for the wicked ride and show the 
perfect contrast of a couple that have stayed together and have known each 
other inside out for years, or so you would think. Her comedic timing and 
partnership with all the main actors, especially Spall, was part of what gave 
this film its charm. If all else fails, someone always has to bring the 
sandwiches on a revenge mission.
