A friend holds an annual Easter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/easter> party where she puts out 
straw hats, piles of decorations and glue and ribbons for anyone with a 
penchant for arts and crafts. And every year I’m delighted by the resulting 
blowsy, OTT bonnets that add va-va-voom to our family dressing-up box. Food is 
on the agenda, too, obviously, and though spring lamb is the seasonal 
tradition, I much prefer the depth of flavour you get from a more mature 
animal. For a proper treat, order some hogget or, better still, mutton from 
your butcher, whether that’s a big joint or a more affordable option that 
requires much less meat, such as a subtly spiced, warming harira, Morocco’s 
national soup and today’s second recipe. All you need then is a hot mound of 
saffron-spiced couscous flecked with herbs, nuts and fruit, and this gloriously 
light salad.

Radish, grapefruit and burrata salad with pistachio and mint pesto

Roast pistachios, bright lemon and fresh mint make a sensational pesto that 
puts a real spring in the step of this end-of-winter salad. Serves four.

60g shelled pistachios
4 big handfuls mint leaves, washed, three-quarters roughly chopped
½ tsp ground allspice
Juice of 1 lemon
1 tsp honey
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
120ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle 
1 pink grapefruit
250g bunch pink radishes
1 handful rocket leaves
2 burrata (a type of mozzarella that’s filled with cream)
A few pinches Turkish chilli flakes, or hot smoked paprika, to serve
4 slices toasted sourdough or country loaf, to serve

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Spread the pistachios over a baking 
tray and roast for eight to 10 minutes, until slightly darkened, then leave to 
cool.

Whiz the chopped mint with the allspice and cooled pistachios, then add half 
the lemon juice and honey, season to taste, add a few tablespoons of the oil, 
to loosen the mix, and blitz again. Stir the rest of the oil into the pesto, 
check again for seasoning and set aside.

Top and tail the grapefruit, then cut off the skin all the way around, making 
sure you remove all the white pith. Cut the fruit into thin rounds, then cut 
each round in three and put in a salad bowl. Thinly slice the radishes (use a 
mandoline, if you have one) and add to the bowl. Add the rocket and the final 
handful of whole mint leaves, and season.

Holding it over the salad, tear the burrata into largish pieces, drop into the 
bowl and season again. Spoon over the pesto dressing, dribble over a few extra 
tablespoons of olive oil and the remaining lemon juice, and toss gently to 
dress the leaves. Sprinkle with a little chilli; the salad should taste bright 
and piquant. Serve with the toast (rub it with garlic and drizzle with more 
extra-virgin olive oil, if you like).

Make this soup a few days ahead, so the spices and meat have a chance to relax 
and get to know each other. Serves six to eight.

3 tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, peeled and roughly diced
2 carrots, peeled and roughly diced
3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped
½ bunch coriander, stalks and leaves separated, both finely chopped
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
300g lamb, hogget or mutton neck fillet, cut into 1-2cm cubes
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp turmeric
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp sweet paprika
½ tsp ground ginger
2 bay leaves
400g tinned plum tomatoes, chopped 
1 pinch saffron threads soaked in boiling water
2 parsnips, peeled and roughly diced
400g tin chickpeas, drained and rinsed
400g tin lentils, drained and rinsed
75g butter
200g Greek yoghurt
A squeeze of lemon juice, plus lemon quarters to serve
2 tbsp harissa, plus extra to taste

Warm the oil in a large, deep pan on a medium heat and add the onion, carrots, 
garlic and coriander stalks. Stir in a big pinch of salt, and saute gently for 
eight minutes, until softened slightly.

Season the meat, turn up the heat under the pan and fry for a few minutes 
until the meat begins to take on colour. Stir in all the spices except the 
saffron, add plenty of black pepper, and cook for a minute until the spices 
begin to smell fragrant.

Stir in the bay, tomatoes and saffron, then pour in enough hot water to cover 
everything by 5cm. Bring to a simmer and leave to cook, uncovered, for 90 
minutes, until the meat is completely soft; stir the parsnips, chickpeas and 
lentils into the pot after one hour. The pulses will thicken the soup, so add 
more water as need be.

Melt the butter in a small saucepan, then season generously and turn up the 
heat a little. Simmer until the solids turn golden brown and it starts smelling 
nutty. Turn off the heat the moment the butter turns hazelnut in colour, then 
stir in the yoghurt to stop the butter cooking any further. Season with a 
squeeze of lemon.

Stir the harissa into the soup, then check the heat levels: you may want to 
add more harissa to taste. Adjust the seasoning, stir in the coriander leaves, 
and serve piping hot with the burnt yoghurt in a bowl to hand round and lemon 
quarters to squeeze over.

And for the rest of the week…

The mint pesto is so delicious, you may find yourself spooning it over 
leftover harira or using it to add a nutty edge to a roast leg of lamb; I also 
love it drizzled over roast aubergine wedges. If you have extra parsnips, roast 
them in the same spices used in the harira, and dress with the same burnt 
yoghurt, too: it makes a great meat-free dish. Harissa adds a gorgeous touch of 
spice to almost any leftovers, so buy as good a quality brand as you can 
afford, ormake your own
