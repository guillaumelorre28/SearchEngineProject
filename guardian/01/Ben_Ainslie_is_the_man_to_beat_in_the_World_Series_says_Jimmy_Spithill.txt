, skipper of Britain’s BAR team and a former team-mate of Spithill, had the 
edge in three training races between the two this week. The British boat is the 
one to watch in the competition of 45-foot twin-hulled catamarans, the 36-year 
old Australian said in an interview.

“Ben had the edge and would have won but it was close, we’re right up there. 
The local guys have a lot of support, which makes a difference,” Spithill said.

The America’s Cup, known as the Auld Mug, is the oldest competition in 
international sport, dating to 1851. The ACWS is a preliminary event and 
provides an opportunity for teams to carry forward points based on their final 
ranking into the next stage of the competition, the America’s Cup qualifiers in 
2017. The racing will pit Spithill against Ainslie, who was drafted in as 
Oracle’s tactician during the 34th edition of the cup two years ago. He helped 
them stage one of the most improbable comebacks in sporting history as theywon
