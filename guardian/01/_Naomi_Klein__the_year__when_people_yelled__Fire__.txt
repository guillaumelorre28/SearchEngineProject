What do we do when our political leaders treat profound moral crises as if 
they are nothing extraordinary? Nothing to see here, move along?

What if a supposedly ho-hum phenomenon is actually an existential threat to 
our species? How do we wrench the script away from those in power and sound the 
alarm?

In the final months of his editorship, Alan Rusbridger publically struggled 
with this question in a memorable essay that kicked off the Guardian’s special 
coverage of the climate crisis.“Changes to the Earth’s climate rarely make it 
to the top of the news list,” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/06/climate-change-guardian-threat-to-earth-alan-rusbridger>
 he wrote. “The changes may be happening too fast for human comfort, but they 
happen too slowly for the newsmakers – and, to be fair, for most readers … 
There may be untold catastrophes, famines, floods, droughts, wars, migrations 
and sufferings just around the corner. But that is futurology, not news, so it 
is not going to force itself on any front page anytime soon.”

At the end of the hottest year on record – one marked by serial disasters, as 
well as armed conflicts exacerbated by drought – it’s getting tough to view 
climate change as futurology. Yet Rusbridger’s central point holds: this is a 
complex, slow-motion crisis. And with politicians loth to put it front and 
centre, how can the warming of our world compete with the many other pressing 
issues that scream daily for our attention?

Rusbridger’s solution was simple: don’t wait for politicians to treat climate 
as a crisis. Instead, just do it. Most extraordinary about the Guardian’s 
coverage has been its strong focus on fossil fuel divestment, based on research 
showing that oil, gas and coal companies have several times more carbon in 
their proven reserves than is compatible with keeping warming below 2C – 
something our governments have pledged to do [in last week’s Paris climate deal,
a new goal of just 1.5C was set 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points>
]. Just a few years ago, the fact that fossil fuel companies were frantically 
searching out more carbon despite the fact that the climate system is 
destabilising was treated as an utterly normal part of the market system. 
Nothing remarkable. Not a story.

But then a relatively small group of activists drew the line and said “no”. 
They redefined the frenetic quest for more carbon as immoral behaviour, 
perpetuated by, as author and activist Bill McKibben put it, “a rogue 
industry”. And they said it must be stopped.

When the Guardian launched its #Keepitintheground 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/keep-it-in-the-ground> series, 
things started changing very quickly. Suddenly all kinds of people came out of 
the woodwork to say that they, too, supported divestment – from Prince Charles 
to Ed Davey, then minister for energy and climate change. Even a former 
chairman of Shell declared divestment a “rational approach”.

All of this speaks to the fact that politicians aren’t the only ones with the 
power to declare an emergency. Large and organised social movements have that 
power too. So, too, do major news organisations. Looking back at many of the 
significant stories of 2015, this phenomenon emerges as a defining theme: some 
ephemeral line is crossed and suddenly an activity that had been regarded as 
unremarkable is vociferously rejected as intolerable.

And when that happens, the Guardian is the news organisation most reliably on 
the side of the people who are sounding the alarm. Telling the most compelling 
stories, digging up the most damning facts, and publishing the most 
heart-stopping photography.

Minneapolis. NB: video contains offensive language 
Though it began in 2013, this bottom-up declaration of a national emergency is 
what the Black Lives Matter movement has been doing in US streets without 
pause. Many analysts have wondered what sparked this uprising, since the number 
of police killings in the US appears not to have risen significantly in recent 
years. Nothing has really changed, they insist, so what’s all the marching 
about?

But that misses the point entirely: what has changed, thanks to the rise of 
the movement, is the idea that “normal” levels of state violence are normal at 
all.Police <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> violence has been redefined, 
in the streets, as both a scandal and an emergency. “For the last couple of 
years, the brutal banality of daily life for some people in this country has 
become visible and undeniable to those who have no immediate connection to it,” 
the Guardian’s Gary Younge wrote in July. “But nothing new has happened. There 
has been no spike in police brutality. What’s new is that people are looking.”

To help expose this “brutal banality”, this year the Guardian launched The 
Counted <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings>
, a detailed, crowdsourced database tracking US police killings. It amounts to 
“the most thorough public accounting for deadly use of force” in the country. 
(By December, this year’s harrowing tally was more than 1,000.) And it once 
again shows the power of rigorous journalism combining with an engaged – and 
awake – population.

Previously, hard journalism was mostly about exposing lies and scandals that 
were being kept hidden. Today, a lot of the job of journalism – and activism – 
involves redefining what is happening right out in the open as scandalous, 
because it is. For instance, just because everybody thinks their emails are 
being monitored doesn’t mean it must always be so. Just because our borders are 
increasingly fortressed to refugees in dire need, doesn’t mean this has to be 
our future. And just because living standards have steadily eroded under the 
banner of “austerity” doesn’t mean that they can’t rise once again.

We can still say “no” – and a great many of us are. From the “refugees 
welcome” demonstrations across Europe, to the surges of anti-austerity 
sentiment in Greece and Spain, to the hundreds of “kayaktivists” who tried to 
stop Shell’s Arctic drilling rigs from making it to icy waters. Again and 
again, regular people are drawing a line and saying “no” to what had very 
recently been treated as perfectly reasonable by experts and pundits.

Journalism plays a critical role in this process of asserting that just 
because something reprehensible has become commonplace we do not relinquish our 
power – indeed our basic responsibility – to declare it unacceptable. Too 
often, media outlets abdicate this power, choosing instead to go with the flow. 
Or, worse, they actively use their enormous power and platform to champion the 
interests of the already powerful.

The Guardian <https://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian> isn’t perfect, 
but it is different. In the face of the most urgent crises we face as a human 
family, it consistently displays the courage to declare normalised abuses – of 
people, privacy and planet – to be wholly unacceptable. And in so doing, it 
helps so many of us to feel less alone, and to find our full voices as well.

That’s why we so badly need the Guardian. On our bedside, yes. But on our 
screens and on the news stands most of all.
