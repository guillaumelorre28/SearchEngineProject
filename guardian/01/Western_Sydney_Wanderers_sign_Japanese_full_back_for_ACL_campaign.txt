The Western Sydney Wanderers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/western-sydney-wanderers> have signed 
Japanese full-back Yusuke Tanaka for their upcoming Asian Champions League 
campaign.

The defending champions have penned a short-term deal with the 28-year-old, 
covering the group stage and potentially round-of-16 matches.

Tanaka joins the A-League club from J-League outfit Kawasaki Frontale, with 
whom he played 39 games in the 2014 season - including two ACL games against 
the Wanderers.

He previously played for Yokohama F Marinos between 2005 and 2010.

“Yusuke is a fantastic addition to our squad and brings a great deal of 
experience to the Wanderers,” chief executive John Tsatsimas said.

“He is a talented and capable defender who can play either side of defence and 
having seen first-hand his work rate we feel that he will fit into both our 
style of play and our team culture very well.”
