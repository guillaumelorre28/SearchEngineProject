Nature is cruel. The Lion King 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/55604/lion.king> schooled me in the law 
of the jungle (akaThe Circle of Life <http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=vX07j9SDFcc>
). I am aware that ferocious furry things must eatcute furry things 
<http://www.cuteoverload.com/> to survive, and that ugly, slimy, scaly animals 
kill adorable creatures before feasting noisily upon their still-twitching 
limbs. Even so, I am routinely shocked byAutumnwatch 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/autumnwatch/meettheanimals/avocet.shtml>; it's like Saw 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387564/>, just with fluffy chicks.

The lovelier the animal and the more limpid its imploring eyes, the closer its 
demise. The more we enjoy the sight of it scurrying along at dusk, the sooner 
it encounters its doom, and if we dare empathise with the adoring mother, you 
can be sure its death will be unpleasant.

Last season on Springwatch (same show, different season) a nest of barn owls 
hatched. They were gorgeous - little bundles of down with enormous eyes - but 
it soon turned ugly. The Cornish owlbox murder saw a big bruiser of an owlet 
eat its younger siblings when daddy owl died and mummy was late with lunch 
(mice and voles; also adorable, since you ask).

I first tuned in to the 'Watch to keep up with the antics of Jamie the wily 
old Glaswegian fox (absolutely the coolest, raggediest carnivore to forage 
outside a chip shop) but soon I needed counselling. Everything died. A clutch 
of ducklings? Dead. A litter of something? Dead with mummy howling inconsolably 
alongside bloody clumps of baby.

This season may be the most distressing yet. Like children everywhere, my most 
traumatic film experience was (I'm welling up) the death of Bambi's mother. 
Autumnwatch features both Muntjac and Fallow deer, rendering tears inevitable: "
Run, Bambi <http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=-eHr-9_6hCg>!"

Oh, and there's also a grey seal, destined to be gnawed by sharks as it blinks 
with incomprehension. And red squirrels. I can see it now - Nutkin playfully 
gathering acorns to sustain her young through the winter. But, what's happening?
Why is Nutkin foaming at the mouth 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7573535.stm>? Oh no! The evil grey 
squirrel has infected her with the pox virus, and she's a goner. There's also a 
conger eel, which being slimy, is sure to be immortal.

To liven things up a little, I'm taking bets on which animal is first for the 
chop. If you take these natural laws one step further, it won't be long before 
the saintly Kate Humble snaps and starts pounding the hugely irritating, albeit 
cute and furryBill Oddie <http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=FCC9pzKiJ5A> on his 
cute and furry little head with the cute and furry microphone. Step back and 
watch the carnage begin.
