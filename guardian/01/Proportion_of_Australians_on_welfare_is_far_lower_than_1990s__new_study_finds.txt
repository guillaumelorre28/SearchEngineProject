The proportion of Australia’s working age population that receives income 
support is much lower than it was in the mid-1990s, according to new 
Parliamentary library research.

Researchers say relatively low unemployment rates in Australia, and successive 
tightening of eligibility requirements for some support payments, has seen the 
proportion of the working-age population claiming income support decline 
significantly to 16.6%, from a peak of over 25% in 1994.

Jenny Macklin, Labor’s spokeswoman for Family and Payments, said the finding 
suggests the treasurer, Scott Morrison, should “stop trying to divide 
Australians” by suggesting we live in a country of “taxed and taxed nots

Morrison warned that reining in the growth in welfare spending was one of the 
“most difficult challenges” confronting the commonwealth budget.

He also said a generation of young Australians had grown up thinking that 
government payments were a “common and expected component of their income” over 
their entire life cycle, rather than the reserve of people in real need of a 
hand up.

“On current settings, more Australians today are likely to go through their 
entire lives without ever paying tax than for generations,” Morrison said.

“More Australians are also likely today to be net beneficiaries of the 
government than contributors – never paying more tax than they receive in 
government payments.

“There is a new divide – the taxed and the taxed nots.”


Parliamentary Library research 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/FlagPost/2016/August/Welfare-dependence>
 shows that since 1994, despite a significant decline in the number of people 
claiming income support, there has been a large increase in payments to the 
sick, to people with a disability and to carers.

“The most dramatic increase in income support reliance for the working age 
population has been among carers,” Parliamentary Library researchers said.

“The proportion of the working age population receiving Carer Payment has 
doubled since 2005, from 0.7% to 1.4%. Ageing of the population overall, with a 
consequential increase in the need for carers, may be a factor in this increase.

“It is also possible that changes to the eligibility for the age pension and 
other payments for mature-aged women have meant that those who are caring for 
elderly partners are now accessing this payment.”

The researchers show that between 1998 and 2015, the proportion of Australians 
receiving parenting payments has declined from a high of 5% to 2.4%.

Macklin says the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> could more easily reduce 
the deficit if it considered some of Labor’s policy proposals, such as its 
negative gearing changes, rather trying to take more money from low-income 
households.

“It’s clear that the Liberals haven’t learned the lessons from their 
calamitous first-term in office,” Macklin said.

New data from the Bureau of Statistics, released on Monday, showed there were 
970,800 single-parent families in Australia 
<http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/6224.0.55.001Main%20Features5June%202015?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=6224.0.55.001&issue=June%202015&num=&view=>
 in June 2015, making up 15% of all families – a rise of 58,600 since 2012.


Parliamentary Library research suggests the reason the number of people 
receiving parenting payments has declined is because of tighter eligibility 
requirements.

Pauline Hanson told Sky News on Monday that welfare had become a way of life 
in Australia.

“A lot of people are saying look, why should I get up and, go, you know, get 
up early and go to work, and actually, the neighbour next door can be sitting 
home with three or four kids and actually getting more welfare than what he’s 
getting paid to go to work and provide for his family,” Hanson said.

“Welfare is there as a helping hand, as I said, not a way of life. We’ve got 
to concentrate on looking after the pensioners, the sick, and the disabled, and 
our young ones who are not in a position to look after themselves.”
