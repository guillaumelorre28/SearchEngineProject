Kenyan farmers are increasingly seeking modern farming methods because of 
difficulties accessing water.

A group of men, women, children and chickens have gathered around a small 
opening in the ground, roughly 60 metres deep, from which they get their water. 
The Kihato ASAL (Arid and Semi Arid Land) group dug the borehole by hand over 
three years to irrigate their crops, which had been at the mercy of the weather 
for so long they had all but given up hope.

Joseph Kingaru, chairman of the group, believes they have continued to farm 
until now only because of the efforts of the technicians at the Syngenta 
Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture. "This helps us very, very much," he 
says, pointing to a large tank and water system that allows the group to pump 
and store water from the borehole.

They have also turned to clean seed – certified disease-free – and soil 
treatments to ensure they maximise their yield of healthy crops. "You see we 
are going to put tradition aside here because actually, if we plant a seed that 
is not treated, it does not do well," explains Kingaru.

The group grows cabbage, kale and beans and is saving any profit it makes from 
selling produce in the market. They hope to be able to afford to have pipes 
installed across the 2km of land between their village and Mount Kenya to 
distribute more water to the whole village. "The problem here is only drought," 
smiles Kingaru, "but if we get that water, everything will be OK."
