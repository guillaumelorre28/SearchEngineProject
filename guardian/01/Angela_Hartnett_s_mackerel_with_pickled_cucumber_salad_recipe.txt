I never used to pickle vegetables until we started doing it at the restaurant 
and I've really taken to it. I love cucumber and fennel in salads for crunch 
and a sharp kick, and they're ideal for a fatty fish such as mackerel.

(Serves 2)

50g sugar
50g white wine vinegar
1 cucumber
½ tsp chopped fresh chilli
2 baby gem lettuce, sliced
½ head of small fennel sliced
Rind of 1 lemon, grated
25ml groundnut oil
4 mackerel fillets, scored

Make the pickling liquid by heating the sugar and vinegar in a pan on medium, 
until the sugar has dissolved.

Peel the cucumber, cut lengthways, remove the seeds then slice horizontally.

Place the pieces in a bowl, pour over the pickling liquid and leave to 
marinate while you prepare the rest of the dish.

Combine the fennel, lettuce and chilli, season lightly and add the lemon rind. 
Then add the cucumber.

Put the oil in a non-stick pan over a medium heat and, when it's hot, put the 
mackerel fillets in, skin side down.

Cook the fish for 3-4 minutes until the skin crisps up.

Turn and sear on the flesh side, remove and when cool enough, flake the 
mackerel over the cucumber salad and serve immediately.
