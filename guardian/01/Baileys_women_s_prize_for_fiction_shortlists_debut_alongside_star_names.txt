A debut novel set in a beehive and dubbed “the Animal Farm of the 21st 
century” by chair of judges Shami Chakrabarti has made the shortlist for the 
Baileys women’s prize for fiction, alongside books from some of the most 
acclaimed writers working today.

Laline Paull’s The Bees tells the story of Flora 717, a lowly, ugly sanitation 
worker in her hive who reaches the Queen’s inner sanctum. The author, a 
screenwriter and playwright turned novelist, will compete for the £30,000 
Baileys prize with five authors who have all been previously shortlisted for 
the award, organisers announced.

Ali Smith was selected this time for her multiple award-winning How to Be Both,
Sarah Waters <https://www.theguardian.com/books/sarahwaters> was chosen for The 
Paying Guests, set in London in 1922, and Rachel Cusk was picked for Outline, 
in which an author travels to Athens to teach a creative writing course.

The six-strong line-up is completed with Kamila Shamsie’s A God in Every 
Stone, the story of a Pashtun soldier who fights in Ypres in 1915, and Anne 
Tyler’s look at the lives of the Whitshank family, A Spool of Blue Thread.

“They are all fantastic,” said Chakrabarti. “They are very different in 
various ways – subject matter, genre, style. Some are sparse, some poetic. What 
they have in common is that you can’t put them down.”

Paull, who wrote her first novel aged seven but set it aside after her family 
described it as “‘sweet’ - I thought ‘no, it’s really serious and dramatic’” - 
said that it was “extremely exciting but quite strange” to find herself on the 
Baileys shortlist.

“In my family we didn’t know anyone who made a living from writing – I thought 
‘I can’t do it’,” she said. “It took me a long time to build up my conviction 
to just write.”

After working as a receptionist at a film company, trainee film-financier and 
then a screenwriter, then turning to the theatre after her daughter was born, 
she decided to take the plunge back into novel-writing, and took a creative 
writing course. The idea about the bees came to her half way through – a 
beekeeper friend had recently died, her eulogy full of quotes about bees.

“Because I was in this very open state, everything clicked. The emotional 
range was there, and my imagination fired. I just went for it,” she said. “I 
thought I’d got nothing to lose – I was in complete obscurity.”

Chakrabarti called The Bees “the Animal Farm of the 21st century. On one hand 
you get the originality and the cheekiness and the brilliant idea – to talk 
about society and politics in the context of a beehive. But then the writing is 
so good that you believe Flora is a person.”

The Liberty director also praised Shamsie’s “exquisite research”, describing A 
God in Every Stone as “such an enterprise, such ambition”. Tyler, the one 
American novelist on the shortlist, “is clearly a master storyteller – the 
novel is like a really amazing designer garment so brilliantly put together you 
can’t see the stitches”. Smith’s How to Be Both is “James Joyce meets Virginia 
Woolf for the 21st century”, and Cusk’s Outline “so self-effacing and yet so 
intriguing”. The Paying Guests, meanwhile, “will have your heart racing from 
start to finish – you so care about the outcome and are so immersed in it you 
can’t put it down”.

Bookmaker William Hill immediately made Waters its favourite to win the award, 
at 2/1, with Smith at 3/1, Cusk and Tyler both at 5/1, and Paull and Shamsie 
both at 6/1.

Now in its 20th year, the prize – formerly known as the Orange – sets out to 
reward “excellence, originality and accessibility in writing by women from 
throughout the world”. It has been won in the past by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie 
for Half of a Yellow Sun, by Zadie Smith for On Beauty and by Lionel Shriver 
for We Need to Talk About Kevin, with this year’s winner to be announced on 3 
June.

Chakrabarti’s fellow judges are Everyday Sexism Project founder Laura Bates, 
columnist Grace Dent, author and former Orange prize winner Helen Dunmore, and 
Channel 4 news presenter Cathy Newman.
