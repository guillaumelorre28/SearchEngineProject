#qanda <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23qanda&src=hash> I don't care what Tony 
Abbott is like as a person. It's his policies that scare the bejesus out of me.

Can we at least just wait for Abbott to govern? Judge him as you will, but 
he's not even sworn in yet.#qanda

Knowing someone for 35 years is not proof that they are likeable. Only proof 
that you are like minded.#qanda <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23qanda&src=hash>

The rest of Labor needs to follow Plibersek's lead on not engaging in

If tonight's #qanda <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23qanda&src=hash> isn't the 
best showing of Tanya Plibersek's leadership skills I don't know what is?

Listen carefully to Plibersek drone on. This is a front contender for the 
leadership. This is Labor. What a fail.#QandA

against labor not the carbon tax. Most support it.

Good pt from Brandis. Commentariat unanimous in mockery of Clive. He's 
obviously tapped into something they're unaware of.#QandA

Is there anyone outside the Labor Caucus who thinks Bill Shorten as leader is 
actually a good idea?#qanda <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23qanda&src=hash>

Yes George, there were slogans and a pamphlet. You got elected with no agenda
