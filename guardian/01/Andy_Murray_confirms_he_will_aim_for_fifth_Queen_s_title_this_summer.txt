That made Murray the eighth four-times champion, joining John McEnroe, Boris 
Becker, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick, but no one has yet managed a fifth.

Murray, the champion in 2009, 2011, 2013 as well as 2015, said: “If I could 
win it a fifth time it would be amazing. The names that have won it four times 
– they are all great tennis players. I’ve played some of my best tennis at the 
Queen’s Club over the years.”

The 28-year-old made his debut at Queen’s in 2005 and used the club’s clay 
courts to prepare for November’s Davis Cup final.
