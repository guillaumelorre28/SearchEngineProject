Night-time politics

I have to run so here is the results of a somewhat wacky day. While there was 
lots of colour and movement, there were not as many verbs as you would think:

 * The ABCC bill passed the Senate – with some major amendments – which 
represents a win of sorts of Malcolm Turnbull. Crossbench amendments include 
security of payments, subcontractor protections and labour market testing. 
 * The 15% backpacker tax rate bill failed in the Senate – amended to 10.5% – 
which represents a fail of sorts for Turnbull.

 * In failing, Derryn Hinch changed his vote for the sake of a compromise and 
Rod Culleton split from the rest of One Nation, which swapped sides to vote 
with the government on 15%.

 * The government won over no tax man David Leyonhjelm to the 15% rate after 
the failed vote but they still need one more vote.

 * Parliament was disrupted by a major protest with protestors gluing their 
hands to the public gallery to highlight the government and opposition’s asylum 
seeker policies.

We will leave it there. Thanks to you dear readers and to my brains trust, 
Gareth Hutchens, Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp.

Thanks to Mike Bowers for more work than you can ever see from the outside.

I will leave you with some photos of the day.

Scott Morrison takes an attitude – more in sorrow than in anger.

I’m not frustrated by Labor but they are just treating this as a political 
sport.

Coalition will not return backpacker tax bill to house until crossbench 
support is clear

The treasurer, Scott Morrison, says the government will not return the bills 
to the House and the Senate until he has clear support from the crossbench.

 The 15% is the rate. That is the rate that is reasonable.


So there will be no more compromises.

The thing left hanging from today’s legislative events is:

Will the backpacker tax go back to the House and then back to the Senate today?

Remember Leyonhjelm is over the line for the government. They would need one 
more number to get 15% through the Senate.

When will the ABCC go back to the lower house for the congratulatory pics a la 
nailing the carbon price?

Such as this one from 2014.

Steve Ciobo, trade minister, is railing against the protesters

It’s a complete disrespect of public property.

He says the damage will have to be paid for by taxpayers. If protests 
continue, he raises the prospect of other measures needing to be put in place. 
Like glassing off the public galleries.

Christopher Pyne: there may well be a trail of where the miscreants came from

The protest will be fully investigated by the parliament. 

I will just take you back to a statement by the leader of the House, 
Christopher Pyne, when the parliament resumed after the protest.

On your statement on indulgence, obviously this is a very serious occurrence 
today.This is the most serious intrusion into the parliament since the riots 
organised by the ACTU in 1996, for which I was in the parliament.

In 1996, ACTU organised a barbecue on the lawns of Parliament House, which 
resulted in a riot and the invasion of the parliament. Those people who were in 
the parliament would remember it very well. A drunken riot. This is the most 
serious intrusion ... Obviously the members of the ALP don’t think this is a 
serious matter, is that right? Members of the ALP think it’s not a serious 
matter?

Labor jeered and groaned.

I’d love to proceed without interruption, Mr Speaker. This is obviously a very 
serious matter. The intrusion of the parliament and the shutting down of 
question time which, of course, is a courtesy extended to the opposition, to 
the crossbenchers by the government.

 Mr Speaker, as the speaker and as the person responsible for the House and 
the chamber,I would request that you conduct a thorough investigation because, 
obviously if people are signed in from the public to the building, and in many 
cases to the chamber, they are signed in by a member of parliament in which case
 there may well be a trail of where the miscreants who disrupted the parliament 
came from and I think it would be important to determine that. 

The government would also like to know in terms of what action might well be 
taken in the future about this matter. On behalf of the government, I would 
like to apologise to the rest of the members of the public who came to watch 
Canberra today, to watch the parliament, had your question time disrupted.

Things are getting willing in here.

Tony Burke to the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop: I refer to ongoing 
concerns about asbestos entering the Australian construction industry [by] 
illegal imports. Has the minister had any discussions with her international 
counterparts for a treaty to combat the trafficking of asbestos. If so, has the 
minister taken any advice on conflicts of interest?

The question is flicked to the industry minister, Greg Hunt. He starts on 
Labor’s pink batts program.

Tony Burke takes a point of order on evidence.

I can understand them not wanting to talk about the conflicts of interest. But 
that was the question.

Burke yells something back and the government benches call on him to withdraw.

It was impossible to hear.

Bishop answers.

I have to run so here is the results of a somewhat wacky day. While there was 
lots of colour and movement, there were not as many verbs as you would think:

 * The ABCC bill passed the Senate – with some major amendments – which 
represents a win of sorts of Malcolm Turnbull. Crossbench amendments include 
security of payments, subcontractor protections and labour market testing. 
 * The 15% backpacker tax rate bill failed in the Senate – amended to 10.5% – 
which represents a fail of sorts for Turnbull.

 * In failing, Derryn Hinch changed his vote for the sake of a compromise and 
Rod Culleton split from the rest of One Nation, which swapped sides to vote 
with the government on 15%.

 * The government won over no tax man David Leyonhjelm to the 15% rate after 
the failed vote but they still need one more vote.

 * Parliament was disrupted by a major protest with protestors gluing their 
hands to the public gallery to highlight the government and opposition’s asylum 
seeker policies.

We will leave it there. Thanks to you dear readers and to my brains trust, 
Gareth Hutchens, Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp.

Thanks to Mike Bowers for more work than you can ever see from the outside.

I will leave you with some photos of the day.

Goodnight.
 
Scott Morrison takes an attitude – more in sorrow than in anger.

I’m not frustrated by Labor but they are just treating this as a political 
sport.
 
The treasurer, Scott Morrison, says the government will not return the bills 
to the House and the Senate until he has clear support from the crossbench.

 The 15% is the rate. That is the rate that is reasonable.


So there will be no more compromises.
 
A new press photographer.
 
The thing left hanging from today’s legislative events is:

Will the backpacker tax go back to the House and then back to the Senate today?

Remember Leyonhjelm is over the line for the government. They would need one 
more number to get 15% through the Senate.

When will the ABCC go back to the lower house for the congratulatory pics a la 
nailing the carbon price?

Such as this one from 2014.

Steve Ciobo, trade minister, is railing against the protesters

It’s a complete disrespect of public property.

He says the damage will have to be paid for by taxpayers. If protests 
continue, he raises the prospect of other measures needing to be put in place. 
Like glassing off the public galleries.
 
This is both disturbing and strangely compelling.

The protest will be fully investigated by the parliament. 

I will just take you back to a statement by the leader of the House, 
Christopher Pyne, when the parliament resumed after the protest.

On your statement on indulgence, obviously this is a very serious occurrence 
today.This is the most serious intrusion into the parliament since the riots 
organised by the ACTU in 1996, for which I was in the parliament.

In 1996, ACTU organised a barbecue on the lawns of Parliament House, which 
resulted in a riot and the invasion of the parliament. Those people who were in 
the parliament would remember it very well. A drunken riot. This is the most 
serious intrusion ... Obviously the members of the ALP don’t think this is a 
serious matter, is that right? Members of the ALP think it’s not a serious 
matter?

Labor jeered and groaned.

I’d love to proceed without interruption, Mr Speaker. This is obviously a very 
serious matter. The intrusion of the parliament and the shutting down of 
question time which, of course, is a courtesy extended to the opposition, to 
the crossbenchers by the government.

 Mr Speaker, as the speaker and as the person responsible for the House and 
the chamber,I would request that you conduct a thorough investigation because, 
obviously if people are signed in from the public to the building, and in many 
cases to the chamber, they are signed in by a member of parliament in which case
 there may well be a trail of where the miscreants who disrupted the parliament 
came from and I think it would be important to determine that. 

The government would also like to know in terms of what action might well be 
taken in the future about this matter. On behalf of the government, I would 
like to apologise to the rest of the members of the public who came to watch 
Canberra today, to watch the parliament, had your question time disrupted.
