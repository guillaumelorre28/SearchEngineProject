Even Lord Shorty, the leading light of Trinidadian calypso, could see that it 
had run its course by the early 70s. In search of a new sound, he turned to the 
"chutney music" of Trinidad's Indian community. It led to a string of songs 
such as Indrani, which pioneered what Shorty called sokah. When it mutated into 
Soca and started to dominate Trinidad carnival, Shorty railed against its 
rampant sexualisation â€“ a little rich for a man who'd fathered 23 children.
