and eco-pods to choose from. Demelza Farm's twist on the trend is a collection

spacious models built for the Romany communities from the 50s onwards. Restored 
interiors are charmingly chintzy with lace curtains and retro furniture, and 
include wood-burning stoves and gas cookers. The site, on Martin and Lucy's 
organic farm, has a central camp fire and composting toilet, and a caravan is 
currently being converted into a shower and wash room (opening in May). As well 
as the many fine beaches around Cornwall's western tip, the surrounding 
countryside is rich in ancient sites; walk to Celtic burial chambers of Mulfra 
Quoit, Zennor Quoit and Men-an-tol, andChysauster Iron Age settlement

it you can give your nerves a final test on the tree jump, a 40ft leap of faith 
from a treetop platform.
