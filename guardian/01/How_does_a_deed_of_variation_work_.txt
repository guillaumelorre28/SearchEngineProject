Q In the many queries on the recent changes to inheritance tax (IHT) there has 
been no mention of the deed of variation, which my wife and I were told by our 
solicitor to include in our wills. Do we need to update them in light of these 
reforms?

A Are you sure you are not confusing this with a will trust? If not, it could 
be time to find another solicitor as yours doesn't seem too bright. The deed of 
variation is not something you put in a will - it's a legal device that enables 
your will to be rewritten in the two years after your death if all the 
beneficiaries agree. It can also enable a will to be created if you died 
intestate (without a will).

This can be useful for IHT purposes. It means your estate could be left to a 
surviving spouse or given away to a charity, or perhaps used in generation 
skipping where the value of the estate goes not to your children but to your 
grandchildren.
