Back in the day, I played Frontier: Elite II on my Atari ST. As far as I can 
tell, Frontier isn't available for PCs, aside from a DOS version which I can't 
get to work even with an emulator. Do you know of any comparable games that 
might satisfy my nostalgia? Chris Morris

You can download Frontier: Elite II and First Encounters from the Elite Club 
<http://www.eliteclub.co.uk/download/> site. These are shareware, so you can 
play them free for 30 days, after which registration costs Â£5. If it doesn't 
work, you're supposed to be able to run it withDosBox 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DosBox>, which I assume is the one you tried.

So, we're looking for an open-ended space flight game with trading, combat 
(Frontier has more of the trading) and perhaps role-playing elements.

The ones most often mentioned in this context are Microsoft's Freelancer 
<http://www.microsoft.com/games/pc/freelancer.aspx> (trial version available), 
Egosoft'sX3: Reunion <http://www.egosoft.com/games/x3/info_en.php> and DarkStar 
One <http://www.darkstar-one.com/>.

What do you think?

For completeness, I should also mention Elite 4, about which there is an 
official FAQ dated 2000,2001 <http://www.frontier.co.uk/games/elite4/faq.html>. 
Play.com reckons it's "Due for release on 28/11/2008 
<http://www.play.com/Games/PC/4-/680942/Elite-IV-The-Next-Encounter/Product.html>
". You might get a different answer fromNostradamus
