It’s not entirely ridiculous to suggest Bill and Ted, the scatterbrained 
heroes ofBill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFy17auuK08> fame, could be a rifftastic, 
southern Californian reincarnation of a certain revolutionary pair called Marx 
and Engels.

It was Marx, after all, who said history repeats itself as farce, and what 
could be more farcical than unleashing the likes of Napoleon, Socrates and 
Genghis Khan on the malls and water parks of 1980s Los Angeles? Then there’s 
the film’s conclusion: a pair of metal-heads create a utopia, not through 
doctrine and manifesto, but with guitar heroics and the radical catch cry, “Be 
excellent to each other”.

Alas, we’re not here to discuss Excellent Adventure, but the song which gets 
it underway: Big Pig’s Breakaway. And, much like the film it features in, 
Breakaway is about fighting fate and a longing for freedom.

“All my life I wanted to fly, like the birds that you see way up in the sky,” 
it begins. “Making circles in the morning sun, flying high in the sky ‘till the 
day is done.”

It’s some poetic imagery vocalist Sherine Abeyratne delivers, though it’s 
quickly dealt a blow: “I can’t break away!” comes the booming reality check 
from the back-up singers.

Abeyratne then compares herself to a “child in his fantasy” who is “punching 
holes in the walls of reality”. Yet fantasy is all it is, because, she says, “I 
don’t have the wings and I wonder why”.

The frustrations of growing up is a universal theme, though it’s possible to 
read the lyrics another way. The original version of Breakaway started life as 
a late-career obscurity for 60s soul man Chuck Jackson, and it’s not hard to 
hear a civil rights undertone in his recording.

Sung in the female voice – “Stand tall girl, you’re number one”, goes the Big 
Pig version – it has another resonance altogether. A different version, a 
different social bind.

The genius of Big Pig though is what they do to the track sonically. There’s a 
brooding industrial exotica to its take. It’s more a punk-funk mutation than a 
new-wave makeover.

Instead of Hammond and strings, we get eastern-ish synths over a pulsating 
bass line, and a band of percussionists who’ve been gorging on Japanese taiko 
drumming. (Nothing brings out their changes like the remix found on the 
flipside of the 12” cut.)

At times, Big Pig had nine drummers. But, unusually for an Australian group of 
the 80s, never a guitarist.

Elsewhere, they push parts of the original to the fore. The nonsensical cries 
of the chorus, for example. “Ah-min-ah, do-ki-do, ah-mah-neh-la,” they chirp in 
the original and bellow in the remake. It adds another layer of foreignness to 
Big Pig’s interpretation. (Melbourne producer Michael Ozone took this trick to 
its extreme in 2012,releasing a song 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1MidHHTkrw> recorded entirely in “native 
Ozone”.)

The elevated place of the back-up singers brings out another element of the 
song: the interplay between the protagonist’s hopes and doubts. Every time she 
pines for freedom, they knock her down. Freud might call them the voice of the 
superego, forcefully reminding her of society’s rules and expectations. They 
are so oppressive that, in the end, she herself is singing the same refrain.

Excellent Adventure seems to show you can break away and change the course of 
your destiny. Instead of flunking school, Bill and Ted end poverty, bring peace 
to Earth and make the planets align. Or perhaps this was written in their stars 
all along, as it was with Abeyratne and her drums of destiny.
