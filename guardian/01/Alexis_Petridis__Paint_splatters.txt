You can see where some trends in fashion come from: the influence of the way 
the clothes are worn in a big film; the style exhibited by an influential star 
or a rock band or habitués of a nightclub with a distinctive look. Then there 
are others who seem to have been plucked out of nowhere: you imagine all the 
designers sitting around towards the end of whatever long meeting they have 
where these things are decided, suggesting pretty much any old cobblers in the 
hope of wrapping things up so they can get back to their ateliers in time forA 
Place In The Sun: Home Or Away

I assume this monkey-tennis stage is where this season's vogue for paint 
splatters is rooted. It's not without precedent, usually among people who want 
to align themselves with the fierce artistic spirit ofJackson Pollock 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock> – such as The Stone Roses 
<http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/> and The Clash <http://www.theclash.com/>, who 
wore paint-spattered uniforms in their early days. This time the look is more 
extreme: photos in style mags suggest everything from blitzkrieg by the seagull 
Luftwaffe to manhandled out of B&Q following a psychotic episode: "Applied to 
trouser legs towards the cuff, the splatters travelled upwards to give an 
impression of having jumped in a puddle of spilt emulsion," wrote one of the 
Gaultier collection.

I'm duty-bound to say that, in moderation, I think paint-splatters look pretty 
good, perhaps because I'm from a generation for whom The Stone Roses were a 
game-changer. One item, probably a shirt: fine. Head to toe, as some stylists 
seem to suggest: short cut to looking like a decorator's radio.
