 After a lifetime spent denouncing the Catholic church and routinely describing 
the Pope as the "Antichrist", Ian Paisley yesterday held "cordial" private 
talks with the Archbishop of Armagh. The meeting, at the Democratic Unionist 
party's offices in the Stormont assembly building, marks a significant 
milestone in the cautious process of normalising inter-community relations in 
Northern Ireland.
It also signals the countdown to intensive political discussions due to start 
in St Andrews tomorrow, aimed at restoring a devolved, power-sharing government 
to the province.

Both Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister, will be at the 
three-day summit.

For decades Mr Paisley has launched tirades against the "Romish" church. There 
have been signs, however, of the DUP softening its line recently.

The meeting with Sean Brady, Catholic Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all 
Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland>, lasted an hour and a half. 
They shook hands - but not in sight of the cameras - and had scones and tea. 
The DUP delegation included three other MPs, Peter Robinson, Nigel Dodds and 
Gregory Campbell. The talks were described by a party spokesman as "cordial". 
Further talks are planned.

Archbishop Brady said: "We discussed the benefits that would derive to all 
parts of the community from a stable and devolved administration."
