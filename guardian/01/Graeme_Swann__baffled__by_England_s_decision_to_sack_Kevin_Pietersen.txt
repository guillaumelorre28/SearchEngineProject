Graeme Swann says he was "baffled" by England's decision to sack Kevin 
Pietersen <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen> and says he 
witnessed nothing on the Australia tour to indicate why the batsman has been 
cast aside now.

Pietersen's international career was effectively brought to a close 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/04/kevin-pietersen-england-ecb> on 
Tuesday night when he was omitted from the upcoming tour of the Caribbean and 
ICC World Twenty20, with the 33-year-old all but conceding in a joint statement 
that it was the end of the line for him with England.

Writing in his column in The Sun 
<http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/cricket/5425428/Kevin-Pietersens-axing-baffled-me-completed-amazing-few-days-for-England.html>
, Swann said: "I'll be honest about Kevin Pietersen – myself and several other 
England players were not exactly members of his fan club during the Textgate 
scandal of 2012.

"But I changed my opinion of him once he was reintegrated back into the 
England team towards the end of that year.

"He made a huge effort to improve his attitude around the dressing room. I saw 
or heard no issues with him in Australia this winter, his approach was 
exceptional.

"That's why I was baffled on Tuesday when he was effectively sacked as an 
England player."

The former spinner said he would have understood if Pietersen's career with 
England had finished after Textgate. "But to go through the reintegration 
process and then, just 15 months later, discard him for good seems very 
strange."

He added: "Clearly, Kevin must have upset people enough for the England 
hierarchy to decide he is no longer wanted. Don't forget we're not talking 
about a middling player here – we're talking about a batsman of sublime talent."
