 Katsushika Hokusai: Ejiri in Suruga Province. Colour woodblock, 1830-33. 
Photograph: British Museum 
Hokusai – Ejiri in Suruga Province (1830-33), from the series 36 Views of 
Mount Fuji
People are caught in a gust of wind on the open road, holding on to their 
hats, bending into the gale as sheets of paper fly up in the air. Mount Fuji 
sits motionless behind them, untroubled by anything so small as a breath of 
wind. Hokusai contrasts its permanence with the flux and comedy of our lives, 
blown this way and that like bits of paper.
