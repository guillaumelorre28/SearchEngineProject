It was intended, according to its creator, as a “warning to America”, a 
horrifying and fantastical vision of the future in which the US – ludicrously – 
had elected as its presidentDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>. 

But with the property billionaire now the favourite to gain the Republican 
nomination for the presidency, the episode ofThe Simpsons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-simpsons> that in 2000 foresaw 
such a laughable outcome <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxjM1yCcqTQ> has 
begun looking unnervingly prescient.

 Bart to the Future, first aired on 19 March 2000. 
A possible future Trump presidency, said the episode’s writer Dan Greaney, 
“just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom. It was pitched 
because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane”.


The episode, broadcast almost exactly 16 years ago on 19 March 2000, saw Bart 
offered a vision of his future in which he is a beer-swilling bum, while his 
sister Lisa has become president, following Trump’s time in office.

“As you know, we’ve inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump,” 
Lisa – who describes herself as “America’s first straight, female president” – 
tells her advisers from behind her Oval Office desk. “How bad is it? The 
country is broke? How can it be?”

The previous regime, she is told, made the mistake of “investing in our 
nation’s children … The balanced breakfast programme just created a generation 
of ultra-strong supercriminals. And midnight basketball just taught them to 
function without sleep.”

Bart’s vision, he is told, is 30 years in the future, which would mean Trump 
is hoping to claim the White House either six or ten years ahead of Greaney’s 
prediction - depending on whether his fictional counterpart serves one or two 
terms in the White House.

Donald Trump thanked his family and supporters on Tuesday as he celebrated wins 
in several key state primaries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/mar/15/donald-trump-wins-primary-florida-video>
He told the Hollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-writer-who-predicted-trump-876295>
, “The important thing is that Lisa comes into the presidency when America is 
on the ropes and that is the condition left by the Trump presidency. What we 
needed was for Lisa to have problems that were beyond her fixing, that 
everything went as bad as it possibly could, and that’s why we had Trump be 
president before her.”

The Simpsons <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-simpsons>, he said, 
“has always kind of embraced the over-the-top side of American culture … and 
[Trump] is just the fulfilment of that.”

In a separate brief animation <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz7_JP7ROvA>, 
released by the Simpsons broadcaster Fox in July, Homer is paid to attend a 
Trump campaign rally (“Do you care who the next president is? No? Come with 
me”), where he is captured by rogue fronds of Trump’s puzzling hairstyle before 
being dragged off by two security guards. The presidential candidate’s podium 
slogan reads: “America, you can be my ex-wife!”

• This article was corrected on 18 March 2016. It originally stated that the 
Trump president in Bart’s vision had claimed the White House 14 years ahead of 
now. The correct figure is six or 10 years depending on whether Trump’s 
fictional counterpart serves one or two terms. This has been changed.
