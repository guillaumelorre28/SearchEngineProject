The Mail on Sunday <https://www.theguardian.com/media/mailonsunday> has 
appointed the former Independent on Sunday editor Tristan Davies as co-deputy 
editor, along with Tobyn Andreae, currently assistant editor at the title’s 
stablemate the Daily Mail.

Staff were informed via a note from Mail on Sunday editor Geordie Greig. The 
changes will take effect from the week beginning 5 September.

The pair replace Gerard Greaves, who was poached by Daily Mail editor Paul 
Dacre

 to replace his long-serving deputy Jon Steafel.

Davies was already serving as assistant editor on the Mail on Sunday, having 
joined from the Sunday Times where he was executive editor with responsibility 
for design.

Andreae has held a number of senior roles at the Daily Mail, including 
executive features editor and editor of Femail, the paper’s women-focused 
section.

Staff were also informed that David Dillon and Tim Smith, both currently 
assistant editors, are being promoted to executive editor roles.
Earlier this year, Steafel, long seen as a potential successor to Dacre, was 
announced as group managing editor and publisher of Mail Plus, a new role which 
gives him oversight of the newspaper’s tablet edition.
