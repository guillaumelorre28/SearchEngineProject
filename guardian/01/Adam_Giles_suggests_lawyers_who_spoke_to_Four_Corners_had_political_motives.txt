Adam Giles has suggested lawyers who exposed abuse in the Northern Territory’s 
Don Dale youth detention centre could have been politically motivated, asking: 
“How many lawyers on the Four Corners show were members of theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party>?”

The Northern Territory’s chief minister made the comment during a debate with 
territory Labor MP Natasha Fyles on Darwin’s Mix 104.9FM on Friday morning, but 
swiftly denied he was attempting to politicise the issue.

“I’m not making suggestions, I’m trying to focus on the kids,” he said. “When 
I get attacked about politics when I’m trying to do the right thing by fixing 
the system, I’m going to fight back.”

He also confirmed he had seen footage of six teenage boys being sprayed with 
teargas in Don Dale’s behavioural management unit before it was shown on Four 
Corners, but said: “The first I’d seen of any footage before we came to 
government was on Monday night.

“I had seen the footage of the gassing component before because that was in 
our time of government – it has been referred to police, it has been in media,” 
he said. “But any of the footage before we came to government I hadn’t seen.”

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced a royal commission in response 
to shocking footage shown on the program, which depicted children in detention 
being assaulted, sprayed with teargas and, in one instance, hooded and shackled 
to a chair.

The lawyer Peter O’Brien, who acts for Dylan Voller, an Indigenous boy 
reportedly subject to incidents of physical abuse at the hands of guards at the 
territory’s youth detention centres between 2010 and 2015, dismissed 
suggestions the allegations were political.

“Only someone who uses child imprisonment as a political bargaining chip could 
suggest that the current allegations of abuse are political,” he said on 
Twitter.

Jared Sharp, senior criminal lawyer for the Northern Australia Aboriginal 
Justice Agency, who also spoke on the program, said he was not a Labor member 
and accused Giles of “outrageous mud smearing.”

Since the footage aired on Monday night, Giles has repeatedly pointed to 
incidents that occurred under the previous Labor government, sayingon Sky News 
on Tuesday that 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/27/adam-giles-defends-record-on-youth-detention-after-northern-territory-abuse-revelations>
 “the Labor party in the Northern Territory has a lot to answer for”.

Turnbull confirmed on Thursday that the territory government had had input 
into the terms of reference for the royal commission, which will be conducted 
by former NT supreme court judge Brian Ross Martin and is toreport to 
parliament by 31 March.

Lawyers and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations said the 
territory government should have been excluded from the process, because the 
inquiry would examine policies, decisions and actions taken under the guidance 
of Giles and his ministers.

The attorney general, George Brandis, said that Giles had been the first 
person to say there should be a royal commission, in a 1am press release on 
Tuesday, and that his “contribution to this process has been exemplary”.

“This is a chief minister saying there should be a royal commission into his 
own government and previous Labor governments in the Northern Territory,” 
Brandistold ABC’s AM program on Friday 
<http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2016/s4509549.htm>.
“I found Mr Giles extremely cooperative. In fact, the terms of reference are 
somewhat broader than they would otherwise have been as a result of Mr Giles’s 
contribution.”
