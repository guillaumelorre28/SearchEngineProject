Former HBOS <https://www.theguardian.com/business/hbos> executives will learn 
whether they face fresh investigations into their conduct in the run up to the 
bank’s near collapse in 2008.

Thursday’s publication of the much-delayed and long-anticipated report into 
what went wrong at the bank will be published alongside an opinion commissioned 
by the regulators into the decision in 2012 to only punish one former executive.

There were reports that the review will say there are grounds to reconsider 
the scope of the original investigation and that the regulators will assess 
whether to embark on a fresh wave of investigations. Individuals are not 
expected to be singled out.

Peter Cummings, the former head of commercial arm of HBOS, is the only bank 
executive to have been censured over the affair. He was investigated by the now 
defunct Financial Services Authority (FSA) following the takeover of HBOS by 
Lloyds TSBin September 2008 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/marketturmoil.hbosbusiness> 
and the subsequent £20bn taxpayer bailout of the enlarged bank. Cummings was
fined £500,000 and banned from the City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/12/hbos-banker-peter-cummings-banned-fined-fsa>
 in September 2012.

He accused the regulator of “tokenism” when the fine was handed out, and 
argued it was “inherently unfair” that he was only the only individual facing 
disciplinary action.

That decision has been the subject of a review by Alan Green QC, who has been 
asked 
<http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/news/2014/tor110714.pdf> 
to consider the “reasonableness” of the FSA’s decision, and whether “the 
regulators should consider afresh whether any other former members of HBOS’s 
senior management should be subject to an investigation with a view to 
prohibition proceedings”.

Green’s review is being published alongside an offcial report, which runs to 
at least 500 pages and was first scheduled for publication in 2013 – when the 
FSA will still in existence. It is being published by the FSA’s successor 
bodies: the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England’s Prudential 
Regulation Authority.

Its publication comes two years after a parliamentary commission accused 
former HBOS chief executives James Crosby and Andy Hornby, and the bank’s 
former chairman Lord Stevenson, of a“colossal failure of management” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/04/bankers-brought-down-hbos>. 
That report, by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, also 
criticised the FSA – which was disbanded in 2013 – for a series of regulatory 
failures.

In addition to Cummings, the FSA also censured the Bank of Scotland arm of HBOS
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/09/bank-of-scotland-fsa-serious-misconduct>
 for not have having risk controls that could keep up with its pace of growth 
in the face of a deteriorating economy.

One of the key findings of the censure in 2012 was that “the culture of 
optimism impeded the effective management of transactions as they became 
stressed”. It also said that the bank had been told by auditors KPMG that it 
would be prudent to start setting aside far bigger provisions to cover looming 
bad debts.

At the time of its takeover by Lloyds, HBOS operated a federated structure 
with six divisions. Each division had its own chief executive, who had autonomy 
in managing their businesses.

Crosby was group chief executive until 2006 when Hornby took over after 
running the high-street operations. Hornby’s current employer, Gala Coral, is 
expected to back him when the report is published.

While Hornby did not receive a payoff, executive members of the board received 
paymentsworth around £1m in total through “change of control” clauses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/11/mps-inquiry-hbos-directors-bonuses>
 in their contracts which paid out through the Lloyds takeover. They have also 
amassed pension pots which will pay out when they retire - althoughin 2013 
Crosby gave back 30% of his £580,000-a-year pension and his knighthood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/09/james-crosby-give-up-knighthood-pension>
.

If new investigations do lead any enforcement action, the former executives 
will not face financial penalties. This is because fines cannot be imposed for 
any wrongdoing unless there is significant new information as regulators needed 
to warn executives of enforcement action before a six-year statute of 
limitations ran out last year.

Regulators <https://www.theguardian.com/business/regulators> have dealt with 
more than 1,500 representations from 35 individuals in a process known as 
Maxwellisation, which requires individuals in the report to see information 
about themselves.
