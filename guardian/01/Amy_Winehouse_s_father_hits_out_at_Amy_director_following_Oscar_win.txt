Amy Winehouse’s father has hit out, again, at the makers of an acclaimed film 
about his daughter, after Asif Kapadia’sAmy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/amy> won the best documentary prize at Sunday 
night’s Oscars.

Mitch Winehouse lambasted director Kapadia for painting a “negative, spiteful 
and misleading” portrayal of his daughter, and hinted once again that he was 
working on a rival documentary, adding: “We will fix this.”

In a further tweet, he accused Kapadia of making the film out of a sense of 
self-interest, rather than because the film-maker cared about his daughter. 
“Amy will not get an Oscar though. Just Asif Kapadia,” he said. “That is what 
this is all about … Asif. He’s fooled everybody.”

I am not changing my stance just because film won Oscar. It's a negative, 
spiteful and misleading portrayal of Amy. We will fix this.

Mitch Winehouse and Amy’s makers have been at loggerheads since the 
documentary’s debut at last year’s Cannes film festival. At the time,the 
Winehouse family released a statement

 claiming the film contained “misleading”, “unfounded” and “unbalanced” 
allegations about the singer’s relatives and management.

Mitch Winehouse later described the film as “very hurtful” and said Kapadia 
had “missed a trick 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/15/amy-winehouses-father-laments-missed-chance-of-documentary>
”, by focusing on his daughter’s drug addiction.In July last year, it was 
reported 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/amy-winehouse-father-reg-traviss-plan-film-amy-documentary>
 that he and the singer’s former fiance, Reg Traviss, were planning their own 
documentary to address issues raised in Kapadia’s film.

“We are looking to do something positive. There are so many great things in 
Amy’s life that were missed in that film. It was a great opportunity that Asif 
Kapadia had and he didn’t grab it,”said Winehouse in October 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/15/amy-winehouses-father-laments-missed-chance-of-documentary>
. “Let’s hear something new about Amy.”

In other post-Oscars news, Sylvester Stallone’s brother Frank has apologised 
<https://twitter.com/Stallone/status/704427003324141570> for insulting British 
best supporting actor winnerMark Rylance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/29/mark-rylance-follows-oscar-win-with-olivier-award-nomination>
.

After Rylance triumphed for his portrayal of a Soviet agent in Steven 
Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies, Frank Stallone took to Twitter to question why his 
brother, the runaway pre-Oscars favourite, had not claimed the prize. “The 
Academy should be ashamed of themselves,” he tweeted. “It’s as clear as the 
nose on your face that Sly won. Mark who? It’s total Hollywood bullshit.” He 
then suggest Rylance should “have been embarrassed” by his victory, adding: 
“Mark Rylance couldn’t even comb his hair for Christ sake this is the 3rd time 
Sly’s gotten ripped off.”

After a period of reflection, Frank Stallone then tweeted: “I will always 
defend what right but I was wrong to put down Mark Rylance and I apologise. He 
is a fine actor but I thought Sly deserved it.”

Sly himself had earlier taken to Instagram to address the controversy. “I’m 
very happy and please understand my brother is so emotional because he is just 
very protective and only wants the best for me,” he wrote. “Life is good!”
