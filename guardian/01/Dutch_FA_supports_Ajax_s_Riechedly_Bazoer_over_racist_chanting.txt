The Dutch FA (KNVB) has said it would have supported Ajax’s Riechedly Bazoer 
if the midfielder had walked off the pitch after he was subjected to racist 
chants from opposition supporters over the weekend.

The 19-year-old, who has been scouted by Arsenal

 in the past, was targeted by a section of ADO Den Haag supporters making 
monkey noises during Ajax’s 1-0 victory on Sunday.

“Jungle sounds are awful,” the governing body tweeted. “We will send the 
images and reports to the prosecutor.”

Their director of operations, Gijs de Jong, added: “We would have accepted it 
in this case if Riechedly Bazoer,Ajax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ajax> or referee Pol van Boekel had 
walked off the field.

“They would not have been addressed by the KNVB. They would have been 
supported.

“Let me be very clear: we absolutely do not want this kind of behaviour. This 
is not what football is all about. Football connects people regardless of their 
religion, colour, sexual orientation or ethnicity.

“About 10 years ago it was decided that the decision to end the game was to be 
taken away from the referee, because the job of the referee is difficult 
enough.”

Ajax’s coach, Frank De Boer, described the actions of the Den Haag supporters 
as “outrageous. I could not believe it because they also have many players with 
that skin colour,” De Boer told Fox Sports.

“I asked my assistant Hennie Spijkerman: ‘Are they making jungle sounds?’ It 
does not belong on the field and it is outrageous that it happens in 
Netherlands.”

In a statement ADO condemned the fans and confirmed that an investigation is 
under way. “The club, board, management, staff, technical staff, players and 
volunteers were very unpleasantly surprised by the offensive chants that have 
been expressed from the stands towards one Ajax player.

“We do not accept these chants and we condemn the behavior of some people in 
our stadium and distance ourselves from such hurtful statements.”
