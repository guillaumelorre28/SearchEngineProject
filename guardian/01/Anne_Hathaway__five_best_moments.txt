Making the difficult transition from Disney poppet to woman with Oscar, Anne 
Hathaway has managed an impressive grown-up career. Her latest film,The Intern 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/23/the-intern-review-robert-de-niro-anne-hathaway>
, promises plenty of beautifully lit scenes of her in beautifully designed 
buildings wearing beautifully designed outfits.

But before you head to the cinema, armed with a pad to note which colours you 
think could work in your house, here are five of her greatest scenes.

Brokeback Mountain

After a drastic and somewhat unsuccessful attempt to rebel against her image 
in the gang-culture dramaHavoc 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115278/havoc>, Hathaway bagged a small 
role inAng Lee <https://www.theguardian.com/film/anglee>’s Oscar-winning romance
Brokeback Mountain <https://www.theguardian.com/film/brokeback-mountain>. She 
might have existed outside of the main love affair but her role as a brassy yet 
tortured southern wife showed big promise.

The Devil Wears Prada

While Meryl Streep <https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep> inarguably 
stole the show as the softly spoken gorgon who made her staff’s lives miserable 
in this sharp comedy, Hathaway deserves recognition for providing a likable 
lump of putty for her to play with. Her engaging turn as an innocent wannabe 
writer was an extension of her role inThe Princess Diaries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89709/princess.diaries> with added 
bite, as shown in this makeover scene.

Rachel Getting Married

Jonathan Demme <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jonathan-demme>’s 
stripped-back family drama gave Hathaway the opportunity to add some grit to 
her squeaky clean repertoire as the drug-taking, smart-talking black sheep who 
is released from rehab to attend her sister’s wedding. It earned her an Oscar 
nomination for best actress and launched her as a serious actor.

The Dark Knight Rises

Another opportunity to shed her cutesy persona arrived in 2012, courtesy of 
Christopher Nolan <https://www.theguardian.com/film/christopher-nolan>’s 
conclusion to the Batman trilogy. There was an initial hostility towards the 
casting of Hathaway as Catwoman but she defied expectations and gave a dark, 
sexy performance as a woman without conscience. It was also the start of a key 
year for Hathaway …

… who subsequently appeared in Tom Hooper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-hooper>’s Oscarbait take on the classic 
musical. The impressive cast, includingHugh Jackman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/hugh-jackman>, Eddie Redmayne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/eddie-redmayne> and Amanda Seyfried 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/amanda-seyfried>, all sang their hearts out 
but it was Hathaway’s haunting turn as the doomed Fantine that stole the show. 
It was this scene in particular that secured Hathaway her first Oscar.
