Independence matters. It means that we can pursue a story without fear of 
where it might take us. We can expose corruption or foul play wherever we find 
it. No shareholders, advertisers or billionaire owners can tell us to censor, 
edit or drop a story. Our unique ownership structure ensures this. The Scott 
Trust, set up in 1936, is our sole shareholder, safeguarding our financial and 
editorial independence, and liberal values, in perpetuity. All profits of the 
organisation are re-invested in journalism and the constitution of The Scott 
Trust Limited contains provisions to ensure that no shareholder can benefit 
financially.
