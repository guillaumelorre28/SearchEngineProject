There are no egg-stealing pigs in the latest spin-off from games firm Rovio 
Entertainment.Angry Birds <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/angry-birds>? 
Well, given that it’s a series of young-adult (YA) novels with a piratical 
theme, perhaps there’ll be a few parrots.

Storm Sisters <http://stormsisters.rovio.com/> is the latest project from the 
Finnish company, as it expands further into the book publishing world. Written 
by Mintie Das, the first novel The Sinking World will be published in late 2015 
or early 2016.

The book is one of 12 being showcased at the Books at Berlinale event in 
February, which touts upcoming books to film companies for possible adaptation.

Rovio is describing Storm Sisters books as “a high action pirate adventure 
with a female twist”, focusing on five 11-17 year-old girls disguised as “girl 
pirates” in the late 18th century.

“After the tragic events of what has become known as the Day of Destruction - 
a day when they were intended to die along with their families - Charlie, 
Sadie, Liu, Raquel and Ingela sail the high seas all alone. In the 1780s, in a 
world filled with pirates, hurricanes and disbelievers, that’s not an easy 
task. What’s more important: Survival or truth?”

A second novel, The Frozen Seas, will follow the first. Author Das lives in 
Angry Birds’ home city of Helsinki, having been born in India then raised in 
the US.

This being the company behind Angry Birds, are there apps for that? Nothing 
has been announced so far, but it would be surprising if Rovio wasn’t planning 
to take the Storm Sisters tales to smartphones and tablets in some form – 
either games or book-apps.

This is far from the first foray into book publishing for the company, though. 
Angry Birds hasspawned a series of books <https://www.angrybirds.com/read> and 
comics, including some published through partnerships with Penguin and National 
Geographic.

“It’s important for kids to read. I don’t care where they read or how they get 
interested in reading. It’s more important that they do get interested in it,” 
Rovio’s vice president of book publishing Sanna Lukandertold the Guardian in 
February 2013 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/feb/18/angry-birds-books>.

Storm Sisters also represents the latest attempt by Rovio to build new brands 
beyond Angry Birds – this time leading with print books, rather than mobile 
games. It is also another example of Rovio targeting girls in particular,
