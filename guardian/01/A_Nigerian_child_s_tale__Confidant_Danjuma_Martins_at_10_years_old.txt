Confidant Danjuma Martins fidgets on the couch and hides her face shyly behind 
a decorative throw as she considers how to answer the question. Does she like 
her maternal great-aunt’s village in Kaduna state, where she has lived since 
2012?

“I don’t like staying in the village,” the 10-year-old blurts out suddenly, in 
response to her mother’s gentle prodding. “[People] are wicked in the village, 
and they curse and fight.”

The family moved from a district of bustling, chaotic Lagos in 2008, after the 
death of Confidant’s father, Danjuma, a waiter in a high-end Lagos hotel.

Her father was HIV-positive, but Confidant was born free of the virus – her 
parents scraped together for a costly caesarean 
<http://preview.gutools.co.uk/world/2005/jun/21/hearafrica05.development6> to 
prevent the virus being passed on. But she doesn’t feel fortunate in her new 
life.

The loss of her father was devastating for a family already struggling to make 
ends meet. Unable to meet the city’s financial demands, Confidant’s mother, 
Deborah, returned to their northern home with her four children. She took a job 
cleaning a local orphanage, earning just 10,000 naira (£32) monthly to feed and 
clothe the family. It is not unusual for extended family networks to provide a 
financial cushion in times of hardship, and Confidant, the youngest, was sent 
away to live in her great-aunt’s village to ease the monetary burden.

Confidant leaves home early to walk the 1km to school, often making it there 
even before the teacher arrives at 7.30am. The government-run school is 
sparsely furnished but neat, and has cement floors, chairs and desks, 
blackboards and a toilet for each class.

After school, Confidant draws water from a well in her great-aunt’s compound 
to use for bathing and washing dishes at home. She also helps with collecting 
firewood and plucking palm kernels so that the oil can be sold in the market to 
boost the family’s income.


“When I took her in, my husband was very happy because she helps around the 
house. She is the only child in the house. All my nine children are not alive,” 
says Asabe Dauda, her 56-year-old great-aunt.


Asabe has concerns about her charge’s education, although she feels powerless 
to do much about it. She has visited the school only once, to make a formal 
complaint. “They give them homework but don’t mark it, so we don’t know if the 
child is underperforming or not,” said Asabe.

Confidant is often sickly, and says she is routinely prescribed painkillers, 
antibiotics, antimalarials and vitamin C from the small government clinic in 
the village.

Today, though, she is happy to be back from her great-aunt’s with her 
siblings, and soon runs off to play with her 12-year-old sister, Faith.

Deborah had envisaged better prospects when she made the 1,000km journey north 
three years ago. She bought a small plot of land on the outskirts of Kaduna 
city for $200 in 2010. A friend helped her build the house, which is down a 
dusty footpath surrounded by maize fields. There is no running water, but they 
can go for days without power blackouts. That’s better than in other areas of a 
country with a dire power problem; arecent survey 
<http://allafrica.com/stories/201508190890.html> showed that the average power 
supply received by Nigerian households is less than six hours a day.

When Confidant visits her mother in the city, the three siblings – aged 18, 15 
and 12 – all share a bedroom, while Confidant sleeps in another bedroom with 
her mother, great-aunt and another aunt who is incapacitated with hepatitis C 
and diabetes. Dusty burlap bags of rice and grain are squeezed alongside 
personal belongings in a “storage room”.

There have been some advantages to moving out of Lagos. The house is less 
cramped, and they rent out a rickety outdoor room to another woman, which 
boosts Deborah’s income by $80 a month.


“When I moved here in 2012 … that was just after the post-election crisis 
<http://preview.gutools.co.uk/world/2011/apr/18/nigerian-election-marred-by-violence>
 of 2011,” Deborah says, shuddering as she recalled the bloodshed in which more 
than 800 people died in riots. “It was really scary living here with just me 
and my children. I [rented] the kitchen out so that I can have a companion to 
live with.”

The unpainted walls are adorned with lovingly framed pictures. One shows a 
smiling, younger Deborah embracing her late husband, her face free from the 
worry etched on it today.
