 Born Donald Randolph in South Carolina in 1938, Covay grew up performing with 
his family’s gospel quartet before forming the doo-wop group Rainbows. Covay 
went on to hone his craft in the famous Brill building in New York, where his 
songs were recorded by Gladys Knight and the Pips and Wilson Pickett. Bobby 
Womack, Small Faces and Gene Vincent are among the other artists to have 
recorded Covay’s music.

 In 1966, now established as a songwriter, Covay formed the Soul Clan, an R&B 
supergroup featuring Solomon Burke, Ben E King, Joe Tex and Arthur Kingley. 
During the 1970s, Covay continued to have hits while working for the A&R 
department at Mercury Records. These included the 1973 song I Was Checkin’ Out, 
She Was Checkin’ In <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCtw2qS4L5M> and 1975’s 
Rumble In the Jungle <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGvpwl5lFDk>, inspired by 
the famous boxing clash between Muhammad Ali and George Forman.

 Covay’s daughter, Ursula Covay Parkes, confirmed the singer’s death. It is 
believed he was suffering from illnesses as a result of a stroke he had in 1992.
