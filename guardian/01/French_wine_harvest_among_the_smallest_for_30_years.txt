This year’s French wine harvest is among the smallest for 30 years, down 10 
percent on last year although not quite as bad as feared, authorities said 
Tuesday.


French grape growers have produced 43.2m hectolitres, according to data 
released by the French agriculture ministry, saying the 1 November harvest 
estimate was 6% lower than the average of the last five years.

Hail, frost and mildew have ravaged French vineyards since the spring, even if 
“precipitation since mid-September has benefited vines where harvest had not 
yet started,” said the ministry’s Agreste statistics service.

The result is “one of the weakest (harvests) for 30 years,” even if not as bad 
had been forecast, said the ministry.

In September experts said the growing season had been challenged by frost and 
hail

although capped by abundant sunshine, predicting a small yield but one of 
“great quality”.

On Tuesday the ministry said the output slump “is mostly due to the springtime 
frost” which notably hit the Champagne, Bourgogne (Burgundy) and Loire Valley 
regions, and the lack of rain further south near the Mediterranean.

But in the Champagne region, while the fall in production was significant, it 
was not as severe as feared due to “very favourable weather conditions at 
harvest time,” it said.

exporter by value, accounting for 29% of the market at €8.2bn($9.1bn) in 2015.

In terms of volume, France ranks third with 14m hectolitres last year,
