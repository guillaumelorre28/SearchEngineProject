The Welsh Premier League champions, The New Saints, set a world record on 
Friday night for the most consecutive wins in top-flight football with a 2-0 
victory at Cefn Druids.

A goal in each half from Ryan Edwards and Jon Routledge saw TNS end Ajax’s 
44-year hold on the record.

The great Ajax <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ajax> team of Johan 
Cruyff, Johan Neeskens and Arie Haan won 26 consecutive games in 1972 at a time 
when the Dutch club were dominating European football.

But TNS, who are currently 21 points clear at the top of the Welsh Premier 
League, have now eclipsed those figures with a 21st successive win in the 
league this season – and 27th in total.

TNS are the only full-time team in the Welsh Premier League and their domestic 
domination is measured by eight titles in the last 11 seasons.

This season they have also competed in the Irn-Bru Cup in Scotland and part of 
their record includes wins over Forfar and Livingston ​to set up a February 
semi-final against St Mirren.

In November Ajax sent 27 crates of beer to the Scottish Lowland League club 
East Kilbride after they reached 27 wins in a row with a 3-1 victory against 
BSC Glasgow. The record was not recognised by Guinness World Records as East 
Kilbride play in the fifth tier of Scottish football.
