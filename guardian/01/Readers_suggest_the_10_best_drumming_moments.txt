Art Blakey makes jazz stars


As recommended by oneneverknowdoone

<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/41743569>


While Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich were busying themselves with “drum-battles”, 
Blakey was responsible for the drums on many great jazz albums of the 1950s, 
most notably with Cannonball Adderley and Thelonius Monk, as well as leading 
his own group: theJazz <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz> Messengers. 
Blessed with a Midas touch, almost all who worked with Blakey were destined for 
stardom, including Horace Silver, Donald Byrd and Wayne Shorter. Nilpferd feels 
he is responsible for “doubling the power, intensity and sustained groove of 
jazz drumming on Wee Dot, fromA Night at Birdland”.

John Bonham takes up the drums

<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/41743424>


It appears Led Zeppelin’s drummer divides opinion among readers, with 
grauniadreader101 calling him the “most massively overrated drummer in the 
history of music” and Bastinado accusing him of stealing the opening of Rock 
and Roll from Earl Palmer on Keep a Knockin’. Others stood up for the drummer 
behind Moby Dick, with rich_fumo simply amazed that “there are drummers out 
there who don’t like Bonham” and DougTarnopol insisting that his “insane 
one-bass-drum triplets in the debut Zep song, Good Times, Bad Times” should be 
remembered.

Joe Morello’s performance on Time Out

Joe Morello is best remembered as the drummer of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, who 
helped make the group’s rhythmic experimentation and innovation possible, most 
famously on the platinum-selling albumTime Out. As johnbarnesjnr mentions, 
“that Joe Morello solo for Take Five is fantastic”. In a live recording, 
observerstation even notes that he “manages to combine playing a one-handed 
drum solo with pushing his glasses back on to his nose”.

<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/41769674>

“Pretty” Purdie was a renowned session drummer who played with a vast array of 
big names, from Aretha Franklin and BB King to Hall & Oates. And the Beatles, 
he claims. He was well-known for unscrolling a sign for his kick-drum 
declaring: “You done hired the hit-maker”, and his inimitable “Purdie shuffle”. 
Drjonty urges us to “think of that great hi-hat fill on Rock Steady”, and we’re 
with him.

Ginger Baker performs the first drum solo in rock history


As recommended by celphexpressed

In terms of drummers who played a vital role in bringing the style of Afrobeat 
to a worldwide audience, Ginger is second only to the great Tony Allen. 
However, it is his work as part of Cream that most endeared him to readers. His 
drum solo on Toad is considered to be one of the first in rock music, which 
should be enough to earn him a spot on this list. As grisgris argues: “Ginger 
Baker remains the best I have ever heard. Drove the band but could also be very 
subtle.”

The original funky drummer, Stubblefield played on many of James Brown’s 
best-loved singles, but it’s his famous break on Funky Drummer for which he is 
most fondly remembered. This has been used by everybody from Public Enemy to 
Sinead O’Connor, ensuring him the title of “the world’s most sampled drummer”. 
As salemanders mentions, it was “a drum sound that shaped modern music”.

Bill Bruford lays the foundations for prog rock


As recommended by ShallowHalo 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/41742829> and Wingates 
<http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/41749153>


Part of the very foundations of prog-rock, Bruford’s work with Yes and King 
Crimson became the standard against which rock drummers were to be rated. He 
was revered by fans and fellow musicians alike – even after a fist-fight with 
Yes bandmate Chris Squire, he was still asked to play all the drums on Squire’s 
next solo albumFish Out of Water. For ShallowHalo, Bruford’s work with King 
Crimson is his favourite, citing “every track offLarks’ Tongues in Aspic”.

Regardless of how you feel about Rush, very much the Marmite of the rock 
genre, it’s hard to argue that Peart isn’t an influential drummer. Rosvanian 
claims that “whether you rate him or not, he is the foremost drummer of his 
generation”. Addicks123 believes that “any list of the best drummers that 
doesn’t include Neil Peart hasn’t really been thought through”.

Lowell “Sly” Dunbar’s drumming influence, not just within reggae but across 
all modern music, cannot be underestimated. He first gained attention through 
his original drumming on the Mighty Diamonds’Right Time. His innovative style 
ensured he played on many key reggae songs from the 70s. As kniphofia notes 
“Vampire on Black Uhuru’sSinsemilla is particularly wonderful”. He’s best 
known, however, for his work with bassist Robbie Shakespeare.

The drummer of Dr Teeth and the Electric Mayhem in The Muppets, with his mad 
antics and erratic drumming, brilliantly satirised the entire concept of the 
drummer. Animal has recalled the drum-battles of the 50s (as Chrisgriff 
remembers: “Animal vs Buddy Rich onThe Muppet Show. Brilliant”), as well as the 
madcap antics of Keith Moon. MrStitches’s favourite Animal moment is his 
“drumming of Fever” with Rita Moreno.
