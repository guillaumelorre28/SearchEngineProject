Bill Haley's 1955 single Rock Around the Clock is generally credited as 
the record that popularised rock across the world, but it wasn't the first rock 
record. In fact, that title is hotly disputed, with contenders including Sister 
Rosetta Tharpe's Strange Things Happening Every Day (1944), and Roy Brown's 
Good Rockin' Tonight (1947). But the song that is usually recognised as the 
first true rock'n'roller is Rocket 88, recorded by Mississippi-born 
saxophonist/vocalist Jackie Brenston.

A bawdy swing/blues concoction with a raunchy sax break, it hymned a 
particular model of Oldsmobile and threw sexual innuendo into the mix with 
lines such as "Everybody likes my Rocket 88/Baby, we'll ride in style". Where 
would a million future garage bands have been without it?
