The Sun’s website traffic rose by more than a quarter in November – but it was 
not enough to close the gap with rival Trinity Mirror.

News UK’s website, which began offering most online articles for free this 
summer and had completely abolished its paywall by the end of November, posted 
a 25.6% rise in daily unique browsers to 1.6 million.

Trinity’s national newspaper sites, which include mirror.co.uk, enjoyed a 
28.1% rise in average daily unique browsers to 4.7 million last month compared 
with October, according to the latest figures from the Audit Bureau of 
Circulations.

Mirror.co.uk editorial director Pete Picton said the the site’s rolling 
coverage of last month’s Paris terror attacks had helped it bring in a record 
77.99m unique browsers over the whole month.

“The Paris terror attacks was a major contributory factor, accounting for more 
than 14m unique browsers alone,” he said.

“All credit goes to the editorial team. Many worked around the clock during 
their time off to produce timely, concise and informative updates on what was a 
very fluid news event.”

The Independent was up 24.4% compared with October to 3.27 million daily 
unique browsers, Telegraph.co.uk jumped 17.2% to just over 5 million, 
theguardian.com rose 13.7% to 9.27 million and MailOnline added 10.5% to 14.6 
million.

The Evening Standard posted the biggest rise of 29.2% to almost 520,000 daily 
unique browsers.
