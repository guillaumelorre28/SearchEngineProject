This tastes fantastic with ripe avocado. If you want to add a bit of spice to 
the salad, try coriander or chilli. Ideal served with a warm potato salad.

(serves 2)
2 ripe avocados
1 lime, juice and zest
50g salted almonds, roughly chopped
2 spring onions, chopped
2 baby gem lettuce, washed and thinly sliced
1 tbsp basil, chopped
500g white crab meat
¼ tsp ginger, finely grated
Pinch of salt
Pinch of pepper
70ml olive oil
15ml white-wine vinegar
¼ tsp dijon mustard

Peel and roughly dice the avocados, squeeze lime juice over them and put to 
one side.

Mix the spring onions, nuts, basil and lettuce in a large bowl.

Add the ginger and crab meat, mix well and season with salt and pepper.

Combine this with the avocado, mix everything together, and check seasoning.

Beat the oil and vinegar together until emulsified and mix through the salad 
just before serving.
