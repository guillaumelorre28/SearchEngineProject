There was shock among customers at a popular fast-food joint in Elizabeth, New 
Jersey <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/new-jersey>, as First American 
Fried Chicken found itself at the center of a major terrorism investigation on 
Monday.

Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, the suspect in Saturday’s bombings in New York and New 
Jersey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/19/new-york-bombing-suspect-ahmad-khan-rahami>
 who was captured in a shootout with police in the nearby town of Linden on 
Monday, lived above the chicken store with his family and worked there most 
evenings with his father and teenage brother.

Regulars in the town near Newark airport, about 16 miles from midtown 
Mahattan, expressed disbelief that the man they knew as a friendly shop manager 
was suspected of terrorism.

New York bombing: what we know so far 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/19/new-jersey-and-new-york-blasts-what-we-know-so-far-video>
“He was my friend … I wouldn’t think he would do something like that,” said 
Brayant Ocampo, 17, a high school senior who lived nearby and regularly stopped 
off for late night cheese fries and fried chicken.

“I thought it was a lie,” said Melani Ragghinti, 18, Ocampo’s girlfriend and 
another local resident, referring to news Rahami had been arrested in 
connection with the bombings. “We always eat there. It’s crazy. They’re really, 
really nice.”

The FBI raided the shop and the apartment above on Monday morning, but found 
it empty. Authorities spent the morning taking boxes away from the property and 
two vehicles were towed.

Ocampo said Rahami was a car buff who used to own an Acura TL, a popular 
luxury sedan, but crashed it.

“He actually came up to me because he wanted to look for some parts he needed 
for the car and I helped him out. I was looking for some parts in the junkyard 
and he got the headlight, the bumper,” he said.

Elizabeth’s mayor, Chris Bollwage, arrived to speak with the dozens of 
gathered members of the news media, saying said he was relieved to hear 
authorities had captured Rahami.

“Now, hopefully, a lot more questions will be answered,” he said.

The mayor said the family had owned and operated the business and lived above 
the modest shop on Elmora Avenue since 2002.

He said the chicken store had faced complaints and problems in 2012, when the 
city council and police ruled that it should close at 10pm. He said that 
Mohammed Rahami, Ahmad’s father, had repeatedly mentioned his Muslim faith in 
responding to these complaints.

“He brought up his faith in [a] lawsuit, he brought up his faith in 
conversations with city officials … [but the complaints against his store] had 
nothing to do with ethnicity or religious beliefs, it had to do with a lot of 
people hanging out in front of the store at all hours as well as congregating 
and code enforcement problems,” said Bollwage.

Ocampo said the younger Rahami was also Muslim but Ocampo had never heard any 
extremist views from him, nor any discussion of politics or terrorism. The only 
thing he had encountered was some quiet religious study, he said.

“One day I was in the chicken shack and he had a book and he was reading the 
book while he was listening to music and I asked: ‘How can you do that and what 
kind of book?’ He said it was some kind of religion book; supposedly they read 
it while they’re listening to music,” said Ocampo.

“He would always be there, and usually when there was no customers he would be 
there reading it. He said it was like a Bible but runs in his religion.”

Neither Ocampo nor Ragghinti could reconcile the man they knew with the 
terrorism suspect whose face was now being broadcast on every cable news 
channel.

“I don’t understand why he would do something like that – obviously he would 
get caught eventually. He had a good business going on. He just fucked up his 
life,” said Ragghinti.

 The scene in Linden, New Jersey, where Ahmad Khan Rahami was arrested.

In nearby Linden, where Rahami was arrested, police had taped off several 
streets, blocking residents from reaching their homes. Several different police 
agencies were present and a helicopter circled above.

“How could this actually happen here in Linden, New Jersey?” wondered a 
visibly flustered Tosha Hardrick. “It’s not what I would expect.”
Hardrick was driving her cousin to work when she heard several gunshots go 
off. She looked to her left and saw a police officer carrying a backpack in 
front of a bar, where police are believed to have exchanged fire with the 
suspect.

Vinnie, who declined to give his last name, was walking out of his house on 
Elizabeth Street in Linden when he saw police cars rush past his house.

“Then I hear gun shots, boom, boom!” he said. “The cops are shooting and 
they’re shooting back at them.”
Adam Machala, who works as a plumber, had come to a house on Elizabeth Street 
for a job when he heard the gunshots go off. Police ran in the house and told 
him and the tenants to evacuate immediately.

“They were scared there might be a bomb in the building,” he said. He came 
back to the scene later to find Rahami handcuffed on the street with police and 
K-9 units swarming the area.
