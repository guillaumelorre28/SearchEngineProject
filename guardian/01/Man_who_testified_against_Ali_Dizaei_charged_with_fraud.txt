A man whose evidence saw a police chief jailed for corruption has himself been 
charged with fraud. The Metropolitan police said that Waad al-Baghdadi was 
charged with two counts of fraud by false representation over allegations he 
claimed Â£21,000 of benefits. He testified at the trial last year of former 
Scotland Yard commanderAli Dizaei <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ali-dizaei>, 
and Baghdadi's testimony helped convict the officer. Dizaei's conviction was 
overturned on appeal in May. Baghdadi, 26, will appear before City of 
Westminister magistrates on Friday. Dizaei faces a retrial over claims he 
framed Baghdadi.
