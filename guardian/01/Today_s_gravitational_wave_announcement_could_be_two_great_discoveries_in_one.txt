It is now widely expected that the detection of gravitational waves using the 
Ligo (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory 
<https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/>) observatories will be announced today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/09/watch-this-spacetime-gravitational-wave-discovery-expected>
 at 15:30 GMT at a press conference that has been called at the National Press 
Club, Washington DC.

Although everything is still rumour at this point, the “details” have begun to 
leak. If they are true, then they certainly explain a few things that seemed 
confusing at first. In particular, they suggest that the gravitational waves 
were produced by a pair of highly unusual black holes colliding.

The black hole news on its own would be a great discovery, but combined with 
the detection of the gravitational waves it is an academic double whammy that 
has astronomers and physicists reeling with excitement.

Black holes are the most mysterious objects in the universe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/feb/01/what-is-a-black-hole-stephen-hawking-reith-lectures>
 but one thing we do know is that they come in two main varieties. Stellar 
black holes are those that form after stars explode, and typically have masses 
of between 3-15 times that of the sun. At the other end of the scale there are 
supermassive black holes that squat in the centre of galaxies and possess 
masses of millions and billions times that of the sun.

What is a black hole?

However, the black holes expected to be announced today are said to have 
masses of 29 and 36 suns. These are highly unusual masses – above the usual 
stellar black hole regime but far below the supermassive ones – and may explain 
why researchers were confident that itwasn’t a test signal injected into the 
data 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/jan/12/gravitational-wave-detection-could-be-a-false-alarm>
.

It also explains the sudden appearance in early January of a number of 
theoretical papers that were talking about the collision of a pair of 30-solar 
mass black holes, a scenario outside the boundaries of what had been thought 
common before.Derek Fox of Penn State University 
<https://twitter.com/partialobs> brought one particular paper to light on 
Twitter.
 The description of an unusual gravitational wave scenario tipped off some 
physicists that a detection announcement was imminent. 
Let’s assume for the moment that the rumours are true. Where do these 30-solar 
mass black holes come from? This is where it gets even more interesting, 
because astronomers do not really know.

In recent years, a class of intermediate mass black holes has been discovered. 
Although their numbers are comparatively low at the moment, they appear to 
possess masses of between 100-1000s of solar masses. However, the lower end of 
that boundary is poorly known. Could these new discoveries be some of those?

It has been suggested that intermediate mass black holes are the remnants of 
the very first stars <http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02875> to be born in the 
universe. Known as population III stars, they existed more than 13 billion 
years ago and are thought to have each been much larger than the stars of 
today. Hence, they might reasonably be expected to leave behind larger black 
holes.

If the Ligo scientists do indeed confirm the 30-solar mass rumours today then 
astronomers will have much to celebrate. To see such a signal so quickly after 
the detectors reached the correct sensitivity implies that such collisions are 
common, which implies that such black holes are common.

We will have a window onto a wholly unanticipated population of black holes: a 
way to look at the dead hearts of the very first stars that formed in the 
universe. Also, of course, we will have the great discovery of gravitational 
waves, another extraordinary triumph for Einstein’s monumental general theory 
of relativity.

Confirmation and surprise: the triumph of theory and the serendipity of 
observation. What’s not to love about that?
