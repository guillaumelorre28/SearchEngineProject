, according to English universities.

Applications to study chemical engineering at the University of Bath shot up 
by 50% this year, with computer science courses also in high demand.

Mike Nicholson, the director of student recruitment and admissions at Bath, 
said: “Why there’s a sudden enthusiasm to become chemical engineers I’m not 
quite sure, normally it’s linked to a TV programme, but applications for 
chemical engineering have gone through the roof.”

Computer science has also gained in popularity. “Computer science has been in 
the doldrums for years, but over the last two or three years, it’s back on the 
agenda,” said Nicholson. “[But] we are seeing a decline again in modern 
languages.”

At Birmingham City University, criminology has been extremely popular this 
year, according to the head of admissions, Julie Mason. Health courses have 
attracted high volumes of applications, as students seek nursing and midwifery

In terms of A-level subjects, there has been a 15% increase in the number of 
students studying computing, to 6,000, while religious studies has gone up by 
6% to 23,000 and economics has risen by 5% to 28,000.

A-level entries this summer show that critical thinking and general studies 
are falling out of favour, with the former continuing on a downward spiral of 
50% to 100 and the latter down by 35% to 12,000.

Leisure and the performing and expressive arts are also down, both by 15%, as 
the established trend to study traditional academic subjects favoured by elite 
Russell Group universities continues.
