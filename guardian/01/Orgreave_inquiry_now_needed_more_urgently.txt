The report on Amber Rudd not actually reading the evidence (11 November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/11/amber-rudd-did-not-review-police-files-before-orgreave-inquiry-refusal>
) held by South Yorkshire police on its operation at Orgreave during the 1984 
miners’ strike, and the subsequent collapsed prosecutions, reflects the 
contempt and lack of respect that the government has had for the Orgreave Truth 
and Justice Campaign (OTJC). In her letter to the OTJC explaining her decision 
not to grant an independent public inquiry she states: “I am satisfied that 
policing today is now very different from how it was in 1984 ... I am of the 
view that in light of ... reforms and changes there would be very few, if any, 
lessons for the policing system today to be gleaned from reviewing the events 
and practices of 1984.” But the actual detailed evidence accumulated by the 
campaign surely points to the contrary. Furthermore, the acquittal of 10 of the 
Rotherham 12 (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/16/asian-men-far-right-rotherham-cleared-violent-disorder>
, 17 November), arrested by South Yorkshire police while defending their 
communities against racist attacks, shows that policing and police tactics have 
not changed at all. There is surely now an even more urgent need for an inquiry 
into Orgreave as well as policing in Rotherham.
