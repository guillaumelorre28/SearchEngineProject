Loukman Ouédraogo is 14 months old and weighs just over eight pounds – the 
average weight of a newborn baby in the UK. When Loukman arrived at the 
hospital two weeks ago he weighed less than seven pounds. An intravenous 
cannula swamps his tiny hand. Every three hours he is drip-fed F-75, a milk 
product designed for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition.

Loukman's mother Binta has six hungry children to feed. While she stays in 
hospital with her youngest, she continually worries about her five older 
children.

"The food is not enough for everyone," Binta says. "I feel very sad when I 
cannot feed my children. I am sitting with them, my own children and I see that 
there is not enough food."

Her dream, Binta adds, is to have enough food so she and her children will no 
longer suffer from hunger.

Binta has received essential education on the simple yet nutritious foods she 
needs to feed her son. Now she needs educating in market gardening so her dream 
will come true – ending the hunger cycle.
