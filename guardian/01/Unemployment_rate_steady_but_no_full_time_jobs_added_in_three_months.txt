The unemployment rate was steady at 5.7% in May but no full-time jobs have 
been added in three months.

The number of people with jobs rose 17,900 in the month, all of them 
part-time, theAustralian Bureau of Statistics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-bureau-of-statistics> 
said on Thursday. Full-time employment was steady after falling 27,300 over the 
previous two months.

The composition of jobs growth reflected the economy’s transition away from 
mining to services industries, according to the Commonwealth Bank’s managing 
director of economics, Michael Blythe. It also meant Australians could expect 
weak income growth.

“Typically all those service jobs pay less than those mining and construction 
jobs, where a lot of the employment losses have been, so you’re getting that 
lower-income effect coming through,” Blythe said.

Spare capacity in the labour market has also increased, said RBC Capital 
Markets strategist Michael Turner.

The official figures showed the quarterly under-utilisation rate, a measure of 
the number of people with work but looking for more, had risen 0.1%.

“The labour market definitely hasn’t tightened over the last few months, it’s 
actually weakened,” Turner said. “That’s consistent with ongoing inflationary 
pressure and further Reserve Bank easing.”

The participation rate, which refers to the number of people either employed 
or actively looking for work, was steady in May at 64.8%.
