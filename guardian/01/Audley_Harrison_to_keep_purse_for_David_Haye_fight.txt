The British Boxing Board of Control has confirmed it will not withhold Audley 
Harrison's purse following his controversial bout withDavid Haye 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/davidhayeboxing> last November.

Harrison angered fans and pundits after landing only one punch before his 
third-round stoppage against the WBA heavyweight champion in Manchester on 13 
November, and the BBBC pledged to investigate the matter.

However, after interviewing the 39-year-old today, it has opted to let the 
matter rest. "The stewards of the British Boxing Board of Control having 
interviewed Audley Harrison with regard to his contest against David Haye at 
the MEN Arena, Manchester on Saturday, 13th November 2010 have accepted his 
explanation and will not be taking the matter any further," a statement on its 
website,www.bbbofc.com <http://www.bbbofc.com/index.php>, said.

Robert Smith, the secretary of the BBBC, had said in the aftermath of the 
fight: "You have to bear in mind it was such a letdown for the 22,000 at the 
MEN Arena and the thousands watching at home. The board have rescinded purses 
when we feel a fighter has not tried. He did nothing all night."

It was widely expected that Harrison would retire following the loss but has 
since announced that he intends to fight on. However, he has yet to confirm any 
plans.
