There’s a little good news for a change down among the details of March’s new 
ABC-audited print circulation and digital reach results. Of course you have to 
duck and weave to find it – but quality papers have something to feel modestly 
pleased about. The Sun-Mirror-Star tabloid category is down 5.87% year on year 
(with theMirror taking a 12.89% hit). The Mail and Express are both down year 
on year (6.79% at theExpress) and month on month. But every one of the quality 
dailies did better in March than in February: they’re up 2.48% overall, which 
also embraces a 0.22% total rise on March 2015.

Not salvation – but not exactly freefall either (and largely replicated in the 
quality Sunday market month on month, too). Popular papers aren’t very popular, 
to be sure, but quality is a tad more resilient.

That’s the last of the print Independent on these figures, of course. But 
modest hopefulness continued asindependent.co.uk <http://www.independent.co.uk/>
, preparing to voyage alone, pushed up its unique browser count to a monthly 63 
million worldwide, up 17% on February. It says it’s now able to employ 90 core 
journalists, some 15 more than projected. Though here, as so often elsewhere, 
percentages matter rather less than the revenue figures involved – and they 
follow rather later.
