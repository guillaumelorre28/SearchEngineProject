The Daily Star appears to be suffering from Sun-Hillsborough disease. It has 
been removed from sale for the second day running at Manchester Airport and 
officials are contemplating whether to extend the ban permanently.

But today's decision to take the red-top off sale - which followed its 
ill-advised and tasteless splash yesterday,TERROR AS PLANE HITS ASH CLOUD 
<http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/131706/JET-S-ASH-CLOUD-HORROR/> - was 
not an official one.

A spokesman said that it was a joint action by staff working for WH Smith and 
their airport colleagues responsible for distributing the papers within the 
airport.

Russell Craig, the airport's head of communications, told Media Guardian 
yesterday <http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/apr/21/airports-pull-daily-star>
 that the Star's splash - illustrated by a computer-generated image of a jumbo 
jet with its engines on fire - had had the potential to cause "absolute panic" 
among passengers.

He added: "We have had so much negative feedback from passengers that we are 
considering whether theDaily Star <https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailystar> 
will remain off the shelves on a permanent basis."

It appears that the Star has not suffered elsewhere. Four airports that also 
removed it from sale yesterday - Gatwick, Leeds-Bradford, Bristol and Liverpool 
- have allowed it back on the shelves today.

The paper - owned by Richard Desmond - came in for widespread criticism. The 
moderators on its own website were called into action to remove "inappropriate" 
comments, which probably means those from people upset with the story.

The possibility of a permanent Manchester Airport ban echoes the Merseyside 
boycott ofThe Sun following its criticism of Liverpool football fans following 
the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989
