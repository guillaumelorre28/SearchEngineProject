On a recent trip to Tanzania <https://www.theguardian.com/world/tanzania>, I 
came acrossdagaa in almost every household I visited. We'd often eat these tiny 
fish with stewed greens, home-ground peanut butter andugali (soft maize), 
served in small bowls, with our fingers. Here is my British take on the dish.

(Serves 2) 48p a portion
150g rice, 6p
2 tbsp oil, 6p
200g sprats, 40p
1 tbsp lime juice, 3p
1 tsp fresh grated ginger, 5p
½ tsp salt, 1p
100g spinach or spring greens, 15p
1 tbsp peanut butter, 10p
1 fresh chilli, chopped, 9p

Bring a saucepan of water to the boil. Add the rice and reduce to a simmer for 
20 minutes, or until cooked.

Warm the oil in a shallow frying pan on a high heat, add the sprats and 
squeeze over the lime juice.

Add the ginger, season, and fry until the fish begin to crisp around the edges 
(no more than 10 minutes).

When the fish are almost done, blanch the greens in boiling water for a 
minute, put them in a bowl, stir in the peanut butter and sprinkle the chilli 
on top.

Serve with the fish and plain rice.

Jack's tip

I had many versions of these fish in Tanzania. Each household cooks them 
slightly differently, so don't be afraid to experiment. For example, you can 
coat the sprats with flour, seasoned with salt and dried chilli, before frying.
