Former Polly Peck tycoon Asil Nadir 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/asil-nadir> was released from custody 
last night and vowed to issue a writ against the police for wrongful arrest.

The 69-year-old, who is on bail and faces a multimillion-pound theft trial 
next year, was arrested at his home yesterday afternoon for allegedly breaching 
a curfew that was part of his bail terms. He later emerged from Charing Cross 
police station in London without being charged and with an apology from the 
police.

After his release, Nadir said: "Unfortunately, I have been a victim of an 
unlawful arrest, claiming that I had broken my bail conditions. That was not 
the case.

"I have been released with an apology but I am hoping that this sort of 
unlawful behaviour, as I have claimed for many years, does not take place in 
this country. It's such a great shame for this country."

Nadir added: "We are issuing a writ, taking proceedings against the people 
that have created this most unfortunate situation."

Of his arrest, he said: "Well, it's a great shame, it shouldn't happen. One's 
freedom shouldn't be attacked in this manner in this country."

Scotland Yard confirmed that Nadir was released and said no further action 
would be taken.

Nadir was originally charged with 66 offences of theft involving £34 million 
fraud allegations following the collapse of his Polly Peck empire.

He fled in 1993 to northern Cyprus before the counts – put into fewer 
condensed charges – could be put to him at trial. But on 30 July this year Mr 
Justice Bean was told he wanted to return to fight the case.

Nadir wears an electronic tag so that the authorities can monitor him. Upon 
arriving back in Britain in August, he declared he had a "little injustice to 
sort out" and that he was confident he would clear his name.
