Anne Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> has 
reached her seventh WTA Tour semi-final after beating fellow qualifier Bibiane 
Schoofs in straight sets at the Luxembourg Open.

The world No93 had reached the last eight after a stunning win on Thursday 
over the former world No1 Ana Ivanovic and the British player reproduced that 
form to reach the final four for the second successive year.

The 28-year-old was superior in all aspects of the match and was dominant on 
her serve, producing three aces as well as winning 70% of points on her second 
serve, as her Dutch opponent made few inroads.

Keothavong secured a 6-3, 6-2 victory in 65 minutes and she will now face 
Monica Niculescu, who beat Lucie Hradecka 6-4, 6-4.

Should she win, Keothavong will become the first British singles finalist in a 
WTA Tour event since Jo Durie in 1990. It will prove a tough test, with the 
Romanian ranked 59 places higher at 34.
