Great Britain's Fed Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/fed-cup> team 
celebrated booking their place in a World Group promotion play-off by 
whitewashing the hosts, Israel, 3-0 on Friday night in Eilat.

Portugal's earlier victory over the Netherlands had already ensured Great 
Britain's progress into Saturday's match with Austria but Judy Murray's team 
were intent on finishing the round-robin stage in style.

Anne Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> got Great 
Britain off to a fine start with a 6-2, 6-1 win over Julia Glushko and Elena 
Baltacha confirmed victory with a superb 6-4, 6-3 win over the world No37, 
Shahar Peer.

The doubles pairing, Laura Robson and Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson>, wrapped up the dead rubber 
6-2, 6-1 over Glushko and Keren Shlomo, completing a third straight win after 
previous successes over Portugal and the Netherlands.

"All our girls have played every day and they've proved now that they're a 
winning team," said Murray. "Again today they showed some fantastic competitive 
spirit and have done tremendously well to get through as group winners."

Baltacha reeled off six consecutive games to win the second set and her match 
against Peer and admitted: "Once I'd won the match point tears came to my eyes. 
It was such an amazing evening and one I will remember for a long time."
