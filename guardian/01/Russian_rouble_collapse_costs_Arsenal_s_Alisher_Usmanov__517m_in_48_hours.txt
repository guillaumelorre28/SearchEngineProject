An index of the world’s richest people has claimed that Arsenal’s second 
largest shareholder, Alisher Usmanov, has been among the hardest hit by this 
week’s collapse of the rouble, with the Uzbek-born businessman losing $809m 
(£517m) in the last 48 hours, while Chelsea’sRoman Abramovich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/roman-abramovich> lost nearly $450m.

The Russian currency has fallen to its lowest value in more than a decade as a 
result of falling oil prices. That has led to major losses among some of the 
country’s oligarchs, with a total of $10bn wiped off their collective fortunes 
since Monday night.

According to Bloomberg’s Billionaires index 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/2014-12-16/aja/aaa6a>, Usmanov – who 
owns 30% of Arsenal’s shares – suffered the most losses, $809m, to leave his 
personal fortune at an estimated $13.4bn. The Chelsea owner, Abramovich, came 
in third on the list and is now worth an estimated $12.8bn.
