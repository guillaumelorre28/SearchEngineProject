The minute you turn into the gates of Wolgan Valley, the phone signal 
disappears. We’re in a remote part of the Blue Mountains, where ancient Wollemi 
pine grew undiscovered until the mid-1990s.

We drove carefully on the way in – but it was on dusk and kangaroos were 
jumping across the hairpin bends like hurdlers. We hit one and the front 
headlight is smashed.

48 hours in Albury, NSW: what to do, where to go

The resort is situated between two big national parks, the Gardens of Stone 
and Wollemi. Yet while tourists flock to the towns such as Katoomba in the Blue 
Mountains, this valley – over Mount Victoria and beyond Lithgow – is 
practically deserted.

The seclusion is part of the allure. As well as being Australia’s first luxury 
conservation-based resort, Emirates One&Only Wolgan Valley (to give it its full 
name) waslast year named by TripAdvisor 
<http://www.luxurylodgesofaustralia.com.au/news-offers-events/tripadvisor-travellers-choice-awards-recognition-emirates-wolgan-valley/>
 as Australia’s top hotel.

It’s definitely pricey, with a tariff of $2,050 a night. This includes 
accommodation in a Heritage Suite, all meals including local wines and beers, 
and two nature-based activities each day for each person.

The expense makes it very much a special occasion destination and, during our 
stay, we meet several groups celebrating big birthdays, wedding anniversaries 
and honeymoons.

Most of the mega-posh places around Australia are beachside (I’m thinking 
Southern Ocean Lodge on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, Saffire Freycinet 
in Tasmania and One&Only Hayman Island in the Whitsundays) but Emirates 
One&Only Wolgan Valley is very much landlocked. The Australian bush and the 
dramatic escarpments around the property more than make up for the lack of 
ocean frontage.

A maximum of 80 guests (in 40 rooms) can stay at any one time and, in the more 
remote corners of the resort, it can feel like you are the only guest.

Friday

Wolgan Valley is 190km and three hours from Sydney, and is a popular weekend 
getaway for Sydneysiders and international tourists wanting an Australian bush 
experience.

After we arrive at the gatehouse a bit after 7pm we are transferred to a 
four-wheel drive Land Rover Defender – it’s a week old and still has that new 
car smell – built to handle creek crossings and unsealed roads.

As we drive up towards the main homestead our driver slows down and points out 
the nocturnal wildlife lining the road. There are the silhouettes of kangaroos, 
wallabies and – most thrillingly – wombats!

I see at least half a dozen wombats on my drive up to the homestead. They’re 
like enormous brown rocks, except that they move slowly along the road. Our 
driver tells us they can sprint at speeds of up to 40km/h.

 The pool outside the main homestead 
After checking in, we proceed straight to dinner. The restaurant, in the main 
homestead, is decorated in the style of a wealthy person’s ski lodge or beach 
house. It’s posh but relaxed. Before dinner we sit by a roaring fire and drink 
local sparkling chardonnay. This lounge is open all day and great if you want 
to play chess or backgammon in front of the fire while enjoying a drink.

We have a long chat to Jason, who has worked at the property for six years. A 
local guy, much of his family had been employed in nearby Lithgow in the mining 
industry. The resort employs about 100 people, many of them locals. Some 70 
staff live on-site in a village built on the property.

Dinner is three courses with matching wines – many coming from just down the 
road in the Bathurst, Orange and Mudgee regions.

The produce is all grown and sourced locally – within 100km of the resort. We 
finish with cheese and dessert wine before taking a buggy back to our room.

Saturday 

Although Wolgan Valley is a great place for rest and relaxation, I’m up early 
to see the sun rise over the escarpment and the kangaroos grazing on the grass 
just outside the porch of our suite.

It’s stunning out here – mist encircles the mountains, there’s the sound of 
magpies and kookaburras, and the air is scented with eucalyptus.

The suite (which is enormous and comfortable, built in the style of an old 
homestead) has a Nespresso machine – and the Sydney Morning Herald and Weekend 
Australian are delivered to our door.

Breakfast is served in the restaurant. It’s à la carte, with a buffet option. 
I can highly recommend the fresh croissants and omelettes cooked to order.

9am: trail ride

The 7,000-acre property (of which only 2% is used for the resort buildings) is 
ideal for exploring on horseback. The well-kept stables house 16 horses, 
including one used to transport the bridal party at the cricketer Michael 
Clarke’s wedding.

I’m on Bandit. The name would suggest a lively spirit, a horse first off the 
blocks. Instead Bandit is “lazy” – slow and barely awake – and drops her head 
into water every time we cross a creek.

The pace is leisurely. There are two of us on the ride, which costs $155 for 
90 minutes. The staff ratiois amazing, with two guides accompanying us.

We stick mainly to walking, with a short trot at the end, and enjoy the chance 
to see more of the property.

When Charles Darwin he first came across this area in1836 he described it in 
his notebook as an ancient “grand valley surrounded by cliffs of sandstone”.

The area is rich in Indigenous history – there are with rock engravings, 
burial sites and ceremonial grounds in the national parks. Several Indigenous 
peoples have a strong, ongoing cultural association to the region, including 
the Darug people.

Convicts were also sent to the site to work on the land – where escape (out 
here, where would they have gone?) would have meant certain death.

There’s also an extensive mountain bike riding trail, and each villa has two 
bikes and helmets parked on the veranda.

1pm: picnic lunch 

Back at the homestead it’s time to eat again. There’s a cafe below the 
restaurant but we’ve opted for a picnic, selecting from a menu provided the 
night before.

Staff drive us to a remote part of the property where a shaded area looks out 
on to the range. There’s a set table and an ice bucket with a cold beer ready 
when we pull up.


Our picnic basket contains a couple of sandwiches and some delicious salads, a 
flask for tea and coffee, and fruit salad.

It’s like Picnic at Hanging Rock out here. It’s too early in the year for 
flies but the air is hot and still and sandstone escarpments loom all around 
us. Except for occasional birdsong, it’s eerily quiet. Even though Sydney is 
just up the road, it feels as though we’re in the most remote place on earth.

4pm: safari


Activities on offer at Wolgan Valley include archery and hiking. But 
ultimately it’s a place where many people go to just do nothing. In the rooms 
there is a good supply of reading materials – including books and the latest 
glossy magazines. There are also two televisions (in the bedroom and lounge 
room) that show the usual pay TV channels and free movies. But these didn’t get 
switched on all weekend.

As much as I want to lounge around inside reading (or using the in-room pool, 
which is heated and a comfortable 25 metres), another tour of the property 
beckons. Roger takes a group of five us out in a sort of open bus/four-wheel 
drive for a wildlife tour to spot Australian native animals.

I’ve never been on safari in Africa so don’t know how this compares, but it’s 
thrilling to get so close to kangaroos, wallabies and gorgeously sleek 
wallaroos, with their dark grey fur. They are very elegant – like the 
aristocrats of the animal kingdom – and gather in mobs across the hills. I 
count at least 50 of them. What’s captivating is that they are just hanging 
out, not hopping off as they usually would when you get close. And we see more 
wombats – their burrows are are all over the property.

We also visit a grove of Wollemi pines planted about six years ago and hear 
the story of the species’ accidental discovery,by an off-duty park ranger  
<https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/plant_info/wollemi_pine>who had gone canyoning 
in the rugged area. They had previously been thought long extinct. It shows 
just how untouched the area has been.

 Sandstone escarpments ring the property 
After our tour it’s back to the original homestead – built in 1832 and 
lovingly restored – for canapes and sundowners.

Nocturnal wildlife spotlighting and stargazing are particularly popular tours 
and are included in the price.

Dinner is back at the restaurant. Around us are mostly couples and larger 
family groups. Children are welcome at Wolgan Valley and there is enough room 
to not feel crowded by the bigger groups.

Sunday 

I wake feeling well rested. The beds are custom made by AH Beard and are 
available for guests to buy. Breakfast is delicious – a variety of local 
mushrooms, with feta and sourdough.

Then it’s into the Timeless Spa for an aromatherapy massage, using oils 
sourced from the property. Looking across to the mountains, with soft music 
playing, I felt myself drifting off.

48 hours in Pokolbin in the Hunter valley, NSW: where to eat and drink

The resort opened its doors about five years ago and is showing no signs of 
age or wear and tear. It has recruited and kept some of the friendliest and 
most knowledgeable staff I’ve come across (one of our guides had done her 
thesis on predator dogs – and was able to speak from a place of deep knowledge 
when I asked her about the region’s dingoes).

It’s a brave move turning your back on the sea and trusting that the scrubby, 
sometimes inhospitable, Australian bush is a good place to build your 
multimillion-dollar resort (Emirates even contributed to improve the road in). 
But it works – and it’s magnificient. The buildings blend in with the landscape 
and all the rooms are angled so you can marvel at the mountains.

After you’ve left and your phone signal returns, it feels as though the whole 
place was a dream.
