Walter Scott’s Rob Roy is up against Muriel Spark’s The Prime of Miss Jean 
Brodie. Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is 
competing with AL Kennedy’s So I Am Glad. As part of its #LovetoRead campaign,
the BBC has launched a vote to find Scotland’s favourite book 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/Scotlands-Favourite-Book>, 
with a selection of 30 titles by authors born or based in Scotland up for the 
accolade.

Chosen by a panel – which featured Glasgow University professor of Renaissance 
studies Willy Maley, Scottish Book Trust head of reader development Philippa 
Cochrane and Creative Scotland head of literature Jenny Niven – the 30 titles 
range from classics of Scottish literature by the likes ofArthur Conan Doyle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/arthurconandoyle> (The Adventures of 
Sherlock Holmes) and John Buchan (The Thirty-Nine Steps), to beloved modern 
thrillers from Scotland’s peerless crime-writing community, including Denise 
Mina, Ian Rankin and Louise Welsh.

It’s always more fun to criticise lists like this than it is to agree with 
them, but this one, pitting Lanark against Harry Potter,Kate Atkinson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/kate-atkinson> against James Kelman, looks 
fearsomely strong and wonderfully varied to me (although I’m disappointed there 
is no room for the superb Mary Stewart). “This is a list that will get people 
talking and reading,” says the BBC’s arts executive producer, Pauline Law. 
“There is such a vast range of good writing in Scotland that choosing which 
books to include was incredibly difficult. I am really looking forward to 
seeing how the public will vote.”

With voting open from 1-26 August, and the top 10 to be revealed in October, 
even those of us without Scottish blood are allowed to vote. I’ve just cast 
mine for Iain Banks’s The Wasp Factory, because – of all the books on the list 
– I think it’s the one most burned into my mind. (“Esmerelda looked round one 
last time at me, giggling, and I laughed back. Then I let the lines go.”) It’s 
also the one I’ve returned to most often over the years. Which Scottish book 
will you go for, and which titles and authors do you think have been missed off 
the list?
