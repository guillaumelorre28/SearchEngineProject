Russian anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexei-navalny> has defied his house arrest 
by walking to his local store to buy milk, and says he was quickly intercepted 
by three men who escorted him home.

Navalny was convicted last week of fraud and given a suspended sentence of 
three-and-a-half years.

Pending appeal, however, he was kept under house arrest, which he claims is 
illegal.

On Tuesday, the opposition activist wrote on his blog 
<https://navalny.com/p/4056/> that he had gone out to buy milk and he posted 
photos taken by his wife showing three men accompanying him back to their 
apartment.

The Kremlin appears reluctant to jail Navalny, so as not to make him a martyr, 
but also seems determined to keep him on a tight leash.

He stood trial with his brother Oleg, who was given a three-and-a-half-year 
prison sentence – and is now in jail. Opposition activists have claimed the 
charges against both men were political, and that Oleg is being held as a 
“hostage” in an attempt to control the political activities of his brother.
