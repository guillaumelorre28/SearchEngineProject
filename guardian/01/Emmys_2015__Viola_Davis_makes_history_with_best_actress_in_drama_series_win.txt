Viola Davis <https://www.theguardian.com/film/viola-davis>, the star of How to 
Get Away with Murder, made history at the 67th Emmy awards on Sunday night, 
becoming the first woman of color to win the Emmy for best actress in a drama 
series.

“The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is 
opportunity,” Davis said when accepting the award. “You cannot win an Emmy for 
roles that are simply not there.”

In her speech, Davis began by quoting the civil rights activist Harriet Tubman

. “In my dreams and visions,” said the actor, whose voice was charged with 
emotion, “I seemed to see a line, and on the other side of that line were green 
fields, and lovely flowers, and beautiful white ladies, who stretched out their 
arms to me over the line, but I couldn’t reach them no-how.”

Davis went on to thank the showrunners, writers and producers who have created 
roles for black women in television. “So here’s to all the writers, the awesome 
people that are Ben Sherwood, Paul Lee, Peter Nowalk, Shona Rhimes - people who 
have redefined what it means to be sexy, to be a leading woman, to be black.”

She then paid tribute to other actresses of colour including Taraji P Henson, 
Scandal star Kerry Washington, Meagan Goods and Halle Berry: “Thank you for 
taking us over that line.”

It was Davis’s first nomination for the Shonda Rhimes show on ABC
