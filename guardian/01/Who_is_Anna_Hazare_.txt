Anna Hazare <https://www.theguardian.com/world/anna-hazare> – real name Kisan 
Baburao – has caused political heads to roll after previous anti-corruption 
campaigns, and it is not just the Congress party to feel the heat.

The government of the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata parties lost two 
ministers during their joint government of his home state of Maharashtra in 
1995-96, and investigations were launched against four ministers in 2003, when 
the state was under Congress control. In April, he launched four days of 
fasting, the prelude to the latest national crisis.

The hunger strike has become his weapon of choice but his often unrelenting 
tactics have long been labelled blackmail by critics.

A Congress party spokesman on Tuesday claimed he was surrounded by "armchair 
fascists, overground Maoists, closet anarchists".

A biography on Hazare's own website <http://www.annahazare.org/biography.html>
, said that having once considered suicide early in his 15 years military 
service, and having written an essay on why he wanted to live no more, he was 
inspired to strive "for the betterment of common people" after picking up a 
book at New Delhi railway station by Swami Vivekananda, the hugely influential 
Hindu of the late 19th century. He decided to remain a bachelor and, at 26, 
dedicate his life to humanity.

In 1978, he took voluntary retirement from the army and returned home to 
Ralegan Siddhi, in Maharashtra's drought-prone Ahmadnagar. There he found 
people struggling for survival and pioneered water conservation, a move that 
helped place it on the international map.
