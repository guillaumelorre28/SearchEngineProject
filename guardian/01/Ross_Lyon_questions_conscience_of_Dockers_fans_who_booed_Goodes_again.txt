Fremantle coach Ross Lyon has questioned the conscience of Dockers fans who 
booedAdam Goodes <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-goodes> during the AFL 
qualifying final.

The booing on Saturday was not as loud as the infamous July 26 game at Domain 
Stadium, which brought the matter to a head.

But it was there, despite Lyon again asking Fremantle fans during the week to 
show Goodes respect.

“Everyone puts their head on the pillow at night and deals with their own 
conscience,” he said.

“Mine’s pretty good with Adam Goodes and the Indigenous community at large. 
It’s disappointing personally ... I think this is really simple.

“Once Adam made it known that he was taking in the context that he was - which 
he feels it’s racist, and his teammates - theAFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> family would prefer everyone just 
cheered for their own (team) and left Adam alone.”

Sydney coach John Longmire said he had not heard any booing and had not spoken 
to Goodes about the issue post-match. “I generally think it was OK,” he said.

Goodes was mighty for the Swans on Saturday, his first game at Domain Stadium 
since the July 26 game against West Coast.

The repeated booing from Eagles fans was not the first time it had happened 
with Goodes this season.

It prompted him to take a week off and sparked a heated national debate about 
racism. He started in the midfield against the Dockers and the 35-year-old 
turned back the clock with an outstanding game.

The two-time Brownlow Medallist stepped up manfully with the Swans missing 
onballers Kieren Jack and Luke Parker.

Longmire had also wanted to use Isaac Heeney through the midfield, but the 
youngster was hindered by a shin knock.

“Goodesy took that opportunity and played a really good game,” Longmire said. 
“He was super - a couple of the old, experienced blokes in he and Rhyce Shaw 
were good.”
