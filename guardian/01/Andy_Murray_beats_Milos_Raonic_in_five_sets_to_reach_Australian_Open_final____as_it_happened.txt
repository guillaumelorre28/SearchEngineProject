And with that interview out of the way, Murray is off for some well-earned 
rest.He’s not got too long to recover before Sunday’s final against Novak 
Djokovic, who has had an extra day to recuperate. Murray must be knackered 
after taking more than four hours to beat the excellent Milos Raonic in five 
sets and there were times when it looked like it wasn’t going to be his day, 
especially when he lost the third-set tie-break. Raonic played well enough to 
suggest that he can win a grand slam title one day, but not yet. Instead, for 
the fourth time in the past six years, theAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> final will be contested 
between the two best players in the world, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Will 
the world No1 win his sixth title here or will the No2 finally break his 
Melbourne duck? Join me on Sunday to find out. See you then. Thanks for reading 
and emailing. Bye.

Murray speaks. “It was tough because i played well in that set and in the 
tie-break he didn’t miss one first serve. It’s frustrating when you don’t have 
much say in the points, but i started to get a slightly better read on his 
serve as the match went on.

He’s asked about Raonic’s injury. “He definitely slowed down in the fifth set, 
which was unfortunate for him. It would have been nice to have played a more 
competitive fifth set. The fourth set, I thought he was still moving well. You 
just have to focus.”

What about the prospect of playing Djokovic on Sunday? “A lot of things are 
important against the best players in the world. You can’t do anything poorly. 
Novak’s played extremely well, in his last couple of matches in particular. 
Hopefully this time it can be a different result.”

And finally, a question about Brother Jamie’s progress into the doubles final. 
“Both my parents will be extremely proud. Not many tennis players come out of 
Scotland. I never expected to be doing this. For us both to be in a slam final 
at the same time is pretty incredible. Hopefully he can win tomorrow night.”

Andy Murray beats Milos Raonic 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 6-2!

An escape for Murray on the first point, Raonic reaching a drop volley but 
whipping a forehand long and wide. Murray then slashes an ace out wide for 30-0 
and he earns three match points, reading a forehand pass from Raonic, who’s 
playing well despite it all, and winning the point with an acrobatic backhand 
volley. He works Raonic over, waits for the opening and then, when his 
opponent’s legs have totally turned to jelly, he spears a forehand away to 
secure his place in anotherAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> final! It’s harsh on 
Raonic, but there was no stopping Murray in the end. They embrace warmly at the 
net and Raonic is given a huge ovation as he walks off court. It was a supreme 
effort from the Canadian, but it wasn’t enough against the remarkable Andy 
Murray.

Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 5-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): Given the 
physical pain he’s in, and the disappointment that must be flooding his mind, 
it’s some effort from Raonic to hold again, comfortably this time, finishing it 
off with an ace. Murray will have to serve for the match.

Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 4-1 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic 
looks done as Murray rasps a 221kmh straight back at him to earn two break 
points. Yet he is determined not to suffer the ignominy of a fifth-set bagel, 
saving both break points, Murray sending a forehand return wide, Raonic 
accurate with a subsequent serve. Raonic has a chance to kill the game off, but 
Murray is pounding on the door, and he earns a third break point. But he lets 
his stricken prey off the hook, choosing a feathery drop shot instead of 
finishing it off with a crisp forehand winner, and his execution leaves a lot 
to be desired. Raonic blasts a forehand down the line for deuce – and then 
Murray squanders a fourth break point with a slice that sails long. A fifth 
chance goes begging as well, though that was because of a pumping Raonic ace, 
and the Canadian somehow manages to hold with another ace. Murray really should 
be preparing to serve for the match, but he was profligate and Raonic still has 
hope. Not much, mind you. “Don’t think I’ll get away with pulling that trick on 
Sunday,” says Simon McMahon. “So I might as well do it now. ANDY MURRAY IS 
GOING TO LOSE THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN FINAL!!!”

Fifth set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 4-0 Raonic (*denotes server): Murray is 
like a cat playing with his food now. The only danger is if he gets complacent. 
That doesn’t look likely. He hoicks a backhand lob over Raonic for 40-0 and he 
seals the game with his third second-serve ace of the match.

Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 3-0 Raonic* (*denotes server): This is 
just cruel, another Murray shot clipping the of the net and dying a death on 
Raonic’s side for 0-15. Yet he’s determined to battle on and the crowd greet an 
ace down the middle with a huge cheer. They know he’s wounded, but they like 
his fighting spirit. Against all the odds, straining every time he pulls back 
his racket, he takes a 40-15 lead, somehow charging back and forth across the 
baseline to outlast the manic Murray. Yet Murray fights back to deuce and he 
earns a break point with some withering forehands. I’ve got a suspicion that 
Murray is keeping the points going just so he can increase the torture for 
Raonic, the sadist. Raonic clings on, smashing for deuce, but another errant 
backhand hands Murray a second break point. Grimacing and gurning, Raonic’s 
race is run. He nets a backhand and Murray leads by two breaks in the decider. 
This is surely over.

net cord is helping Murray now. Raonic tries a drop shot at 15-0. Murray 
hurtles forward and whips a forehand down the line. It clips the top of the net 
and flies past Raonic. Murray seals a hold to love with an unsympathetic 
forward into the corner. Raonic is soldiering on, but the extent of his 
movement is decreasing at an alarming rate.

Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 1-0 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic 
has been so cool, but how will he react now? He begins with a double-fault and 
then slices into the net, Murray taking a 0-30 lead. He gets it back to 15-30 
with a forehand winner, but then he nets one to give Murray two break points. 
He double-faults. Murray breaks. Raonic’s poker face has disappeared. He 
smashes his racket to the floor as he walks back to his chair and he’s given a 
warning for racket abuse. You have to feel for him. It’s the biggest match of 
his career and he’s really hurting out there, against an opponent who’s going 
to do everything he can to make him run.

Andy Murray wins the fourth set 6-4 to level the match!

The trainer came on and the mystery is solved: Raonic’s right groin is 
bothering him. Yet it doesn’t stop him from winning the first point, crushing a 
forehand into the corner for 0-15. Murray then tightens up at 15-all, netting a 
backhand, and Raonic earns two break points, larrumping his forehand into the 
corner and leaping into an overhead! That is magnificent. Murray is furious 
with himself again. He’s not serving well. He saves the first break point, 
though, volleying well, then goes for broke with a sliced second serve down the 
middle, Raonic only able to net a forehand! Raonic can’t believe it and soon 
he’s facing another set point, Murray overpowering him with a forehand. He 
misses another first serve – but he goes for that slice down the middle again 
with the second serve and Raonic can only slash a forehand long! The match is 
level again – and how much does Raonic left in the tank?

Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 5-4 Raonic* (*denotes server): Serving to 
stay in the fourth set, Raonic batters an ace down the middle for 15-0, before 
he cracks a booming forehand away for 40-15. Yet sis first double-fault of the 
set makes it 40-30, a slack forehand goes wide for deuce and Murray scorches a 
backhand down the line for a set point. He can’t take it, though, a backhand 
return drifting wide. Murray challenges, but to no avail, and Raonic earns a 
game point with a perfect ace out wide. He holds thanks to an ace and a lovely 
drop volley. Murray will have to serve for the fourth set. It’s Murray. 
Anything could happen. Your guess is as good as mine. Raonic has the trainer 
back on.

Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 5-3 Raonic (*denotes server): Looking to 
consolidate that precious break, Murray begins assertively, serving well for a 
30-0 lead. Raonic mutters. For the first time in his life, he mutters. His 
level has dropped. He knocks a backhand wide to give Murray a 40-15 lead. The 
Eurosport commentators are wondering if something is up with Raonic’s back – 
yet Murray then screws up two simple shots, a forehand and a backhand, and the 
game goes to deuce. He berates himself. That was desperate from Murray, who 
should have wrapped this game up. Instead he’s facing a break point after 
slashing a forehand into the net. Dearie me. Murray is living on the edge now. 
He opts for a risky approach to the net and survives by the skin of his teeth, 
standing his ground and volleying well to save the break point. “Yeaaaaahhhhh!” 
Murray cries, kneeling and pumping his fist. He summons up every last ounce of 
his defiance to hold with a couple of huge forehands. That could have been very 
ugly.

Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 4-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray begins 
the game with a deep return, the ball squirting off the line and drawing the 
forehand error from Raonic, who then slices a backhand into the net for 0-30. 
This is a huge chance for Murray in a match of such fine margins – and he earns 
three break points, Raonic forced to swipe a forehand wide on the run. Murray 
roars. What a pivotal moment this could be. Raonic misses a first serve. He 
can’t do much with the second. Murray dominates the rally, crunching that 
backhand and wearing Raonic down, breaking to love when the Canadian nets a 
weary forehand!

Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 3-3 Raonic (*denotes server): Murray was 
asking the umpire what’s wrong with Raonic after the previous game. He’s not 
convinced, though he can’t allow thoughts of mind games to disturb his focus. 
This is a solid enough game featuring a splendid backhand pass down the line 
from Murray and he holds to 15. On the other side of the net, Raonic doesn’t 
seem to be struggling with his movement.

Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 2-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray thinks 
he’s got the first point when he steers a cross-court backhand past Raonic, but 
a challenge shows that it was clearly out. What’s the line judge up to? Raonic 
isn’t happy. He takes his anger out on the ball, whipping his 15th ace past 
Murray for 30-0, before huge shots off the backhand side helps him into a 
volleying position for 40-0. Murray fights back to 40-30, but the game gets 
away from him when a forehand sails long. He’s now talking to himself a lot.

Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 2-2 Raonic (*denotes server): And judging 
by the quality of this drilled backhand down the line for 0-15, whatever’s 
bothering Raonic can’t be that serious if he’s capable of pulling off shots 
like that. Yet Murray roars after the winning next two points, even though 
second serves were inviting for Raonic. Murray holds, Raonic’s returns letting 
him down. That was tight.

The players are back. Murray will serve. Raonic didn’t appear to be hurt in 
that previous game.

Milos Raonic has disappeared to have some treatment on something during the 
changeover. Murray has also gone off court to gather his thoughts. “I’m 
picturing Djokovic in full Noel Coward mode right now, reclining, pipe and 
slippers,” says Simon McMahon. “Maybe they should just give him the trophy 
after this match ends.”

Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 1-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic is a 
set away from reaching his first ever grand slam final. To get there, he’s 
going to have to beat the world No2. And still the shield is up. We’ve got no 
idea of what’s going on in his head at the moment. Does Raonic currently have 
the stoniest face in sport? He holds to 15.

Milos Raonic wins the third set 7-6; he leads 6-4, 5-7, 7-6!

Third-set tie-break: Murray 4-7 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic crashes an 
ace down the middle and the third set is his! Murray is paid to pay for one 
limp second serve. His old weakness.

Third set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-6 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic comes into 
this game having lost only two points on serve in this set, but he drops a 
third when he starts it with a jittery double-fault. He’s unmoved, though, and 
he makes it 15-all when Murray can’t hit the target with a backhand down the 
line. It goes to 30-all, but Murray can’t earn a set point, another backhand 
down the line going wide after he read a Raonic smash. It would have been an 
absurd winner. But it’s not. And Raonic wallops a forehand away to force that 
tie-break. You have to fancy the Canadian here.

Third set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-5 Raonic (*denotes server): This us impressive 
from Raonic, who drives a forehand out wide, forcing Murray to stretch and 
knock one long for 0-15. He has 0-30 again when Murray nets a forehand. Murray 
is swimming in choppy waters now, but he wins the next two points with some 
staggering tennis, a courageous second-serve ace that’s followed by a spinning, 
snorting, taunting backhand drop shot. What a touch. Yet Murray can’t pull 
clear yet, netting a backhand down the line at 40-30, and the game goes to 
deuce. This is still on for Raonic. Murray is struggling to make first serves 
and he’s facing a break point when he’s forced to knock a forehand wide. It’s 
the first break point of the set. Yet it doesn’t lead to the first break of the 
net. Murray stays in the rally when a forehand clips the top of the net and 
stays in, and the exchange ends with Raonic stooping low and netting a 
backhand. Murray is made of stern stuff. A cleverly disguised forehand brings 
him a game point and he escapes unscathed with a serve down the middle. Raonic 
will serve to force a tie-break.

Third set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 5-5 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray is annoyed 
with himself after pulling a forehand wide on the first point. He probably 
didn’t have to go for the line there, with the rally finely poised. That was a 
decent chance to take a 0-15 lead, but that slip allows Raonic to move into a 
40-0 lead. A double-fault makes it 40-15, but Raonic holds with an ace.

Third set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 5-4 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic takes a 0-15 
lead on the Murray serve again, a series of deft chips enough to find a way 
past the blur of movement on the other side of the net. Murray then finds 
himself in trouble when he splutters a forehand into the net, handing Raonic a 
0-30 lead, but he stubbornly pulls it back to 30-all, before defending well on 
the next point for a 40-30 lead, Raonic jabbing a backhand into the net. From 
0-30, Murray holds with an instinctive volley and Raonic’s concentration will 
need to be absolute now.

Third set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 4-3 Raonic (*denotes server): Murray sends a 
forehand to the Raonic backhand, but the Canadian comes up with a fine shot 
down by Murray’s feet. Murray scoops the ball up and knocks a backhand volley 
past Raonic, but the point was already lost. This is a chance for Raonic, 
especially when he has a look at a second serve, but he can’t take a 0-30 lead, 
a backhand return going long. Still, the game goes to 30-all. Raonic is 
pressing, but not quite hard enough, accurate serving getting Murray out of a 
small hole.

Andy Murray takes rational approach to facing the mighty Novak Djokovic

And with that interview out of the way, Murray is off for some well-earned 
rest.He’s not got too long to recover before Sunday’s final against Novak 
Djokovic, who has had an extra day to recuperate. Murray must be knackered 
after taking more than four hours to beat the excellent Milos Raonic in five 
sets and there were times when it looked like it wasn’t going to be his day, 
especially when he lost the third-set tie-break. Raonic played well enough to 
suggest that he can win a grand slam title one day, but not yet. Instead, for 
the fourth time in the past six years, theAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> final will be contested 
between the two best players in the world, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Will 
the world No1 win his sixth title here or will the No2 finally break his 
Melbourne duck? Join me on Sunday to find out. See you then. Thanks for reading 
and emailing. Bye.

Andy Murray battles back to beat Milos Raonic in five-set Australian Open semi

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/29/andy-murray-beats-milos-raonic-australian-open-semi-final> 
Murray speaks. “It was tough because i played well in that set and in the 
tie-break he didn’t miss one first serve. It’s frustrating when you don’t have 
much say in the points, but i started to get a slightly better read on his 
serve as the match went on.

He’s asked about Raonic’s injury. “He definitely slowed down in the fifth set, 
which was unfortunate for him. It would have been nice to have played a more 
competitive fifth set. The fourth set, I thought he was still moving well. You 
just have to focus.”

What about the prospect of playing Djokovic on Sunday? “A lot of things are 
important against the best players in the world. You can’t do anything poorly. 
Novak’s played extremely well, in his last couple of matches in particular. 
Hopefully this time it can be a different result.”

And finally, a question about Brother Jamie’s progress into the doubles final. 
“Both my parents will be extremely proud. Not many tennis players come out of 
Scotland. I never expected to be doing this. For us both to be in a slam final 
at the same time is pretty incredible. Hopefully he can win tomorrow night.”
 
An escape for Murray on the first point, Raonic reaching a drop volley but 
whipping a forehand long and wide. Murray then slashes an ace out wide for 30-0 
and he earns three match points, reading a forehand pass from Raonic, who’s 
playing well despite it all, and winning the point with an acrobatic backhand 
volley. He works Raonic over, waits for the opening and then, when his 
opponent’s legs have totally turned to jelly, he spears a forehand away to 
secure his place in anotherAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> final! It’s harsh on 
Raonic, but there was no stopping Murray in the end. They embrace warmly at the 
net and Raonic is given a huge ovation as he walks off court. It was a supreme 
effort from the Canadian, but it wasn’t enough against the remarkable Andy 
Murray.

Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 5-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): Given the 
physical pain he’s in, and the disappointment that must be flooding his mind, 
it’s some effort from Raonic to hold again, comfortably this time, finishing it 
off with an ace. Murray will have to serve for the match.
 
Fifth set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 5-1 Raonic (*denotes server): Murray 
bangs a forehand long in andymurrayish fashion to give Raonic a 0-15 lead, but 
he wins the next four points to hold to 15. He’s a game away from his fifth
Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> final.
 
Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 4-1 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic 
looks done as Murray rasps a 221kmh straight back at him to earn two break 
points. Yet he is determined not to suffer the ignominy of a fifth-set bagel, 
saving both break points, Murray sending a forehand return wide, Raonic 
accurate with a subsequent serve. Raonic has a chance to kill the game off, but 
Murray is pounding on the door, and he earns a third break point. But he lets 
his stricken prey off the hook, choosing a feathery drop shot instead of 
finishing it off with a crisp forehand winner, and his execution leaves a lot 
to be desired. Raonic blasts a forehand down the line for deuce – and then 
Murray squanders a fourth break point with a slice that sails long. A fifth 
chance goes begging as well, though that was because of a pumping Raonic ace, 
and the Canadian somehow manages to hold with another ace. Murray really should 
be preparing to serve for the match, but he was profligate and Raonic still has 
hope. Not much, mind you. “Don’t think I’ll get away with pulling that trick on 
Sunday,” says Simon McMahon. “So I might as well do it now. ANDY MURRAY IS 
GOING TO LOSE THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN FINAL!!!”
 
Fifth set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 4-0 Raonic (*denotes server): Murray is 
like a cat playing with his food now. The only danger is if he gets complacent. 
That doesn’t look likely. He hoicks a backhand lob over Raonic for 40-0 and he 
seals the game with his third second-serve ace of the match.

Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 3-0 Raonic* (*denotes server): This is 
just cruel, another Murray shot clipping the of the net and dying a death on 
Raonic’s side for 0-15. Yet he’s determined to battle on and the crowd greet an 
ace down the middle with a huge cheer. They know he’s wounded, but they like 
his fighting spirit. Against all the odds, straining every time he pulls back 
his racket, he takes a 40-15 lead, somehow charging back and forth across the 
baseline to outlast the manic Murray. Yet Murray fights back to deuce and he 
earns a break point with some withering forehands. I’ve got a suspicion that 
Murray is keeping the points going just so he can increase the torture for 
Raonic, the sadist. Raonic clings on, smashing for deuce, but another errant 
backhand hands Murray a second break point. Grimacing and gurning, Raonic’s 
race is run. He nets a backhand and Murray leads by two breaks in the decider. 
This is surely over.
 
Fifth set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 2-0 Raonic (*denotes server): Even the 
net cord is helping Murray now. Raonic tries a drop shot at 15-0. Murray 
hurtles forward and whips a forehand down the line. It clips the top of the net 
and flies past Raonic. Murray seals a hold to love with an unsympathetic 
forward into the corner. Raonic is soldiering on, but the extent of his 
movement is decreasing at an alarming rate.
 
Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 1-0 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic 
has been so cool, but how will he react now? He begins with a double-fault and 
then slices into the net, Murray taking a 0-30 lead. He gets it back to 15-30 
with a forehand winner, but then he nets one to give Murray two break points. 
He double-faults. Murray breaks. Raonic’s poker face has disappeared. He 
smashes his racket to the floor as he walks back to his chair and he’s given a 
warning for racket abuse. You have to feel for him. It’s the biggest match of 
his career and he’s really hurting out there, against an opponent who’s going 
to do everything he can to make him run.

The trainer came on and the mystery is solved: Raonic’s right groin is 
bothering him. Yet it doesn’t stop him from winning the first point, crushing a 
forehand into the corner for 0-15. Murray then tightens up at 15-all, netting a 
backhand, and Raonic earns two break points, larrumping his forehand into the 
corner and leaping into an overhead! That is magnificent. Murray is furious 
with himself again. He’s not serving well. He saves the first break point, 
though, volleying well, then goes for broke with a sliced second serve down the 
middle, Raonic only able to net a forehand! Raonic can’t believe it and soon 
he’s facing another set point, Murray overpowering him with a forehand. He 
misses another first serve – but he goes for that slice down the middle again 
with the second serve and Raonic can only slash a forehand long! The match is 
level again – and how much does Raonic left in the tank?

Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 5-4 Raonic* (*denotes server): Serving to 
stay in the fourth set, Raonic batters an ace down the middle for 15-0, before 
he cracks a booming forehand away for 40-15. Yet sis first double-fault of the 
set makes it 40-30, a slack forehand goes wide for deuce and Murray scorches a 
backhand down the line for a set point. He can’t take it, though, a backhand 
return drifting wide. Murray challenges, but to no avail, and Raonic earns a 
game point with a perfect ace out wide. He holds thanks to an ace and a lovely 
drop volley. Murray will have to serve for the fourth set. It’s Murray. 
Anything could happen. Your guess is as good as mine. Raonic has the trainer 
back on.
 
Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 5-3 Raonic (*denotes server): Looking to 
consolidate that precious break, Murray begins assertively, serving well for a 
30-0 lead. Raonic mutters. For the first time in his life, he mutters. His 
level has dropped. He knocks a backhand wide to give Murray a 40-15 lead. The 
Eurosport commentators are wondering if something is up with Raonic’s back – 
yet Murray then screws up two simple shots, a forehand and a backhand, and the 
game goes to deuce. He berates himself. That was desperate from Murray, who 
should have wrapped this game up. Instead he’s facing a break point after 
slashing a forehand into the net. Dearie me. Murray is living on the edge now. 
He opts for a risky approach to the net and survives by the skin of his teeth, 
standing his ground and volleying well to save the break point. “Yeaaaaahhhhh!” 
Murray cries, kneeling and pumping his fist. He summons up every last ounce of 
his defiance to hold with a couple of huge forehands. That could have been very 
ugly.
 
Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 4-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray begins 
the game with a deep return, the ball squirting off the line and drawing the 
forehand error from Raonic, who then slices a backhand into the net for 0-30. 
This is a huge chance for Murray in a match of such fine margins – and he earns 
three break points, Raonic forced to swipe a forehand wide on the run. Murray 
roars. What a pivotal moment this could be. Raonic misses a first serve. He 
can’t do much with the second. Murray dominates the rally, crunching that 
backhand and wearing Raonic down, breaking to love when the Canadian nets a 
weary forehand!
 
Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 3-3 Raonic (*denotes server): Murray was 
asking the umpire what’s wrong with Raonic after the previous game. He’s not 
convinced, though he can’t allow thoughts of mind games to disturb his focus. 
This is a solid enough game featuring a splendid backhand pass down the line 
from Murray and he holds to 15. On the other side of the net, Raonic doesn’t 
seem to be struggling with his movement.
 
Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 2-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray thinks 
he’s got the first point when he steers a cross-court backhand past Raonic, but 
a challenge shows that it was clearly out. What’s the line judge up to? Raonic 
isn’t happy. He takes his anger out on the ball, whipping his 15th ace past 
Murray for 30-0, before huge shots off the backhand side helps him into a 
volleying position for 40-0. Murray fights back to 40-30, but the game gets 
away from him when a forehand sails long. He’s now talking to himself a lot.
 
Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 2-2 Raonic (*denotes server): And judging 
by the quality of this drilled backhand down the line for 0-15, whatever’s 
bothering Raonic can’t be that serious if he’s capable of pulling off shots 
like that. Yet Murray roars after the winning next two points, even though 
second serves were inviting for Raonic. Murray holds, Raonic’s returns letting 
him down. That was tight.

The players are back. Murray will serve. Raonic didn’t appear to be hurt in 
that previous game.
 
Milos Raonic has disappeared to have some treatment on something during the 
changeover. Murray has also gone off court to gather his thoughts. “I’m 
picturing Djokovic in full Noel Coward mode right now, reclining, pipe and 
slippers,” says Simon McMahon. “Maybe they should just give him the trophy 
after this match ends.”

Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 1-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic is a 
set away from reaching his first ever grand slam final. To get there, he’s 
going to have to beat the world No2. And still the shield is up. We’ve got no 
idea of what’s going on in his head at the moment. Does Raonic currently have 
the stoniest face in sport? He holds to 15.

Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-7, 0-1 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic 
returns after a toilet break and he holds to love at the start of the fourth 
set. He remains impossible to read. There’s still not even the slightest hint 
of emotion on that poker face.
 
Third-set tie-break: Murray 4-7 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic crashes an 
ace down the middle and the third set is his! Murray is paid to pay for one 
limp second serve. His old weakness.
 
Third-set tie-break: Murray 4-6 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray retrieves a 
smash – but then he nets a backhand and Raonic has two set points!
 
Third-set tie-break: Murray* 4-5 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic nets a 
forehand return. Murray is just about still in this.

down the middle.
 
Third-set tie-break: Murray 2-5 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic wallops 
another smash away! He’s two points away from winning the third set! Murray 
challenges in vain.

serve is working.

Third-set tie-break: Murray* 2-3 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic jabs a 
backhand return long. “Woke up to find the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> has brought in some sort of 
2nd Place Play-off,” says Mac Millings. “When did that start, then?”
 
Third-set tie-break: Murray* 1-3 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic punishes a 
tame Murray second serve with a contemptuous forehand.
 
Third-set tie-break: Murray 1-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray nets a 
forehand return.
 
Third-set tie-break: Murray 1-1 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic hesitates 
and incredibly plonks a volley into the net!
 
Third-set tie-break: Murray* 0-1 Raonic (*denotes server): A searing 
cross-court forehand return from Raonic is met by Murray, but his low forehand 
down the line flashes out!
 
Third set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-6 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic comes into 
this game having lost only two points on serve in this set, but he drops a 
third when he starts it with a jittery double-fault. He’s unmoved, though, and 
he makes it 15-all when Murray can’t hit the target with a backhand down the 
line. It goes to 30-all, but Murray can’t earn a set point, another backhand 
down the line going wide after he read a Raonic smash. It would have been an 
absurd winner. But it’s not. And Raonic wallops a forehand away to force that 
tie-break. You have to fancy the Canadian here.
 
Third set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 6-5 Raonic (*denotes server): This us impressive 
from Raonic, who drives a forehand out wide, forcing Murray to stretch and 
knock one long for 0-15. He has 0-30 again when Murray nets a forehand. Murray 
is swimming in choppy waters now, but he wins the next two points with some 
staggering tennis, a courageous second-serve ace that’s followed by a spinning, 
snorting, taunting backhand drop shot. What a touch. Yet Murray can’t pull 
clear yet, netting a backhand down the line at 40-30, and the game goes to 
deuce. This is still on for Raonic. Murray is struggling to make first serves 
and he’s facing a break point when he’s forced to knock a forehand wide. It’s 
the first break point of the set. Yet it doesn’t lead to the first break of the 
net. Murray stays in the rally when a forehand clips the top of the net and 
stays in, and the exchange ends with Raonic stooping low and netting a 
backhand. Murray is made of stern stuff. A cleverly disguised forehand brings 
him a game point and he escapes unscathed with a serve down the middle. Raonic 
will serve to force a tie-break.

Third set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 5-5 Raonic* (*denotes server): Murray is annoyed 
with himself after pulling a forehand wide on the first point. He probably 
didn’t have to go for the line there, with the rally finely poised. That was a 
decent chance to take a 0-15 lead, but that slip allows Raonic to move into a 
40-0 lead. A double-fault makes it 40-15, but Raonic holds with an ace.
 
Third set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 5-4 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic takes a 0-15 
lead on the Murray serve again, a series of deft chips enough to find a way 
past the blur of movement on the other side of the net. Murray then finds 
himself in trouble when he splutters a forehand into the net, handing Raonic a 
0-30 lead, but he stubbornly pulls it back to 30-all, before defending well on 
the next point for a 40-30 lead, Raonic jabbing a backhand into the net. From 
0-30, Murray holds with an instinctive volley and Raonic’s concentration will 
need to be absolute now.
 
Third set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 4-4 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic holds to 
love. Are we heading for a tie-break?

Third set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 4-3 Raonic (*denotes server): Murray sends a 
forehand to the Raonic backhand, but the Canadian comes up with a fine shot 
down by Murray’s feet. Murray scoops the ball up and knocks a backhand volley 
past Raonic, but the point was already lost. This is a chance for Raonic, 
especially when he has a look at a second serve, but he can’t take a 0-30 lead, 
a backhand return going long. Still, the game goes to 30-all. Raonic is 
pressing, but not quite hard enough, accurate serving getting Murray out of a 
small hole.
 
Third set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 3-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Finally! Finally, a 
point goes against the serve, Murray hammering a backhand for 15-all past 
Raonic, who was stranded at the net. Yet it’s just the one point. Murray isn’t 
allowed any closer than that, Raonic pinging two aces past him to hold to 15.
 
Third set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 3-2 Raonic (*denotes server): Murray holds to 
love, swerving a second-serve ace down the middle, and we’ve still not had a 
point against serve in the third set!

Third set: Murray 4-6, 7-5, 2-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic appears to 
have shrugged off the loss of the second set and his serve is clicking again, 
his first ace in a while making it 40-0. He holds to love and we’ve still not 
had a point against serve in this set. Murray has to be careful.
 
Third set: Murray* 4-6, 7-5, 2-1 Raonic (*denotes server): Murray adopts the 
Raonic approach and wins the first point with some neat volleying at the net. 
He holds to love. We’ve not had a point against serve in this set yet.
