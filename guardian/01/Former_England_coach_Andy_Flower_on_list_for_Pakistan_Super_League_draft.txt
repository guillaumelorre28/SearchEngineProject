Flower, who stepped down from his position with the England and Wales cricket 
board after the Ashes whitewash of 2013-14, is joined by big names such as 
Waqar Younis, Allan Donald and Australia’s World Cup winning coach John 
Buchanan.

The South African’s inclusion opens up the possibility of a reunion with Kevin 
Pietersen <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen> in the PSL, to be 
played in February next year.

The former England international, who has confirmed he will take part 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/22/kevin-pietersen-pakistan-super-league-t20>
, was sacked by the ECB shortly after Flower’s departure, andhas since claimed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/07/kevin-pietersen-andy-flower-england-cricket>
: “Flower had it in for me ever since he took over.”

Salary caps have been set for the head coach in the PSL at between 
$45,000-$60,000 (£30,000-40,000) per season.
