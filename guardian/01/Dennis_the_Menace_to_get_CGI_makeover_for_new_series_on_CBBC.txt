“We’re thrilled to be working with CBBC on the new series, which will see us 
bring Dennis to life and bang up to date in CGI for the next generation of 
Beano fans,” said Emma Scott, chief executive of Beano Studios.


The 52-part series of 11-minute episodes, called Dennis & Gnasher Unleashed 
<https://www.beano.com/posts/new-dennis-on-tv>, will see the 10-year-old Dennis 
“aged up a bit” visually in his 21st-century makeover, which will air in late 
2017.


Previous series, the last of which aired in 2013 on the BBC, showed Dennis 
only in 2D.

“Dennis and Gnasher have been unleashing their own particular brand of 
mischief on CBBC for many years and their ardent fans will be delighted by this 
wonderful new series from two of the UK’s most notorious rascals,” said Cheryl 
Taylor, controller of CBBC.


Beano Studios has also hinted that a Dennis-led Beano movie may be in the 
works, saying that it was “exploring plans” to take its characters to “bigger 
screens and stages worldwide”.

The company was set up earlier this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/08/dennis-the-menace-beano-youtube-tv-series-movie-magazine>
 by parent company DC Thomson to lead a digital rejuvenation of the 78-year-old 
magazine’s characters including Minnie the Minx and Bananaman.


The venerable title, which holds the Guinness World Record for longest-running 
weekly comic, sells 38,000 copies per week in the UK.


However, Scott is keenly aware of the need to win over the YouTube and iPad 
generation, setting up a new online portal, Beano.com.

In 2012, DC Thomson shut the Dandy, the UK’s oldest children’s comic, and put 
it online following its 75th anniversary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/dandy-comic-online-dc-thomson>.


However, the attempt to give the title a breath of digital life failed and the 
website was shut.
