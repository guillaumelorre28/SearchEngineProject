Steven Pinker is a Canadian experimental psychologist renowned for his work in 
the fields of cognitive science and linguistics. He is a professor at Harvard 
and a prolific author, with bestsellers on how the mind works (the title of one 
of his two Pulitzer-nominated books) and the science of language. In his 
controversial 2011 work,The Better Angels of Our Nature 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/22/better-angels-steven-pinker-review>
, he argues that violence in human societies is on the wane. Pinker regularly 
crops up on lists of top global thinkers. His most recent book isThe Sense of 
Style 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/15/sense-of-style-review-steven-pinker-linguistics>
, in which he offers guidelines for achieving clarity in non-fiction writing.

The Fallen of World War II

With this film by Neil Halloran <http://www.fallen.io/ww2/>, data graphics has 
become a major new medium of intellectual exposition and artistic expression. 
His presentation of war death data is stunning: informative in a way that no 
text could be, and emotionally ravaging. Who would have thought that bar graphs 
(admittedly, with the help of haunting music) could overflow with human pathos? 
Less emotionally captivating, but even more mind-altering, is Max Roser’sOur 
World in Data <http://ourworldindata.org/> and Marian Tupy’s HumanProgress. 
Both use compelling data graphics to present an utterly different picture of 
the world than the one we get from the headlines.

As an ageing baby boomer I have spent the 21st century lamenting the decline 
of popular music and was heartened, then heartbroken, by the shooting-star 
career of Amy Winehouse.This documentary  <http://www.amyfilm.co.uk/>has stayed 
with me for weeks. Winehouse was doomed by callous friends and family and by an 
industry that romanticises licentiousness and protects lucrative stars from the 
consequences of their own behavior. But she also had an oppositional 
temperament, enjoyed her drugs and booze, and made stupid and reckless choices. 
“They tried to make me go to rehab, and I said No, No, No” – funny at the time, 
horrifying in hindsight. Must creative artists live fast and die young? To what 
extent should we hold people responsible for their self-destructive choices, 
and to what extent are they victims of circumstances or other people?

Since the end of the human-interest-driven space race in the 1960s we have 
become criminally blase about the stunning achievement of unmanned planetary 
exploration. But tomorrow’s historians will surely credit space photography as 
one of our crowning achievements: it’s visually gorgeous, and prods us to 
contemplation about our place in the cosmos. Last month we were treated to
photographs of the maybe-maybe-not planet Pluto 
<http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/07/150717-pluto-flyby-photos-pictures-new-horizons-space/>

Language Log 


Do you notice grammar gaffes, wonder about the speech styles of celebrities, 
find yourself curious about the origin of new words and constructions?Language 
Log <http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/> is the place to go for commentary 
by people who actually know their stuff – linguists and other language 
scientists – as opposed to the pundits and scribblers who think that their 
standing as writers entitles them to present their offhand impressions and 
grumpy peeves as proven fact. One important exception is Oliver Kamm’s new book
Accidence Will Happen 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/accidence-will-happen.html>, which is 
informed by astonishing erudition on the history and grammar of the English 
language.

Only rarely do I read a book and feel that I am in the presence of true 
brilliance. I had that feeling throughout the physicist David Deutsch’s 
exploration of the nature of knowledge, reality, beauty, progress, and culture. 
Deutsch avoids intellectual cliches and scientific conventional wisdom, 
reasoning everything out from first principles, usually persuasively, always 
provocatively.

Plato at the Googleplex: Why Philosophy Won’t Go Away 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/19/rebecca-newberger-goldstein-interview-science-philosophy-plato-googleplex>
, we’ve cultivated an interest in ancient Greece, and this summer we have been 
taking turns reading aloud this graphic tale of sex and violence. It’s a 
late-life delight for someone who somehow missed it in college: the startling 
combination of primitive ways of life (chiefdoms raiding each other for women) 
and thinking (human war as entertainment for capricious gods) with flashes of 
strikingly modern sensibilities – particularly the pathos in the ebbing 
consciousness of fatally wounded warriors and the anticipation of the grief in 
their relatives.

“How many feminists does it take to change a light bulb?” “That’s not funny!” 
If there ever was any truth in this old joke, it has been exploded by theInside 
Amy Schumer sketches on Comedy Central. 
<https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=amy+schumer+comedy+central> Like 
all ambitious comedy, itcan verge on the tasteless and occasionally misfires 
(her stand-up is not as good as her sketches). But her humour is original, the 
execution perfect, and the targeting uncomfortably dead-on. It’s great to see a 
young woman from a new generation join the pantheon of great Jewish comedians.
