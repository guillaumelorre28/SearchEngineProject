The winner

Falling a decent 36%, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-second-best-exotic-marigold-hotel> 
comfortably held on to the top spot for a second week, rebuffing the challenge 
of new releases such as Neill Blomkamp’s Chappie. After 11 days, the ensemble 
comedy has grossed a healthy £8.64m.

So far, Second Best Exotic is performing rather differently in the marketplace 
to its predecessor, although no less successfully.The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/23/best-exotic-marigold-hotel-review>
 began in late February 2012 with a £2.22m opening weekend, increasing 5% in 
its second frame to £2.34m. At that stage of its run, after two weekends of 
play, it stood at £7.01m.

 Chappie video review 
With the sequel, it’s been a different story. Second Best Exotic began with a 
stonking £3.07m (plus previews of £705,000), dropping to £1.96m for the second 
session. It’s now reasonable to assume that this second film won’t match the 
extraordinary sustained performance of the first one, which managed a final 
total that was 9.2 times its opening number (ie £20.4m). If Second Best Exotic 
manages to quintuple its debut tally, it will get to £15m, which would still be 
a strong and very profitable result for Fox UK, with foreign all to come.

Like its predecessor, Second Best Exotic is performing well on weekdays, 
grossing a solid £2.91m during the Monday-to-Thursday period last week. The 
film should go into this weekend with £10.5m already grossed at UK cinemas.

The indie hit

Although Second Best Exotic managed a healthy site average of £3,240, it was 
no match forStill Alice <https://www.theguardian.com/film/still-alice>, which 
achieved the best per-cinema number of any film on release: £4,454. The US 
indie drama grossed a very strong £383,000 from 86 venues, plus £18,500 in 
previews.

The success of Still Alice is a vindication of distributor Curzon’s strategy, 
which was to wait for all of the major awards contenders to play out to UK 
audiences, holding back release until after theOscars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars-2015> ceremony. In doing so, it 
gambled thatJulianne Moore <https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliannemoore> 
would, as expected, win the best actress prize. In order to make the film 
eligible for theBaftas <https://www.theguardian.com/film/baftas-2015> (another 
win for Moore), Curzon quietly released the film for one week in December at 
Curzon Ripon in North Yorkshire.

 Still Alice video review 
Despite Moore’s clean sweep of all the major actress prizes, it was by no 
means certain that audiences would show up for Still Alice. Adulatory reviews 
made the film sound not so cheery, given the early-onset Alzheimer’s storyline. 
But the timing was perfect, with no other film offering direct competition, and 
intense audience curiosity for a film that had been included in all the awards 
conversations, but which had been almost impossible to see. Still Alice had 
been leaked online after Sony’s server was hacked in November, but most pirate 
sites were swiftly shut down, and, in any case, the target audience for Still 
Alice hardly overlaps with regular viewers of pirated material.

Curzon received investment from the BFI’s distribution fund in order to help 
the film break out to a broader audience. This it now looks set to do: Still 
Alice expands to 200 cinemas from this Friday.

The mainstream new releases

Two Hollywood studio pictures benefited from significantly wider release than 
Still Alice –Chappie <https://www.theguardian.com/film/chappie> and Unfinished 
Business both landed at 400-plus venues – while Universal’s Kill the Messenger 
landed at 115. All proved disappointing relative to expectations.

Sony’s Chappie at least managed to break the £1m barrier, with takings of 
£1.02m from 459 cinemas. This compares with a debut of £2.15m plus £974,000 in 
previews for Blomkamp’s previous filmElysium 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/22/elysium-review>. District 9 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/03/district-9-review>, which 
benefited from excellent buzz but lacked familiar cast names, began with £2.29m 
in September 2009.

Fox comedy Unfinished Business landed flatly in ninth place, with £394,000 
from 408 cinemas, yielding a £966 average. Vince Vaughn’s previous vehicle,
Delivery Man <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/09/delivery-man-review>
, did much better, beginning with £1.10m from 372 venues in January 2014. 
Despite the seeming enduring affection for Vaughn, it was always hard to 
identify the audience for a fish-out-of-water, Euro-business-trip comedy, 
co-starring Dave Franco and Tom Wilkinson.

The flop

Kill the Messenger, starring Jeremy Renner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/15/jeremy-renner-david-thomson>
, did worst of all, with a gross of just £58,000, and a site average of £501. 
Produced by Universal’s boutique arm Focus in the US, this film needed a more 
nurturing release strategy than it has been afforded. Despite some notable 
advocates among US critics (Variety and Hollywood Reporter were both positive), 
the film wasn’t aggressively screened to UK reviewers, and cinema-goers could 
be forgiven for not noticing it had come out. Perhaps Kill the Messenger’s fate 
was sealed when it grossed just $2.5m in US cinemas last October.

Fifty Shades update

Fifty Shades of Grey hits $500 million at the global box office

With £32.71m so far, Fifty Shades of Grey is now the fifth-biggest hit of the 
past year, behindthe final Hobbit film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/dec/11/hobbit-battle-of-the-five-armies-video-review>
,Paddington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/27/paddington-review-michael-bond-film-adaptation>
,The Inbetweeners 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/06/inbetweeners-2-review-film> and 
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/17/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review-andy-serkis>
. Fifty Shades should have no trouble overtaking the latter two, although it 
will struggle to catch Paddington, now at £37.24m. Incidentally, Paddington saw 
a 64% rise in box office at the weekend, suggesting that the bear has no 
intention of going away, and will still be in cinemas for the Easter holiday, 
despite a DVD release on 23 March.

The market falters

Previously this year, successive weekends have proved level with the 
equivalent frame from 2014, or well ahead, or only very moderately down. Now, 
for the first time this year, there is a significant shortfall, with takings 
21% down on the same session a year ago, when300: Rise of an Empire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/06/300-rise-of-an-empire-review-greek-history>
 knockedThe Lego Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/the-lego-movie-review> off the 
top spot. It’s easy to identify the reason: the lack of any commercially 
compelling new film arriving in multiplexes. Sony’s nervousness about Chappie 
can be gauged by the fact that reviews were embargoed until two days before 
release, and the first UK screening for critics was held on the day the embargo 
lifted. It’s hard to escape the feeling that this year distributors viewed the 
first weekend of March as a quiet harbour for some of their less favoured 
vessels – with the honourable exception of Still Alice, which benefited all the 
more in comparison to the rival offer.
