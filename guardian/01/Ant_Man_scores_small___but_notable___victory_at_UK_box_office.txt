The winner: Ant-Man

Disney and Marvel have already scored a robust £48.3m this summer with 
Avengers: Age of Ultron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2015/apr/21/avengers-age-of-ultron-london-premiere-in-pictures>
. If that franchise film represented a safe bet, the partners’ other offering, 
Ant-Man, always felt more like a roll of the dice. The premise – an 
insect-sized superhero – doesn’t suggest an equivalently broad appeal, and then 
there was the issue of original director (and co-writer)Edgar Wright 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/edgar-wright> departing the project close to 
shooting. Would Marvel fans and cinema audiences in general line up for the 
film?

The opening number, £4.01m, compares unfavourably with the debut of Guardians 
of the Galaxy last summer. That Marvel title kicked off with just under £5m, 
plus £1.37m in previews, for an opening tally of £6.36m. Among the 12 Marvel 
feature films where head creative honchoKevin Feige 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/23/marvel-studios-kevin-feige> 
carries a full producer credit, only 2008’s The Incredible Hulk (debut of 
£3.25m including £533,000 in previews) and 2011’s Captain America: The First 
Avenger (£2.98m) began with smaller numbers. You might also include 2011’s Thor 
in that list, since its £5.45m opening included £2.34m in previews.

Viewed away from the context of Marvel, Ant-Man’s £4.01m debut is actually 
pretty decent. Looking at some of the other blockbusters this summer, it’s very 
comparable withMad Max: Fury Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/14/mad-max-fury-road-review-extravagantly-bizarre>
, which began with £4.54m including £639,000 in previews back in May. And it’s 
ahead of Terminator Genisys, which kicked off with £3.79m including £716,000 in 
previews.

The sustained runs: Jurassic World 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-world> and Minions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/minions>

Jurassic World, now with cumulative box-office of £59.5m (the 10th-biggest 
gross ever in the UK), has just delivered a sixth weekend with more than £1m in 
takings. The last film to do so wasPaddington 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/27/paddington-review-michael-bond-film-adaptation>
, which enjoyed a very sustained run into Christmas 2014 and beyond. Minions, 
in its fourth weekend of play, managed a robust £2.70m. That’s actually ahead 
of the fourth-frame takings of Jurassic World, and is the biggest for a fourth 
session since The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies, which was the top-grossing 
release of 2014. Minions now stands at £32.3m. With kids now on school holiday, 
the film should continue to perform solidly.

 Amy: Asif Kapadia’s documentary on Amy Winehouse – exclusive clip 
Achieving the gentlest decline in the Top 10 is Asif Kapadia’s Amy Winehouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse> documentary Amy, with a drop 
of 24%. Helping the sustain in box-office is the film’s modest expansion from 
214 cinemas to 254. With £2.06m in takings so far, Amy is now the sixth-biggest 
documentary hit in the UK, excluding concert films. Amy should overtake 
fifth-placedTouching the Void 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/30/touching-the-void-best-british> 
(£2.64m) by the end of its run, and it has a shot at matching Kapadia’s ownSenna
 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/05/ayrton-senna-alain-prost>, which 
reached £3.17m, and is in fourth place in the UK all-time chart.

For classical music fans, the summer concert from Dutch violinist and conductor
André Rieu <http://www.andrerieu.com/> is an annual highlight. Beamed into 
cinemas from his home town of Maastricht since 2011, the event has been 
steadily gaining in popularity over the years, achieving £831,000 from 395 UK 
cinemas exactly a year ago. This time around, Rieu has achieved his biggest UK 
box-office yet – £1.11m from 460 cinemas – a number that sets a new record for 
a music concert at UK cinemas, ahead of Take That Live andOne Direction: Where 
We Are 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/12/one-direction-where-we-are-the-concert-film-review-harry-styles>
. While the Rieu number includes some takings from encore showings on Sunday, 
the event’s Saturday tally of £1.10m is the only time a music concert has 
grossed over £1m in the UK in a single day. The audience for Rieu skews 
60-plus, and is viewed as infrequent cinemagoers. Pulling them in once a year 
every summer gives cinemas a chance to market relevant coming attractions to an 
audience that seldom comes through the doors.

With Eid, marking the end of Ramadan, falling on Saturday, the weekend proved 
a propitious time to release films aimed at the UK’s south Asian markets. Hindi 
titleBajrangi Bhajaan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/19/bajrangi-bhaijaan-review-salman-khan-india-pakistan-movie>
 covers a lot of bases by featuring a Pakistani girl in India, and stars Salman 
Khan and Kareena Kapoor. A debut gross of £758,000 is the biggest for a 
Bollywood film since Dhoom 3 back in December 2013. The film’s site average of 
£6,831 was exceeded only by Ant-Man. Urdu romantic drama Bin Roye also achieved 
a very healthy average (£4,958), with £139,000 from just 28 cinemas.

Three films from heavyweight distributors opened on a combined 729 screens, 
achieving total box-office under £700,000. Warners offered horror titleThe 
Gallows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/09/the-gallows-review-horror-at-the-high-school-play>
, and scraped a site average above £1,000, with £336,000 from 315 venues. 
That’s an achievement that eludedSelf/Less 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/16/selfless-review-ben-kingsley-ryan-reynolds>
 from director Tarsem Singh, starring Ryan Reynolds. Landing outside the top 
10, the film debuted with a weak £215,000 from 267 cinemas. Fox’sTrue Story 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/16/true-story-review-exasperating-tale-of-a-disgraced-journalist>
, starring Jonah Hill and James Franco, likewise fell short of £1,000 per 
venue, despite a relatively focused rollout into 147 cinemas. Takings of 
£137,000 earned True Story 15th place in the weekend chart.

 True Story - video review 
Secret Cinema rises again

For the first time, Secret Cinema’s presentation of The Empire Strikes Back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2015/jun/12/secret-cinema-the-empire-strikes-back-in-pictures>
 drops out of the UK top 10. The irony is that weekend takings of £304,000 are 
6% up on the previous weekend, and are in fact the highest achieved so far. 
It’s also the first time that this run of Secret Cinema has cracked £300,000 in 
a single weekend. Now that schools are on holiday for the summer, takings for 
the event on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday should see a rise – so far, the 
bulk of tickets have been sold for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. With £2.60m so 
far, The Empire Strikes Back is currently on track to achieve a final gross of 
£6.5m.

Takings are 2% up on the previous weekend, but 17% down on the equivalent 
frame from 2014, when Dawn of the Planet of the Apes landed with a 
previews-inclusive £8.7m splash at the chart summit. Cinema bookers can be 
reasonably confident of an uptick in the coming session, with the arrival of
