This recipe uses a well-loved ingredient: biltong. Biltong is very much like 
beef jerky, a type of cured meat. There are various varieties, but beef is very 
common. You can also get biltong made from game meat.

The biltong stew concept first came about after my husband mentioned eating it 
with sadza whilst visiting a friend. The very first time I made the stew, it 
turned out to be just as wonderful as I had hoped it would. The most amazing 
thing was how ridiculously easy it was to make.

1 tbsp olive oil
300g biltong
1 onion, chopped
2 fresh tomatoes, chopped
ginger/garlic paste
2 tbsp tomato puree
2 tbsp peanut butter
cayenne pepper
100ml boiling water (use stock if biltong is unsalted)

Heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan or saucepan and fry the onions and 
garlic.

Add the biltong and fry for just a minute. Quickly follow by adding the tomato 
puree. Stir and cook for a minute, then follow with the peanut butter.

After one minute, add the chopped tomatoes and allow to break down and cook. 
Within five minutes, it will have cooked down and thickened so add the boiling 
water, a little at a time: you may not need it all. This stew is meant to be 
nice and thick. Serve with a side of vegetables and sadza or rice.
