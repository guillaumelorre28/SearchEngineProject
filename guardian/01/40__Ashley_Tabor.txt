A speedy rise up the hit parade for Ashley Tabor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ashley-tabor> who is in charge of the UK's 
biggest commercial radio group spanning Capital, Heart and Classic FM.

Bankrolled by his father, multimillionaire racehorse owner Michael Tabor, 
Global was created with the £545m purchase of GCap Media and Chrysalis Radio.

Tabor also has a talent and music publishing business that includes boy band 
the Wanted.

The Global boss prefers to stay out of the media spotlight, but when he does 
put his head above the parapet he has been an outspoken critic of the BBC.

Global reported pre-tax losses of £27.7m for the year to the end of March, 
while underlying profits grew 12.5% to £56.6m. The highest-paid director, 
understood to be Tabor, was paid a total of £2m.

It remains to be seen whether Global Radio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/globalradio> will grow even bigger after its 
£70m purchase of Smooth owner GMG Radio was referred to media regulator Ofcom.
