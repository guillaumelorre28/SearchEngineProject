Anthony Blunt liked to invent new “special subjects” for third-year 
undergraduates. One of them was “19th-century art criticism in England and 
France”.Anita Brookner <https://www.theguardian.com/books/anita-brookner> 
taught our students about Baudelaire while I was deputed to introduce them to 
Ruskin and Pater. This was in 1966.

Thus we formed an unlikely friendship. Anita would never enter a pub, but we 
sometimes had a drink in a little cafe opposite the Archives Nationales in 
Paris, and she liked lunching in the restaurant at Fenwick’s in Bond Street. A 
quarter of a trout would fill her.

She was smartly dressed, but in those days often wore ornate dark glasses, 
used bright red lipstick and chain-smoked tipped Woodbines. Anita often spent 
the cocktail hour in Blunt’s flat on the top floor of the Courtauld building. 
As soon as she got home to South Kensington, she told me, she went to bed with 
piles of empty exercise books in which she wrote novels, in French. So her 
later public career as a novelist had been given some very personal preparation.
