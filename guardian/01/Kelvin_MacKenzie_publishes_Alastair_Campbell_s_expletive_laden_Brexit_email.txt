An expletive-laden email from Alastair Campbell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alastaircampbell> berating Sun columnist 
Kelvin MacKenzie for expressing “buyers remorse” over voting to leave the EU 
has been published by the Sun.

MacKenzie, a former editor of the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid, wrote on 
Monday that the “surge” of power he had felt from voting leave had given way to 
worries about the impact the vote would have on the UK’s future.

Regrets, I've had a few: Kelvin MacKenzie and the great Brexit U-turn

“Four days later I don’t feel quite the same,” he said. “I have buyer’s 
remorse. A sense of be careful what you wish for. To be truthful I am fearful 
of what lies ahead.”

However, in his column on Friday, MacKenzie included an email from Campbell in 
which Tony Blair’s former spin doctor attacked his earlier backing for the 
leave campaign and the “giant propaganda machine” he said MacKenzie had been 
part of.

According to MacKenzie, Campbell’s email read: “Never mind buyers remorse, you 
should feel fucking ashamed to have been for so long part of a giant propaganda 
machine which has helped the country make a potentially self-destructive 
decision that future generations will have to live with when you and I are long 
gone.”

“Murdoch has been a complete poison in our national life and you have helped 
so much. And because you are well sorted it will not hit you nearly as hard as 
those you and yours have persuaded to make the decision they did.

“But hey, it’s all a bit of fun eh? Fuck off.”

On Twitter, Campbell confirmed he had written the email as the Sun had 
reported it.

In his column, MacKenzie hit back at Campbell, citing his involvement in the 
notorious document claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass 
destruction.

He wrote: “I think of the two of us, the one that knows most about ‘giant 
propaganda machines’ would be Campbell by some distance.”
