Immaculately dressed in a black and gold suit, Patricia Henríquez de Ugarte, 
60, looks as glamorous as the life-size portrait of her younger self that hangs 
on the living room wall.

Looking good and being successful – she has been the vice-mayor of Machala in 
south-west Ecuador for five years – seems to come easily to Henríquez de 
Ugarte, ensconced in her marble-floored, security-gated family condo. But she 
says she would be nowhere without the help of domestic workers.

"For example, this morning, this room was a complete mess," she says, 
gesturing at the spotless space.

Henríquez de Ugarte has had about eight domestic workers in her life, 
fulfilling roles as diverse as nurse, nanny, cook and gardener. She can 
remember each one and recount details of their personality and lives.

"All of my domestic workers have been part of the family and they give their 
opinion whether we like it or not. Often my children and grandchildren will 
listen more to the help than to us," she says.

Despite her public office, for years Henríquez de Ugarte knew nothing of the 
work being done by the local women's groups. "When I began to talk to the 
women's movement here they started to brainwash me," she laughs. She is still 
shocked when they tell her of the treatment some workers receive.

Overall Henríquez de Ugarte is optimistic about the changes that are taking 
place in her country.

"It has taken a long time to realise but slowly we are starting to recognise 
how important these women are to us. I don't take my domestic worker for 
granted because I know I really need her," she concludes.
