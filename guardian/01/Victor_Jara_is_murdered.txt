In 1973, the military led a coup d'etat against Chile's democratically elected 
government and ushered in Augusto Pinochet's brutal dictatorship. One of the 
first victims was Victor Jara, a protest singer. Together with thousands of 
radicals, Jara was dragged into an indoor sports arena in Santiago, his arms 
were smashed and the bones in his fingers systematically broken by soldiers, 
who then taunted him to play the guitar. Three days later, he was machine 
gunned to death. Jara's music – a poeticnueva canción that borrowed from 
indigenous Chilean folk – seem like a gentle and stately response to fascism. 
But, behind Jara's pretty tenor voice, there's a fearlessness that can still 
lift the hairs on the back of your neck.
