My parents are going away for a weekend, leaving me in charge. Having had 
limited experience of cooking meals, could you suggest some easy vegetarian 
meals that aren't pasta?

Here are a couple of tasty suggestions that anyone can be confident in 
attempting. And not a pasta packet in sight ...

First up: fried cauliflower cheese fritters. Take half a medium cauliflower 
and cook in boiling salted water until soft. Drain, then chop. Thinly slice a 
small onion and fry in a hot pan with a little oil for about a minute, stirring 
continuously. In a bowl, mix the onions with the cauliflower, add some thyme, 
chopped coriander, a tiny pinch of dried chilli flakes and about 50g finely 
cubed cheese: emmental or gruyere work well.

To this, add 100g gram (chickpea) flour with half a teaspoon of baking powder 
and mix well. Gradually add cold water until you have a thick, evenly mixed 
batter. Season with a little celery salt and pepper. Shallow fry dollops of the 
mix, turning once, until crisp and nicely brown. Serve with your favourite 
relish.

Or how about a fancy jacket potato? Score the potato and microwave on full 
power for 8 minutes. Transfer to the oven (30‑40 minutes at 190C/375F/gas 
mark 5) to finish cooking. When you can handle the spud, cut it in half and 
scoop into a bowl. Add some soft goat's cheese, chopped cooked asparagus and 
some caramelised onion (you might find a jar of this in your fridge). Mix and 
pile back into the skins. Bake until browned and the skins and crust have 
become slightly crisp. Have fun!
