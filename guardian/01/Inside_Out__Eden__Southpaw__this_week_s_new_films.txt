According to Pixar’s bold new animation, the inner landscape is a cross 
between a theme park and a disaster movie – sounds about right. It takes place 
inside the head of an 11-year-old girl, whose uprooting to a new city triggers 
a crisis among her controlling emotions – personified as Joy, Sadness, Anger, 
Disgust and Fear. Thus, a sort of Wizard Of Oz quest is required to restore her 
mental balance. Consciousness experts might take issue with the conceit, but in 
terms of making a complex subject accessible and taking animation to new 
frontiers, it’s a triumph.

Roughly spanning the French house era (from Da Funk to Random Access Memories 
inDaft Punk <https://www.theguardian.com/music/daft-punk> years), this 
emotionally literate odyssey covers a lot of ground, tracking a Parisian DJ 
beyond his halcyon days and into a long, 21st-century coming-down/growing-up 
period.

After Nightcrawler, another over-committed turn from Gyllenhaal. His ripped, 
scarred torso is the biggest surprise in what boils down to a pretty 
conventional boxing drama, centring on a champ facing battles in and out of the 
ring.

Carlyle’s sidelined barber accidentally finds a sideline in serial killing in 
this gruesome black comedy, set across a Glasgow strewn with death and body 
parts. Thompson all but steals the show as his raddled but protective mother.

Zombie apocalypse in a muted indie key – into which Schwarzenegger fits 
awkwardly, playing a farmer protecting his infected teenage daughter. It calls 
on acting muscles he’s rarely had to flex.

Documentary recalling Gore Vidal <https://www.theguardian.com/books/gore-vidal>
 and William F Buckley’s increasingly fractious national TV debates of 1968 – a 
clash of political opposites and finely honed wits, and possibly a harbinger of 
sensationalist news TV to come.

First world problems abound when an elderly Brooklyn couple embark on the 
process of selling up and moving after 40 years. The seasoned performers are 
value for money, unlike their apartment.

Gillen gets a reprieve from prison to care for his orphaned niece, setting up 
a delicate, unsentimental drama of broken families, odd couples and emotional 
complications.
