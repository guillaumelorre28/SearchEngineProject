Audley Harrison <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/audley-harrison> is set to 
make a comeback in April by fighting Ali Adams for the International Masters 
heavyweight title.

Harrison, 40, has not entered the ring since his feeble showing against the 
then WBA heavyweight champion David Haye in November 2010 but is now set to 
face Ali Adams in a fight nominally for the International Masters heavyweight 
title at the Brentwood Centre in Essex on 14 April.

Harrison said: "I've never been more disappointed in myself as I felt that 
night [against Haye] â€¦ anyone can lose, but I didn't lose with dignity, so I 
was never going to retire on that performance.

"I've been sitting on the shelf for 15 months, so I'm grateful for this 
opportunity. With my right arm now healed, I'll have too much for Ali Adams. I 
intend to show I still have a future in the game."

The Baghdad-born Adams, 30, won the Masters title by beating Vjekoslav Bajic 
at York Hall in Bethnal Green in December, and has a record of 13 wins from his 
17 fights, with five victories coming by knockout.

Adams said: "Audley is a joke. His fight with Haye was an embarrassment and he 
still wants to make a comeback. I will give him such a beating that Audley will 
see he does not belong in a boxing ring again."
