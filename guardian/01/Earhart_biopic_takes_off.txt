A biopic of aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amelia-earhart> is taking off this month, 
with Hilary Swank in the cockpit.

The Million Dollar Baby star will play the first woman to fly solo and 
non-stop across the Atlantic, in a film by Monsoon Wedding director Mira Nair. 
Production on the movie, entitled Amelia, begins later this month in Canada and 
South Africa.

Amelia will focus on the pilot's formative years, focusing on her 
rollercoaster relationship with George Putnam, to be played by Richard Gere, 
the promoter who helped publicise her solo flight across the Atlantic.

Sideways' Virginia Madsen has also joined the cast, as Putnam's first wife, 
Dorothy Binney. The movie was penned by veteran Hollywood screenwriter Ron Bass 
(Rain Man, Entrapment).

Earhart was one of the few female pilots who worked in the first part of the 
20th century. She set several flight records during her career, including being 
the first person to fly solo between Hawaii and California, and flying non-stop 
between Mexico City and New York, both in 1935. She died in 1937 during her 
attempt to fly around the world, believed to have crashed off Howland island, a 
tiny atoll in the Pacific.

Amelia is not the first attempt to bring the life of Amelia Earhart to the 
screen. In 2000, Julianne Moore was expected to portray the aviator in I Was 
Amelia Earhart, with Mel Gibson playing her navigator Fred Noonan, but the 
project never got off the ground. And in 1994, Diane Keaton played her in the 
TV movie Amelia Earhart: the Final Flight.
