Appearance: Friday and Saturday, BBC1.

Really? Doing what? She has joined the judging panel for the new series of 
Strictly Come Dancing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/strictly-come-dancing>

What qualifications does she have for the job? She won SCD in 2005. Also, she 
was a member of a dance academy before she became a member of Brit and Mobo 
award-winning girl group Mis-teeq.

I'll bet they didn't win any spelling awards. Alesha must have some strong 
views about dancing, though. Er, not really.

What do you mean? Her comments on the initial shows have been criticised for 
being banal, vacuous and inarticulate.

What sort of things does she say? "I thought it was really lovely"; "That was 
brilliant"; "Amazing"; "You certainly look the part"; "I have one word: fierce."

Huh. What sort of things do the other judges say? "You're still a bit tight"; 
You're a little bit mean with your lines"; "Like a doughnut with no jam"; "You 
look like you've got both legs down one hole of your knickers"; "That's a dance 
only a mother could love."

So it's a real battle of wits out there. Are you sure she's not being banal 
and inarticulate on purpose, in order to fit in? Much of the criticism stems 
from the fact that Alesha has replaced Arlene Phillips, a 66-year-old 
choreographer with a sharp tongue.

I see. Alesha is too young and too nice. Well, she did tell Rav Wilding that 
he was "a little bit stompy".

Is that a technical term? Possibly. It's not all bad news, anyway — many of 
the comments on the SCD message board were supportive, and the BBC said, "We 
are pleased with how well Alesha was received."

Don't say: "If you can't say anything nasty, Alesha, you shouldn't say 
anything at all."

Do say: "I know you must be nervous up there, but I thought you were 
brilliant!" (© A Dixon) or: "Who cares? I watch the X Factor."
