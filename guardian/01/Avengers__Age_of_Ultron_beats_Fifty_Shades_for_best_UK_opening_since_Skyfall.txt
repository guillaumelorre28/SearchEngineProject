The latest Marvel superhero blockbuster, Avengers: Age of Ultron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/avengers-the-age-of-ultron>, left a trail of 
devastation in its wake at the UK box office this weekend, with records smashed 
and previous chart-topper Fast & Furious left eating dust.

The film took £18m from 585 sites, which makes it the biggest opening of 2015, 
the eight biggest of all time, the biggest April opening ever, the biggest ever 
day for a superhero movie and Disney’s own best-ever day.

It beat the previous Avengers movie’s opening of £15.87m – as well as that of 
Fifty Shades of Grey (£13.55m), recorded in February. The film’s debut in the 
UK is therefore the highest since Skyfall (£20.18m) at the end of 2012. 
Spectre, Sam Mendes’s James Bond followup, as well as the new Star Wars movie, 
will be among those titles hoping to top the £20m mark later in the year.

Fast & Furious is still making good progress in the UK, however – it’s 
currently taken nearly £35m; meanwhile, the animation Home’s cumulative total 
now stands at £21m.
