Although married at the time, Alina felt frustrated and scared when she found 
out that she was pregnant two years ago. She was in college, about to sit her 
final exams, and wanted to delay having children until finishing her studies.

Through Zayada, a local youth charity in Zanzibar, she had found out about 
family planning methods, but had experienced prejudice from service providers 
because she was young. When she asked for the contraceptive pill at a pharmacy, 
she faced questions about whether she was married and how many children she 
had. "They refused to sell me the pill when I told them I had no children," she 
says. Like other adolescents, she avoided government health facilities because 
the nurses were known to gossip about girls who requested family planning 
services.

This led to her relying on the calendar method. When she found out that she 
was pregnant, she carried out an abortion at home by boilingmhaina, the root of 
a local plant. The effects were instant. Yet even when she had severe abdominal 
pain and heavy bleeding, she was too ashamed to tell her husband.

She has finished school now and has two children. Her second pregnancy came 
just one month after her abortion. The support of husbands and partners is 
needed if women are to plan their families, she says.
