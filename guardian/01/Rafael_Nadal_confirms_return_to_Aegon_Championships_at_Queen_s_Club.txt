The 14-times grand slam champion won the title in 2008 and was back at Queen’s 
in 2015 after aN absence of four years.

It was not a happy return, however, with the popular Spaniard losing his 
opening match to Alexandr Dolgopolov

.

Nadal said: “I love playing at the Queen’s Club and I am very happy that I 
will be back this year. I will never forget winning the title in 2008; it was a 
special moment, and going on to win my first Wimbledon.

“Holding that trophy again would be amazing, although I am well aware of the 
difficulties because the tournament always has so many good players.”

The Aegon Championships begin on 13 June, with Murray looking to become the 
first player to win a fifth title.
