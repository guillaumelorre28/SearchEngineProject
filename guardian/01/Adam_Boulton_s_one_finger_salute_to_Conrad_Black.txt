We've all probably wanted to give Conrad Black the bird â€“ but how many people 
would have had the cojones to do it live on air? WellAdam Boulton, that's who. 
Because that is precisely what Sky News's rottweiler appears to be doing to the 
former Telegraph owner in yesterday's interview on Boulton & Co.Watch closely 
about 35 seconds in 
<http://news.sky.com/story/1001568/conrad-black-ill-keep-my-seat-in-the-lords> 
as Boulton lists Black's convictions in the US. "One for mail fraud" [holds up 
middle finger]. "One for obstruction of justice" [holds up second finger]. Was 
that in the script? If not, one imagines Boulton was already quite annoyed with 
the convicted fraudster because this was just at the start of the interview and 
comes even before Black asked Boutlon what his name was, called him a "jackass" 
and said he was asking "predictable" questions.
