And that seems like a good place to close down the live blog. What a fantastic 
day. It has been full of unalloyed joy at the ingenuity of human beings and our 
ability to develop technology to help us perceive the Universe.

We now know that 1.3 billion years ago, two gigantic black holes collided. For 
a brief moment, they gave out more energy that all the stars in the whole 
universe put together, and that set the very fabric of spacetime rippling. 
Those ripples have traveled through space ever since.

They arrived at Earth on 14 September 2015 and disturbed the detectors in the 
LIGO observatory by no more than one thousandth the width of a proton, the 
particle that makes up the heart of a hydrogen atom.

The fact that this minuscule movement was detected means that a whole new era 
has opened up. One in which we will be able to look into the hearts of stars, 
watch the most cataclysmic events in the universe unfold, and eventually see 
the moment of the big bang itself.

And all of this follows from a prediction of Albert Einstein’s 100 years ago, 
from a set of equations he developed originally to help him sort out a small 
discrepancy in the orbit of planet Mercury.

Of course, today belongs to the thousand plus researchers who work on LIGO and 
the other gravitational wave detectors around the globe, but it also belongs to 
Einstein, true genius.

Today is not the end of a search, but a beginning. It is the beginning of 
gravitational wave astronomy, prepare for the wonders to come.

thousands of detections a year with the fully sensitive LIGO and Virgo 
observatories. Truly a new era is opening up.

Arvanitaki now explains that there are experiments to try to detect 
gravitational waves by measuring the ultra-precise time pulses that comes from 
the spinning hearts of dead stars called pulsars.

Boyle now talking about the proposed eLISA space-based gravitational wave 
observatory. He explains that a space-based observatory would see different 
frequencies of gravitational waves than ground-based ones. In other words, we 
need space- and ground-based observatories.

Surely, the detection today gives the expensive space-based observatories a 
huge boost.

Turok says that now we know gravitational waves exist, future gravitational 
wave observatories will be able to see the signals coming from the big bang 
itself. He suspects that the technology may be 20-30 years away but one day, he 
says, we will be able to see the moment of the universe’s formation.

Bring it on!

Turok makes a philosophical point that there is something very mysterious

we are sitting here today discussing a cataclysmic event that took place 1.3 
billion years ago.

He says that it is an amazing prospect to wonder what use we may one-day be 
able to put gravitational waves – and not just for observing the Universe. He 
draws the analogy to radio waves. They were a curiousity when discovered, now 
we use them to transmit information.

Interesting to ponder and speculate...

Lehner explains that LIGO is just the start. Soon it will be joined by Virgo 
and Italy, and in a few years there are two more gravitational wave 
observatories that are due to come on line. The more detectors we have, the 
better we will be able to pinpoint the location of the gravitational wave 
sources.

And that seems like a good place to close down the live blog. What a fantastic 
day. It has been full of unalloyed joy at the ingenuity of human beings and our 
ability to develop technology to help us perceive the Universe.

We now know that 1.3 billion years ago, two gigantic black holes collided. For 
a brief moment, they gave out more energy that all the stars in the whole 
universe put together, and that set the very fabric of spacetime rippling. 
Those ripples have traveled through space ever since.

They arrived at Earth on 14 September 2015 and disturbed the detectors in the 
LIGO observatory by no more than one thousandth the width of a proton, the 
particle that makes up the heart of a hydrogen atom.

The fact that this minuscule movement was detected means that a whole new era 
has opened up. One in which we will be able to look into the hearts of stars, 
watch the most cataclysmic events in the universe unfold, and eventually see 
the moment of the big bang itself.

And all of this follows from a prediction of Albert Einstein’s 100 years ago, 
from a set of equations he developed originally to help him sort out a small 
discrepancy in the orbit of planet Mercury.

Of course, today belongs to the thousand plus researchers who work on LIGO and 
the other gravitational wave detectors around the globe, but it also belongs to 
Einstein, true genius.

Still got questions about today’s monumental discovery? Leave them in the 
comments here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-explained-live-questions-answers-with-physicist-jon-butterworth>
 and Prof Jon Butterworth will answer them tomorrow between 14:00-15:00 GMT.
 
Arvanitaki also says that today’s detection shows that there could be 
thousands of detections a year with the fully sensitive LIGO and Virgo 
observatories. Truly a new era is opening up.
 
Arvanitaki now explains that there are experiments to try to detect 
gravitational waves by measuring the ultra-precise time pulses that comes from 
the spinning hearts of dead stars called pulsars.
 
Boyle now talking about the proposed eLISA space-based gravitational wave 
observatory. He explains that a space-based observatory would see different 
frequencies of gravitational waves than ground-based ones. In other words, we 
need space- and ground-based observatories.

Surely, the detection today gives the expensive space-based observatories a 
huge boost.
 
Turok says that now we know gravitational waves exist, future gravitational 
wave observatories will be able to see the signals coming from the big bang 
itself. He suspects that the technology may be 20-30 years away but one day, he 
says, we will be able to see the moment of the universe’s formation.

Bring it on!
 
Lehner says that astronomy to date has been like watching people come out from 
a movie and trying to guess the story by the look of their faces. Now, he says, 
gravitational waves allow us to look inside the theatre and read the plot.
 
Boyle is reminding us that after the advent of radio astronomy we say a lot of 
new types of objects in the Universe. Could we see ‘wilder’ stuff now that 
gravitational wave astronomy has begun?
 
Asimina Arvanitaki, Perimeter Institute, is now talking that perhaps 
gravitational waves will allow us to make progress in our search for dark 
matter. Dark matter is the so-far hypothetical particles that are thought to 
hold galaxies together in the Universe.
 
Lehner suggests that the discover today is so revolutionary that perhaps we 
should start a new calendar AGW – After Gravitational Waves. Welcome to year 
zero AGW!

billion years ago.

He says that it is an amazing prospect to wonder what use we may one-day be 
able to put gravitational waves – and not just for observing the Universe. He 
draws the analogy to radio waves. They were a curiousity when discovered, now 
we use them to transmit information.

Interesting to ponder and speculate...
 
Lehner explains that LIGO is just the start. Soon it will be joined by Virgo 
and Italy, and in a few years there are two more gravitational wave 
observatories that are due to come on line. The more detectors we have, the 
better we will be able to pinpoint the location of the gravitational wave 
sources.
