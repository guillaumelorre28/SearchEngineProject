Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy> advice column in the 
Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. 
We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here 
is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?

I’ve been a freelance filmmaker working in TV and education, in both the 
public and voluntary sectors.

 Technical change is non-stop and, as I near 60, I feel my age is beginning to 
count against me. But I have writing and editorial, as well as technical, 
skills, and have always enjoyed “explain-y” projects as much as the simply 
creative ones.

 Back in the 19’90s, I helped one of my sound assistants with his literacy (it 
had been constrained by his chaotic childhood in care). From zero school 
qualifications, he went on to get a history degree.

 It was hard to find materials to work with, but it was such a straightforward 
and purposeful thing to do and so rewarding that I’m wondering how to do it 
again. There must be a way to train and then teach literacy to adults – but the 
obvious searches haven’t got me very far.

 I’m not expecting to earn much, I never have; but the mortgage is paid, and 
we’ve got no children.
