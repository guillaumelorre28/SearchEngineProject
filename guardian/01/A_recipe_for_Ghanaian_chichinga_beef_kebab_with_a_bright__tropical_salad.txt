Street food is an everyday thing in Ghana. Morning, noon and night, grills on 
street corners boast the heady scent of things charring. In the neighbourhoods 
of Accra, pedestrians pound into work every day amid a swirling commotion, 
often stopping for breakfast at a street food cart. I’ve never been so excited 
to watch a commute as I was there; the rattling city waking up for work has a 
kind of cinematic cacophany of traffic, bustle and grill smoke.

On Palace Street, there is, according to my uncle Ernest, the best waakye in 
Accra. At 6am every morning, before his “home breakfast”, he joins a queue 
across the road (funny how convenience improves on flavour) and waits to fill a 
polythene bag withwaakye stew of mixed meats in spiced tomatoes, with rice and 
beans, noodles, a boiled egg andshito (Ghana’s traditional hot pepper sauce 
made with smoked ground prawns). On the opposite corner, says Ernest, you can 
find the city’s bestkelewele (diced and fried plantain in fresh ginger and 
grated onion), which he may run to for an afternoon snack.

The lyrically named chichinga is a very popular street food, essentially 
Ghana’s answer to shish kebab: meat that has been rubbed in spice mix, then 
skewered and grilled. The spice mix we use is calledsuya, a blend of peanuts, 
ground spices and hot pepper. Suya is also the word that refers to this style 
of cooking with hot grills.

My favourite memory of chichinga is of sitting roadside in McCarthy Hill, a 
neighbourhood in Accra, and listening to uncle Ernest and my dad’s old school 
friend Albert as they regaled me with stories of my industrious and intelligent 
young father. Having won a Commonwealth writing scholarship in the mid-1970s, 
he’d come to London at just 16 and fallen in love with this city of promise and 
prosperity. He returned to Ghana to tell his mother that London was where he 
would make his life.

That lazy afternoon we drank warm Club beers (and graduated on to fiery 
akpeteshie, a local home brew made from palm sap) and ate a plate of goat 
chichinga with roasted peanuts – all for just twocedi (about 35p). The sun was 
searing and the flies buzzed around us.

You can choose whatever meat you fancy for this recipe – there are no 
hard-and-fast rules. While goat is most common (and I find that darker, 
sometimes gamey, meats hold up to the deeply pungent spices best), it works 
very well with chicken too. The recipe below uses diced beef chuck, which I’ve 
served with mango and pineapple salad to offset the heat and intense 
savouriness of the spices.

Cook this on the barbecue during the summer, and in a griddle pan or under the 
grill the rest of the year. Whichever method you choose, the easy cooking style 
and earthy flavours epitomise much about Ghanaian cooking. Be warned – it packs 
a punch, so adjust heat levels according to your taste. When I made this for 
uncle Ernest, he proclaimed it too hot for him. I think I have my dad’s palate 
for heat, and we like our food hot ...

Suya spice mix 

This will determine the heat of your dish. If you like spicy food, go with the 
below. For something milder, reduce or omit the ground hot pepper.


Makes around 200g
150–200g peanuts, ground and roasted
2 tsp ground hot or cayenne pepper
½ tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1 tsp garlic powder

½ tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp salt

 Optional extra seasonings
2 tbsp groundnut or sunflower oil 
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated
5cm piece of fresh ginger, finely grated 
A sprig of thyme, leaves picked
1 tbsp lime juice

airtight container in a cool, dark place. Store for up to one month. If you’ve 
added fresh ingredients, store in the fridge and use it within a week.

Chichinga (suya beef kebabs)

The leaner your meat, the better, so trim any sinew away. I recommend 
tenderising the diced beef by gently bashing it with a rolling pin. Many 
vegetables work, like aubergines and courgettes; AnyThe cubes will flatten out 
and will cook faster on the grill. I like to use mixed bell peppers here, 
because they are cheap, easy, and the red, yellow and green colours echo the 
Ghanaian flag! Courgettes and aubergine work really well too.


Serves 4-6
3-4 tbsp suya spice mix
3 tbsp rapeseed or groundnut oil, plus extra for brushing
1kg lean beef rump, trimmed and cubed
2-3 bell peppers, cored, deseeded and cut into chunks 
1 red onion, cut into quarters and separated
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper

 For a side salad (optional)
Fresh seasonal salad leaves
2-3 tbsp roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped 
A small pinch of ground chilli powder
A few coriander leaves

1 Mix the dry spice mix with the rapeseed oil in a bowl. Add the diced beef to 
the bowl and massage the mixure thoroughly into the meat. Thread the chunks of 
pepper, onion and beef on to your skewers – I use 10–13cm bamboo skewers.

2 As ever, the longer you can leave the ingredients to marinate the better, so 
if you have time, lay the skewers in a dish, cover with clingfilm and leave in 
the fridge for at least 1-2 hours, but preferably overnight if you’re organised 
and have planned ahead.

3 Take the skewers out of the fridge and leave them to sit at room temperature 
for a few minutes while you prepare a charcoal barbecue. Alternatively, preheat 
a gas barbecue, griddle pan or grill to a medium-high heat. Brush the meat with 
groundnut oil and season with the salt and pepper before adding to the barbecue 
or griddle pan or putting under the grill.

4 The kebabs should sizzle as they hit the grill or griddle, but don’t move 
them too quickly. Turn them over after 2-3 minutes for medium rare, or give 
them 3-4 minutes each side for well done (depending on the size of the beef 
chunks used).

5 Remove from the heat and leave to rest for 2-3 minutes. If you like, serve 
with theside salad above.

Mango and pineapple salad

Ghanaians aren’t big on salads, but we do have plenty of wonderful fresh 
ingredients, so there’s every opportunity to get inventive within the Ghanaian 
tradition.

Serves 4
Juice of 1 lemon
50ml orange juice
25ml apple juice
2 ripe mangoes, cubed
Half a fresh pineapple, cubed
Half a cucumber 
200-250g rocket leaves, washed and drained
50g cashews, crushed or whole
Salt

1 Mix the juices together and add to a bowl with the pineapple and mango.

2 Halve the cucumber lengthways, de-seed using a teaspoon and slice into 
whatever shapes you prefer – I like simple half-moons.

3 Remove the fruit chunks from the bowl (reserve the excess juices to drizzle 
later) and gently add to another bowl with the rocket and cucumber.

4 To finish, drizzle a little juice over the salad, add a pinch of sea salt, 
and garnish with crushed cashews.
