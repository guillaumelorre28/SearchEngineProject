Translation:

My opinion with all modesty is that we should tighten the security grip and to 
start an operation to restore state power and authority in Idlib and Hama 
countryside using all possible means. Those who have come to conclusions based 
on the Arab League meetings only wanted to give impetus to the street in these 
areas and this is the utmost limit of their capabilities.

And if the saboteurs do not sense the state power, the Arab plan will lead to 
a very bad result.

I have met [XXXXXXXXXXXX] before the departure to Homs and it was positive and 
we agreed on a work plan to deal with the Allawi street. I will be back to 
Damascus within 48 hrs to visit [XXXXXXXXXXXX] to brief him on the net shield.

With all love and respect
