Plans to build a giant hydroelectric dam in the heart of the Amazon rainforest 
have been halted by Brazil’s environmental protection agency because of 
mounting concernsabout the fate of indigenous communities 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/22/brazil-amazon-dam-project-suspended-indigenous-munduruku-sao-luiz-do-tapajos>
 and wildlife living in the area.


The 8,000-megawatt São Luiz do Tapajós (SLT) dam would have been the 
sixth-largest hydroelectric dam in the world, spanning the five-mile wide 
Tapajós river and drowning 376 sq km (145 sq miles) of rainforest that is home 
to some 12,000 Munduruku Indians.

But in an unexpected announcement, the Ibama protection agency on Thursday 
cancelled development permits saying that an environmental impact study (EIA) 
submitted by a consortium of Brazilian, European and other companies seeking to 
build the dam had failed to present enough evidence to judge its social and 
ecological impacts.

Human rights groups and environmentalists had earlier said the social and 
ecological risks had been grossly neglected, including impacts on biodiversity, 
aquatic ecosystems, greenhouse gas emissions, and implications for downstream 
communities.

Leaders of the Munduruku people, who stood to lose much of their ancestral 
land and would have been forced to move, welcomed the announcement. “We 
Munduruku people are very happy with the news. This is very important for us. 
Now we willcontinue to fight against 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/dec/22/amazon-munduruku-indians-brazil-tapajos>
 other dams in our river,” said Arnaldo Kabá Munduruku, general chief Munduruku.

International environment and human rights groups said the announcement, just 
hours before the start of the Olympic games, was a turning point for the 
protection of the world’s largest rainforest.

Greenpeace forest campaigner Sara Ayech said: “The Tapajós dam would have 
flooded into oblivion a whole swath ofAmazon rainforest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/amazon-rainforest>, home to indigenous 
civilisations and a stunning variety of wildlife.”

Christian Poirier of Amazon Watch said: “We have been awaiting such a welcome 
announcement from the Brazilian government for more than a decade, while 
witnessing the tragic and unnecessary damming of the Madeira andXingu rivers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/16/belo-monte-brazil-tribes-living-in-shadow-megadam>
 during this time.”


Brent Millikan, Amazon program director at International Rivers, said: 
“Today’s decision is a major victory for the Munduruku, their allies and the 
rule of law inBrazil <https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil>, sending a shot 
across the bow of the dam industry juggernaut in the Amazon.”

A licence for the Tapajós dam can be requested again, but that is considered 
unlikely due to the cost of redoing impact studies from scratch and the current 
recession Brazil is in.

Environment minister José Sarney Filho told Valor newspaper in an interview 
published on Thursday that the Tapajós dam was “entirely dispensable” and could 
be compensated by energy from smaller power generators and other sources such 
as wind.

Deputy energy minister Paulo Pedrosa told Reuters, however, that the Tapajós 
dam was a “competitive” project and a final decision on pursuing the project 
was up to interim president Michel Temer.

The SLT dam is the largest of five proposed hydropower projects on the 
Tapajós. Dozens of smaller dams are also planned on tributaries across across 
the Tapajós basin.

Under Brazil’s constitution, indigenous people cannot be forced off their 
lands except in case of war or epidemics. In June, the Munduruku started 
demarcating their territory in the Tapajós in the hope of saving it.


Campaigners are now urging Temer to formally recognise the Munduruku’s rights.
