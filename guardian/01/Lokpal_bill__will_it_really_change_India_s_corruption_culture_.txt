India <https://www.theguardian.com/world/india>'s parliament has approved an 
anti-corruption bill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/18/india-parliament-anit-corruption-bill>
under which an independent watchdog will have the power to investigate and 
prosecute cases of corruption by politicians, civil servants and bureaucrats.

The bill was passed by the lower house of parliament on Wednesday after the 
government agreed to several amendments suggested by opposition politicians. 
The bill cleared the upper house on Tuesday. Regional Samajwadi party, an ally 
of the Congress, walked out in protest and did not participate in.

It has been a main demand of campaigners led by Anna Hazare 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/aug/21/profile-anna-hazare>, who 
is now expected to end his latest hunger strike after nine days.

Do you think it will successfully eradicate government corruption which has 
plagued the Congress-led government this past year?
