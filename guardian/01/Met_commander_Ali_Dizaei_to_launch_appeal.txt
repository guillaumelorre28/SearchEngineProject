The disgraced Scotland Yard commander Ali Dizaei 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ali-dizaei> will appeal against his conviction 
for corruption and four-year jail sentence, his legal team said today.

Last week he began a four-year prison sentence after a jury found he had tried 
to frame a man and told a series of lies in an attempt to cover up his abuse of 
office.

Dizaei, a commander with Scotland Yard, was convicted of falsely arresting a 
web designer in a dispute over money and then lying in official statements when 
he claimed he had been assaulted and threatened by the man.

A statement issued by his Manchester-based solicitors Ralli said Dizaei would 
take further legal action.

"Ralli can today confirm that Ali Dizaei is to launch appeals against both 
conviction and sentence," it said.

At the time of his sentencing Nick Hardwick, the chair of the Independent 
Police <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> Complaints Commission, said: 
"Dizaei behaved like a bully â€¦ the greatest threat to the reputation of the 
police service is criminals in uniform like Dizaei."

Dizaei, 47, remained defiant and told the Guardian last week that the case was 
"completely outrageous and a fit-up" and that he had been pursued by the 
authorities, which had a "vendetta" against him.
