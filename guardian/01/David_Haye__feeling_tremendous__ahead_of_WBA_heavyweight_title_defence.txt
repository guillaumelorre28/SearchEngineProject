David Haye and Audley Harrison 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/audley-harrison> engaged in one last verbal 
sparring session before Saturday's WBA heavyweight title fight. An intense 
build-up to the all-British encounter culminates in Haye's mandatory defence at 
Manchester's MEN Arena when the former friends turned bitter enemies finally 
square off.

"I feel tremendous," Haye said at today's final press conference. "We're about 
to go to war and it gives me a nice warm feeling. This is what I was born to do 
and I'm going to force him to fight.

"I hope he's ready to go every second of every round and I'm looking forward 
to giving a great night of boxing."

Harrison, the 2000 Olympic gold medallist, finally gets his shot at a 
professional world title after a decade of disappointment.

"It's my big night and I'm really looking forward to Saturday night," he said. 
"The Audley Harrison that won the Olympics and beat Danny Williams in our 
second fight will destroyDavid Haye 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/davidhayeboxing>. It's going to be a tough 
fight but ultimately I will prevail, it is my destiny.

"I've fallen in the past but never given up and Saturday night will be my 
crowning glory when Audley Harrison becomes heavyweight champion of the world."
