When Quentin Tarantino <http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/quentintarantino> 
accepted his Oscar for best screenplay this year, he said 2013 would be the 
"writer's year". While directors and actors tend to get the lion's share of 
glory, film-makers would be lost without a good script written by a talented 
screenwriter.
