There is no debate around the relevance of education to development. "The 
interconnected dividends that result from investments in equitable quality 
education are immeasurable,"said a recent UN brief 
<http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/18290406tstisuesedcult.pdf>
, "generating greater economic returns and growth for individuals and 
societies, creating a lasting impact on public health, decent work and gender 
equality, and leading to safer and more resilient and stable societies."

At first glance, progress towards millenium development goal two - achieving 
universal primary education - is on track.Enrollment in primary schools in 
developing countries reached 90% in 2010 
<http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/education.shtml>, but with further scrutiny 
we see that being enrolled in school doesn't necessarily mean that children are 
learning.Unesco's annual in-depth Education for All global monitoring report 
<http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/efareport/reports/2013>
, released last month, showed that despite efforts from numerous international 
organisations,one in four young people in developing countries are unable to 
read a sentence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jan/29/illiteracy-education-young-people-developing-countries>
.

Is this failure to educate due to lack of effort or lack of skill? The main 
critique, from the UK's Department for International Development and others is 
that efforts have been concentrated on access to education while quality of 
learning has been neglected. By way of explanation, the UN adds: "The emphasis 
on global targets imposed one-size-fits-all targets for countries, irrespective 
of countries' diverse starting points, financial resources and capacity".

So how do policymakers and development actors facilitate real learning? How do 
we move the focus beyond primary education and factor in employability? And 
finally, what role should technology or indigenous techniques play in improving 
global literacy - both in children and adults? Join us to debate these 
questions and many more on Thursday 20 February, at 1pm GMT.
