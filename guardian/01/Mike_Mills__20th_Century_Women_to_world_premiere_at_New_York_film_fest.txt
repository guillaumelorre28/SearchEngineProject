Annette Bening <https://www.theguardian.com/film/annette-bening> heads the 
1970s-set film as a single mother raising her teenage son (newcomer Lucas Jade 
Zumann) in a sprawling bohemian house in Santa Barbara, shared by a carpenter 
(Billy Crudup) and a punk artist (Greta Gerwig). Elle Fanning rounds out the 
cast as her son’s rebellious friend. The festival pegs 20th Century Women as a 
“texturally and behaviorally rich new comedy”.

The festival’s director, Kent Jones, said he was “taken aback by 20th Century 
Women”, in a statement. “It’s made with an extraordinarily unusual level of 
craft and attention to detail, human and visual, which is now all but extinct,” 
he said.

Beginners, Mills’ last film, netted a supporting actor Oscar for Christopher 
Plummer in 2010.

20th Century Women will be released by A24 in December in the US.

The festival runs from 30 September to 16 October.
