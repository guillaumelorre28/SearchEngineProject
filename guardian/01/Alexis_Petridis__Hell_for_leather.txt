Fashion designers may be many things, but you could never accuse them of being 
predictable. In a list of looks you could devise for a gentleman to wear at the 
height of summer, you'd think a full leather outfit would lurk somewhere near 
the bottom. Before you even get to the matter of aesthetics, there's the matter 
of practicality: it's traditionally hot in summer, which you might expect would 
preclude the all-over leather thing. Apparently not: designers not merely 
proposed we wear full leather this summer but, according to one menswear 
blogger, a "tough, dark, tight" leather outfit.

It's worth noting that these designers weren't from the lunatic fringe, but 
its mainstream: Calvin Klein, Burberry, Armani. The latter sent a model down 
the catwalk in leather trousers and a leather shirt, with the shirt open and 
nothing underneath it: the overheating problem was thus solved, but at the cost 
of making the wearer look like he'd been drawn byTom Of Finland 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_of_Finland>.

Of course, the gay subculture isn't the only connotation a full leather outfit 
holds. "You're going to look likeSid Snot 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/kennyeverett/gallery/15.shtml>," guffawed a 
friend when she found out I was modelling one. Frankly, chance would have been 
a fine thing: the outfit in question, also by Armani, featured a top that most 
closely resembled a beautician's tabard. I just looked baffling, and baffled, 
as indeed I had been from the moment I read about the all-over leather look. 
"This is just for the big guys," advised the menswear blogger. I hesitate to 
say the big guys are welcome to it, but it certainly wasn't for me.
