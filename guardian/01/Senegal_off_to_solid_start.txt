Wigan's Henri Camara was the star man as Senegal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> overcame Zimbabwe in their 
opening game of the competition this evening.

After a disappointing first half in which Senegal missed two open goals, 
Camara made the breakthrough with a well-taken goal on the hour.

Portsmouth's Zimbabwean striker Benjani Mwaruwari then squandered a golden 
chance to equalise for the underdogs, before Camara played through substitute 
Issa Ba to secure all three points with his first touch of the ball.

The win was a timely boost for the Lions of Teranga, who are one of the 
favourites for the tournament despite failing to qualify for the World Cup.
