Nonhuman primates have long played a key role in life-changing medical 
advances. A recent white paper by nine scientific societies in the US produced 
a list of 50 medical advances from the last 50 years made possible through 
studies on nonhuman primates. These included: treatments for leprosy, HIV and 
Parkinson’s; the MMR and hepatitis B vaccines; and earlier diagnosis and better 
treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome and breast cancer.

The biological similarities between humans and other primates mean that they 
are sometimes the only effective model for complex neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Parkinson’s. More than 10 million people suffer from Parkinson’s 
worldwide, and a recent study estimated that one in three people born in 2015 
will develop dementia in their lifetime. Primate research offers treatments, 
and hope for future treatments, to patients and their families. Already over 
200,000 Parkinson’s patients have had their life dramatically improved thanks 
to deep brain stimulation surgery, which reduces the tremors of sufferers. This 
treatment was developed from research carried out in a few hundred monkeys in 
the 1980s and 1990s.

Given that primates are intelligent and sensitive animals, such research 
requires a higher level of ethical justification. The scientific community 
continues to work together to minimise the suffering of primates wherever 
possible. We welcome the worldwide effort to replace, refine and reduce the use 
of primates in research.

We, the undersigned, believe that if we are to effectively combat the scourge 
of neurodegenerative and other crippling diseases, we will require the careful 
and considered use of nonhuman primates. Stringent regulations across the 
developed world exist to ensure that primates are only used where there is no 
other available model – be that the use of a mouse or a non-animal alternative 
– and to protect the wellbeing of those animals still required. The use of 
primates is not undertaken lightly. However, while not all primate research 
results in a new treatment, it nonetheless plays a role in developing both the 
basic and applied knowledge that is crucial for medical advances.
