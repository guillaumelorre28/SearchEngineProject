More than 500 writers, journalists and artists from around the world have 
signed a letter to Mexico’s president,Enrique Peña Nieto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/enrique-pena-nieto>, calling on him to stop 
the violence against journalists in his country.

The signatories from more than 40 countries include Salman Rushdie, Margaret 
Atwood, Gael García Bernal, Noam Chomsky, John Coetzee,Guillermo del Toro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/guillermodeltoro>, Paul Auster, Alan 
Rusbridger, Gavin MacFadyen, Arianna Huffington, Christiane Amanpour and Jo 
Glanville, the director of English PEN.

The letter, posted on the website of the US chapter of PEN International 
<http://www.pen.org/blog/president-pe%C3%B1a-nieto-investigate-murders-journalists-mexico-and-establish-mechanisms-protect>
 and backed by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), expresses 
indignation about the deadly attacks on Mexican reporters.
The letter refers to the murder of photojournalist Ruben Espinosa in Mexico 
City on 31 July, calling his killing “only the latest in a long series of 
outrages against the press.” It continued:

“Since 2000, dozens of journalists have been killed in Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico>, and approximately 20 more remain 
disappeared. The great majority of these crimes have never been prosecuted.

According to the Mexican Human Rights Commission, there is evidence that 
points to the involvement of government officials in many of the attacks 
against journalists and media outlets.

The widespread and extreme physical threats faced by reporters in Mexico have 
drawn the attention of many concerned with international freedom of expression 
and press freedom, including PEN and CPJ, who have campaigned to end censorship 
by the bullet.”

Referring to Espinosa’s murder, the letter said that he fled to Mexico City 
after receiving what he considered severe threats to his life in the state of 
Veracruz. It stated:

“Reporters in Veracruz who receive threats are often convinced that they come 
directly from the local government.

Since the current governor of Veracruz [Javier Duarte] took power in 2010, 
journalists have been harassed, threatened and killed in unprecedented numbers: 
14 have been murdered in atrocious fashion, and three have disappeared in the 
same time period. In each of these cases local justice has dismissed the 
victim’s profession as probable cause.”

The letter, in calling on Peña Nieto to take action to end the violence 
against members of the media, said:

“In your country, the statistics are disastrous regarding impunity in crimes 
against the press: according to the Human Rights Commission, 89% of the murders 
remain unsolved.”

It urged the president to “guarantee the immediate and effective 
investigation” of Espinosa’s murder “and the shameful number of journalists in 
Mexico who have met the same fate”.

It also demanded a “thorough investigation of state and municipal officials 
who, in each case, may have been involved” along with an undertaking to review 
“the procedures established to protect reporters’ lives.”
