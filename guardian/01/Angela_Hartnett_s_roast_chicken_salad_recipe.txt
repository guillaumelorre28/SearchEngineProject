I use freshly roasted chicken thighs for this salad but it also works with 
leftovers from a roast. If you do this, keep and heat up the cooking juices 
from the chicken with a touch of cumin, and pour over the salad just before 
serving.

Serves 4
6 chicken thighs
Salt and pepper
Pinch of cumin powder
2 small head radicchio or 2 large endive
2 spring onions, chopped
1 tbsp roasted hazelnuts, chopped
1 apple, unpeeled and sliced
75ml olive oil
15ml cider vinegar
1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped 

Preheat oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Add a dash of oil to a saucepan and gently 
warm on a medium heat.

Season the thighs all over with salt, pepper and cumin powder. Add to the pan, 
turning, for a few minutes until they have coloured on all sides. Place in the 
oven for 20 minutes.

Loosely rip the radicchio or endive into a large bowl, add the spring onions, 
hazelnuts and sliced apple.

Test the chicken is cooked through, remove from the oven and allow to cool.

Beat the oil and cider vinegar together until emulsified.

Remove the chicken from the bone and tear into strips. Toss with the salad and 
dressing and check seasoning. Garnish with parsley and serve.
