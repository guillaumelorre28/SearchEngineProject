Stellan Skarsgård <https://www.theguardian.com/film/stellan-skarsgard> has 
defended the BBC and launched a forthright attack on Rupert Murdoch’s influence 
on British media.

The actor is starring in River 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/07/stellan-skarsgard-abi-morgan-river-behind-the-scenes-tv-police-drama>
, a dark and complex new police drama fromAbi Morgan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/abimorgan>, which starts on BBC1 on Tuesday. 

“Of course it’s under attack, because David Cameron – who put him there? 
Rupert Murdoch did,” Skarsgård toldthe Hollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/stellan-skarsgard-rupert-murdoch-fox-830913>
. “Rupert Murdoch is in bed with Cameron. Of course they want to kill the BBC …

“If you want to have a civilised country, you cannot let all the information 
come from somebody who wants to make money out of it, and definitely not from 
Rupert Murdoch. It’s horrifying, horrifying.”

Skarsgård argued that any attempts to diminish the BBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> would work in Murdoch’s favour. “You 
want to give him more power? Go ahead,” he says. “You’re going to fuck up 
whatever is left of civilisation!”
