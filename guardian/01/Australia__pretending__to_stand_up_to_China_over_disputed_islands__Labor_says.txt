Australia should stop “pretending” to conduct freedom of navigation exercises 
and take more concrete action in theSouth China Sea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-china-sea>, the Labor defence 
spokesman Stephen Conroy has said.

Conroy’s statement is a strong reiteration of Labor’s position that the 
defence force should be authorised to conduct freedom of navigation exercises 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/19/coalition-under-renewed-pressure-to-send-australian-military-to-south-china-sea>
 within 12 nautical miles of rocky outcrops and artificial islands in the area.

Conroy said it would be “bullying” if China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> retaliated economically against 
Australia for making such a stand.

On Tuesday an international tribunal in The Hague came down overwhelmingly in 
favour of claims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china>
 by thePhilippines <https://www.theguardian.com/world/philippines> over China 
in the South China Sea.

The Hague tribunal ruled that rocky outcrops claimed by China could not be 
used as the basis of territorial claims and China had violated the Philippines’ 
sovereign rights in those waters by interfering with its fishing and petroleum 
exploration and by constructing artificial islands.

Conroy told Radio National on Wednesday the ruling made it “clear and 
unambiguous” that there was no legal basis for China to claim resources in the 
area.

“Labor has advocated for some time that it is important to uphold the 
international rules-based system.

“It is vital that we not just talk the talk but that we act and be seen to act 
to support the system,” he said. “The government is continuing to pretend to 
the Australian people that it has an ongoing program of freedom of navigation 
exercises – this is in fact not the case.”

Australia supports in principle freedom of navigation exercises conducted by 
the US within 12 nautical miles of Chinese structures

 but hasso far not itself conducted such exercises

.

Conroy said his questioning of Defence officials at Senate estimates had 
revealed they were not authorised to engage in freedom of navigation exercises 
in the South China Sea.

“Now that it’s very clear you can’t build an artificial island and claim 
rights around it – there is no 12-mile limit around these islands ... Australia 
should authorise its forces to both sail and fly over those areas of the South 
China Sea.”

Conroy said Australia should not indicate when and where it would conduct the 
operations, but called on the government to stop “pretending” it was engaged in 
them already.

On ABC’s AM Bishop called on the Philippines and China to abide by the final, 
binding ruling.

She said Australia had “been calling on China for some time to halt 
reclamation work and not to militarise the structures”.

Bishop said if China ignored the law of the sea it would be “a serious 
international transgression” with “strong reputational costs”.

“As we’ve done for many decades, Australian ships and aircraft will continue 
to exercise rights of freedom of navigation and over-flight, we’ve already been 
doing that, we’ll continue to do it.”

Asked if Australia would do so within 12 nautical miles, Bishop said she would 
not comment on the details ofAustralian defence force 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-military> activities 
“but we’ve certainly exercised the right of freedom of navigation and freedom 
of over-flight”.

Australia should be working to reduce tensions, not increase them, she said.

Conroy said China had indicated it would ignore the ruling and its actions had 
become “even more aggressive and provocative, including sinking vessels and 
ramming vessels”.

Asked about the threat of economic repercussions if Australia conducted 
freedom of navigation exercises, Conroy said it was “straight-up bullying” to 
threaten retaliation.

He said Australia had a free trade agreement with China, and if China intended 
to flout the agreement in retaliation, it should say so.
