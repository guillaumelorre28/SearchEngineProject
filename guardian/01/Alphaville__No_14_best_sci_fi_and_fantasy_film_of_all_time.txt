No film-maker of the 60s embodies that tumultuous decade as thoroughly as 
Jean-Luc Godard <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jeanlucgodard>, whose 
ceaseless, unresting innovation led others into a new realm of radical politics 
and extreme formal experimentation. But few could match his invention and 
idiosyncrasy – by the end of the decade Pauline Kael noted: "The corpses 
of his imitators littered the world's film festivals."
Alphaville is one of his more approachable works, a sort of retro-futuristic 
noir that partakes equally of Raymond Chandler, Jean Cocteau and Leon Trotsky. 
It offers an inspiration for the dystopian futurescape of Ridley Scott's Blade 
Runner, and has strong parallels with John Boorman's Point Blank (both films 
could happily have used Alphaville's original title: Tarzan Vs IBM).

Sam Spade-like shamus Lemmy Caution arrives in Alphaville 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/alphaville> – a modernist, steel-and-glass 
Paris by night, as captured by Nouvelle Vague cinematographer Raoul Coutard – 
to confront its logic-based, computer-governed reality and perhaps to rescue 
someone called Werner von Braun (it's that kind of film). Along the way he 
encounters Mme Godard (Anna Karina), batty Cahiers du Cinéma critics Jean-André 
Fieschi and Jean-Louis Comolli playing scientists and, just for good measure, 
Hollywood veteran Akim Tamiroff!
