In September 1918, German-American Otto K E Heinemann, manager of the US 
office of the German Odeon records, decided, given events in Europe, that it 
might be wise to start a US-based record label. He called it OKeH (its name 
derived from the initials of his name), and it sold popular songs and dance 
numbers as well as recordings in Yiddish and other languages for theÂ US's new 
immigrant communities. The first recording of vocal blues by an 
African-American artist followed two years later, with vaudeville singer Mamie 
Smith's record CrazyBlues <https://www.theguardian.com/music/blues> selling 
more than a million copies in less than a year, uncovering a previously 
unimagined market for "race" records.
