In October 1960, a German student took five young Britons to a Hamburg 
fairground for a photoshoot. Astrid Kirchherr had only just met the Beatles 
through her friend Klaus Voormann. She was determined to find common ground 
through the language barrier.

Many of the negatives are now lost but one group shot remains: caught in a 
grid of metal, the Beatles stand and sit in a line. Dressed in leather, jeans 
and boots, they could be a street gang, were it not for the sharp intelligence 
of their faces. They're not sleazy deadbeats but existentialist heroes.

In Kirchherr's photograph, the Beatles came into focus for the first time. It 
came at a crucial historical moment when black American music, as played by 
Britons, came up against the continental avant garde aesthetics embodied by 
Kirchherr and her friends.

That triangulation resulted in the beginning of pop modernism. The next year 
Stuart Sutcliffe, and then John Lennon and Paul McCartney, swept forward their 
50s' rocker haircut into the pilzen kopf (mushroom head) style, and the western 
world soon followed.
