1 My style is boyish and tough. I like button-up shirts, T-shirts, skinny 
jeans, and either very high heels or trainers. I'm not into pastels; I love 
strong colour. I'm also loving this season's tropical/tribal prints trend!

2 Confidence is key. Assuming your own style, regardless of how bizarre or 
plain, is the best thing you can do. I don't like it when an outfit looks too 
put together or when someone is wearing shoes they can't walk in.

3 Don't bare too much flesh. Wear something fitted with something loose. 
Always have a colour pop situation going on: your handbag strap, neon nails or 
a really strong lipstick.

4 Be comfortable. I can't wear heels if I have meetings in town. I end up sore 
and looking uncomfortable. Always have a pair of flat shoes – heels can go in 
the handbag for later.

5 Shop less and spend more money on classics. I do buy a lot from Topshop, 
Urban Outfitters and Zara, but I bought two classic shirts from Whistles 
yesterday – perhaps it's a sign I'm growing up.
