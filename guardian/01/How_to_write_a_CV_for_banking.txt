A recent Q&A on financial services 
<http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/financial-services-careers?commentpage=all#start-of-comments>
 revealed that recruitment for investment banking, down during the height of 
the recession, is now back to 2006-07 levels.

A career in banking is open to graduates of all disciplines. Anuranjita Kumar, 
head of human resources (global banking) at Citisays 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/11553845>: "We 
encourage applications from all degree disciplines. Our recruits have diverse 
academic backgrounds – ranging from business degrees to the arts."

The banking sector is also open to career changers. Gaining relevant 
qualifications may ease the transition and prove you have an understanding of 
the industry.

Jhan Burger, specialist financial markets lecturer at Kaplan, says 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/11552587>: "The CISI 
and CFAUK qualifications can be completed in months. They have the added 
benefit of illustrating to employers your interest and saves them from having 
to pay for you to do it if your job requires a demonstration of competence to 
the FSA."

Dr Robert Webb, a course leader at GCU London advises 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/11554132>: "Another 
(pathway) is to get on to a banking MSc programme – preferably one that's 
practical and focused (on risk management, finance, investment and so on). 
Programmes with industry accreditation are good as they have bankers coming on 
to campus. Make sure you ask the programme leader to tell you of the industry 
links that they offer."

General guidelines

Competition is intense. Banks want to see drive, ambition and evidence of a 
high degree of "financial literacy". Start building your CV as an undergrad 
throughcourses or internships 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/11554127> taken during 
the summer, for example.

It's crucial you understand the financial industry – and, in particular, where 
you want to work within it. Research roles, organisations and wider trends so 
you can clearly – and convincingly – explain why the role appeals. Jhan Burger 
advises taking out a subscription to the FT and Economist, while Laura Raznick, 
head of student careers liaison at ESCP Europe Business School advises 
undergrads to take part in events organised by financial companies, and to join 
any relevant student societies, as these arrange visits and talks by guest 
speakers.

Along with excellent academic achievement, employers also want to see 
particular skills. Stephen Smith executive director (employer engagement) for 
the National Skills Academy for Financial Services, says that the financial 
services industry looks for communication skills (necessary to articulate 
complex ideas concisely), analytical skills (useful for problem-solving and 
decision-making) and the ability to work under pressure.

Interpersonal skills are also important. Anuranjita Kumar explains 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/11554737>: "Teamwork is 
valued very highly because the nature of the work often requires the input of a 
broad range of skills, but you'll also be required to use your initiative and 
show leadership."

Include extra-curricular activities to differentiate yourself 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/11555441>. "As a 
benchmark, we're seeing a lot more applications where graduates involve 
themselves in so many things from clubs, work experiences, volunteering, 
playing sports and still managing to get top grades."
