What makes a good beach read? My main criterion is that the pages must turn 
quickly, almost as if by magic. Finding out what happens next becomes the most 
important thing in the world. You don’t just take the book to the beach; you 
take the book to the dinner table, to bed, on the bus or the boat. In other 
words, you cannot put it down.

A good beach read doesn’t have to be light and frothy – although sometimes 
that’s just what the doctor ordered when the most complex thing you can handle 
is applying sunscreen and floating on your back.


We’d love to hear about your favourite beach reads by Australian writers. Here 
are some of ours, based on both their literary merit (just because you’re 
reading at the beach, doesn’t mean you want to put up with sloppy prose) and 
page-turning qualities.

1. The Slap 
<https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/fiction/The-Slap-Christos-Tsiolkas-9781741758207>
 by Christos Tsiolkas

 A word-of-mouth phenomenon on its release in 2008, The Slap has a simple 
premise: a man at a family barbecue slaps a child who is not his own.

The Slap captured the zeitgeist of John Howard’s aspirational Australia and 
ignited thousands of conversations along the lines of “what would you do?”

But it’s also a page-turner – each chapter is told from a different 
character’s point of view, and the characters are so well-drawn that it’s a 
wrench to leave their worlds.

2. Joe Cinque’s Consolation <http://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781925483574/> by 
Helen Garner

A controversial inclusion: Joe Cinque’s Consolation deals with dark subject 
matter but it’s a real-life court story, and the unfolding trial provides the 
narrative drive.

In 1997 Anu Singh killed Joe Cinque with a lethal dose of heroin after she 
laced his coffee with rohypnol. At a dinner party and in law student circles at 
the Australian National University in in Canberra, a number of her friends and 
acquaintances had been informed of her intent to kill him. So why did no one 
try to stop her?

Eminently readable, like all the best true crime, the suspense lies in whether 
or not Singh will be found guilty of Cinque’s murder.

3. The Riders <https://penguin.com.au/books/the-riders-9780143568803> by Tim 
Winton

 This 1994 book is a departure for Winton from his usual home turf of 
beachside Western Australia. Much of the action of The Riders takes place in 
Ireland and other locations throughout Europe and it is a joy to see him use 
his vivid powers of description for places outside Australia.

In many ways The Riders is a chase novel. The main character, Fred Scully, 
goes to Shannon airport to collect his wife and six-year-old daughter, Billie, 
but only Billie gets off the plane. The reader is as clueless as the loved-up, 
hapless Scully as to the whereabouts of his wife – and so we follow him in his 
frantic search for her through the Greek isles, Rome, Paris and Amsterdam. It 
is fast-paced and full of action, with Winton coming close to penning a 
thriller.

4. Stasiland <https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/stasiland> by Anna Funder

These true stories of the people who were caught in the web of secret policing 
and industrial-strength surveillance in cold war East Germany is a gripping 
read.

The Australian writer Anna Funder was living in Berlin just after the wall 
fell, and watched history speed along while the stories of those whose lives 
were affected by the Stasi, the East German secret police, were being forgotten.

Including interviews with both the spies and the spied upon, Funder’s gripping 
account of the era has the descriptive but restrained prose of a novel.

5. A Fraction of the Whole 
<https://penguin.com.au/books/a-fraction-of-the-whole-9780143009528> by Steve 
Toltz

 Steve Toltz’s 2008 debut novel, A Fraction of the Whole, is a long, 
engrossing read. It’s a joyful, discursive, funny romp through three 
generations of one strange family, the Deans. There are lots of laugh-out-loud 
moments in this book but amid the humour are some acute observations about 
Australian character and values.

Jasper Dean tries to unravel the enigma that is his father, Martin – paranoid, 
inventive, hilarious and full of life lessons that he regularly imparted to his 
son. Fixated by his own death, in life Martin embarks on a series of weird and 
wonderful “immortality projects”, the results of which kept me glued to the 
page over my summer holiday.

6. The Getting of Wisdom 
<https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/the-getting-of-wisdom> by Henry Handel 
Richardson

 It’s an Australian classic but don’t let that put you off. It’s the late 19th 
century and 12-year-old Laura Tweedle Rambotham leaves her widowed mother, her 
younger siblings and her country life to attend boarding school in Melbourne.

Laura is imaginative, clever and speaks her mind – and finds out that such 
qualities might be tolerated at home but get her in trouble more often than not 
in the wealthy and often judgmental company she finds herself keeping in the 
big city. A gorgeous coming-of-age story that is both charming and deeply 
moving. Stephanie Convery

7. Butterfly Song <https://penguin.com.au/books/butterfly-song-9781742280004> 
by Terri Janke

 Tarena Shaw is a young Indigenous lawyer facing her final exams at Sydney 
University. Then her mother sends her a newspaper clipping about a brooch that 
is up for auction – a family heirloom that disappeared when her grandmother 
died. Tarena is charged with getting the brooch back and, to prove her family’s 
ownership, she must go back to Thursday Island, to the home of her 
grandparents, and dive deep into her family’s memories and their accounts of 
the pearling days of the Torres Strait.

Part redemption narrative, part Indigenous rights parable, Terri Janke’s novel 
from 2005 might deal with big issues but it’s a story delivered with a light 
touch and a lot of heart.Stephanie Convery

8. The Broken Shore <https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/the-broken-shore> 
followed byTruth <https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/truth> by Peter Temple

 Why have one beach read when you can have two? Start with Peter Temple’s 
brilliant crime novel The Broken Shore, safe in the knowledge that you’ve got 
its equally wonderful companion novel, Truth, lurking in your beach bag. When 
you finish the first you can immediately dive into the next.

The Broken Shore (winner of multiple international crime writing awards) and 
Truth (winner of the Miles Franklin) are set in Victoria. Temple follows some 
crime-writing conventions – yes there are crimes to be solved, yes the plot 
thickens, yes there are flawed cops with problems of their own – but he folds 
in so many layers with so much style that genre becomes irrelevant.

The joy is in Temple’s writing – so tight and pared back that it almost seems 
to be in code. His feel for dialogue and rhythm is superb, his control and 
timing masterful. With these books he has pulled off no mean feat: literary 
masterpieces that also happen to be page-turners.Lucy Clark

9. The Watch Tower <https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/the-watch-tower> 
by Elizabeth Harrower

This is no page-turner in the action-packed sense. It’s a psychological 
thriller centred on domestic life in Sydney suburbia in the 1940s, as gripping 
and terrifying as any horror story.

Little by little, sisters Laura and Clare are controlled and humiliated by 
Felix Shaw – Laura’s husband and one of the great villains in Australian 
literature – who loathes women while pretending to love them.

How do they escape? Can they escape? An astonishing book first published in 
1966. It was out of print and all-but-forgotten before Text Publishing reissued 
it in 2012.Gay Alcorn

10. Missus 
<https://penguin.com.au/books/the-harp-in-the-south-trilogy-pmc-9780143180159> 
by Ruth Park

A prequel Ruth Park wrote 40 years after the two other books in her Harp in 
the South trilogy, Missus is the tale of how Hughie and Mumma Darcy got 
together in outback New South Wales in the years leading up to the Great 
Depression – before they moved to the slums of Sydney’s Surry Hills.

It’s a rollicking read, simply and vividly written (sample sentence: “The wife 
never saw John come through the back gate without a wickedly warm tickle in her 
vitals, and the sight of Eny waggling her bottom as she stirred a pot on the 
fire made John feel quite astray”). There isn’t a lot of plot but it’s a 
spirited romp, and Park’s large cast of characters leap off the page.Nikki
