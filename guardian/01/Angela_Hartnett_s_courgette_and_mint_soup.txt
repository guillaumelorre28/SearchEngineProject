This fresh soup works equally well warm or cold. I love it chilled on a hot 
afternoon. Use those courgettes at the bottom of your fridge that are getting a 
bit soft.

Serves 3-4

4 tbsp olive oil
Generous knob of butter
1 small onion, chopped
2 small courgettes, thinly sliced
Pinch of salt
300g frozen peas
500ml vegetable stock (top up with water to cover if necessary)
Handful of mint, torn
Handful of watercress, torn
50g spreadable goat's cheese
8 small pieces of toasted sourdough bread

Put half the oil and all the butter into a pan on a medium heat. Saute the 
onion until soft, but without colour, then add the courgettes, season and cook 
for about five minutes.

Stir in the peas, add the stock, boil, then simmer for a few minutes. Check 
the seasoning, blend the mixture, thinning it with water if necessary.

If you want the soup cold, pour it into a bowl over some ice to chill quickly, 
then refrigerate. Chill your bowls before serving the soup, then garnish with 
the mint, watercress and a little olive oil.

Spread the goat's cheese on to the sourdough toast for croutons and serve on 
the side.
