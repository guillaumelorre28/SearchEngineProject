1968 was a year of political upheaval in Brazil, with a soundtrack provided by 
a new musical movement, tropicalia, headed by Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. 
Their aim was to shake up the Brazilian scene with "cultural cannibalism", 
mixing rock music with Brazilian styles or the glamour of Brazil's Hollywood 
star Carmen Miranda. The country had been under military rule since 1964, but 
in 1968 the repression intensified with the publication of Institutional Act 5, 
which suspended habeas corpus and allowed anyone to be jailed without reason. 
Gil and Veloso had taken part in the "March of 100,000", protesting against the 
killing of a student by police, while Veloso's song E Proibido Proibir 
(Prohibiting is Prohibited) was based on a slogan from the student upheavals in 
France. On 27 December 1968, they were arrested without charge, and told they 
were more dangerous than straightforward political activists. They were jailed 
for two months, kept under house arrest for four more months, and then exiled, 
choosing to go to London "because of the Beatles and Stones". After three years 
they were allowed home; Gil would later become Brazil's minister of culture.
