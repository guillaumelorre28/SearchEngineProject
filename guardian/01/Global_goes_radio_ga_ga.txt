While the BBC was axing two radio stations, Global Radio's entire staff (or at 
least, all of them minus those required to keep the stations on air) were 
gathering at London's Dominion Theatre to be addressed by Global Radio's 
founder and group chief executive,Ashley Tabor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/ashley-tabor>. The gee-up to the troops 
coincided with the second anniversary of Global's purchase of GCap Media for 
Â£375m. The Dominion is host to Ben Elton's Queen musical, but there was no word 
on whether We Will Rock You is to become the new slogan of Global's Heart. The 
BBC, meanwhile, was busy playing its reworking of another Queen song, Another 
Two Bite the Dust.
