Laura Robson, last year's junior Wimbledon champion, reached the last 16 of the
Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> girls' 
tournament with a 6-3, 7-6 win over Thailand's Kanyapat Narattana. Robson 
trailed 5-1 in the second set but came back strongly, eventually taking the 
tie-break without conceding a point.

"I was lucky to play in the morning because it wasn't too hot. I shall be 
having iced baths, and I've never drunk as much water in my life," Robson said.

She had watched Andy Murray get beaten by Fernando Verdasco the previous 
evening, sitting behind Murray's mother, Judy. "I'd spoken to Andy quite a lot 
before the match, and Serena Williams came up and had a chat with me, but I was 
so nervous I was only giving her one-word answers."

There were certainly no nerves on court, not even when she was down in the 
second set. "I played a good tie-break. I didn't want a third set in that heat, 
although I think I am getting used to it," said Robson who is the No5 seed.

The 15-year-old is also studying for GCSE maths and English this year. "But 
while I'm here I focus on the tennis."
