Nebraska director Alexander Payne is set to direct a film based on The Judge's 
Will, the last published work bynovelist and scriptwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/03/ruth-prawer-jhabvala>, according 
to Deadline 
<http://www.deadline.com/2013/10/alexander-payne-teams-with-searchlight-conde-nast-on-the-judges-will/>
.The Judge's Will was included in the March 25 2013 issue 
<http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2013/03/25/130325fi_fiction_jhabvala>
 of the New Yorker, shortly before Jhabvala died in April.

Jhabvala was born in Germany but later moved to India (after marrying 
architect Cyrus Jhabvala) and then the US, and remains best known as the writer 
of a string of film scripts for Merchant Ivory, includingHeat and Dust 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/95842/heat-and-dust>, Room with a View 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77615/room-with-a-view> and Howards End 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/41530/howards.end>. She won two Oscars, 
for the latter two films.

The Judge's Will recounts the preparations an Indian judge with heart disease 
makes for after his death, providing for both his family and his mistress. 
Perhaps influenced by Satyajit Ray'sThe Chess Players 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/78287/chess-players>, the story 
concludes with a chess game between husband and wife.

Payne is currently readying his black and white road movie Nebraska for a 22 
November US release and possible awards run, after a successful premiere at 
Cannes where Bruce Dern won the best actor award. Nebraska is then due for a 6 
December release in the UK.
