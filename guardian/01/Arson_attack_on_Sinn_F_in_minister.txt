Two cars were set alight outside the Murphys' home in the Church Road area of 
Camlough, SouthArmagh <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/armagh>, around 1am. No 
one was injured in the attack, which the MP branded as "cowardly".

"We had to evacuate our own kids out of our house, down to neighbours' houses, 
in case the cars actually exploded while they were burning," he said.

"They were all fairly traumatised by the whole experience.

"There was some damage to both houses but the fire brigade managed to get the 
fires out before the houses caught fire."

The minister's home and that of his parents-in-law next door were badly 
scorched by the burning cars.

The Newry and Armagh MP said he would not be deflected from representing local 
people. "The reality is the people who sneaked into my yard last night and 
traumatised my kids, my parents-in-law, my wife haven't offered any explanation 
as to who they are or what they're about," he said.

"It is incumbent on them to do so and let people decide whether they offer a 
better way forward.

"Until such times as these people come out from under cover of darkness we 
can't actually ascertain who they are or what their motives are."

Police said they were treating the incident as malicious and have appealed for 
witnesses.
