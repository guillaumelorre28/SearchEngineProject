A lethal batch of heroin contaminated by anthrax has emerged in London and 
Germany <https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany>, and has now claimed 10 
lives, two months after cases emerged in Glasgow.

The Health Protection agency said that an unnamed heroin user is being treated 
in a London hospital after becoming ill last month, in the first known case of 
anthrax being caught through drug use in England.

Investigators also confirmed that the anthrax which killed a drug user in 
Germany in December was indistinguishable from the strain confirmed to be in 14 
of the 19 cases so far in Scotland, where nine addicts have died.
