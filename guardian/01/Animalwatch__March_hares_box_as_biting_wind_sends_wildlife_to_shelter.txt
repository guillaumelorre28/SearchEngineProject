Hares have been boxing each other in their annual fisticuffs out in the open 
countryside this spring. This is not a mating ritual, though, or even two males 
punching each other for the right to get mates or territory - it is females 
fending off over-amorous males who are rather too keen on mating. These are 
common brown hares, and they are also astonishingly fast, capable of reaching 
speeds of 40mph to escape predators.

March's balmy sunshine brought out butterflies, and brimstones – one of the 
few British butterflies that hibernate as an adult – woke up early from their 
hibernation. The male's bright yellow wings are easy to spot and their buttery 
colour may even have been the origin of the word "butterfly". The comma 
butterfly came out over much of England, small tortoiseshells appeared in 
Scotland and the beautiful red admiral showed up in southern England. The 
unusually warm weather also brought bats and hedgehogs out from their 
hibernation.

But this month's bitter winds have sent wildlife scurrying for shelter. The 
lurch into wet and snowy weather has brought some relief from the drought, 
though, which was beginning to hit pondlife and river creatures particularly 
hard. And should another long dry spell of weather return, gardeners can help 
by preparing valuable wet refuges – animals ranging from hedgehogs to bees 
appreciate birdbaths, ponds, bog gardens, open compost heaps or simply putting 
out dishes of water.
