Dear Alia,

Is it possible to take a picture of the nightstands indicating which one is 
the one your ordered and which has been sent wrong? I need to send them to the 
head office. I will then organize a replacement for the one that is wrong.

The lighting department will get back to me with an answer on Monday.

Thank you for your patience and have a good weekend!

Kind regards,

Dear Alia,

I am sorry to hear about that. Usually we check things in the warehouse but 
this time was difficult because items were crated.

I will deal with this matter and get back to you as soon as I can. I will also 
check those lamps for you.

Please accept our apologies.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

Dear [XXXXXXXXXXXX]

I hope you are well. I am pleased to say that all the items sent recently have 
been safely received - many thanks for all your help.

I have received two nightstands as ordered, but unfortunately they appear to 
be different finishes and they have different colour draws!? I am sure there is 
a mistake. I checked the invoice and thankfully the two nightstands have the 
same order reference so I am sure they sent the wrong one. Please can you look 
into this for me.

Alo, just to confirm that we are still waiting on the following:

- [XXXXXXXXXXXX] Lantern *3
- [XXXXXXXXXXXX] Magnolia Table Lamp *2

Do you have an idea of when they will be ready?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards

Alia
