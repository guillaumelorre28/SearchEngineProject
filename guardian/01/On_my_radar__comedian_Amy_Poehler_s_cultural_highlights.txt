 A scene from the the 1948 film Bicycle Thieves. 
I’m a big fan of Bicycle Thieves. Love that film. I first saw it when I was at 
university and I’ve probably seen it half-a-dozen times. It’s a classic example 
of very simple storytelling. The father-son relationship is so beautiful and 
incredibly moving. It’s one to watch in the dead of winter. People always 
assume when you’re a comedian that you’re laughing all the time, but I actually 
enjoy very dark, sad things – as my choices here will demonstrate.

 Soulful style: Leon Bridges. 
I’m really loving Leon Bridges right now. He’s a good Texan boy with a 
beautiful voice.Sam Cooke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/18/authorised-sam-cooke-biopic-murder-theory-romeo-antonio>
 is my favourite musician ever – again, a perfect musician to listen to in a 
cold, dark room – and Leon has a bit of that natural, soulful style. I listen 
to a lot of British music, too. I’m in the UK right now and it’s against the 
law not to wake up toMorrissey <https://www.theguardian.com/music/morrissey>. 
Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiqOsKngc-c> is pretty much the perfect song. 
I also adoreBilly Bragg <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/billybragg>, 
especially his collaborations withWilco

The Goldfinch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/17/goldfinch-donna-tartt-review> 
[by Donna Tartt] is a year or two old, but I finally read it this spring and 
it’s amazing. A big hefty one, too. You look very impressive when you’re 
reading it. There’s a guy introduced on page 278 who is one of the best 
characters I’ve read in fiction for the last decade: this wonderful Ukrainian 
maniac named Boris, who both helps and hurts the protagonist Theo at the same 
time. I’d love to have Boris come alive and be in my life. He’d take care of me 
/ put me in harm’s way – every girl’s dream.

 Billy Eichner and Julie Klausner in Difficult People. 
Continuing on the dark trend, but in a funny way, there’s a show called 
Difficult People <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4676574/> coming out this month. 
I’m exec-producing and it’s a single-camera show set in New York City about two 
comedians, played by Julie Klausner andBilly Eichner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/19/billy-eichner-on-the-street-five-best>
, who feel their chance has passed them by. They’re exasperated that their 
friends are successful and they’re still struggling. They hate everything and 
everyone except each other. Julie’s the creator and writer, and it’s so great. 
It’sWill & Grace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/06/next-boxset-will-and-grace>
 if Grace was a six and Will was a five. We pressurised our pals to make

Amy is crushing it on every level. I love what she’s doing. Her show, Inside 
Amy Schumer

captains, number ones, and Amy andLouis CK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/10/louie-louis-ck-season-five-premiere>
 are the king and the queen of comedy right now. I’ve known Louis for a long 
time, seen him in all different iterations, but his standup continues to feel 
completely fresh. His stuff is both incredibly personal and universal, which is 
hard to pull off. I just love his artistic worldview. Growing up in the 90s, I 
loved British comedy, too. We used to pass VHS tapes around college ofSmack the

I went to see The Elephant Man on Broadway, with Bradley Cooper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/07/elephant-man-review-haymarket-london-bradley-cooper>
 and the luminousPatricia Clarkson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/25/patricia-clarkson-interview>, and 
I was really excited. Bradley and I did a movie 15 years ago calledWet Hot 
American Summer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/28/wet-hot-american-summer>, 
which has now got a prequel series on Netflix. It was Bradley’s first film and 
even back then, he was talking about how he’d played John Merrick in a college 
production. Now he’s done it on Broadway, so good on him, man. TheDavid Lynch 
film version 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/20/david-lynch-films-five-best-moments-mulholland-drive-elephant-eraserhead>
 is another goodie for a cold dark night. So weepy. And I think if we’ve 
learned anything here, it’s that I like to cry.

 Mark Bradford in his LA studio. Photograph: Jesse Grant/MacArthur Foundation 
Mark Bradford <http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/mark_bradford.htm> is 
from LA and does these giant collage paintings using found elements from his 
everyday life. I love his work. His process is very blue-collar, not precious, 
he just keeps moving things around and sanding things down. I’m drawn to 
artists who don’t pretend they’re magicians but show their workings. I like the 
physical labour of it.
