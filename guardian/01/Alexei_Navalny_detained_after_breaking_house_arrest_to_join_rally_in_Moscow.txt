The Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexei-navalny> was arrested on Tuesday 
after breaking house arrest to join an opposition rally in Moscow, hours after 
a court gave him a suspended sentence for fraud. His brother, Oleg, was jailed 
for three and a half years for the same offence.

Police arrested Navalny soon after he emerged from the metro. Officers 
detained him outside the Ritz Carlton hotel, in Tverskaya street, before he had 
a chance to join demonstrators trying to reach the heavily guarded Manezh 
square, directly in front of the Kremlin.

Thousands of protesters gathered in freezing conditions to protest against the 
verdict on Navalny and his brother. They chanted anti-Putin slogans including: 
“No Putin, no war”, “Crimea is not ours”, “Putin is a thief” and “freedom”. 
More than 100 protesters were arrested, including a Wall Street Journal 
reporter, and loaded into waiting buses, to cries of “shame!”.

 Pussy Riot, the Russian feminist punk band, has released a video calling for a 
protest against the Navalny verdict outside the Kremlin. 
“Look how much they fear us, as if we were enemies. Navalny and [Russian 
president Vladimir] Putin are now real enemies. Today’s verdict made Alexei 
very angry,” Svetlana Guseva, an oncologist and longtime opposition activist, 
said. “Anger will make us stronger,” she added.

Some of those detained tweeted photos from inside police vans 
<http://instagram.com/p/xPQvobnRRY/>. Navalny tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/navalny> that officials had taken him to a police station 
and then taken him back to his flat. Five police guards stood outside his door 
to prevent him from leaving again.

In a case which critics say was politically motivated, the judge earlier 
handed Navalny – Vladimir Putin’s most high-profile opponent – a suspended 
three-and-a-half-year sentence. He had faced up to 10 years in jail. But in an 
unexpected move, the court jailed Oleg Navalny and sent him to a penal colony.

It was unclear whether Alexei Navalny now faces a similar term behind bars 
after deliberately breaking his bail conditions on Tuesday. He is under house 
arrest following an earlier conviction. Setting off to the demonstration, he 
tweeted from the metro: “Yes, there is this house arrest. But today I want to 
be with you. So I’m coming too.”

Navalny’s supporters said Tuesday’s verdict showed the Kremlin was returning 
to the Soviet-era practice of punishing the relatives of those it disliked.

Both men were found guilty of stealing 30m roubles (about £334,000 under the 
current exchange rate) from the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher. Asked by 
the judge, Yelena Korobchenko, if the rulings against them were clear, Alexei 
replied: “Nothing is clear. Why are you imprisoning my brother? By this you 
punish me even harder.”

The sentencing had originally been scheduled for 15 January, but was abruptly 
brought forward to the day before New Year’s Eve, the main Russian holiday, in 
an apparent attempt to prevent large-scale anti-Putin demonstrations. Riot 
police and military vehicles flooded Manezh Square in anticipation of protests. 
The authorities had not given permission for the rally, so it was considered 
illegal.

“Of all the possible types of sentence, this is the meanest,” said Alexei 
Navalny outside court after his brother was taken away. “The government isn’t 
just trying to jail its political opponents – we’re used to it, we’re aware 
that they’re doing it – but this time they’re destroying and torturing the 
families of the people who oppose them,” he said.

Writing on his blog, <https://navalny.com/p/4050/>, Navalny said his brother’s 
sentence would not stop him from political activity. He lambasted those at the 
top of Kremlin power as “thieves, scoundrels and traitors who must be 
destroyed”. He also said ordinary Russians were guilty of allowing the 
political elite to plunder the country. “We let them through our passivity,” he 
wrote.

Critics said the move was the latest attempt by the Kremlin to shut down 
Navalny’s long-running anti-corruption campaign against Putin. Navalny’s 
friend, the opposition leader Ilya Yashin, said: “By taking his own brother as 
a political hostage, the sinister Kremlin wants to squash Navalny’s spirit, so 
he shuts up.”

The editor-in-chief of the liberal radio Echo of Moscow, Aleksei Venedictov, 
described the Kremlin’s perceived new strategy against Navalny as 
“sophisticated torture”.

“The verdict is purely political. The Kremlin weakens Alexei by giving him 
thousands of little wounds. First they keep him for months under house arrest, 
forbid him to use the internet, then put him on trial, then throw his brother 
in jail – taking family members hostage is a sensational new strategy,” 
Venediktov told the Guardian.

Oleg Navalny is the father of two small children and a former executive of the 
state-owned postal service. Unlike his better-known brother, he has never 
played a role in the Russian opposition movement. His imprisonment in a penal 
colony seems to echo the Soviet-era practice of arresting the relatives of 
inconvenient people.

The EU condemned Tuesday’s guilty verdict and said the case against the two 
brothers “appears to be politically motivated”. It said the trial had failed to 
substantiate the charges against them.

The Russian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent 10 years in jail before he 
was pardoned last year, dismissed the verdict as Putin’s revenge for Navalny’s 
activism.

Khodorkovsky said in a statement that he was “not even surprised that Putin 
and his entourage are capable of vile tricks, deception, forgery and 
manipulation. They are not capable of anything else.”

Hugh Williamson, Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and 
central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the sentencing might have 
been designed to warn off other Putin critics.

“The sentence, and the imprisoning of his brother, Oleg Navalny, seems aimed 
not only at punishing Alexei Navalny himself and stopping his anti-corruption 
work, but also intimidating other critics of the government,” he said.

“The Kremlin seems to be telling independent voices to expect a harsher 
crackdown in 2015. Many factors point to political motivations in the case 
against Alexei and Oleg Navalny.

“By moving up the verdict, the Russian authorities apparently sought to 
diminish planned demonstrations. They also pushed those planning to protest 
[against] a guilty verdict to the margins of the law, by denying them enough 
time to comply with local regulations.”
