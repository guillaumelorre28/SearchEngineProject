Audley Harrison <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/audley-harrison> has 
refused to rule out making a comeback despite his crushing first-round defeat 
by David Price on Saturday.

It took 82 seconds for the British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion Price 
to dispose of the 40-year-old Olympic gold medallist at the Liverpool Echo 
Arena.

While Price was magnificent, the defeat appeared certain to end the career of 
Harrison, who has become a figure of ridicule in boxing. However, the former 
world title challenger is still considering his future.

"I have said when I turn up to win and lose to nothing other than ability I 
will know my time is up, so this could be my last bout," he said. "I'll take 
some time to think this out as I never want to come back to boxing once I've 
walked away.

"If it's to end here, what a ride it's been and I'm grateful to the universe 
for allowing me to find my destiny and walk the precarious road my way. Keep 
dreaming, keep believing and never give up."
