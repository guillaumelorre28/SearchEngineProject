: “There will be pressure here, for sure, but I like pressure. I also know 
about the famous players who have played for Newcastle United, like Alan 
Shearer who is a hero of mine. I hope I can play like him for this club. It 
will be an honour.

“I am so happy to have signed for Newcastle. I visited the stadium yesterday 
and it’s amazing. I have played in a lot of impressive stadiums in my career 
but St. James’ Park is so big, I can’t wait to play my first game here.

“I know how passionate the fans are. This is a club with a very big history 
and the fans are a big part of that.”

In two seasons at Anderlecht <https://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht>
, Mitrovic scored 36 goals in 69 games and won the Belgian Pro League title and 
Belgian Super Cup in 2014. He started his career at the Serbian side Teleoptik 
and has one goal in 13 games for his country.

Mitrovic follows the PSV Eindhoven midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum to St James’ 
Park and the head coach Steve McClaren believes they have pulled off a coup.

“I think this is a fantastic signing for us. We’ve fought off a lot of 
competition to secure a top young talent in Europe,” he said.

“Aleksandar is someone who can develop with the team and someone who will help 
us to get to where we want to go.

“As a board we have worked hard to make it happen. It’s another demonstration 
that we are wanting to push on.”
