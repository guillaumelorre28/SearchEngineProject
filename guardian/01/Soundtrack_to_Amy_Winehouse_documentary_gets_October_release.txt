To be released on 30 October, the tracks are lifted from the film by 
Bafta-winning director Asif Kapadia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/16/amy-review-asif-kapadias-amy-winehouse-film-is-a-tragic-masterpiece>
, and include live versions of tracks at London’s Union Chapel, TV’s Later… 
with Jools Holland show, the North Sea jazz festival and the Mercury awards, as 
well as her duet withTony Bennett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tony-bennett>, demos and original songs by 
composer Antonio Pinto, who created the score for Amy.

This is the second posthumous Winehouse album, following 2011’s Lioness: 
Hidden Treasures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/dec/01/amy-winehouse-lioness-hidden-treasures-review>
. Earlier this year, there was speculation as to whether it would be the last: 
speaking to Billboard, Universal Music UK chairman and CEO David Joseph said he 
had destroyed her demos to ensure they could not be developed into releasable 
material. “It was a moral thing,” he said. “Taking a stem or a vocal is not 
something that would ever happen on my watch. It now can’t happen on anyone 
else’s.”

Joseph was speaking to Billboard ahead of the release of Amy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/amy>, on which he is credited as executive 
producer.
