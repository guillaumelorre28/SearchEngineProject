Yes, it’s back. The weekly roundups of iOS and Android apps went on hiatus at 
the end of 2014 in favour of monthly collections.

However, after a number of comments on app-related articles asking for the 
weekly rundowns to come back, it’s clear there’s still a demand. So, this 
column is getting back in the saddle for both platforms.

Here’s this week’s roundup, casting its net back to the beginning of March. 
The Android roundup will follow later in the day, and from now on, the roundups 
will be back to their usual Friday publishing schedule.

As before (Free) means fully free, while (Free + IAP) indicates use of in-app 
purchases. Prices for paid apps are correct at the time of writing, but if 
you’re coming to the piece a few weeks (or even days) later, they may have 
changed.

APPS

HERE (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/here-offline-navigation-maps/id955837609?mt=8>
Nokia’s HERE app has been on iOS before, but was removed from the App Store in 
late 2013 after falling foul of Apple’s iOS 7 update. Now it’s back and 
completely revamped: a slick maps and navigation app that gives Apple and 
Google’s offerings a run for their money – especially with its offline feature.
iPhone


Google Calendar (Free) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id909319292?mt=8>
Talking of Google, the company has finally got around to making a standalone 
iOS app for its Google Calendar service. A clean, clear design and the ability 
to pull in your iCloud calendar data make it a handy replacement for the 
default iOS calendar app.
iPhone


Snow White by Nosy Crow (£3.99) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/snow-white-by-nosy-crow/id934867093?mt=8>
Nosy Crow has made its name with a series of beautifully-crafted fairytale 
apps for children, and Snow White doesn’t dent the run of form. It tells the 
familiar story in an engaging, interactive way with the emphasis always on 
reading, rather than touchscreen gimmicks.
iPhone / iPad


Enlight (£2.99) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/enlight/id930026670?mt=8>
Enlight is one of the best photo-editing apps available for iPhone: simple to 
use to quickly tweak your pics, but with powerful features to dig in to if you 
want to spend a bit more time. Filters, double exposures, photo correction 
tools and simple social sharing are all impressive.
iPhone


Tinkerplay (Free) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tinkerplay/id975940251?mt=8>
Tinkerplay is Autodesk’s latest app tapping in to the emerging market of 3D 
printing. It’s a creative app for creating “fun characters, scary creatures or 
anything else”, snapping body parts together using the touchscreen interface, 
then – if you have the necessary hardware – printing them out.
iPhone / iPad


Yousician Guitar (Free + IAP) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id959883039?mt=8>
Yousician is the latest app hoping to teach you how to play guitar (or, if you 
already play, how to improve). It’s a comprehensive catalogue of lessons and 
songs to play along to with your real guitar, using the microphone to “listen” 
to you and provide feedback. A premium subscription for unlimited play-time 
costs £14.99 a month.

Meerkat (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/meerkat-tweet-live-video/id954105918?mt=8>
Meerkat is the buzz app of this year’s SXSW conference in Austin, but will it 
be an enduring hit like Twitter, the buzz app of SXSW 2007? Meerkat is an app 
for broadcasting video live from your iPhone to an audience drawn from your 
Twitter followers – who can comment as you film.
iPhone / iPad


Atari Fit (Free + IAP) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/atari-fit/id952768302?mt=8>
Atari may be best known for its arcade games, but this is something of a 
curveball: a mobile fitness app. It encourages you to work out – with more than 
100 exercises included – rewarding you with coins to unlock games like Pong, 
Super Breakout and Centipede. It’ll also connect to apps like RunKeeper and 
Apple’s Health, or activity-tracking devices from the likes of Fitbit and 
Jawbone.
iPhone


Wikiwand: Faster Wikipedia Reader (Free) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wikiwand-faster-wikipedia/id947444965?mt=8>
Not that impressed by the official Wikipedia app, but want something beyond 
accessing its website from your iPhone’s browser? Wikiwand is worth a look. 
It’s a neatly designed interface to the popular online encyclopaedia.
iPhone


Elmer’s Photo Patchwork (£1.99) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id967262500?mt=8>
This is a brilliant app for getting your children out and about in the real 
world. Based on fictional elephant Elmer, it gets them to take photographs to 
use as the textures on a collection of 10 patchwork characters. Ideal for 
exploration to find interesting colours and shapes in the outside world.

 Stick Cricket 2 for iOS. 
GAMES

Stick Cricket 2 (Free + IAP) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id920668137>
The original Stick Cricket game remains a marvellous time-sucker, and while 
not all App Store reviewers love this sequel, there’s plenty to enjoy. Your job 
is to batter runs against increasingly talented bowlers, with a varied career 
mode to work your way through.

Angry Birds Stella POP! (Free + IAP) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/angry-birds-stella-pop!/id937718942?mt=8>
Just like the Bubble Witch Saga games, this takes its inspiration squarely 
from classic console series Bust-a-Move / Puzzle Bobble. You fire coloured 
bubbles at other coloured bubbles to make matches of three or more, except here 
(obviously) there are pigs and Rovio’s Angry Birds Stella characters. 
Unoriginal, maybe, but nicely done.
iPhone / iPad


Epic War TD 2 (£2.29) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/epic-war-td-2/id765482338?mt=8>
This is one of the best-looking tower defence games on iOS, as you marshal 
your towers to destroy onrushing enemies across 50 missions. “No gimmicks,” 
promises its App Store listing and while a few more interesting gimmicks might 
be welcome, it’s still a rewarding play.
iPhone / iPad


SwapQuest (£2.29) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/swapquest/id931185583?mt=8>
There’s something truly charming about this pixelly cross between a puzzler 
and an RPG game. You have to guide your character through the kingdom of 
Aventana by dragging paths into place, while also battling monsters and looting 
chests.
iPhone / iPad


Ryan North’s To Be Or Not To Be (£4.49) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id962986396?mt=8>
“William Shakespeare’s Hamlet has finally been restored to its original 
second-person non-linear branching narrative format,” chirps the App Store 
listing for this. The sharp humour runs throughout this narrative-led game, as 
fun if you’re a Shakespeare buff as for complete newcomers to the Bard.
iPhone / iPad


Dungeon Hunter 5 (Free + IAP) <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id885823239>
If swords, monsters and dungeon-crawling are your thing, Dungeon Hunter 5 is 
well worth a look – as long as you’re not harbouring fond memories of earlier 
games in this series that weren’t freemium. It looks good and there’s fun to be 
had, but it can sometimes feel a bit over-aggressive in nudging you to pay.

Card Crawl (£1.49) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/card-crawl/id950955524?mt=8>
Another game that may sound like a niche: a dungeon-crawling game where you 
slay monsters and collect gold by laying down virtual cards. But it’s very 
nicely done, and is accessible enough to appeal to a wide audience.
iPhone / iPad


TouchTone (£2.29) <https://itunes.apple.com/app/id962133182?mt=8>
Get your NSA on with this stylish security-themed game, where you have to 
decrypt suspicious messages to “help make our nation safer and stronger!” The 
satirical intent is clear, but this is also an engrossing puzzler.

MiniDrivers (Free + IAP) <https://itunes.apple.com/app/id873538439>
Sitting somewhere between Mario Kart and Micro Machines, this pocket-sized 
racer sees you speeding around 20 tracks grabbing power-ups to see off rival 
drivers. Neat graphics and unaggressive in-app purchases add up to a satisfying 
package.
iPhone / iPad


Pixel Heroes: Byte & Magic (£4.99) 
<https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pixel-heroes-byte-magic/id955790173?mt=8>
More dungeons in this excellent indie RPG/roguelike game, with more weapons, 
hero classes and random events than you can shake a massive, sharp axe at. It’s 
got humour, pixel-perfect visual charm and plenty of depth.
iPhone / iPad
