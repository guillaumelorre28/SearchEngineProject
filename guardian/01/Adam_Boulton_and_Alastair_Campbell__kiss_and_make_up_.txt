 in the aftermath of the general election, was arather more genial affair

. Indeed it ended with an apology from Campbell and a handshake â€“ as well as 
the least likely namedrop ever when Campbell told Boulton: "Peter Schmeichel 
sent me a text and said 'Shake his hand at the end'..." It was not the most 
convincing of handshakes, as you can see, and we're not sure how hard Campbell 
is pressing on Boulton's hand with his thumb, but the sinews don't appear to be 
straining too much. Thank goodness for that. As TV reunions go, all it needed 
was thetheme music from Surprise, Surprise and a cameo appearance by Cilla Black

eye in Westminster. Altogether now: "The more the world is changing, the more 
it stays the same ..."
