PayPal has withdrawn £132.50 from my wife's Alliance & Leicester bank account. 
She doesn't have a PayPal account. We are having problems convincing them both 
that there is a problem. Alliance & Leicester said she had to sort this out 
with PayPal but PayPal wanted confirmation of the transaction from A&L. A&L 
took two attempts to write a letter showing the correct amount. She sent this 
on to PayPal which said it could not find any trace of her. This is not 
surprising as she doesn't have aPayPal

Alliance & Leicester misunderstood her initial inquiry and assumed she was 
disputing a transaction she had made. It refunded £132.50 to her account while 
it investigated her real problem.

PayPal also investigated and accepts that your wife had not authorised the 
payment. This is unlikely to be fraud but no one can see where the error 
occurred. PayPal refunded the payment to her bank account, at which point A&L 
took back the refund it had made. A few days later the money again disappeared. 
A&L has put it back again as a goodwill gesture and promises it will stay there.
