I knew that there was no right way to tell my family that I was transgendered 
- just that some ways were more wrong than others. (Dressing as Marilyn Monroe 
and bursting from a cake at a birthday was the first I discounted.) To find the 
least wrong way, I had to rack my memory for any clues, however minor, however 
old, as to how my family might react - and try to anticipate them.

I'd come out as 'gay' to them aged 18, when someone who'd been at school with 
me called to say he'd heard "a horrible rumour" that the girl over the road had 
seen me wearing a dress (imagine!). My parents were aware that I wore makeup 
around college, but I knew that I couldn't pass off dressing at home as 
youthful rebellion: panicking, I decided to tell themsomething before someone 
else did.

I naively presumed that 'gay' would cover any sexual or gender difference in 
my parents' minds: after a couple of tough conversations, things had carried on 
as before. But I came to think (without any real evidence) that they weren't 
fully aware of my gender issues, believing that they'd dismissed my sixth-form 
expression as a phase. For years I avoided the subject because I couldn't find 
the right word: cross-dresser sounded too innocuous (like writing to say I'd 
taken up the ukulele), transvestite too sexual, and transgender too vague - it 
would invite further questions rather than clarify who I was.

Coming to define as transsexual meant I'd have to come out again. This would 
be much harder, as my stock line of "I'm still the same person" wouldn't work 
so well: in time I'd have a different body, a different voice, and a name 
different to the one they'd given me.

I discussed it extensively with friends, as well as checking the Transsexual 
Road Map <http://www.tsroadmap.com/index.html>'s page on coming out to parents 
<http://www.tsroadmap.com/early/comeout.html>. A letter seemed best: I 
handwrote three pages, starting with the present and then explaining my past in 
the context of my gender issues. Then, I figured, they could digest it and 
respond when they felt ready. Trembling, I posted it: there wasno going back 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogaJ0CygjnI&feature=related>. 

I spent the following days contemplating their response. I expected neither 
ecstasy nor excommunication, but could not guess where between those extremes 
it would fall. I knew that their expectations for me would be challenged - and 
most likely exchanged for anxieties. Would they think it was their 'fault'? 
Fear for my future? Or be ashamed of me?

Days later, I received an email from my father, explaining that although they 
were struggling to comprehend my decision, time and understanding would enable 
us to continue to be part of each other's lives. They visited me in Brighton 
and we had a long, difficult conversation where we discussed all their fears at 
length: I might regret it (a risk I was no longer unwilling to take); I might 
not 'pass' (not my primary concern); I might get beaten up (I'd developed 
strategies against that in Crawley and Manchester).

Eventually, it seemed best to try to talk about something else. "Who am I 
going to talk to about football?" asked my mother. "Me!" I replied. She was by 
no means the only person to think of this first. One friend's second question 
was, "Will you still supportNorwich <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-FebBxbGXY>
?" To which I said, "No,Ipswich <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSSva2D5p64>." 

Perhaps this was because they'd absorbed some stereotypical ideas 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwkwSfo0dng&feature=related> about trans women 
becomingStepford-esque <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stepford_Wives> when 
living as female. I was surprised that they'd applied this to me - but I was 
more surprised that on coming out, friends and family might initially see my 
transition as some sort of 'death'. Carrying on our relationships as normal 
soon proved that all that was 'dying' was my masculine façade.

Fine: as long as your loved ones can accept that conforming to the 
expectations around your assigned genderwas a 'façade' and carry on 'as normal' 
- or at least try. Support services for families of transsexual people exist, 
but remain underfunded and underpublicised:Depend 
<http://www.depend.org.uk/frameset.html> offers information and online 
discussion forums; theBeaumont Society <http://www.beaumontsociety.org.uk/>, 
originally a support group primarily forheterosexual transvestites 
<http://www.beaumontsociety.org.uk/history.html> and their wives, provides 
opportunities for trans people and relatives to meet; andMermaids 
<http://www.mermaidsuk.org.uk> runs an information line for gender-variant 
children and their families.

None of these, though, are particularly prominent, and I'm sure that my 
parents weren't the only ones who didn't know where to find them, turning 
instead to television documentaries - which often overplay the 'pathetic' in 
'sympathetic', or reinforce stereotypes and prejudices handed down through 
generations as transgenderism became visible during the last century.

Attending the Clare Project for sessions with a gender-specialist counsellor, 
I saw firsthand how the internalisation of these prejudices affected people - 
people transitioning in their fifties or sixties because they'd felt too afraid 
to do so in their youth, in floods of tears because their wives might become 
estranged, their children (or grandchildren) might disown them, or their 
elderly parents might die without accepting them. One friend of mine was barred 
from her mother's funeral, long after coming out to her family. I'm sure she 
was not the first, and won't be the last, to suffer such rejection.

I'm fortunate enough to be able to negotiate a new 'normality' with my 
parents: I've asserted my new identity more slowly than with my friends, 
allowing them time to adjust, and share the news with other relatives, who - 
having less invested in my gender and public image - have been accepting. For 
my parents, my 'becoming a woman' has not realised their worst fears (embodied 
bythose Daily Mail columns and cartoons 
<http://gendertrust.wordpress.com/2009/09/11/where-will-it-all-end/>): 'time 
and understanding' from both sides have indeed allowed us to remain part of 
each other's lives, thanks to our willingness to respect and share each other's 
concerns.

I hope that with each generation, more families are able to do the same.
