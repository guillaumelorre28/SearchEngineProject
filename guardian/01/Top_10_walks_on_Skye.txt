The Quiraing

The weird and wonderful rock formations of the Quiraing make it rightly 
popular with geologists, photographers and walkers – but the convoluted nature 
of the landscape means it never feels crowded. This high-level circular route 
also allows you to peer down on people below from a clifftop. It's a strenuous 
walk, so reward yourself with a coffee and homebaking at Staffin's Columba 
Centre (columba1400.com/locations/staffin 
<http://www.columba1400.com/locations/staffin>) – itself an interesting 
departure from the traditional architecture of the island – which also houses a 
pioneering leadership centre for disadvantaged young people.

The Isle of Skye is a hot spot for otters and this easy walk to a comfortable 
hide is a great way to begin your search for this elusive but beautiful 
creature. Take binoculars and look out for the distinctive v-shaped wake behind 
their heads as they swim in the narrow strait of water between the mainland and 
Skye. If otters remain out of sight, you are pretty much guaranteed to see 
seals basking on rocks near the lighthouse. The flat, well-surfaced walk, 
dotted with picnic benches, is great for people of all ages.

If you don't have the time or inclination to tackle the bare rock and airy 
peaks of the Cuillin or Red Hills, this wee coastal peak provides a fantastic 
taste of the best walking Skye has to offer. Climbing over rough ground, the 
route follows the rim of a dramatic escarpment above the sea, with wonderful 
views down to the water, often specked with passing porpoises and dolphins. 
Don't be alarmed if you also spot the huge conning tower of a naval submarine; 
these deep waters are used as a testing area for nuclear subs. The summit trig 
point provides the perfect backrest to eat your sandwiches while taking in the 
view over Portree Bay – the fishing boats and yachts bobbing in the harbour 
look like models from this height.

Coire Lagan is the perfect introduction to the Cuillin – Skye's alpine-like 
mountain range of jagged peaks. This route climbs to a high ice-carved bowl on 
the side of the mountain which is the starting point for many of the climbs to 
the peaks on the ridge as well as being a superb destination in itself. If it 
fires your desire to conquer the Cuillin Munros, there are manyexcellent local 
mountain guides <http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/skye/guides.shtml> who will 
ensure you get the best out of each day, whether your ambition is simply to 
reach an airy summit or conquer the nemesis of many Munro-baggers, the infamous
Inaccessible Pinnacle

It's difficult to resist the lure of a tidal island, and as long as you pick 
your times to coincide with the receding tide there is plenty of time to cross 
the pebbly causeway and explore the high cliffs and stunning coastal views of 
Oronsay (the name means tidal island in Norse, a reminder of the centuries-long 
dominance of the Viking rulers in this part of the world). It juts out into 
Loch Bracadale to provide a wonderful high viewpoint over this sheltered, 
island-dotted sea loch, which is popular with seals and other wildlife, as well 
as sea-kayakers.

To malt whisky buffs the name Talisker conjures a picture of peaty drams and 
long fireside evenings. Whether you visit theeponymous distillery 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talisker> before or after the walk is up to you 
but Talisker Bay is one of the few sandy beaches on Skye and perfect for a 
bracing dip, after which a warming dram would be very welcome. The short stroll 
passes Talisker House, visited in 1773 by Johnson and Boswell. Johnson no doubt 
also sampled the local whisky – he described the place much more favourably 
than most others they stayed at during their Hebridean tour.

Bla Bheinn

<http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/skye/blabheinn.shtml>
Bla Bheinn (or Blaven to give it its Anglicised name) is the one isolated peak 
of the black Cuillin. Its unique position means the climb to the summit is 
rewarded with an amazing view of the stark, jagged summits of the main ridge, 
one of the most awe-inspiring mountain vistas. Strike it lucky and you will 
climb up through cloud to emerge in a sunny inversion where the peaks rise from 
a cotton wool sea, and Brocken spectres provide rainbow halos reflected on the 
clouds. The walk is strenuous, involves a little scrambling and careful 
navigation but is within the capabilities of experienced and well-equipped 
hillwalkers.

This long but fairly easy going route sets off down Glen Sligachan which 
divides the Red and Black Cuillin peaks and provides awesome views as well as a 
good chance of spotting red deer. A good path makes it easy going until a large 
cairn indicates the start of the climb to the summit of Sgurr na Stri. From 
here the view is breathtaking; looking down on Loch Coruisk and tiny sandy 
beaches below all ringed by the looming jagged peaks of the Cuillin. Drink it 
all in before returning along the Glen to the famous climber's bar of the 
Sligachan Hotel (sligachan.co.uk <http://www.sligachan.co.uk/>) where an 
impressive whisky selection and micro-brewery will slake most thirsts.

"A strange wailing sound reached my ears, I could see a long and motley 
procession winding along the road that led north from Suisnish. There were old 
men and women, too feeble to walk, who were placed in carts; the younger 
members of the community on foot were carrying their bundles of clothes … while 
the children, with looks of alarm, walked alongside … A cry of grief went up to 
heaven, the long plaintive wail, like a funeral coronach, was resumed … the 
sound re-echoed through the wide valley of Strath in one prolonged note of 
desolation". This was Archibald Geikie's eyewitness account of the 1853 forced 
clearance of the coastal villages on this route. Now deserted and eerily 
peaceful, it is possible to sit among the ruins and imagine a thriving 
community living against the stunning mountain backdrop. The sheep the crofters 
left to make room for still graze the hillsides, and you might spot an otter or 
eagle overhead, but the area remains largely deserted of human influence.

The Skye Trail

This seven-day, unofficial, long-distance hike is gaining popularity among 
those wanting to challenge themselves against the spectacular mountain and 
coastal scenery – and unforgiving weather – of Skye. Starting from the 
northernmost point of the island, it follows a varied course along high 
sea-cliffs and mountain ridges, taking in low lying crofts, villages deserted 
many years ago by the Highland Clearances, and modern day settlements, and 
gives a real taste of the island, its landscape, culture and heritage. 
Requiring a fair bit of planning and hillwalking experience, the Skye Trail is 
a fantastic backpacking adventure.
