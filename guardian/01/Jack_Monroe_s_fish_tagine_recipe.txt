This take on a traditional tagine makes a tasty, sweet and spicy dinner that 
is easy to knock up in 20 minutes from store-cupboard favourites. Best of all, 
it is a simple way to sneak five different fruits and vegetables into my son.

(Serves 4) 78p a portion
300g rice, 12p
1 tbsp oil, 3p
1 onion, diced, 11p
1 tsp cumin, 5p
1 tsp paprika, 5p
1 vegetable or chicken stock cube, crumbled 2p
4 white fish fillets, £1.68
200g tinned mandarin segments, 27p
400g chopped tomatoes, 35p
Handful of sultanas, 6p
Few sprigs of mint or coriander, 8p
150g spinach, 23p

Put the rice on to cook. Warm the oil over a medium heat and saute the onions 
in the spices and stock for a few minutes.

When the onions start to soften, add the fish and pour the mandarins, their 
juice and the chopped tomatoes over the top. Add the sultanas, chopped herbs 
and spinach, and bring to the boil for a minute.

Reduce to a vigorous simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to stop the 
sauce from sticking to the pan.

Meanwhile, check the rice is cooked and remove from the heat.

Break the fish into chunks and stir through before serving over the rice.

Jack's tips

Leftover mint can be chopped finely and frozen in an ice-cube tray with a 
splash of water or oil for handy portions, or hung upside down to dry out and 
stored in a jar.

This tagine also works well with chickpeas and root vegetables as a vegetarian 
alternative, or with chicken thighs and drumsticks.
