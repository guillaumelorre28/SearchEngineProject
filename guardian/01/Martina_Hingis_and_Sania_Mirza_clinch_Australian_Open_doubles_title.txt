Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza clinched their first Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> doubles title together with 
a 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 victory over the Czech pair Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie 
Hradecka.

It was the 12th grand slam women’s doubles title for Hingis and the third for 
India’s Mirza, all of which have come with the Swiss over the past year. The 
world No1 doubles pairing, who have now won 36 successive matches, are also the 
reigning Wimbledon and US Open champions.

“Thanks to my partner, we have had an incredible year,” Mirza said. “We keep 
going and it’s great to have all these records with you.”

Both pairs were broken four times each in the first set before Mirza sealed it 
in the tie-break after 62 minutes when Hradecka sent a forehand service return 
long.

Hingis, who was knocked out by Mirza and Croatia’s Ivan Dodig in the mixed 
doubles quarter-finals, took a medical time-out at the end of the first set to 
have treatment to her right shoulder but did not appear troubled.

Hradecka dropped serve in the first and fifth games of the second set to give 
the top seeds a 4-1 lead, and while Mirza lost her next service game they never 
looked like relinquishing control with Hingis dominant at the net.

The Swiss was then broken while serving for the title, though they sealed it 
on their fourth championship point when Hradecka’s running forehand sailed over 
the baseline, the third time she was broken in the set.

“You have won two grand slam doubles so you were very tough,” Hingis said of 
the Czech pair. “I know everyone will say break, break, break but you guys have 
the best returns in doubles.”
