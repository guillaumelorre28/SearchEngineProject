Conrad is the strategic director and European co-founder/CEO of the Wolfram 
group of companies. The Wolfram Group specializes in pushing boundaries at the 
intersection of computation, math, and knowledge, including making Mathematica 
software, the Wolfram|Alpha knowledge engine (the power behind Siri's knowledge 
answers), the new Computational Document Format (CDF) standard and forthcoming 
Wolfram Finance Platform.

For more than twenty years, Conrad's business and technical leadership has 
been central to the rise, spread and democratization of high-level computation 
particularly through the use of automation and interactivity. He is also the 
world's leading advocate for a fundamental shift of maths education, founding 
computerbasedmath.org.
