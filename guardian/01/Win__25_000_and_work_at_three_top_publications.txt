The Anthony Howard Award for Young Journalists 2015 
<http://anthonyhowardaward.org.uk/>

Anthony Howard <https://www.theguardian.com/media/anthony-howard>, who died in 
2010, was a superb political journalist, with an exceptional ability to 
encourage young writers. In his memory, Haymarket Media Group is funding an 
annual bursary of £25,000 for working or aspiring journalists under the age of 
27 who want to write about politics and government.

The successful candidate will serve three successive fellowships of 14 weeks 
each, starting in October this year, at the publications with which Howard was 
most closely associated: theTimes, the Observer and the New Statesman. 

Applicants – who should remember that Anthony Howard valued flair, imagination 
and wit – should propose a subject for a 5,000-word piece on British politics 
and government and outline how they would research that subject. They should 
also include an example of their writing, published or unpublished.

should send their proposal, an example of their writing (maximum 800 words) and 
a short CV, including contact details, to anthonyhowardaward@gmail.com
