To celebrate Ada Lovelace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/13/ada-lovelace-day-women-computing-60s>
 day – oh, Ada is just basically theworld’s first computer programmer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/12/ada-lovelace-exhibition-science-museum>
 – here’s alook at seven inspiring women in technology, either pioneers from 
the past who have shaped the current tech we often take for granted, or women 
currently working in Stem and making waves. Technology is still a sector with a 
vast gender imbalance, but these women prove how much technology could gain 
from sorting it out, and fast.

Sheryl Sandberg

The woman who introduced “lean in 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/13/lean-in-sheryl-sandberg-review>” 
to the cultural lexicon. Sandberg is the chief operating officer at Facebook, 
whose employee makeup is68% male 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/25/facebook-diversity-report-black-white-women-employees>
 according to June 2015 figures, and she previously worked for Google. Sandberg 
was included in the world’s100 most powerful people by Time 
<http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2112093,00.html>
 in 2012, the year she became the first women on Facebook’s board of directors. 
The magazine said she “understands intuitively the potential of social 
networking to create positive change on a grand scale”.

Joan Clarke

Brought recently to mainstream attention thanks to the Academy Award-winning 
biopic of Alan Turing, The Imitation Game 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-imitation-game>, Clarke was one of the 
team cracking codes and deciphering ciphers at Bletchley Park during the second 
world war.

Clarke, who was played by Keira Knightley in the feature film, was recruited 
into the Government Code and Cypher School in 1939 after studying at Cambridge.

Bletchley had thousands of women code breakers who, until recent years, had 
been overshadowed. Thankfully, now the likes of Clarke,Betty Webb and Mary Every
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/20/bletchley-park-women-meet-codebreakers-book-launch>
 are being given their due.

Radia Perlman

Perlman is sometimes referred to as the “mother of the internet” (which she 
does not like 
<http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2011/04/profile_of_radi.php>) 
because of her invention of “spanning-tree protocol” (STP). Put simply, SPT 
prevents repetition of information and action when a network is shared by one 
or more machines (known asbridge looping 
<http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/spanning-tree-protocol>).

Perlman, who studied at MIT and whose mother was a programmer, has registered 
more than 100 patents <http://patents.justia.com/inventor/radia-j-perlman>. 
Kinda lazy. She once told an interviewer she actually “hates” technology and 
gets annoyed when people ask her to fix their printer, for instance.

Speaking on advice she would give young engineers, Perlman said: “Start out 
with finding the right problem to solve. This is a combination of “what 
customers are asking for”, “what customers don’t even know they want yet” and 
“what can be solved with something simple to understand and manage”.

Hedy Lamarr


An actor by profession, Lamarr basically invented radio frequency-hopping 
<http://www.women-inventors.com/Hedy-Lammar.asp> on the side, when she was 
drafted into the war effort to “focus her efforts on countering torpedoes”, as 
you do. Along with George Antheil, Lamarr tweaked radio frequencies at sporadic 
intervals between transmission and reception, creating a system in which 
messages could not be easily intercepted.

In addition to being a glamorous 1940s Hollywood movie star and a radio 
innovating genius, Lamarr also once invented a variation on a carbonated soft 
drink and atraffic light

Zoe Quinn

One of the most prominent women in the games industry, Quinn developed the 
interaction fiction game,Depression Quest 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_Quest> for the web. You can play
