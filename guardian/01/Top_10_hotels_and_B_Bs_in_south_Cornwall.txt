Venton Vean, Penzance

Owners David and Philippa Hoyes admit to being guesthouse novices (they were 
London lawyers in a former life) but there's nothing amateur about their classy 
little B&B. In a quiet street, a hop and skip from the seafront, it has three 
immaculate bedrooms – think cornices, cast-iron fireplaces, white-painted 
floors, cool colours (greys, blues, aquamarines), contemporary furniture and a 
dash of vintage. You get cotton robes, homemade biscuits, natural Cornish 
toiletries and interesting breakfasts (try Mexican tortillas with hot salsa and 
fried eggs). A walk through sub-tropical Penlee Park (just opposite) brings you 
to the bars and restaurants of Penzance.

The Old Coastguard, Mousehole
 The Old Coastguard hotel, Mousehole, Cornwall 
The Inkin brothers (who also run the Gurnards Head near St Ives) took over 
this tired but classic hotel in the summer of 2011. They have since ripped out 
the starchy dining room and installed a relaxed brasserie-style restaurant and 
bar with a gastro pub vibe. A room makeover is in progress (and they have 
reduced the silly old prices) but some things will never change – such as the 
palm trees in the garden and the awesome sea views (from St Michael's Mount to 
St Clement's Isle to cute Mousehole harbour). A big plus is the high quality, 
sensibly-priced food. You can eat really well here for around £20 a head (main 
courses start at £10.25).

Highcliffe, Falmouth
 Highcliffe hotel, Falmouth 
On a main road into town, it's not the prettiest of houses, but this friendly, 
"contemporary" B&B deserves every one of its five stars. Each of the eight 
luxury rooms (including two stylish singles and a star-gazing penthouse suite) 
offers pocket-sprung mattresses, quality linen, iPod docks and power showers; 
some rooms have views of Pendennis Castle; one has a chandelier dangling over a 
free-standing slipper bath. There's a jolly little breakfast room (wake up to 
Baker Tom's organic breads,Kernow sausages <http://www.kernowsausages.com/> or 
a Highcliffe special – homemade pancakes or French toast with Cointreau). 
Falmouth's beaches, harbour and railway station are within easy walking 
distance.

Halzephron House, Gunwalloe, near Helston
 Halzephron House, Gunwalloe, Cornwall

Mounts Bay from the west coast of the Lizard peninsula. Stay in the Tower Room 
(with its own lounge and verandah), the Cabin (a cosy hideaway for two) or the 
Observatory (in the garden). Breakfast is cooked on an Aga and served at a 
communal table in the family kitchen. The Thorp's own Barefoot Cafe next door 
runs occasional pop-up nights (log fire, live music, guest chefs) or the
Halzephron Inn <http://www.halzephron-inn.co.uk/> is five minutes' walk down 
the hill. The coast path – right on your doorstep – takes you to beaches at

Lower Barn, Bosue, near St Austell
 Lower Barn B&B, Bosue, Cornwall 
Once part of the Heligan Estate, it was a disused cowshed in a field until 
Janie and Mike Cooksley turned it into a homely B&B. Four large rooms include 
the Hideaway (essence of beach hut in its own mini garden) and the Hayloft 
(split-level two-bedroom suite with wheelchair access); all nicely furnished 
and zinging with colour. Breakfasts feature Calenick Farm sausages and local 
free-range eggs. In the Shack the Cooksleys serve home-cooked dinners (by 
arrangement – just ask when you book) and in the Stable, they offer holistic 
therapies, a hot tub and a tipi treatment room. Heligan's Lost Gardens are a 
mile away.

Trevalsa Court, Mevagissey
 Trevalsa Court hotel, Cornwall 
This beautiful, slate-hung house – built in 1937 – overlooks Mevagissey bay 
from clifftop gardens that slope down to the South West Coast Path. As you'd 
expect, it's not cheap, but Trevalsa offers a couple of budget rooms (and, due 
to demand, they are thinking of adding another). The economy tariff won't buy 
you a sea view, but you will still get to enjoy the hotel's original oak 
panelling, open fires, glamorous restaurant (three courses from £24.50 per 
head), boats slipping across the bay at sunset, sea-gazing hut in the garden 
and the hotel's own deserted beach.

 "economy double" from £85, small double with sea view from £110 B&B

Botelet Farm B&B, Herodsfoot
 Botelet Farm B&B, Herodsfoot 
The Tamblyn family have been farming this middle-of-nowhere corner of Cornwall 
for nearly 200 years. And somewhere along the line, they seem to have got lost 
in a time warp. Clucking hens, brown paintwork, faded upholstery, flagstones, 
wood-smoke, scrubbed pine – it's almost as though the 21st century hasn't 
arrived (apart from the Wi-Fi, of course, and the occasional fashion shoot). 
Sleep in iron-frame beds or an ancient four-poster. Breakfast on homemade 
breads and Botelet's organic blueberries. Spend the day exploring the Fowey 
River from Lostwithiel's medieval castle down to Fowey harbour and the coast.
• 01503 220225, botelet.com <http://www.botelet.com>, from £35pp B&B (from 
Easter to late autumn)

Trussel Barn, St Keyne
 Trussel Barn, Cornwall 
Mike and Jo Lawrence's converted stone barn sits in seven acres of rolling 
farmland that dips down to the East Looe River – one of the most undiscovered 
corners of south Cornwall. They offer two king-size rooms, two singles, a 
self-contained apartment and, for breakfast, fresh breads, local eggs and bacon 
and fruit from their own polytunnel. The scenic branch line railway between 
Liskeard and Looe trundles through the wooded valley below. Mike, incidentally, 
is an expert on sustainable building materials (check out the straw bale hut in 
the garden).

Barclay House, Looe

The decor is not its strong point, but if you can turn a blind eye to the 
colour scheme (a palette of peppermint, sunflower and maroon), this relaxed, 
family-run hotel has a lot going for it – an award-wining restaurant 
specialising in fresh Looe Bay seafood, a heated outdoor pool, six acres of 
garden and a terrace overlooking the Looe Estuary. The Barclay also runs the 
excellentTrawlers on the Quay <http://trawlers-restaurant.co.uk> right next to 
Looe's busy fish market. In the gardens, there are timber-clad, self-catering 
cottages which are available for short breaks.
