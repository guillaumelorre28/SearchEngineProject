After the heartfelt farewells to Alan Rusbridger comes an equally heartfelt 
tip of the cap to Roger Alton, once features supremo at theGuardian, then 
editor of this paper, then editor of theIndependent and lately executive 
editor of theTimes

.

There’s no need, surely, to go on more commodiously about Rusbridger’s 
brilliance – except that it was his brilliant idea to put Alton in charge of the
Observer. But it does need to be said that Roger was, and is, one of 
journalism’s forces of nature: a fount of talent, professionalism, intuition – 
and fun.

Whenever you worked with him or for him, there were good times and great 
laughs. You were always eager to go into work, to see the sweat drip, to hear 
the undeleted expletives, and know that you’d been part of something special.
