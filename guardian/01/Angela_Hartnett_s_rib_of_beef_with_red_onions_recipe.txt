(Serves two)
2 tbsp olive oil
100g butter
4 small red onions, halved
1 rib of beef, 800g
1 head garlic, cloves unpeeled, but cut in half across
2 sprigs of thyme
Salt and pepper

Preheat oven to 200C /gas mark 6.

Add a dash of oil to a grill pan and a third of the butter. Allow it to 
bubble, then add the halved onions and a splash of water. Allow to cook 
for 10-15 minutes. As the water evaporates, keep adding further splashes and 
cook until the onions are soft.

Heat another grill pan, add a dash of oil and season the beef. Grill the steak 
on both sides until it has a nice chargrilled colour. Add the rest of the 
butter and the garlic, and continue to cook for a further four minutes, turning 
and basting the meat.

Transfer the meat to the oven in the same pan – or if your pan isn't 
ovenproof, you can use a hot oven tray and pour the butter and garlic on top.

Cook for a further five minutes for a medium steak, less if you would like it 
rare, and longer if your prefer it medium-to-well-done.

Serve with the onions, a green salad and vinaigrette.

• This article was amended on 19 February 2013. The original referred to the 
cut of beef as a rib-eye steak rather than a rib of beef. This has been 
corrected.
