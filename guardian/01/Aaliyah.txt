 One of the few things Aaliyah Haughton, who has died in a plane crash aged 22, 
had in common with other young American R&B singers was the regal custom of 
using only her first name. But in a musical sense, it was impossible to confuse 
her with the fluffy Brandys and Monicas. While they churned out the anodyne 
party tunes beloved of every teenage mall-rat, Aaliyah was a different 
proposition. A cutting-edge stylist with an aloof, sparse sound, she often 
forgot that the point of making pop music is to sell 10m copies per album, and 
erred instead on the side of artistry.
Her 1996 CD, One In A Million, recorded when she was just 17 (she had already 
released the aptly titled Age Ain't Nothing But A Number two years before 
that), was the first big R&B album to experiment with minimalism inspired by 
hip-hop.

If female soul stars had previously tended toward the Janet Jackson model of 
characterless big tunes, the album's self-containment gave them much to think 
about. It's now difficult to find an R&B record, even those by Brandy and 
Monica, that isn't in some way influenced by it.

As an artist who wrote little of her own material, Aaliyah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aaliyah> was at least partly the creation of 
male producers, who included the maverick Chicago singer R Kelly and fiercely 
hip producer Timbaland. It was Timbaland, along with Rodney Jerkins (credited 
with bringing Whitney Houston up to date), who saw the young singer's potential 
and matched her voice with understated beats on One In A Million.

But to attribute her success to them misses the point that what they did was 
nurture an already distinctive talent. Her best known song, Try Again, 
nominated for a Grammy this year, is a bewitching trinity of voice, melody and 
a lyric that urges, "Pick yourself up and try again."

Aaliyah was born in Brooklyn as disco was being succeeded by hip-hop. She was 
a child of both musical eras; at 11 she performed in Las Vegas with her aunt, 
Gladys Knight, but was also a rap fan while attending the High School for Fine 
And Performing Arts in Detroit, where she moved as a child. R Kelly discovered 
her - and, supposedly married her when she was only 15, though it was never 
confirmed - and produced her debut. She was welcomed by America's "urban" radio 
stations as a fresh young contender, a confidence that was repaid by One In A 
Million.

She notched up seven hits before she turned 18. For whatever reason, however, 
she didn't capitalise on that album's success. Rather than following standard 
R&B practice by bringing out another album quickly, she waited five years. When 
rock bands dawdle beyond reason, there's usually a drink or drug-fuelled 
explanation, but the dynamic, drug-free Aaliyah seemed an advert for clean 
living. It's likely she was simply busy with other projects, among them roles 
in the trendy kung-fu film Romeo Must Die and an Anne Rice vampire potboiler, 
The Queen Of The Damned. She was also signed to appear in both sequels to The 
Matrix.

The gap between One In A Million and Aaliyah, her latest album, cost her 
sales. The former sold two million, but despite contributions from Timbaland 
and rap potentate Missy Elliott, the latter has had a slower start.

Aaliyah was in the Bahamas filming a video for her new single, Rock the Boat, 
when a twin-engined plane carrying her and staff from her record company, 
Virgin, crashed. Eight others died.
