In the beginning you hardly notice them: little lapel buttons in purple, 
yellow and black to mourn the dead and a lost homeland. But then there are the 
posters, T-shirts, umbrellas, bumper stickers, even cakes, all bearing the same
forget-me-not flower 
<http://www.armenianchurch-ed.net/uploaded_files/tinymce/files/pdf/GenocideEmblemExplanationFlyer.pdf>
 designed to commemorate the tragedy of a nation.

It is the symbol of the centenary of the Armenian genocide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/armenian-genocide> of 1915, being marked 
this week in solemn ceremonies in Yerevan and wherever in the world this 
ancient people fled in the wake of the mass atrocities suffered in the dying 
days of the Ottoman empire.


This newly invented tradition, a poppy-like throwback to the killing fields of 
eastern Anatolia, has triggered complaints about commercialisation. But it has 
caught on. AcrossArmenia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/armenia>, in 
schools and homes, and as far away as the diaspora community of Glendale, 
California, children have picked up crayons and scissors to make their own 
paper flowers or have planted the real thing in remembrance of the horrors that 
beset their forebears.

Rosa and Tamara, Yerevan sisters of 10 and six, wrote a name on the back of 
their homemade forget-me-nots:Raphael Lemkin 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Lemkin>, the Polish-Jewish scholar who 
coined the word genocide in 1944 – and cited the Armenians as a seminal example.

The centenary on 24 April provides a rare opportunity to focus global 
attention on killings that were once notorious, then faded from view, were 
fought over in a vicious propaganda war, and are now widely seen as a crime on 
a monumental scale – and a grim precursor to the Nazi Holocaust. In their 
different ways, the pope and the reality TV star Kim Kardashian both 
highlighted the issue last week, much to the fury of Turks who continue to 
dispute the Armenian version of events.

Final preparations for Friday’s commemoration are under way at Armenia’s 
genocide memorial on the Tsitsernakaberd plateau, overlooking Yerevan. It 
features a bunker-like museum and a tapering grey stele pointing skywards like 
an accusing finger. To the south, on the Turkish side of the long-closed 
border, Mount Ararat beckons through spring clouds, snow-covered and majestic.

The big names on the day will include Vladimir Putin and François Hollande, 
leaders of the largest of the 20 countries to have formally recognised the 
genocide. But western governments that have not, including Britain, are sending 
low-profile officials to Yerevan, and far more senior representatives toTurkey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> to mark the centenary of the 
Gallipoli landings, the date deliberately and cynically chosen by President 
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – so furious Armenians believe – in order to sabotage 
their own ceremony.

“I am proud to be here and I understand why I am here,” said Milena Avetisyan, 
16, looking formal in black suit, white blouse and sensible pumps, standing 
with an honour guard of her classmates outside the memorial’s cone of basalt 
slabs, an eternal flame burning at its centre. “It is a call to the world to 
recognise the Armenian genocide. It is to show that we remember and demand.”

The slogan lies at the heart of the campaign for the Turkish state to 
recognise that its Ottoman predecessor annihilated up to 1.5 million Armenian 
citizens, starting on 24 April 1915 with the arrest of intellectuals in 
Constantinople and continuing with a centralised programme of deportations, 
murder, pillage and rape until 1922. The shadowy Teskilat e-Mahsusa (“special 
organisation”) drew up plans and sent coded, euphemistic telegrams to 
provincial officials and dispatched its victims on railway journeys to oblivion 
in the deserts of Iraq and Syria. Henry Morgenthau, the US ambassador, 
described the Turks as giving “a death warrant to a whole race”.

On 23 April, at Etchmiadzin, seat of the Armenian Apostolic church, the 
martyrs will be canonised collectively – renewing a tradition dating back 1,700 
years. “We have to liberate our own people from hostility and hatred,” 
explained Bishop Bagrat Galstanyan. “And we have to liberate the Turks, to 
cleanse themselves from the pain of genocide.”

It was at Etchmiadzin in 1965 – the 50th anniversary of the slaughter, a key 
moment of Armenian national awakening, and when many witnesses were still alive 
– that the bleached bones of the dead were brought from Deir ez-Zor in Syria 
for reburial.


Numerous centenary events, such as conferences, exhibitions and concerts, 
underline how closely this country’s identity and future are bound up with the 
bloody past. Raw emotion, competing narratives and an ongoing diplomatic crisis 
make for a difficult combination.

“International recognition is fine but, if Turkey doesn’t do it, then we won’t 
have the security we need,” said Tevan Poghosyan, an MP for the nationalist 
Heritage party. “It is a security issue because the genocide happened to us. It 
is our nation that lost its homeland and was scattered around the world. It is 
not just a historical issue.”

History does cast a long shadow. Modern Armenia won its independence in 1918, 
but was taken over by the Soviet Union two years later and only regained its 
freedom in 1991. Landlocked and poor, its 3 million people include many 
descendants of the survivors of the genocide, though far more of them live in 
the diaspora of 7 million to 10 million, concentrated in Russia, the US and 
France – a split that has had a powerful effect on the politics of 
commemoration and the closely linked question of the troubled relations between 
Yerevan and Ankara.

Scholars say denial is the last stage of the crime of genocide
Vigen Sargsyan, Armenian presidential adviser 
Turkey’s behaviour is seen as consistent with its traditional animosity 
towards the Armenians. The border has remained shut since 1993, part of the 
continuing stand-off overNagorno-Karabakh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/nagorno-karabakh-clashes-azerbaijan-armenia>
, the ethnic Armenian region of neighbouring Azerbaijan, in which Ankara 
supports Baku. That “frozen conflict” has heated up into a shooting war in the 
past year so the issue is live and dangerous. People and goods do get through 
from Turkey by air and by land via Georgia but the blockade is damaging to an 
already fragile economy and ties it uncomfortably closely to Russia.

“Turkey has engaged in a proactive policy of denial, and scholars say denial 
is the last stage of the crime of genocide,” said Vigen Sargsyan, the 
presidential adviser in charge of centennial events. “Genocide is based on 
xenophobia and it has a tendency to affect the current policy of the state that 
denies it. Turkey has an anti-Armenian policy. The burden of proof is with them 
to show that it does not.”

Independent Armenian voices readily acknowledge the changes that have taken 
place in Turkey, where liberal intellectuals, civil society and Kurdish groups 
accept that genocide occurred. Thousands signed the “We Apologise” petition in 
the spirit of the Armenian-Turkish writerHrant Dink 
<http://www.hrantdink.org/?Lang=en>, who was murdered in 2007. Memorial 
ceremonies will be held in Istanbul and elsewhere, and Turkish delegations will 
be in Yerevan on 24 April.Last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/turkey-erdogan-condolences-armenian-massacre>
 Erdoğan referred to the victims as “Ottoman citizens” and sent “condolences” 
to their descendants.

But his Gallipoli manoeuvre has been a crude reminder of the refusal of the 
Turkish state to go any further than what many in Yerevan dismiss as 
“repackaged denial”.

The cultivation of memory is presented as a national duty. There is a striking 
parallel with Israel, where the Nazi holocaust is seen as part of the state’s 
raison d’etre. Like Jerusalem’s Yad Vashem, Yerevan’s genocide memorial is 
invariably the first stop for visiting foreign VIPs – many of their names 
inscribed on plaques under the trees in its “alley of memory”.


New interactive exhibits are being installed so that an Armenian child of 
today can connect to one of his or her own age in those times of savagery and 
terror. “We try to avoid the most horrible photographs of human remains,” said 
Suren Manukyan, the museum’s deputy director, “or at least to use them on touch 
screens rather than on public display.”

It is not only the atrocities that are remembered

Individual memories do not need to be curated by the state. It is common to 
hear stories of a grandmother fleeing to the screams of men burning alive; of 
orphans blinded and girls abducted.

But it is not only the atrocities that are remembered. In Nerkin Sasnashen, a 
village of simple stone houses, unpaved roads and a ruined 7th-century 
monastery, locals talk animatedly about their roots in Sasun, a mountainous 
region of what is now Turkey’s Batman province and a stronghold of Armenian 
resistance to Turks and Kurds – who carried out a notorious massacre in 1894. 
The second word of the village’s name means “built by people from Sasun”.

Handfuls of earth from Sasun are thrown into graves and at one recent baptism 
the proud parents gave the priest consecrated oil brought from there. “We even 
name our children after the towns and villages of western Armenia,” said 
Andranik Shamoyan – his own first name recallingthe most celebrated of his 
people’s national heroes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andranik>. 


Arayan Hendrik, a leathery-faced 72-year-old sitting back after a festive 
lunch of kebab, lavash bread and vodka toasts, sang movingly of the beauty of 
Sasun in the dialect spoken there in 1915. “Our children dance the same dances 
as their great-grandparents did,” he said. “They are part of our history that 
we want to hand down to the next generations. They are a connection between us 
and the lands we left.”

Many have travelled to Turkey to seek their roots but say they find it an 
unsettling, emotionally wrenching experience. Others refuse to visit their 
homeland as tourists. If the border were open, it would be just a 90-minute 
drive from Yerevan to Ararat. As it is, the journey there, via Georgia, takes 
14 hours. Unlike Palestinians, few Armenians articulate a “right of return” to 
their lost patrimony. “It is not that people don’t dream about their land,” 
suggested Poghosyan. “But they do have a state now and they need to build it.”

We live in a small territory but we are a big nation
Hranush Hakobyan, Armenia's minister for the diaspora 
Armenian government policy does not include demands for territory or 
reparations, as organisations in the more militantly nationalist diaspora would 
like. Yerevan seeks normalisation of relations with Ankara, starting with the 
crucial reopening of the border, to promote reconciliation that it hopes will 
eventually bring genocide recognition – even if that takes decades.

Optimism peaked in 2009, when protocols brokered by the Swiss and endorsed by 
the US and EU were signed in Zurich, crucially with no mention of the horrors 
of 1915. But they were never ratified – because the Turks insisted on linking 
them to progress on Nagorno-Karabakh. It has been downhill ever since, 
relations now frozen in an atmosphere of deep mistrust. The vacuum is being 
filled by strident, anti-Turkish voices from the diaspora, and attitudes are 
hardening at home as well.

Talk of greater unity is rife. “We live in a small territory but we are a big 
nation,” said Hranush Hakobyan, minister for the diaspora. “Anyone who deals 
with us is dealing with 12 million Armenians.” The country’s entry to this 
year’s Eurovision song contest will be sung by a six-strong band – one singer 
each from the five continents of the diaspora and one from the republic. The 
title of the song is Don’t Deny.

“Nationalist tendencies are gaining the upper hand,” warned Vahram 
Ter-Matevosyan, a highly regarded historian of Turkey. “People feel that we 
tried to help the Turks to come to terms but they failed, so why should we 
trust them again?”


No one expects much to change after 24 April, even if Erdoğan comes up with 
another expression of qualified contrition that avoids the totemic G-word. 
There are signs, however, of a debate about the style of the genocide 
commemoration, dominated by the ubiquitous forget-me-not.

Armenian genocide. Photograph: PR 
“I was a bit critical of this campaign at first but it is the first time 
Armenians have associated themselves with a symbol,” said Ter-Matevosyan. “This 
is about modernising genocide discourse, a sort of rebranding. Now it is the 
fifth generation since the genocide so you do need to reach out to young people 
with a different message.”


But Tigran Matosyan, a sociologist, warned of “a ritual without reflection” 
that was not relevant to the country’s needs. “Armenia has lots of problems and 
I wish the centennial could be used as an opportunity to reflect on them,” he 
said. “Armenia wants to be a democracy, but it’s not. There’s huge social 
injustice as well. That’s not becoming for a people who suffered genocide.”

Isabella Sargsyan, who promotes Armenian-Turkish reconciliation, remembers her 
first meeting as a teenager with a Turk from Kars, her family’s ancestral home, 
and bursting into tears, lost for words. “It’s not that I am not sorry for the 
genocide,” she said. “I am. But I don’t like the way it is dealt with publicly. 
And it is also not the only thing that shapes my identity. The old diaspora is 
focused on the genocide. It’s an identity issue for them. We are citizens. The 
fact that we have this tiny piece of land is a miracle. The primary goal for 
the Republic of Armenia is to be a decent place for the people who live here.”

Still, time alone, it seems, cannot heal the open wounds of a century ago. 
Remembering is the easy part. Fulfilling the demand that goes with it is far 
harder. “Other genocides have been recognised, but ours has not been,” said 
Andranik Shamoyan. “It will be part of our lives always. You cannot just turn 
this page.”

mother and an Armenian-American father.
Kim Kardashian The 34-year-old US-born reality star’s late father, Robert, was 
Armenian.
Andre Agassi The ex-tennis player’s father is Iranian Armenian. An ancestor 
changed the name from Agassian to avoid persecution.
