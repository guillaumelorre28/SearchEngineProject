iPad Pro, which will be available from November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/09/apple-ipad-pro-129in-iphone-6s-event>
, will have a 10-hour battery life, and be priced from $799 (£520) in the US.

“This is the clearest expression of our vision of the future of personal 
computing, a simple multitouch piece of glass that instantly transforms into 
anything you want it to be,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive.

It includes a faster, more efficient A9X processor and is being launched, for 
the first time, withApple <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> Pencil 
– despite vigorous statements by now-deceased former chief executive Steve Jobs 
as recently as 2010 that the stylus is awkward and not as intuitive as a finger.


The iPad <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ipad> Pro is a product 
designed for illustrators, designers and editors who need maximum precision, 
Schiller explained.

 Tim Cook announces the release of the iPad Pro. 
Though widely leaked, Wednesday’s announcements beefed up Apple’s product line 
and the hope will be that investors’ confidence is bolstered after a rocky 
period for international markets.


The new Apple TV has been widely anticipated for several years; the original 
product launched in 2007 and has stayed static since a 2010 revamp selling over 
25m devices since launch. For the last two years, the Apple TV has been in need 
of feature upgrades to compete with rivalAmazon Fire TV 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/02/amazon-unveils-fire-tv-set-top-box-rival-google-apple>
 andGoogle Chromecast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/20/google-chromecast-review-streaming-stick>
 products, which introduced voice search and smart assistant funcationality in 
2014.

“TV has been standing still while mobile has been changing, led by iPhone and 
iPad,” said Cook. “We’re going to do something about that. Our vision for TV is 
simple and provocative: we believe the future of television is apps.”

The Apple TV 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/09/apple-tv-upgrade-app-store-iphone-6s-event>
, which will be available in the UK from late October, includes Apple’s voice 
command feature Siri, a touch-controlled remote and a simplified navigation 
that offers programmes initially from iTunes and Netflix, and US networks Hulu, 
HBO and Showtime. It will also have its own operating system, tvOS, with 
purpose-designed apps for the screen including games, shopping and sports.

Dan Cryan, a senior analyst at IHS, said: “Apple TV has graduated from being a 
‘hobby’ to being a fully-fledged product in its own right. The great strength 
of the new Apple TV is the connection to Apple’s existing ecosystem and in 
particular the App Store.


“The gaming element features are undoubtedly important but perhaps as 
important, it should make it much easier for the new Apple TV to offer local TV 
experiences for a truly global customer base.”

, with a 3D touch gesture that accesses extra features on screen, a new rose 
gold colour, faster processor and high resolution 4K video.


In a nod to ferocious competition against Google’s Android phones, Schiller 
also introduced a new import feature that makes it easier to copy content from 
Android phones, while Apple also invited rival firm Microsoft on stage to 
preview improvements to its Office apps.
