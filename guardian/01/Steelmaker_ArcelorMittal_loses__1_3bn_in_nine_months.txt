ArcelorMittal blamed cheap Chinese imports for depressing the price of steel 
as the world’s biggest steelmaker scrapped its annual dividend after losing 
$1.3bn (£860m) in the first nine months of 2015.

The company blamed unsustainably low export prices from China

 and customers delaying purchases for the net loss, which was 10 times bigger 
than the $131m loss recorded a year earlier. Sales fell by $11bn to $49.6bn, 
underlining the crisis in the steel industry.

Conditions deteriorated rapidly in the third quarter, when ArcelorMittal’s net 
loss was $711m – more than half the total for the year. ArcelorMittal, based in 
Luxembourg, wrote down the value of its steel stocks by $500m to reflect rapid 
falls in prices.

Aditya Mittal, the company’s finance director, said. “This is essentially the 
result of very low export prices out of China that are impacting prices 
worldwide.”

European steelmakers are struggling to cope with falling prices, cheap imports 
and weakened demand as the economy slows in China, the biggest user and 
producer of the metal.

British companies have partly blamed dumping of cheap steel by China for a 
series of plant closures that has left one in six UK steelworkers facing 
redundancy. Tata Steelslashed the value of its UK business by £862m

 on Thursday after announcing plans last monthto cut 1,200 jobs

. The writedown effectively made Tata’s UK operation worthless for accounting 
purposes.

ArcelorMittal, which makes car parts in the Midlands and has operations around 
the world, reduced its annual forecast for earnings before interest, tax, and 
other items to as low as $5.2bn from a target of $6bn to $7bn. It will suspend 
its annual dividend to save $360m and reduce investment spending and operating 
costs.

Before an emergency meeting of European Union ministers scheduled for Monday 
to discuss the steel crisis, ArcelorMittal said politicians needed to move more 
quickly to stop the dumping of cheap Chinese steel in Europe.

Lakshmi Mittal, ArcelorMittal’s chairman and chief executive, said: “While we 
are confident our actions are the right ones, there are also important issues 
for governments to address, specifically relating to unfair trade. We are 
encouraged by various examples of trade action being initiated in response to 
dumping, but the process needs to be faster in order to be fully effective.”

Sajid Javid, the business secretary, will represent Britain at the steel 
summit in Brussels, after receiving criticism for a slow response to the 
crisis. The UK government was also accused of failing to complain about cheap 
Chinese steel exports when China’s premier, Xi Jinping, visited the UK last 
month.

ArcelorMittal said imports in Europe, including from China and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States>, were at a 
record high and were still rising, meaning European steelmakers would struggle 
to benefit from a recovery in demand as pricing pressure continued next year.


“This is not an economic crisis, it is not a volume crisis, it is an import 
crisis,” Aditya Mittal said. “Our core markets of Europe and Nafta [North 
American free trade agreeement] are still growing.”
