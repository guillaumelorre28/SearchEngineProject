There's a huge row bubbling about the "kettling" of Aaron Porter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/aaron-porter>, the NUS president, by 
students in Glasgow at the weekend.

Glasgowoccupied <http://twitter.com/#!/glasgowoccupied> tweeted:
 "We kettled Aaron Porter outside the Labour youth conference earlier. Follow 
#porterwatch <http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23porterwatch>." 
And follow #porterwatch we did. Pics were posted on Facebook 
<http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23porterwatch>.

Then @pollytoynbee  <http://twitter.com/#!/glasgowoccupied>tweeted@
 "Are you sure faction fighting in the student movement is the best way to 
fight the government cuts?" 
And @EmilyMaryDavis <http://twitter.com/#!/EmilyMaryDavis> said:
 "Get the bullying out of our campaigns against education cuts please. 
#porterwatch." 
And now we have @Kirsteen Fraser declaring:
 "#porterwatch has backfired @glasgow_uni  <http://twitter.com/#!/glasgow_uni>
anti-cuts and occupation groups now splintering over treatment of@aaronporter  
<http://twitter.com/#!/AaronPorter>and future strategy." 
In the face of reports that at one point he was hiding in the ladies' loos, 
@aaronporter <http://twitter.com/#!/AaronPorter> himself is maintaining a 
dignified silence.

Never mind the politics, feel the love

• It's Valentine's Day, and we're grateful to the THE for this link to 
research on the state of the modern marriage 
<http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=415165&c=1>
:
 "No Valentine's Day would be complete without academic insights into the 
nature of love in modern Britain. Among the research released this 14 February 
is a study that suggests that, despite rising divorce rates, the majority of UK 
couples are happy in their relationship." 
• Thanks also to @pollycurtis <http://twitter.com/#!/pollycurtis> for tweeting:
 "Ed Balls in the Times on his and Yvette's song, Elvis's Can't Help Falling 
in Love. 'We'd drive along embankment singing the harmonies'." 
• There's a public lecture at Brunel University 
<http://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/events/public-lecture/event-42302> 
tonight at 7 entitled "What's Love Got to Do With It? The New Dynamics of Human 
Attraction".

• Laurie Penny, aka activist blogger @pennyred 
<http://api.twitter.com/#!/PennyRed>, writes in the Guardian:
 "Whether you are single or attached, Valentine's Day can be the loneliest day 
of the year. The saccharine sentiment of the annual Hallmark holiday puts 
pressure on all of us: couples dutifully shell out time and money over kitsch – 
cuddly mating rituals that paralyse real passion – while the rest of us, 
however contented, nurse a sense of bitter isolation." 
• The lovely and temperate researcher @DaintyBallerina 
<http://twitter.com/#!/DaintyBallerina> has posted David Tennant reading 
Shakespeare sonnets 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-cuNXsqJZA&feature=youtu.be>. Much better than 
chocolate.

Education news from the Guardian and Observer

• Riazatt Butt is preparing a story about a Muslim school that has shut early 
for half-term ahead of a Dispatches programme to be shown tonight on Channel 4. 
In the meantime, this is theMail's account of what the programme will show 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1356361/Shame-Britains-Muslim-schools-Secret-filming-shows-pupils-beaten.html?ITO=1490>
.

• Jeevan Vasagar reports on a NUS survey that shows the time university 
students spend in direct contact with lecturers has fallen 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/feb/13/university-students-teaching-hours-tuition-fees>
 over the past year, with the sharpest decreases in medicine and engineering.

• The NAHT, the union representing headteachers, says its members are prepared 
to take industrial action 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/feb/13/headteachers-industrial-action-threat-pensions>
 if ministers approve sweeping changes to public sector pensions. The union has 
carried out a survey of its members, and found 64% of respondents backed some 
sort of industrial action to retain their pension scheme.

• Cuts to Esol provision are causing anguish 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/feb/13/english-language-teaching-immigrants-cutbacks>
 for immigrants trying to learn English so that they can make a life for 
themselves in the UK. Shalina Parveen, who came from Bangladesh 10 years ago, 
tells Toby Helm:
 "I want to do a child care course. I really want to do it. But I have to 
improve my English to get accepted."

"You have to speak English, because it helps with everything. If you want to 
go to the doctor, or if people ring you. It makes you feel more relaxed in the 
community." 
Education news from around the web

Michael Gove's perky reaction to the news that a judge had ruled his 
cancellation of the school building programme an "abuse of power"  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/feb/11/gove-school-building-court>was 
the subject of an interestingblog from a teacher called Pencilandpapertest 
<http://pencilandpapertest.wordpress.com/2011/02/11/how-abusing-power-can-raise-the-spirits/>
:
 "Sounding like a football manager who looks for the positives after a defeat 
to nil a long way from home, he says: "I am delighted that the judge has ruled 
in my favour".

"To go with his peculiar interpretation of making a decision that was deemed 
to be both unlawful and an abuse of power, Gove chooses to add an unpleasant 
whiff of eau-de-gloat, picking out the following for our delectation: 'No-one 
should gain false hope from this decision'." 
But Tim Montgomerie, writing in the Telegraph, says the high court's decision 
must not knock the education secretary off course -his reforms are too important
 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/8320668/Michael-Goves-school-of-hard-knocks.html>
.

• The Telegraph also has a piece by Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, 
calling for anend to the "unearned Master's degree"  
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8318601/Time-for-Oxbridge-unearned-Masters-degree-to-go.html>
at Oxford and Cambridge to go:
 "Incredibly, the practice of converting a bachelor's degree straight into an 
MA with no exams, no extra academic study and no tuition fee sees around 3000 
Oxbridge graduates able to list an impressive looking postgraduate 
qualification on their CVs each year for no more than a £10 admin charge.

"With 200,000 students typically spending a year's full-time study to earn a 
'real' MA degree, it is highly unfair to perpetuate this fast-track award 
merely on the assumption that a BA (Hons) from these two institutions justifies 
a complimentary equivalent award." 
• The Mail carries the news that Eton plans a "mini version 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1356473/Camerons-Eton-plan-Mini-version-public-school-wont-cost-penny.html?ITO=1490>
 of the top public school which won't cost pupils a penny to attend". Actually 
it turns out that the head, Tony Little, is merely "involved in advising" on 
how to provide free boarding facilities at a school in Holyport, near 
Maidenhead.
