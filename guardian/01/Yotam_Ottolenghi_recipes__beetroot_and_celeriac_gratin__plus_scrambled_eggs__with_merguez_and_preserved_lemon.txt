Beetroot and celeriac gratin (V)

Just right for the season – warm, comforting and colourful. Either boil or 
roast the beetroots. Serves six.

500ml double cream
1 medium onion, peeled and quartered
20g thyme sprigs, leaves picked but also keep the stems 
2 bay leaves
6 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed
Shaved skin of 1 large lemon
8 whole cloves
Salt and white pepper
4-5 medium beetroots (700g), boiled, peeled and sliced 2mm thick
1 large 900g celeriac, peeled and sliced widthways 2mm thick 
100g hard mozzarella, grated
150g extra mature cheddar, grated

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Pour the cream into a medium saucepan 
and add the onion, thyme stems, bay, garlic, lemon skin, cloves, a teaspoon of 
salt and a teaspoon of white pepper. Gently bring the cream to a boil, then 
remove from the heat. Set aside to infuse for at least 10 minutes, then strain.

Scatter a third of the beetroot and celeriac on the base of a 27cm x 18cm 
baking dish or high-sided roasting tray. Pour over a few spoonfuls of cream and 
sprinkle a third of the cheese and thyme leaves on top. Arrange another layer 
of vegetables followed by a little cream and another third of the cheese and 
thyme. Place the final layer of vegetables on top, pour over the remaining 
cream, holding back the last of the cheese and thyme leaves, and gently press 
down to level.

Cover with foil and bake for 50 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 
160C/320F/gas mark 2½, remove the foil and bake for 20 minutes more. Sprinkle 
over the last of the cheese and thyme, and bake for another 15 minutes, until 
the cheese is golden brown and the vegetables are cooked through. Leave to sit 
in a warm place for five to 10 minutes before serving.

Scrambled eggs with merguez and preserved lemon

Tunisia, a country of which I knew very little before last summer, was another 
stop onmy Mediterranean journey for More 4 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca5duADS0Nk>. I was bowled over by the deft and 
complex use of spices, and by this gutsy, spicy cuisine which isn't shy of 
using lots of components in one dish, all loud, all colourful and all competing 
for attention. Cumin is a key spice, as is caraway, while aniseed surprised me 
by its popularity. Aniseed or fennel seed is also a key spice in the local 
merguez sausages. Serves four.

1 tbsp olive oil
1 small onion, peeled, thinly sliced
200g charlotte potatoes, peeled and sliced ½cm thick
150g merguez sausages, sliced on an angle 1cm thick
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 tsp caraway seeds
½ tsp ground turmeric
2 tsp harissa paste
½ tsp tomato paste
8 medium eggs
50ml double cream
Salt and pepper
10g preserved lemon, flesh and skin, finely chopped
2 tbsp chopped coriander or parsley

Put a large sauté pan on a medium to high heat, add the oil and cook the onion 
for five minutes to soften. Add the potato, sausage, garlic, caraway, turmeric, 
harissa and tomato paste, and fry for two minutes. Pour over 100ml water and 
simmer for eight minutes, until the potato and sausage are cooked and the water 
has evaporated (add a little more water if you need to cook it longer).

Whisk the eggs and cream with a quarter-teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Pour 
the eggs over the hot potato mix, reduce the heat to low and gently stir until 
just cooked. Stir through the preserved lemon, taste for seasoning and serve 
sprinkled with coriander or parsley.
