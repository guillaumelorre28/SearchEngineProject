The Global Radio <https://www.theguardian.com/media/globalradio> boss, Ashley 
Tabor, today said he has not had any conversations with Chris Moyles after 
reports last week linking the BBC Radio 1 breakfast presenter with a move to 
Global-owned Capital.

Tabor, the Global Radio founder and Global Group chief executive, said a move 
for Moyles, who has recently signed a new one-year contract with Radio 1, did 
not fit in with the commercial radio group's strategy on talent.

"I want to put that one to bed," Tabor told the Radio Festival in Salford today
 <http://www.radioacademy.org/events/radio-festival-2010/festival-radio-2010/>.

"We haven't had any conversations with Chris about joining us. If you look at 
what we did with Heart – [hiring presenters such as] Emma Bunton and Jason 
Donovan, they are people who have not done radio before and we are bringing 
them into the sector. That is more our strategy at Global," he added.

Reports last week linked Moyles with a move to Capital, which will relaunch as 
a national station next year. Moyles, the longest-serving breakfast DJ in Radio 
1's history, previously worked at Capital and is a former flatmate of Tabor.
