Asking people to soak beans overnight in cold water often gets me into, well, 
hot water. To be honest, it’s not a frustration I fully understand: apart from 
the need to think ahead, the effort required to run a tap over some dried beans 
in a pan is no more than the effort required to open a few cans of the 
pre-cooked variety.

The advantages of starting out with dried beans, however, I do understand. It 
means you can cook the beans just as you need them for a particular dish; 
canned beans don’t give you anywhere near the same control, because they’re 
already cooked and soft (though that’s not to say I don’t resort to tinned 
beans when the occasion demands). If you want very soft and yielding beans, for 
example for crushing or blitzing into a dip, spread or soup, cook them almost 
to the point of collapse. If, on the other hand, you want them whole but with a 
bite – for a salad, say – just take them off the heat sooner. And if you want 
them whole but nice and soft, that’s a different cooking time again.

When it comes to butterbeans, however, things are complicated by the fact that 
the time they take to cook can vary hugely from batch to batch – it all depends 
on how old and what size they are – so test every 20 minutes or so. (I often 
add a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda to the soaking water, too, because it 
helps soften the skins and so cuts down on cooking time.)

As with so many things in the kitchen, cooking with dried beans is just a case 
of a little organisation. The rewards are more than worth the extra time.

Butterbean mash with padrón peppers and jalapeño sauce

Bean purees are a comforting way to start any meal. Serves four.

300g dried butterbeans, soaked overnight in plenty of water and 1 tsp 
bicarbonate of soda
1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced
200ml olive oil
1 small preserved lemon, skin and flesh finely chopped, seeds discarded
1 tbsp lemon juice, plus 2 tsp to serve
Flaky sea salt and black pepper
500g padrón peppers
¼ tsp each cumin, caraway and coriander seeds, all lightly toasted and roughly 
crushed

For the jalapeño sauce
35g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
15g parsley leaves, roughly chopped
2 jalapeño chillies, deseeded and roughly chopped
½ tsp cumin seeds, lightly toasted and roughly ground
¼ tsp caraway seeds, lightly toasted and roughly ground
⅛ tsp caster sugar
1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed
2 tbsp olive oil

Drain the beans, put them in a large saucepan and cover with plenty of fresh 
water. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently for between 45 minutes and an hour, 
skimming off any impurities and checking the texture of the beans every 20 
minutes or so, until completely soft.

While the beans are cooking, put all the ingredients for the sauce in a food 
processor, and add half a teaspoon of salt and three tablespoons of water. 
Blitz to a rough paste, then tip into a bowl and cover with clingfilm.

Once the beans are cooked, drain them and put in a food processor; retain the 
cooking water. Put the garlic clove in a small pan with three tablespoons of 
oil, and cook over a medium-high heat for two minutes, until the garlic starts 
to colour. Pour the garlic and oil over the beans, add the preserved lemon, 
lemon juice, a teaspoon and a half of salt, a good grind of black pepper and 
100ml of the bean cooking water. Blitz to a smooth puree, then transfer to a 
medium saucepan: before serving, you’ll reheat this gently, adding a little 
more cooking water if needed.

Heat the remaining olive oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high flame, then 
fry the peppers in batches for a minute or two (take care, because they will 
spit), stirring frequently, until golden and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon 
and put in a medium bowl while you repeat with the remaining peppers. Once all 
the peppers are fried, sprinkle them with half a teaspoon of salt and set aside.

Spread the warmed-through butterbeans over a large platter (or between four 
smaller plates). Spoon over the sauce, top with the peppers and sprinkle with 
the crushed, toasted spices. Squeeze over the remaining two teaspoons of lemon 
juice and serve.

Bkeila

This Tunisian condiment is pretty magical. You can add it to most cooked 
legumes and vegetables, as well as to long-cooked stews such as the oxtail one 
that follows, to which it imparts an intensely rich, savoury flavour. It is 
also a good one to play “guess the ingredients” when you have friends round. 
It’s spinach, yes, but not like you’ve ever known it, because it’s cooked down 
for over an hour and a half. These quantities make enough to fill a 320g jar, 
which will keep in the fridge for weeks.


20g parsley leaves, roughly chopped
10g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
Salt
1kg spinach leaves, stalks discarded and leaves washed 
250ml olive oil

Put a large saucepan on a high heat and add the parsley, coriander and a 
quarter-teaspoon of salt. Add the spinach in three to four batches, stirring in 
the next lot once the previous has wilted. Leave to cook and wilt further for 
10 minutes, stirring frequently, until dark green, then turn down the heat to 
medium and cook for 30 minutes more, stirring occasionally and breaking up the 
leaves. Turn down the heat to low and cook for another 30 minutes, stirring as 
before, until the mix has turned into a dry, green paste. Don’t worry if it 
starts sticking to the bottom of the pan: just use the spoon to scrape it off 
as you go.

Increase the heat to medium and add 50ml oil. Fry the spinach paste for a 
minute, stirring continuously, almost until it starts to burn, then add another 
50ml oil and repeat, until all of the oil has been added. Turn down the 
temperature to low and leave to fry slowly for 30 minutes, until you are left 
with a very dark green, almost black oily paste that’s grainy and crisp. 
Transfer to a bowl or jar, seal and keep in the fridge.

Guaranteed to convert you to bkeila. Serves six. 

2 tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, peeled and cut into 3cm-wide wedges
1.5kg oxtail pieces
Salt and black pepper
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
2 cinnamon sticks
1 lemon, skin thinly shaved into 8 or 9 long, thin strips
150g butterbeans, soaked in cold water overnight with 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
4 tbsp bkeila (see previous recipe)
350g basmati rice
25g unsalted butter

To serve
Finely grated zest of 1 small lemon, plus 2 tsp juice
10g parsley leaves, roughly chopped
40g pine nuts, toasted and roughly crushed

Heat the oven to 160C/320F/gas mark 2½. On a high flame, heat a tablespoon of 
oil in a large, ovenproof saucepan for which you have a lid. Fry the onion for 
eight minutes, stirring often, until soft and slightly charred, then transfer 
to a small bowl and add the remaining oil to the pan. Turn down the heat to 
medium-high, add the oxtail pieces, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of 
pepper, and fry for 10 minutes, turning regularly, until golden-brown all over. 
Add the garlic, cinnamon, lemon skin, drained butterbeans, half the bkeila, 1.2 
litres of water and half a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil and skim off any 
scum. Cover and transfer to the oven for four hours, stirring every hour or so, 
until the liquid has reduced to a thick sauce and the oxtail is tender.

Set aside to cool for an hour, then lift out the oxtail pieces. Skim off and 
discard the fat from the surface. Pick the meat off the bones, then return it 
to the pan; discard the bones, cinnamon and lemon skin. If the stew needs 
thickening, put it on a high heat and reduce for a few minutes until thick.

Put the rice in a medium saucepan for which you have a lid, add the butter and 
a third of a teaspoon of salt, and cover with 530ml cold water. Bring to a boil 
on a high heat, then turn the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 10 
minutes. Take off the heat and set aside, covered, for five minutes. Meanwhile, 
mix together the lemon zest, parsley and pine nuts.

Gently reheat the stew, then stir through the remaining bkeila and two 
teaspoons of lemon juice. Divide the rice between four plates, spoon over the 
stew and top with the zest, parsley and pine nut mix.
