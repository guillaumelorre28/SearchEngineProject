SABMiller is in demand suddenly, up more than 5% on talk of a possible deal 
with Anheuser-Busch InBev.

Talk of an $80bn offer from InBev for SABMiller 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sabmiller> to create a company brewing a 
third of the world's beer has seen SAB jump 113.5p to 2213.5p. SAB is currently 
in the process of buying Australia's Fosters for $10.2bn.

The story, which has done the rounds before, appears to have originated in a 
blog post by a Brazilian journalist 
<http://colunistas.ig.com.br/guilhermebarros/2011/10/06/ab-inbev-negocia-uma-das-maiores-fusoes-da-historia/>
. With some scepticism in the City SAB shares have come off their highest 
level, having touched Â£23.23.
