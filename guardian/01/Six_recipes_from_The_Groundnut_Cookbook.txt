Groundnut soup

Jacob: We’re accustomed to the word “soup” being used interchangeably with 
meat- and vegetable-laden stews or sauces that serve as an accompaniment to a 
staple, such as pounded yam. This recipe has been tweaked to just a liquid 
soup, which works to whet the appetite and isn’t too filling. We add a stick of 
celery for scooping and crunching.


Serves 4
onions 2
carrot 1, large
celery 4 sticks
groundnut oil 3 tbsp
white pepper ½ tsp
Scotch bonnet pepper 1
tomato puree 1 tbsp
smooth peanut butter 2 level tbsp
hot vegetable or chicken stock 1l
sea salt flakes ½ tsp
black pepper a pinch

Finely dice the onions, carrot and 2 of the celery sticks.

Heat the groundnut oil in a large non-stick heavy-bottomed pan. Add the onion, 
carrot, celery and white pepper and cook over a medium heat with the Scotch 
bonnet (pierced with a sharp knife to ensure that the flavours seep out 
steadily) for 15 minutes, stirring at least every 5 minutes.

Add the tomato puree and cook for a further minute. Stir in the peanut butter 
and leave to cook for another minute.

Now add the stock – it’s important to add it gradually, stirring all the time. 
This helps the elements in the soup to meld well. Once all the stock has been 
added, cover with a lid and cook for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Remove the Scotch bonnet pepper before blending with a hand blender for 2-3 
minutes. Aim not to blend too heavily, as the soup can become too creamy (for 
our liking…).

Top and tail the remaining 2 celery sticks, then, using a vegetable peeler, 
nick the ends and pull out any thick fibres. Pour the soup into bowls, then 
halve the celery sticks and place one in each bowl, resting on the edge. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve hot.

 Pan fried okra 
Jacob: This is a truly fantastic and simple way to cook okra. It doesn’t get 
slimy in the way that puts many people off, but you get a real sense of the 
flavour of okra enhanced by lime and honey.


Serves 4
okra 400g
chilli oil 2 tbsp
salt ¼ tsp
lime ½
runny honey 1 heaped tsp

Wash the okra, trim the top of the stalks and the very tips (although not the 
entire end) and dry with kitchen paper. Halve each okra lengthways.


Heat the chilli oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the okra 
and cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until it has softened slightly 
with some dark patches and begins to wilt slightly.

Remove from the heat, add the salt, squeeze over the lime juice and drizzle 
with honey. Toss and serve hot.

Duval: People make jollof in different ways, incorporating preferred cooking 
techniques and local ingredients to their personal recipes, similar to how a 
paella or biryani might adapt to different regions or local traditions. 
Something that distinguishes the jollof that I am most familiar with is the 
delicious meat sauce that accompanies it. The sauce ingredients echo those in a 
traditional jollof rice, and it’s banging with chicken.


Serves 4
onions 4
red peppers 3
small whole chicken 1 (about 1kg)
salt 2 tsp
black pepper 1 tsp
fresh thyme leaves 1 tsp
olive oil 50ml
Scotch bonnet pepper 1
fresh tomatoes 2
garlic 4 cloves
tomato puree 2 tbsp
vegetable stock 200ml

Finely slice the onions and red peppers. Chop the chicken into 12 pieces, skin 
them and trim off any fat. Using your hands, mix the chicken with the salt, 
pepper and thyme.

Fry the chicken pieces in the oil with a whole Scotch bonnet pepper on a 
medium heat for 15 minutes, turning them every 4 minutes. Ensure each piece has 
room to move. Once the chicken is nicely browned, remove from the pan and put 
to one side.

Add the onions and red peppers to the pan and fry them for 20 minutes, 
stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, bring a small pan of water to the boil. Gently slit the skins of 
the tomatoes and drop them into the boiling water. When the skin begins to come 
away from the flesh, take them out and peel away the skin with your hands.

Crush the garlic and finely chop the skinned tomatoes. Stir the garlic, 
tomatoes and tomato puree into the pan of sauce, then turn the heat down to low 
and cook for 10 minutes.

Return the chicken to the pan, pour in the stock and cook for a further 15 
minutes. Taste and season with salt if necessary. Serve hot.

Folayemi: Tamarind is usually sold in three forms – pods, blocks and 
concentrate. I strongly suggest that you use the concentrate for this marinade. 
It’s much easier to use than pods and blocks, and it keeps for a long time too.


If you do have fresh tamarind pods, crack the shells and remove the case and 
the fibrous veins that surround the sticky pulp. Refrigerating makes them easy 
to peel. You can use pork loin chops for this recipe, but the shoulder is 
better because of the marbling of fat that run through it.

This tamarind marinade can also be used to coat cubed butternut squash before 
roasting it until sticky and caramelised.

Serves 6
pork shoulder chops 800g
spring onions 6
carrots 2, large

For the marinade
(Makes about 400ml)
tamarind concentrate 4 tbsp
clear honey 100g
fresh blueberries 500g, mashed
garlic granules 2 tbsp
salt 2 tbsp
smoked paprika 1 tbsp
sumac 1 tbsp
coarse black pepper 1 tbsp
extra virgin olive oil 1 tbsp
balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp

Put all the marinade ingredients into a large bowl and stir well. Add the 
chops and cover with the marinade. Refrigerate for 2 hours.


Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and roast the pork on the middle shelf for 
30 minutes, then turn the oven to a medium grill setting.

Remove the meat from the oven and slice it into long 1cm wide strips. Return 
the strips to the roasting tray with their juices, and finish them under the 
grill for a final 10 minutes. The marinade will concentrate and it will become 
even darker and stickier.

While the meat is grilling, finely slice the spring onions and finely grate 
the carrots. Garnish the pork and serve with noodles.

Jacob: I became fond of chicory, or endive as it’s called in France, while 
living in Paris. They were alluring in the markets and I loved how crunchy and 
bitter they were. The dates make for a bittersweet salad and the dressing 
marries the two perfectly.

Serves 4
chicory 2 heads
dates 4, stones removed
English mustard 1 tsp
tahini 1 tsp
clear runny honey 1 tsp
lemon juice of 1
fine sea salt ½ tsp
olive oil 4 tbsp

Wash and halve the chicory, removing any blemished areas. Remove the core at 
the base and separate the leaves.


Chop the stoned dates into small cubes by halving, cutting into strips and 
dicing. Working with wet hands prevents the dates from sticking.

Mix the mustard, tahini, honey, lemon juice and salt in a small bowl. 
Gradually add the olive oil, stirring as you go until it is well combined.

Add more oil or a little water if a thinner dressing is desired. Toss the 
dates and chicory with 3 or 4 tablespoons of dressing, and serve.

Duval: This simple salad is light, fresh and tactile. It goes very well with 
fish. Kohlrabi can be visually intimidating but it is an easy ingredient to 
use. If you can’t get hold of it, you can use broccoli stalks or turnips as a 
substitute. It’s important to search for a very hard, green, unripe mango to 
achieve a crunchy salad.


Serves 4
kohlrabi 1 (400g)
green mango 1 (400g)

Trim the stalks of the kohlrabi and peel off the skin. Make sure to remove 
enough skin so that you are left with just the flesh of the vegetable. The area 
just underneath the skin is quite tough.

Cut the kohlrabi into thin slices roughly 3mm wide. Take a few slices at a 
time, turn them on their side, and cut them into long strips. Put to one side.

Peel the mango. Cut off the sides of the mango and remove as much flesh from 
the stone as possible. Cut the flesh into long thin slices the same width as 
the kohlrabi. Turn a few slices on their side at a time and cut into long 
strips.

Toss the mango and kohlrabi together and serve.
