From former heroin addict Sam Willetts to the hit performance poet Kate 
Tempest, they are the up-and-coming new poets who have been named as the Carol 
Ann Duffys and Simon Armitages of the future. The Poetry Book Society has 
released its once-in-a-decade list ofNext Generation poets 
<http://poetrybooks.co.uk/projects/51/>, which has in the past tipped names 
from Duffy and Armitage to Alice Oswald and Don Paterson for future success.

The 20 new names, said the poetry organisation which was founded by TS Eliot 
in 1953, are expected to “dominate the poetry landscape of the coming decade”. 
More than half of them are women, from Tempest, the 27-year-old south London 
performance poet whose spoken-word theatre show Brand New Ancients won her the
Ted Hughes award for innovation in poetry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/27/kate-tempest-ted-hughes-poetry-prize>
 last year, to 66-year-old Annie Freud. Daughter of Lucian Freud, she writes in 
her second collection, The Mirabelles: “Do we need to know why the child is 
laughing? / Or indeed that she is the artist’s daughter? / Not in the least. // 
What matters is that we register her presence / with the greatest possible 
immediacy: / the inexplicable human gorgeousness.”

According to the Poetry Book Society, “women look set to lead the charge” when 
it comes to the next decade of poetry. Judge and poetClare Pollard 
<http://clarepollard.wordpress.com/> said she had been looking for poets “who 
were doing something new: tackling fresh subject matter, taking both emotional 
and literary risks”, and “female poets seem to be particularly fearless at the 
moment, with names such as Emily Berry and Melissa Lee-Houghton shaking up and 
reinvigorating the poetry scene”.

The announcement makes something of a red letter day for Kate Tempest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kate-tempest>, who the night before was also 
nominated for the Mercury prize – given to what its judges deem to be the best 
British album of the year – for her album Everybody Down, a hip-hop concept 
album about three people adrift in the city.

The selection of what the Poetry Book Society believes is the best of the 
emerging poets from the UK and Ireland who published their first collection of 
poetry within the last 10 years also includes Willetts, whoseNew Light for the 
Old Dark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/18/new-light-old-dark-willetts> is 
the author’s poetic response to the years he was homeless and addicted to 
heroin. “I’m back in a basement, / heartsick, digging for a vein in February / 
as in a February gone and a February / still to come, spitting prayers through 
the tourniquet / in my teeth, licking up tears and pleading / for my blood to 
plume up in the barrel, please,” he writes.

Willetts is joined by Forward prize winner Daljit Nagra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/daljit-nagra>, the Granta best young 
novelist Adam Foulds, TS Eliot prize winner Jen Hadfield and 12 other poets 
whom chair of judges and poet Ian McMillan said were “the visible and vocal 
evidence that poetry is on the crest of the wave at the moment”.

“What a fantastic list”, said McMillan, who was joined on the judging panel by 
the poets Caroline Bird, Robert Crawford, Pollard and Paul Farley. “We are 
going through a really fantastic period for poetry and these writers show the 
confidence poetry has at the moment. It is everywhere – in festivals, open mic 
nights, on the internet.”

The Poetry <https://www.theguardian.com/books/poetry> Book Society has made 
two previous selections of New Generation poets: in 1994, its selection 
included Armitage, John Burnside, Michael Donaghy, Duffy, Lavinia Greenlaw, 
Kathleen Jamie, Paterson and Glyn Maxwell. In 2004, it highlighted names from 
Patience Agbabi to Sophie Hannah, Oswald, Pascale Petit, Robin Robertson and 
Owen Sheers.

The latest selection, according to McMillan, “will be leading our national 
cultural conversation for many years to come”.

“In this group of writers we find an exhilarating mix of style and subject, 
reflecting a truly diverse range of voices: poetry is in excellent hands,” he 
said. “The quality of these collections was hugely impressive but not 
surprising – most of these poets have been paying their dues for years now on 
the events circuit and cutting their teeth with short pamphlets. In this way 
the poetry scene differs from fiction where you often see debut novelists 
appearing seemingly out of the blue. Poets are made to prove themselves long 
before their first full collection is ever published.”

Pollard said she had been “struck by how many of the collections are in fact 
sequences, heralding a return to book-length narratives: long-poems”, adding: 
“There are some incredible storytellers in this list, with tales about family, 
loss, drugs, madness, colonialism, love or war every bit as gripping as any 
novel.”

The New Generation award is supported by the Arts Council and the T S Eliot 
Estate.
