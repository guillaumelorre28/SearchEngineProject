companies in the world, will stop investing in the tobacco industry, it has 
announced.

The firm, which has more than 10 million customers in the UK, has also pledged 
to sell investments worth more than £1.7bn (£1.3bn).

Incoming chief executive Thomas Buberl told the BBC it “makes no sense” for 
the company to continue investing in the industry.

Last week, tobacco companies started selling cigarettes in standardised green 
packaging

 bearing graphic warnings of the dangers of smoking, under new rules designed 
to prevent young people taking up the habit.

Tobacco giants also failed in a last-ditch legal challenge against the 
government’s plain packaging rules at the high court when a judge rejected a 
judicial review action brought against the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, by 
four of the world’s biggest firms.

Buberl said: “The business case is positive. It makes no sense for us to 
continue our investments within the tobacco industry. The human cost of tobacco 
is tragic – its economic cost is huge.”

He added that as Axa was also a large provider of health insurance, chronic 
diseases cost the firm a lot of money.

“We need to invest more into prevention in order to prevent chronic diseases 
and we want to really support that, not invest in tobacco which creates more 
chronic diseases,” he said.
