Are you suffering from a musical malaise? Lost your mojo? Misplaced those 
dancing shoes? Then you need to consult Observer Music Monthly's Record Doctor.

After five years dealing with celebrity patients from Sir Michael Parkinson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/07/jazz-michael-parkinson-record-doctor>
 toDavid Tennant <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jun/18/34>, Peter 
Stringfellow <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/apr/23/25> to Kirsty Wark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/aug/13/8>, the Record Doctor is now 
expanding his practice, and will also be curing readers' conditions.

So if jazz brings you out in a nasty rash or you're suffering from a phobia of 
dubstep and donk, simply post your problem below, listing brief details of your 
condition, and we'll print a selection of his diagnoses and cures. And if your 
problem is of, shall we say, a sensitive nature, you can email the doctor too at
