An English writer teaching a creative writing workshop in Athens hears the 
stories of students, colleagues and strangers: this slippery novel about the 
fictions by which we live and the distances between people is also shortlisted 
for the Folio prize. “Among other things, it gets a great variety of human 
beings down on to the page with both immediacy and depth,” wrote James Lasdun 
in the Guardian.

 Crooked Heart by Lissa Evans 
A 10-year-old evacuee survives the Blitz, only to get caught up in crooked 
schemes with con artists and spivs. “A dark comedy, moving between drollery, 
pathos, farce and harrowing moments of tragic insight; it’s also a grey comedy, 
situated among backstreet have-nots subsisting hand-to-mouth in a St Albans of 
stint and grudge,” wrote Stevie Davies in the Guardian.

 I Am China by Xiaolu Guo 
Set across three continents, a young translator pieces together the identity 
and fate of the writer of a mysterious letter. “Dislocation afflicts all the 
characters as they struggle through atomised lives, where the relative freedoms 
of exile are counted against cultural nostalgia and loss of certainty as 
once-cherished meaning is stripped away,” wrote Isabel Hilton in the Guardian.

 Dear Thief by Samantha Harvey 
The narrator writes a letter to the woman who broke up her marriage, in this 
novelisation of Leonard Cohen’s classic song “Famous Blue Raincoat”. “Perhaps 
because it is so intimate, so honest, so raw,Dear Thief provokes you to think 
about life, and Life, and your own life, the people in it as well as the 
ghosts,” wrote Claire Kilroy.

 Elizabeth Is Missing by Emma Healey 
A narrator-heroine with dementia attempts to determine her missing friend’s

success. “Healey has a wonderful feel for language, and Elizabeth’s state of

depth,” wrote Viv Groskop.

 Station Eleven by Emily St John Mandel 
A new strain of flu wipes out 99% of humanity in this delicately written 
dystopia.
“Station Eleven is not so much about apocalypse as about memory and loss, 
nostalgia and learning; the effort of art to deepen our fleeting impressions of 
the world and bolster our solitude,” wrote Justine Jordan.

dystopian epic set in a ruined future America, with a narrator-heroine on the

 The Girl Who Was Saturday Night by Heather O’Neill 
A coming-of-age story in which Canadian twins serve as symbols of separatist 
Quebec. “Thematic undercurrents swell – the repercussions of motherlessness, as 
well as the 1990s push for the Québécois to be free from Canada, and from the 
English language ... as entrancing and antic and sensual as a dream,” wrote 
Amity Gaige in the Guardian.

A comic take on the tales of Camelot and the traditional quest narrative. 
“Bathos, bawdy and the absurd – a combination of uncommon felicity, as if Jane 
Austen were rewriting Terry Pratchett: snorts and giggles plus elegant 
eyebrow-raising,” wrote Ian Sansom.

 A God in Every Stone by Kamila Shamsie 
The novel deals with vast sweeps of history, from the travels of a 
fifth-century BC explorer to early 20th-century archaeologists, the outbreak of 
the first world war, the experiences of Indian Army troops on the western front 
and the rise of the independence movement in Pakistan. “A God in Every Stone is 
an ambitious piece of work, and its pages are lit by Shamsie’s eloquent prose,” 
wrote Helen Dunmore.

their myth-making, but she does so with a compassion that recognises that few

Clark in the Guardian.
