It was while she was discussing the achievement of reaching her first grand 
slam final that Angelique Kerber pulled out her phone to check her messages. 
Among them was a text from Steffi Graf, congratulating her on her effort and 
wishing her luck for Saturday’s Australian Open final againstSerena Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams>. On all available evidence, 
she will need more than luck.

Whether Graf offered her advice on how she might do it, Kerber did not say, 
but receiving any message from her idol will at least fill the 28-year-old with 
confidence, even if the odds are very much against her. Kerber turned to Graf 
last March when her confidence had dipped. A reminder from the former world No1 
that she was a good player and doing the right things put her back on track and 
she is now firmly established back in the top 10.

Should Kerber somehow pull off a massive upset, it will keep Graf one ahead of 
Williams in the all-time list of grand slam singles winners, with 22 to 21. 
Beating Williams will surely require something extra special. After a few 
months off at the end of last year, the American has breezed through the 
tournament without dropping a set, with onlyItaly’s Camila Giorgi, in round 
one, taking more than four games in a set 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/18/serena-williams-australian-open-knee-injury-camila-giorgi>
. Kerber has beaten her once, in Cincinnati in 2012, but has not won a set in 
their five other meetings. Throw in the fact that it is her first grand slam 
final and the inevitable nerves and the scale of her task is clear.

To make matters worse, Williams looks emotionally and physically refreshed, 
the disappointment ofnot completing the calendar grand slam at last year’s US 
Open

 already out of her system. Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, believes she has 
improved again. “She’s playing better tennis than last year,” he said. “She won 
a lot last year but she was far from her best and she’s closer this year, for 
the moment.

“I’m happy with the level and I’m happy also about the way she plays. We’ve 
worked a lot on that in the pre-season.

“She is obviously the tennis of the past because she’s been dominating the 
game so much. What I want and what she wants is that her tennis is the tennis 
of the future. So that’s why we’re working on stuff to improve and to look like 
what tennis is going to be in the next years. I think she’s doing quite well.”

In October, Mouratoglou revealed that Williams was forced to cut short her 
year after the US Open because of chronic knee trouble. The 34-year-old has 
injections every six months because of the problems and this month, for the 
first time, her left knee reacted badly and she pulled out of the Hopman Cup 
team exhibition in Perth because of inflammation. Rumours flowed around 
Melbourne Park in the buildup that she might be vulnerable but she has moved 
well and cruised through to her seventh final here.

The break, Mouratoglou said, helped her. “She rested mentally, so she’s very 
fresh and excited to play,” he said. “She’s very confident in her game and the 
new things she’s worked on, she really feels comfortable with, so she goes for 
the shots without thinking. This combination is quite deadly.

“She had to dig so deep in many tournaments last year. Roland Garros was the 
worst

and the moment she needed to be the best mentally was the moment she was the 
most tired also. This is totally different. She is rested mentally and she’s 
excited and the tennis that she’s playing makes her feel even better.

“She enjoys a lot the matches. She doesn’t always – sometimes you can feel 
that it’s not a pleasure to be on the court, not playing tennis but competing.”

After beating Agnieszka Radwanska in the semi-finals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/28/serena-williams-demolishes-agnieszka-radwanska-in-australian-open-semi>
, Williams claimed she was surprised she was in the final, which, if it is 
true, makes her just about the only person who is. “I’m not going to say that 
she’s lying,” Mouratoglou said. “I don’t know about her but I’m not surprised. 
I would be surprised if she was not.”

Having won all six of her previous finals here, she is a huge favourite to 
join Graf in second place on the all-time list behind Margaret Court. 
Mouratoglou wants more. “I think 23 is more important,” he said. “Tying is one 
thing. Beating is better.”
