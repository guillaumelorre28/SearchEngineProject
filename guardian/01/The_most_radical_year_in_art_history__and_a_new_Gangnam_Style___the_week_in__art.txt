Exhibition of the week: 1913 – The Shape of Time

Heroes of modernism from Guillaume Apollinaire 
<http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/apollinaire.jpg> to 
Umberto Boccioni 
<http://www.theartstory.org/images20/works/boccioni_umberto_5.jpg> to Giorgio 
de Chirico <http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_1996.403.10.jpg> appear 
in this highly interesting exhibition. It is called The Shape of Time because 
the curators argue that in 1913 radical ideas about time found expression in 
sculpture. Artists attempted to show not only different viewpoints but 
different moments in simultaneous images. This was a moment in art that 
cherished complexity and sought difficulty: the epoch of the high modernist 
avant garde at its brilliant and sometimes profound zenith.

Masterpiece of the week
 A dream guardian … Hypnos (1st-2nd century). Photograph: British Museum, 
London 
Hypnos 
Possibly Roman copy of Greek original, 1st-2nd century AD
A masterpiece of poetic art. Hypnos is the god of sleep and somehow when you 
look at this dreamy, winged face you feel soothed, calm, ready to close your 
eyes and slumber happily. It is a dream guardian. Like many ancient works of 
art that survive, it is a Roman copy of a lost Greek sculpture. The original 
was made in the Hellenistic era, the later age of Greek civilisation when art 
became subjective and personal. Theearlier "classical" Greek style is concerned 
with perfection 
<http://www.ekt.gr/parthenonfrieze_text_version/images/first.jpg>. Hellenistic 
artists are more interested in expression 
<http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/rome-vatican-museum-photos/slides/eosb_185p.jpg>
. Hypnos is a Hellenistic delve into the mysteries of the unconscious.
