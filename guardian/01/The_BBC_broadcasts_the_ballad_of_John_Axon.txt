The BBC broadcast of the Radio Ballads, in particular the first of these, The 
Ballad of John Axon, changed radio for ever. A collaboration between Ewan 
MacColl, Peggy Seeger and producer Charles Parker, it recounted the story of 
Stockport steam locomotive driver John Axon, who was posthumously awarded the 
George Cross in 1957 when he refused to abandon his runaway train and saved 
lives at the expense of his own. The broadcast featured so-called "actuality"â€“ 
real recordings and interviews, melded into a soundtrack of traditional and 
original songs. Not only did it change the format of radio documentaries that 
were previously the domain of home counties actors, it put folk music into a 
modern, relevant and emotional context.
