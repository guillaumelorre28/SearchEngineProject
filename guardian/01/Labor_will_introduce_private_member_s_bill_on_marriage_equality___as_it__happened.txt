Night-time politics

Rightio. I have to chuff off now because I have to string whole sentences 
together for The Drum very shortly.

 * What happened here today? The 45th parliament was opened by the governor 
general, Peter Cosgrove. He outlined – in a speech traditionally prepared by 
the prime minister’s office – the Turnbull government agenda for the next three 
years. It was a policy list from the last election.

 * Labor has confirmed it will introduce a marriage equality bill, which may 
come to parliament in the next few days or may not – depending on strategic 
reasons.

 * The omnibus bill was the subject of chest-beating by both sides. Labor has 
yet to give a final decision on whether to support the $6.1bn in savings as it 
was only handed over in the last 24 hours and it is 650 pages.

 * Labor has asked Turnbull to join with them and reaffirm the parliament’s 
commitment to non-discrimination in immigration and Indigenous affairs. With an 
eye to Cory Bernardi’s push to change 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act and 
Pauline Hanson’s policies on Islam, Labor is trying to draw Turnbull out on 
equality. John Howard and Kim Beazley agreed on this motion in 1996.

 * As to the Cory motion, Bernardi has given notice of it but it probably 
won’t come up for debate until next year. It seeks to remove “offend” and 
“insult’ from section 18c.

Thanks for your company and thanks to the brains trust of Katharine Murphy, 
Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens. Mike Bowers, take a bow. 


Welcome to the new parliament and see you on the morrow.

Obviously regarding that last post on marriage equality, Labor is not going to 
telegraph their strategy.

OK, so Labor is giving notice of a marriage equality bill. It could come on 
through a suspension of standing orders in the next two days or it could be 
delivered in an orderly fashion – during private member’s time.

Reports that Labor will bring on a bill for marriage equality.

We are seeking clarification of this news from Bill Shorten’s office. We were 
expecting this news but were not sure on the timing. This would have to be a 
private bill.

So that’s it for Peter Cosgrove. We have had a 19-gun salute and the MPs are 
wandering back into the lower house chamber.

After the 2016 proroguing of parliament, Cosgrove got a bit of stick for not 
shakingTanya Plibersek’s hand. He focused on the leaders and, even though she 
was standing next to him, he seems to not see her.

This time he stood square in front Plibersek this time and she went the full 
hug. Hopefully we will have pictures for you shortly.

(This post has been corrected. In my head the so-called snub was the last 
opening. But it was actually at the proroguing just before the election. It 
seemed like a lifetime ago. Thanks for the heads up. You know who you are.)

Rightio. I have to chuff off now because I have to string whole sentences 
together for The Drum very shortly.

 * What happened here today? The 45th parliament was opened by the governor 
general, Peter Cosgrove. He outlined – in a speech traditionally prepared by 
the prime minister’s office – the Turnbull government agenda for the next three 
years. It was a policy list from the last election.

 * Labor has confirmed it will introduce a marriage equality bill, which may 
come to parliament in the next few days or may not – depending on strategic 
reasons.

 * The omnibus bill was the subject of chest-beating by both sides. Labor has 
yet to give a final decision on whether to support the $6.1bn in savings as it 
was only handed over in the last 24 hours and it is 650 pages.

 * Labor has asked Turnbull to join with them and reaffirm the parliament’s 
commitment to non-discrimination in immigration and Indigenous affairs. With an 
eye to Cory Bernardi’s push to change 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act and 
Pauline Hanson’s policies on Islam, Labor is trying to draw Turnbull out on 
equality. John Howard and Kim Beazley agreed on this motion in 1996.

 * As to the Cory motion, Bernardi has given notice of it but it probably 
won’t come up for debate until next year. It seeks to remove “offend” and 
“insult’ from section 18c.

Thanks for your company and thanks to the brains trust of Katharine Murphy, 
Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens. Mike Bowers, take a bow. 


Welcome to the new parliament and see you on the morrow.

Obviously regarding that last post on marriage equality, Labor is not going to 
telegraph their strategy.
 
OK, so Labor is giving notice of a marriage equality bill. It could come on 
through a suspension of standing orders in the next two days or it could be 
delivered in an orderly fashion – during private member’s time.

BREAKING: @tanya_plibersek <https://twitter.com/tanya_plibersek> & I have 
given notice that we intend to introduce a private member's bill to make 
marriage equality a reality.

We are seeking clarification of this news from Bill Shorten’s office. We were 
expecting this news but were not sure on the timing. This would have to be a 
private bill.
 
Herewith, the Xenophones – the new Senate band getting back together.

would appreciate a little background accompaniment from The Xenophons.

Nats cosy up to Pauline Hanson.

Now Malcolm Turnbull, Bill Shorten and Barnaby Joyce are giving their shadow 
lists of whips etc to the house.
 
So that’s it for Peter Cosgrove. We have had a 19-gun salute and the MPs are 
wandering back into the lower house chamber.

After the 2016 proroguing of parliament, Cosgrove got a bit of stick for not 
shakingTanya Plibersek’s hand. He focused on the leaders and, even though she 
was standing next to him, he seems to not see her.

This time he stood square in front Plibersek this time and she went the full 
hug. Hopefully we will have pictures for you shortly.

(This post has been corrected. In my head the so-called snub was the last 
opening. But it was actually at the proroguing just before the election. It 
seemed like a lifetime ago. Thanks for the heads up. You know who you are.)
