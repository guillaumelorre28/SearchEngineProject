A drug user has died of anthrax 
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Anthrax/> in 
hospital in Blackpool, triggering concerns of a second outbreak of death and 
serious illness among injecting heroin users in Britain.

A drug user was hospitalised in Lanarkshire, Scotland, last month and health 
watchdogs are trying to establish whether the incidents are linked to a 
pan-European outbreak suspected of being caused by contaminated heroin. Since 
early June, three cases have been reported in Germany, two in Denmark and one 
in France.

Anthrax among drug users was considered to be very rare â€“ before an outbreak 
between 2009-10, mainly in Scotland, only one previous case had been reported, 
in Norway in 2000. Fourteen people died out of 119 confirmed cases in Scotland 
in the last outbreak. In England, there were five confirmed cases, including 
four deaths,including one inBlackpool <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackpool>
, 24-year-old Shane Brown.

Although they have not officially been linked, European health experts say the 
recent cases could have come from the same batch of contaminated heroin in the 
2009-10 outbreak.

Dilys Morgan, an expert at the Health Protection Agency in England and Wales, 
said: "It's likely that further cases among PWID [people who inject drugs] will 
be identified as part of the ongoing outbreak in EU countries. The Department of
Health <https://www.theguardian.com/society/health> has alerted the NHS of the 
possibility of people who are injecting drugs presenting to emergency 
departments and walk-in clinics, with symptoms suggestive of anthrax.

"Anthrax can be cured with antibiotics, if treatment is started early. It is, 
therefore, important for medical professionals to know the signs and symptoms 
to look for, so that there are no delays in providing the necessary treatment."

Anthrax <https://www.theguardian.com/world/anthrax> is a serious bacterial 
infection. The disease occurs most often among wild and domestic animals in 
Asia, Africa and parts of Europe. It is not known exactly how long symptoms can 
take to develop following the use of contaminated heroin, but in most cases 
during the 2009-10 outbreak, symptoms started within one to seven days of 
taking heroin.
