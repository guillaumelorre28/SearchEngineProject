After a stellar May, the UK's national newspaper websites were on a gentle 
comedown for June, with almost all audited sites recording a small drop in both 
daily and monthly user figures.

Mail Online remained by some distance the UK's busiest site with 4,062,059 
daily unique users, falling 6.96% or just over 300,000 from the previous month, 
according to the latest Audit Bureau of Circulations figures published on 
Thursday.

May had been a record month for news sites across the board following the 
death of Osama Bin Laden and extended coverage of the royal wedding, distorting 
what is actually a healthy traffic report for June.

Guardian.co.uk recorded 2,613,405 daily uniques, a fall of 7.58% from May, and 
Telegraph.co.uk was down 12.2% month on month to 1,921,711 daily uniques. 
Independent.co.uk fell 7.28% from May to 625,999 daily unique users.

Mirror Group Digital was the only national newspaper site reporting monthly 
ABCe figures to record an increase in daily uniques from May to June, up 3.32% 
to 730,296. Industry sources credited this to a marketing campaign that boosted 
traffic to the Mirror's mobile site.

Mail Online saw June 2011's average unique users increase 55.64% from June the 
previous year to 67,110,048, while Mirror Group Digital's monthly average 
traffic rose 31.52% to 14,708,075 average monthly uniques.

Independent.co.uk saw year-on-year growth of 27.58% to 13,513,040 for the 
month and the Telegraph 8.22% to 36,457,713.

Guardian.co.uk did not report monthly unique user figures for June as part of 
a new policy of reducing the focus on monthly traffic figures that means 
publishing this data every other month.

Independent.co.uk has the highest proportion of domestic users, with 57.5% of 
its average monthly visitors based in the UK, or 7.7 million. Mirror Group 
Digital's UK audience is 57.1% of its total, or 6.3 million users.

Telegraph.co.uk has 36.1% of its monthly audience, or 23.3 million users, in 
the UK, while Mail Online has 34.4% or 23.1 million.

Guardian.co.uk has not published a monthly user figure for June, but its daily 
unique user figure shows that 45.2% of its audience, or an average 1.2 million 
people, are in the UK.
