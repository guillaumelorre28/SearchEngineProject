The Campbell’s Soup paintings, part of a set of 10 worth $500,000 in total, 
were taken from the Springfield art museum during a break-in early on 7 April.

The screenprint works are part of set number 31 of the Campbell’s Soup I 
collection, which has been owned by the museum since 1985.

The stolen artworks each measure 94cm by 62cm (37in by 24.5in).

Last year, nine original Warhol prints worth $350,000 – from the late artist’s 
Endangered Species series – were discovered to have been quietly stolen from a 
Los Angeles movie firm and replaced with copies, in a crime that went 
undetected for years
