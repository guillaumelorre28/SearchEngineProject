The possibility of a merger between Aston and Birmingham universities came to 
a definitive end yesterday, when Aston University withdrew from the 
negotiations which have spanned the past two years.

When the talks began in 1999, collaboration between the two institutions was 
proposed. But discussions soon moved on to the possibility of the full 
integration of the two HE providers. This would have resulted in the production 
of one of the largest universities in the UK, with a student body of 30,000.

After withdrawing from yesterday's negotiations, a spokesperson for Aston 
said: " The Aston council was convinced that current timing and circumstances 
are not opportune for fully realising the two present vice-chancellors' shared 
vision for a new integrated institution, or that integration with Birmingham 
University on any other terms would be in the best interests of Aston's staff 
and students."

Birmingham's vice-chancellor Professor Maxwell Irvine, was said to be 
"disappointed" on behalf of the university. He said: "Many people in both 
universities, and in Birmingham itself, will be disappointed that we've missed 
this opportunity of equal partnership.

"Our door remains open to Aston, although we have no doubt that full 
integration offered the most potential for us both. Any other form of 
collaboration would be a second best choice. "

Members of Aston's guild of students had previously voted two-to-one to oppose 
the merger, and while some staff supported the possibility of a merger, a great 
many were against the project, due to fears of job losses.

The AUT, which is the officially recognised academic union in both Aston and 
Birmingham said: "AUT branches in both universities had expressed concern, the 
plans and the implications of those plans were not at all clear.

"We are pleased that the recent uncertainty about academic implications and 
job uncertainty have come to an end with the end of these talks."
