The formation of Crosby, Stills and Nash is headily serendipitous stuff: proof 
that a supposed musician's nirvana existed in Laurel Canyon, California. Errant 
Byrd David Crosby and former Buffalo Springfield guitarist Stephen Stills were 
brought together in 1968 by Mama Cass Elliot. Hollies guitarist Graham Nash 
listened to the pair sing You Don't Have to Cry, asked to hear it again, then 
on the third performance joined in with his own perfect harmony. The high point 
of their collaboration came with Déjà Vu, their second album – the sound of 
California in a way the Beach Boys had been a few years earlier.

You could argue the trio never stopped symbolising the Laurel Canyon scene: 
their formation spoke of its optimism and talent, their transformation to 
coked-out, cocooned multimillionaires, unable to contain their own egos long 
enough to make an album, told you how things had changed. Occasionally 
participating (he was on Déjà Vu), but always from a distance – the funkier, 
scruffier neighbourhood of Topanga Canyon – the zealously independentNeil Young 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/neilyoung> was the first to call bullshit 
when he saw things going wrong: the off-key, agonised howl of 1973's Time Fades 
Away as perfect a summation of what the hippy dream had become as the songs on 
Déjà Vu were an expression of what it might have been.
