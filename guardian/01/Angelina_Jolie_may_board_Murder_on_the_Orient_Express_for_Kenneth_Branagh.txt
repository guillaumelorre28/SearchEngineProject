Angelina Jolie is expected to take on the role played by Lauren Bacall in 
Murder on the Orient Express, in an upcoming remake of the 1974 classic, 
directed byKenneth Branagh <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kenneth-branagh>
.

Branagh’s film, like Sidney Lumet’s original, is based on Agatha Christie’s 
1934 mystery novel, which revolves around special detective Hercule Poirot and 
his efforts to solve a murder case aboard the famous train.

Branagh will star as Poirot, played by Albert Finney in Lumet’s adaptation. 
According to theHollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/angelina-jolie-talks-star-murder-901498?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News_now_2016-06-10%2007:25:24_HLewis&utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews>
, Jolie is in final talks to portray Mrs Harriet Hubbard, one of the passengers 
who’s deemed a suspect.

The rest of the ensemble has yet to be announced – but expect it to be 
star-packed. On top of starring Finney and Bacall, Lumet’s film also featured 
Ingrid Bergman and Sean Connery.

Malta. Green Lantern writer Michael Green penned the screenplay.

has suggested that she plans to move permanently into directing. Last year, 
Jolie directed herself, alongside husband Brad Pitt, in the arthouse 
relationship dramaBy the Sea

. Coming up, she’s slated to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney’s sequel 
to the 2014 box-office smash.

Jolie also recently helmed the upcoming Netflix documentary, First They Killed 
My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers, based on Cambodian author and 
human rights activist Loung Ung’s 2000 memoir.

2017, during the heat of awards season.
