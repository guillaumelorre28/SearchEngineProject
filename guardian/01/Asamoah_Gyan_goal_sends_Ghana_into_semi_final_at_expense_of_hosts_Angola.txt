Ghana became the first team to reach the semi-finals as Asamoah Gyan scored 
the only goal of the game to knock the hosts,Angola 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/angola>, out of the competition. The 
Rennes striker produced a clinical finish at the end of a sweeping 
counter-attack in the 16th minute to stun the majority of the near 50,000 crowd.

Angola could have only themselves to blame for failing to progress as they 
missed a series of chances against Milovan Rajevac's side, Manucho, the Real 
Valladolid striker, being particularly culpable.

The tension inside the Estadio do Novembre 11 in Luanda was evident from the 
outset as theGhana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> striker Andr√© 
Ayew found himself in the referee's notebook within 30 seconds for diving in on 
Mabina.

Richard Kingson, the Ghana goalkeeper who is the back-up to Chris Kirkland at 
Wigan Athletic, survived two anxious moments in mix-ups with his left-back, Lee 
Addy, before Gyan gave warning of his threat by curling a 30-yard free-kick 
narrowly wide.

However, it took only six minutes more for him to score. Kwadwo Asamoah, the 
Udinese midfielder, split the Angola defence with a superb pass from inside his 
own half and Gyan fired a shot beyond Carlos Fernandes to score what turned out 
to be the winning goal as Manuel Jose's team matched their best-ever appearance 
in the competition.
