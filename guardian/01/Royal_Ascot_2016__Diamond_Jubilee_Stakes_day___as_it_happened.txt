Goodbye for now

Well, that’s another Royal Ascot over. A dramatic final day on which the Queen 
had a winner in a dramatic race that involved the rider on the second losing 
his whip and then the first past the post having to survive a stewards’ 
inquiry. Ryan Moore proved he could ride and booted home three winners after a 
very mixed week for him when he was considered at fault by some people in a 
couple of races.Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> 
will be back next year and one thing’s for certain: the royal procession will 
be the same.

Queen Alexandra Stakes (5.35) preview

Chris Cook

The last race at Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> 
is an extreme test of stamina, won twice by Willie Mullins in the past four 
years as well as by jumps trainers like Nicky Henderson and Gary Moore in the 
past decade. Mullins’s Clondaw Warrior, narrowly beaten in the Doncaster Cup, 
has an obvious chance with Ryan Moore aboard. Oriental Fox hacked up in last 
year’s race but is not so fresh this time and would prefer fast going. Sandro 
Botticelli must have more to offer after just five outings and has been keeping 
good company. For Sir Mark Prescott, Amour De Nuit has won five of his last 
seven. He has more to prove in this company and was well beaten in a Group Two 
here last year but is going the right way.

Wokingham Stakes (5.00) preview

Chris Cook

The last of the week’s tricky handicaps and another six-furlong sprint. The 
overnight rain might change things but it has begun to look in the last couple 
of days as if those drawn high, towards the stands’ side, might be at an 
advantage. Perhaps that will help Tupi, who ran Magical Memory to a neck in 
April when tried at this distance for the first time. First-time blinkers ought 
to assist and he looks a big price. Coulsty is another from the Richard Hannon 
yard wearing first-time blinkers but lacks the same evident scope to be ahead 
of his mark. The progressive Brando will be well fancied but has been raised 
13lb for two races, despite having got beat the last time. Spring Loaded has 
grown into himself this season but his best form is on the all-weather. Flash 
Fire and Buckstay have shown they can cope with these big-field, 
straight-course races and their stamina will help them stay on at the finish.

Diamond Jubilee Stakes (4.20) preview

Chris Cook

A top-class sprint, rather lacking in numbers this year but not in quality. 
Magical Memory has been gradually working his way to the top of the tree, 
keeping on to bag a Group Two at York last time. He was edged out at Haydock in 
September, his only attempt on a Group One, but the winner, Twilight Son, is 
under suspicion after a disappointing return to action. Meanwhile, The Tin Man 
is coming through the ranks and appears, to me, a horse worth sticking with. He 
wasn’t quite ready for his first Group One tilt in October but seemed to have 
improved again when hacking up at Windsor on his reappearance. Undrafted, last 
year’s winner, is a powerful beast but probably needs a drier surface to show 
his best.

Dartmouth lands Hardwicke Stakes for the Queen

Dartmouth landed a famous success in the colours of the Queen in what was a 
dramatic Hardwicke Stakes atRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>.

Partnered by leading French jockey Olivier Peslier, the Sir Michael 
Stoute-trained four-year-old was sent off at 10-1 to add to his previous 
victories this season at Chelmsford and Chester.

Peslier cut a confident figure in the saddle throughout, positioning his mount 
on the outside of the field before launching his challenge in the straight.

Dartmouth proved a willing partner, picking up to challenge for the lead 
heading inside the final furlong and while Highland Reel was a persistent 
threat, the Royal runner saw him off by a head.

The front two did come close together and a stewards’ inquiry was immediately 
called, although the outcome confirming the placings was swift. Almodovar ran a 
fine race from the front before eventually weakening into third place.

It was a 75th triumph at the showpiece meeting for Stoute, meaning he joins 
the late great Sir Henry Cecil as the winning-most trainer in RoyalAscot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> history.

Stoute said: “That’s a great mark to reach. I hope it doesn’t stop there. He’s 
a lovely, quality horse. Everybody in the yard is very fond of him. He’s 
stepped up all year. We put him into the John Porter, which was run at 
Chelmsford. He had another step up in the Ormonde Stakes and another one today.”

Peslier said: “The horse is relaxed and he came through well. When he’s in 
front he won’t stop. I’m very happy.”PA

Isaac Newton adds up for Moore and O'Brien

Sir Isaac Newton clung on grimly to land the Wolferton Handicap at Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>.

Aidan O’Brien’s four-year-old has endured a slightly underwhelming career so 
far, but hinted at better to come when third behind Wednesday’s Royal Hunt Cup 
winner Portage in a Listed event at the Curragh last month.

After being sent off at 7-1 for what was his first ever start in handicap 
company, the Galileo colt was produced with a well-timed challenge by Ryan 
Moore and while he was crying out for the line in the dying strides, he held on 
by half a length from Second Wave. Revolutionist was close-up in third.

The victory completed doubles on the day for the formidable O’Brien-Moore 
combination after winning the opening Chesham Stakes with odds-on favourite 
Churchill.

Moore said: “I had a very good trip round and he’s a high-class horse when 
things drop his way.

“We thought an awful lot of him last year. The trainer has done remarkably 
well to get him back winning here today.

“He’s definitely got the ability and hopefully racing will bring him forward 
and he’ll get better.”PA

Hardwicke Stakes (3.40) preview

Chris Cook

If there’s one race in which to follow a trainer at the Royal meeting, this 
would be it. Sir Michael Stoute has won this Group Two for older horses a total 
of nine times, including six times in the past decade. But you’d still have a 
choice to make, as he runs two here and they head the market. Exosphere looks 
the one to me, having apparently improved bundles over the winter, cuffing 
Simple Verse and others at Newmarket in April. Stoute’s other one is Dartmouth, 
four times a winner in his last six but starting to look exposed and perhaps 
fortunate to hold off Wicklow Brave at Chester. The Irish raider reopposes but 
might prefer a longer distance. Astronereus is a course winner who put up a 
career best last time but Eagle Top would probably prefer a drier surface.

And they’re off in the 3.05. Best Of Times is leading early ... Arthenus is 
right at the back ... Oceanographer and Noble Gift have taken the lead on the 
turn for home ... Sir Isaac Newton challenges, takes the lead and makes it a 
double for Ryan Moore and trainer Aidan O’Brien ... Second wave gets second

Hotpot Churchill has finest hour at Ascot

The heavily supported Churchill got favourite-backers off to the perfect start 
on the final day ofRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> 
with victory in the Chesham Stakes.

Aidan O’Brien’s juvenile was only third on his racecourse debut at the Curragh 
last month, but was backed as if defeat was out of the question for his 
Berkshire assignment.

Always travelling well in the hands of Ryan Moore, the 8-11 market leader 
moved to the front with two furlongs still to run.

He started to wander a little when coming under pressure, and the late thrust 
of 25-1 shot Isomer made odds-on backers sweat, but Churchill passed the post 
half a length to the good.

Cunco, the first foal of the great Frankel and a winner on his Newbury debut, 
was far from disgraced in finishing third.

Moore said: “He’s a big, powerful, beautiful horse. He travelled nice and 
smooth and when he got there (the front) he was very green, but he’s a 
high-quality two-year-old. He’s a bit of a baby, but he can only improve and 
he’s one to look forward to.”

Part-owner Michael Tabor said: “You must remember it’s only his second run and 
he was very green. We think there should be a lot of improvement in him, so 
hopefully he’ll be a very nice horse in the future.

“He was Aidan’s number one fancy for the week and so he proved to be. We have 
not even discussed plans. You like to win here first and not jump ahead of 
yourself.”

Coral make Churchill a 10-1 shot for next year’s 2,000 Guineas, while he is 
the 16-1 favourite for the Derby with RaceBets.

O’Brien said: “He’s a big, powerful, raw baby. That’s what he is, as you can 
see by the size of him. He had one easy run at the Curragh, when he didn’t know 
what was happening.

“They went slow today and Ryan had him handy. He went on, but he didn’t know 
what to do.

“This horse is going to be a lovely fellow and we’ll now look for a Group race 
with him. He is not short of pace, as he travels very easily.”

Comparing him to Tuesday’s brilliant Coventry Stakes winner Caravaggio, the 
trainer added: “Caravaggio is very fast and a real sprinter. This horse has an 
awful lot of class.”PA

Preview: Wolferton Handicap (3.05)

Chris Cook

Fiercely competitive, including a couple of horses with multiple recent wins 
to their names. But Maleficent Queen (unbeaten since May last year!) seems 
unfancied for some reason, perhaps because people imagine a 10lb hike for her 
fifth win will stop her in her tracks. Revolutionist has won twice on a much 
faster surface in May and a wide draw won’t help him but he’s game. Our Channel 
has also had a productive year but on the all-weather; turf is not his thing, 
it seems. I likePacify, running in the Prince of Wales’s colours and for the 
trainer Ralph Beckett, who is practically hot to the touch right now. He was 
unlucky at Epsom in April and gave lumps of weight to the only horse that beat 
him at York in May. A case can be made for Educate but my hat is off to you if 
you can keep the faith with a talented horse that has somehow failed to win for 
almost three years.

Ascot on Saturday, own Pacify, the Guardian selection in the 3.05 race.

They’re away and running in the Chesham Stakes ... big roar from the crowd ... 
Churchill is away fast with Frankuus, who now takes the overall lead ... Thora 
Barber the outsider is close up ... Churchill travels well and is ready to 
pounce ... He takes a narrow lead and now kicks ahead ... he’s getting caught 
but just clings on tenaciously from Isomer and Cunco.

Preview: Chesham Stakes (2.30)

Chris Cook

After Frankel’s first runner at Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> did him proud with a third 
place yesterday, he has two sons running for him here over a distance of seven 
furlongs that might be more suitable than the six at which Queen Kindly ran 24 
hours ago. But frankly I wasn’t all that taken with Frankuus, a winner at 
Haydock recently. Instead, I’ll side withCunco, the other Frankel, who behaved 
really badly at Newbury last month and ran as if he hadn’t a clue for half the 
race. He then shot past his rivals in a manner quite reminiscent of the sire 
and he’ll be dangerous over this extra furlong if there’s any improvement in 
his physique / professionalism. But Aidan O’Brien might have found another good 
one in Churchill, who was a major eye-catcher when running on for third at The 
Curragh last month. Even so, this is a major step up in class and on a much 
drier surface.

The Royal procession is on its way ...

It’s almost that time ... for the royal procession to wend its way down the 
centre of the track. I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artistMark 
Wallinger <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wallinger> back in 1994 when one 
of his installations was a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight 
cases, each isolating the royal carriage’s leisurely progress down the track on 
the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of 
Royal Ascot.

The British Council described the work thus: 
<http://visualarts.britishcouncil.org/exhibitions/exhibition/horse-2015/object/royal-ascot-wallinger-1994-p6682>
 ‘Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen’s frozen smile 
and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh 
raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an 
event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather 
than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen’s dolly 
mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes; the difference from day to day is barely 
discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather.’

Dettori v Moore for Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>
 top jockey

The race for the QIPCO Leading Jockey Award at Royal Ascot 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot-2016> looks set to go down to 
the wire with Frankie Dettori and Ryan Moore head to head. Dettori currently 
leads the way with four winners to Moore’s three.

Moore has ridden substantially more placed horses (four seconds to Dettori’s 
one) this week however, which could prove vital if the pair finish on the same 
number of winners and a countback on placed horses is required. Going into the 
final day, Moore has a full book of six rides, while Dettori is down to three 
mounts following the defection of Eagle Top in the Hardwicke Stakes. 

Frankie Dettori’s rides today: 2.30pm Chesham Stakes - Magillen; 4.20pm 
Diamond Jubilee Stakes - Magical Memory; 5.35pm Queen Alexandra Conditions Race 
- Sandro Botticelli

Dettori is seeking to win the QIPCO Leading Jockey Award for a sixth time, 
having landed the honour in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2003 and 2004. He has ridden 56 
RoyalAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> winners at the start of 
day five, more than any other current jockey. 

Ryan Moore’s rides today: 2.30pm Chesham Stakes - Churchill; 3.05pm Wolferton 
Handicap - Sir Isaac Newton; 3.40pm Hardwicke Stakes - Exosphere; 4.20pm 
Diamond Jubilee Stakes - Twilight Son; 5.00pm Wokingham Handicap - The Happy 
Prince; 5.35pm Queen Alexandra Conditions Race - Clondaw Warrior.

Steady on Eddie

Many happy returns to Eddie Fremantle, the Observer’s former racing 
correspondent, who has been working for Racing UK atRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> this week . He’s having his 
celebrations today but is somewhat miffed (and perhaps he’s got a point) that 
the Queen’s seem to have been going on for quite some time.

Chris Cook

2.30 Chesham Stakes

After Frankel’s first runner at Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> did him proud with a third 
place yesterday, he has two sons running for him here over a distance of seven 
furlongs that might be more suitable than the six at which Queen Kindly ran 24 
hours ago. But frankly I wasn’t all that taken with Frankuus, a winner at 
Haydock recently. Instead, I’ll side with Cunco, the other Frankel, who behaved 
really badly at Newbury last month and ran as if he hadn’t a clue for half the 
race. He then shot past his rivals in a manner quite reminiscent of the sire 
and he’ll be dangerous over this extra furlong if there’s any improvement in 
his physique / professionalism. But Aidan O’Brien might have found another good 
one in Churchill, who was a major eye-catcher when running on for third at The 
Curragh last month. Even so, this is a major step up in class and on a much 
drier surface.

3.05 Wolferton Handicap

Fiercely competitive, including a couple of horses with multiple recent wins 
to their names. But Maleficent Queen (unbeaten since May last year!) seems 
unfancied for some reason, perhaps because people imagine a 10lb hike for her 
fifth win will stop her in her tracks. Revolutionist has won twice on a much 
faster surface in May and a wide draw won’t help him but he’s game. Our Channel 
has also had a productive year but on the all-weather; turf is not his thing, 
it seems. I like Pacify, running in the Prince of Wales’s colours and for the 
trainer Ralph Beckett, who is practically hot to the touch right now. He was 
unlucky at Epsom in April and gave lumps of weight to the only horse that beat 
him at York in May. A case can be made for Educate but my hat is off to you if 
you can keep the faith with a talented horse that has somehow failed to win for 
almost three years.

3.40 Hardwicke Stakes

If there’s one race in which to follow a trainer at the Royal meeting, this 
would be it. Sir Michael Stoute has won this Group Two for older horses a total 
of nine times, including six times in the past decade. But you’d still have a 
choice to make, as he runs two here and they head the market. Exosphere looks 
the one to me, having apparently improved bundles over the winter, cuffing 
Simple Verse and others at Newmarket in April. Stoute’s other one is Dartmouth, 
four times a winner in his last six but starting to look exposed and perhaps 
fortunate to hold off Wicklow Brave at Chester. The Irish raider reopposes but 
might prefer a longer distance. Astronereus is a course winner who put up a 
career best last time but Eagle Top would probably prefer a drier surface.


4.20 Diamond Jubilee Stakes

A top-class sprint, rather lacking in numbers this year but not in quality. 
Magical Memory has been gradually working his way to the top of the tree, 
keeping on to bag a Group Two at York last time. He was edged out at Haydock in 
September, his only attempt on a Group One, but the winner, Twilight Son, is 
under suspicion after a disappointing return to action. Meanwhile, The Tin Man 
is coming through the ranks and appears, to me, a horse worth sticking with. He 
wasn’t quite ready for his first Group One tilt in October but seemed to have 
improved again when hacking up at Windsor on his reappearance. Undrafted, last 
year’s winner, is a powerful beast but probably needs a drier surface to show 
his best.


5.00 Wokingham Handicap

The last of the week’s tricky handicaps and another six-furlong sprint. The 
overnight rain might change things but it has begun to look in the last couple 
of days as if those drawn high, towards the stands’ side, might be at an 
advantage. Perhaps that will help Tupi, who ran Magical Memory to a neck in 
April when tried at this distance for the first time. First-time blinkers ought 
to assist and he looks a big price. Coulsty is another from the Richard Hannon 
yard wearing first-time blinkers but lacks the same evident scope to be ahead 
of his mark. The progressive Brando will be well fancied but has been raised 
13lb for two races, despite having got beat the last time. Spring Loaded has 
grown into himself this season but his best form is on the all-weather. Flash 
Fire and Buckstay have shown they can cope with these big-field, 
straight-course races and their stamina will help them stay on at the finish.


5.35 Queen Alexandra Stakes

The last race at Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> is an 
extreme test of stamina, won twice by Willie Mullins in the past four years as 
well as by jumps trainers like Nicky Henderson and Gary Moore in the past 
decade. Mullins’s Clondaw Warrior, narrowly beaten in the Doncaster Cup, has an 
obvious chance with Ryan Moore aboard. Oriental Fox hacked up in last year’s 
race but is not so fresh this time and would prefer fast going. Sandro 
Botticelli must have more to offer after just five outings and has been keeping 
good company. For Sir Mark Prescott, Amour De Nuit has won five of his last 
seven. He has more to prove in this company and was well beaten in a Group Two 
here last year but is going the right way.

Preamble

Hello and welcome to the final day of Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. It’s far from the most 
prestigious day but it is the most popular and has been a huge success since 
the track decided to extend the Royal meeting and race on Saturday.

The Diamond Jubilee Stakes (4.20pm BST) is the feature race, but there will be 
plenty of interest in the match between Frankie ‘Mr Ascot’ Dettori and Ryan 
Moore to see who comes out as top jockey. Moore might have had three winners at 
the meeting so far but has had some well-publicised reverses and knowing what a 
perfectionist he is will be determined to overhaul Dettori, who currently has 
four winners on the board.

The opening race features two of the mighty Frankel’s sons while the Wokingham 
Handicap at 5.00 is one of the big betting races of the year. We have Chris 
Cook at the track and you’ll find all the latest news and comment here where 
you won’t miss a minute of the action.

Well, that’s another Royal Ascot over. A dramatic final day on which the Queen 
had a winner in a dramatic race that involved the rider on the second losing 
his whip and then the first past the post having to survive a stewards’ 
inquiry. Ryan Moore proved he could ride and booted home three winners after a 
very mixed week for him when he was considered at fault by some people in a 
couple of races.Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> 
will be back next year and one thing’s for certain: the royal procession will 
be the same.

The last race at Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> 
is an extreme test of stamina, won twice by Willie Mullins in the past four 
years as well as by jumps trainers like Nicky Henderson and Gary Moore in the 
past decade. Mullins’s Clondaw Warrior, narrowly beaten in the Doncaster Cup, 
has an obvious chance with Ryan Moore aboard. Oriental Fox hacked up in last 
year’s race but is not so fresh this time and would prefer fast going. Sandro 
Botticelli must have more to offer after just five outings and has been keeping 
good company. For Sir Mark Prescott, Amour De Nuit has won five of his last 
seven. He has more to prove in this company and was well beaten in a Group Two 
here last year but is going the right way.

The last of the week’s tricky handicaps and another six-furlong sprint. The 
overnight rain might change things but it has begun to look in the last couple 
of days as if those drawn high, towards the stands’ side, might be at an 
advantage. Perhaps that will help Tupi, who ran Magical Memory to a neck in 
April when tried at this distance for the first time. First-time blinkers ought 
to assist and he looks a big price. Coulsty is another from the Richard Hannon 
yard wearing first-time blinkers but lacks the same evident scope to be ahead 
of his mark. The progressive Brando will be well fancied but has been raised 
13lb for two races, despite having got beat the last time. Spring Loaded has 
grown into himself this season but his best form is on the all-weather. Flash 
Fire and Buckstay have shown they can cope with these big-field, 
straight-course races and their stamina will help them stay on at the finish.

A top-class sprint, rather lacking in numbers this year but not in quality. 
Magical Memory has been gradually working his way to the top of the tree, 
keeping on to bag a Group Two at York last time. He was edged out at Haydock in 
September, his only attempt on a Group One, but the winner, Twilight Son, is 
under suspicion after a disappointing return to action. Meanwhile, The Tin Man 
is coming through the ranks and appears, to me, a horse worth sticking with. He 
wasn’t quite ready for his first Group One tilt in October but seemed to have 
improved again when hacking up at Windsor on his reappearance. Undrafted, last 
year’s winner, is a powerful beast but probably needs a drier surface to show 
his best.
 
Dartmouth landed a famous success in the colours of the Queen in what was a 
dramatic Hardwicke Stakes atRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>.

Partnered by leading French jockey Olivier Peslier, the Sir Michael 
Stoute-trained four-year-old was sent off at 10-1 to add to his previous 
victories this season at Chelmsford and Chester.

Peslier cut a confident figure in the saddle throughout, positioning his mount 
on the outside of the field before launching his challenge in the straight.

Dartmouth proved a willing partner, picking up to challenge for the lead 
heading inside the final furlong and while Highland Reel was a persistent 
threat, the Royal runner saw him off by a head.

The front two did come close together and a stewards’ inquiry was immediately 
called, although the outcome confirming the placings was swift. Almodovar ran a 
fine race from the front before eventually weakening into third place.

It was a 75th triumph at the showpiece meeting for Stoute, meaning he joins 
the late great Sir Henry Cecil as the winning-most trainer in RoyalAscot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> history.

Stoute said: “That’s a great mark to reach. I hope it doesn’t stop there. He’s 
a lovely, quality horse. Everybody in the yard is very fond of him. He’s 
stepped up all year. We put him into the John Porter, which was run at 
Chelmsford. He had another step up in the Ormonde Stakes and another one today.”

Peslier said: “The horse is relaxed and he came through well. When he’s in 
front he won’t stop. I’m very happy.”PA

Sir Isaac Newton clung on grimly to land the Wolferton Handicap at Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>.

Aidan O’Brien’s four-year-old has endured a slightly underwhelming career so 
far, but hinted at better to come when third behind Wednesday’s Royal Hunt Cup 
winner Portage in a Listed event at the Curragh last month.

After being sent off at 7-1 for what was his first ever start in handicap 
company, the Galileo colt was produced with a well-timed challenge by Ryan 
Moore and while he was crying out for the line in the dying strides, he held on 
by half a length from Second Wave. Revolutionist was close-up in third.

The victory completed doubles on the day for the formidable O’Brien-Moore 
combination after winning the opening Chesham Stakes with odds-on favourite 
Churchill.

Moore said: “I had a very good trip round and he’s a high-class horse when 
things drop his way.

“We thought an awful lot of him last year. The trainer has done remarkably 
well to get him back winning here today.

“He’s definitely got the ability and hopefully racing will bring him forward 
and he’ll get better.”PA

If there’s one race in which to follow a trainer at the Royal meeting, this 
would be it. Sir Michael Stoute has won this Group Two for older horses a total 
of nine times, including six times in the past decade. But you’d still have a 
choice to make, as he runs two here and they head the market. Exosphere looks 
the one to me, having apparently improved bundles over the winter, cuffing 
Simple Verse and others at Newmarket in April. Stoute’s other one is Dartmouth, 
four times a winner in his last six but starting to look exposed and perhaps 
fortunate to hold off Wicklow Brave at Chester. The Irish raider reopposes but 
might prefer a longer distance. Astronereus is a course winner who put up a 
career best last time but Eagle Top would probably prefer a drier surface.

The heavily supported Churchill got favourite-backers off to the perfect start 
on the final day ofRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> 
with victory in the Chesham Stakes.

Aidan O’Brien’s juvenile was only third on his racecourse debut at the Curragh 
last month, but was backed as if defeat was out of the question for his 
Berkshire assignment.

Always travelling well in the hands of Ryan Moore, the 8-11 market leader 
moved to the front with two furlongs still to run.

He started to wander a little when coming under pressure, and the late thrust 
of 25-1 shot Isomer made odds-on backers sweat, but Churchill passed the post 
half a length to the good.

Cunco, the first foal of the great Frankel and a winner on his Newbury debut, 
was far from disgraced in finishing third.

Moore said: “He’s a big, powerful, beautiful horse. He travelled nice and 
smooth and when he got there (the front) he was very green, but he’s a 
high-quality two-year-old. He’s a bit of a baby, but he can only improve and 
he’s one to look forward to.”

Part-owner Michael Tabor said: “You must remember it’s only his second run and 
he was very green. We think there should be a lot of improvement in him, so 
hopefully he’ll be a very nice horse in the future.

“He was Aidan’s number one fancy for the week and so he proved to be. We have 
not even discussed plans. You like to win here first and not jump ahead of 
yourself.”

Coral make Churchill a 10-1 shot for next year’s 2,000 Guineas, while he is 
the 16-1 favourite for the Derby with RaceBets.

O’Brien said: “He’s a big, powerful, raw baby. That’s what he is, as you can 
see by the size of him. He had one easy run at the Curragh, when he didn’t know 
what was happening.

“They went slow today and Ryan had him handy. He went on, but he didn’t know 
what to do.

“This horse is going to be a lovely fellow and we’ll now look for a Group race 
with him. He is not short of pace, as he travels very easily.”

Comparing him to Tuesday’s brilliant Coventry Stakes winner Caravaggio, the 
trainer added: “Caravaggio is very fast and a real sprinter. This horse has an 
awful lot of class.”PA

Fiercely competitive, including a couple of horses with multiple recent wins 
to their names. But Maleficent Queen (unbeaten since May last year!) seems 
unfancied for some reason, perhaps because people imagine a 10lb hike for her 
fifth win will stop her in her tracks. Revolutionist has won twice on a much 
faster surface in May and a wide draw won’t help him but he’s game. Our Channel 
has also had a productive year but on the all-weather; turf is not his thing, 
it seems. I likePacify, running in the Prince of Wales’s colours and for the 
trainer Ralph Beckett, who is practically hot to the touch right now. He was 
unlucky at Epsom in April and gave lumps of weight to the only horse that beat 
him at York in May. A case can be made for Educate but my hat is off to you if 
you can keep the faith with a talented horse that has somehow failed to win for 
almost three years.

After Frankel’s first runner at Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> did him proud with a third 
place yesterday, he has two sons running for him here over a distance of seven 
furlongs that might be more suitable than the six at which Queen Kindly ran 24 
hours ago. But frankly I wasn’t all that taken with Frankuus, a winner at 
Haydock recently. Instead, I’ll side withCunco, the other Frankel, who behaved 
really badly at Newbury last month and ran as if he hadn’t a clue for half the 
race. He then shot past his rivals in a manner quite reminiscent of the sire 
and he’ll be dangerous over this extra furlong if there’s any improvement in 
his physique / professionalism. But Aidan O’Brien might have found another good 
one in Churchill, who was a major eye-catcher when running on for third at The 
Curragh last month. Even so, this is a major step up in class and on a much 
drier surface.

It’s almost that time ... for the royal procession to wend its way down the 
centre of the track. I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artistMark 
Wallinger <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wallinger> back in 1994 when one 
of his installations was a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight 
cases, each isolating the royal carriage’s leisurely progress down the track on 
the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of 
Royal Ascot.

The British Council described the work thus: 
<http://visualarts.britishcouncil.org/exhibitions/exhibition/horse-2015/object/royal-ascot-wallinger-1994-p6682>
 ‘Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen’s frozen smile 
and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh 
raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an 
event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather 
than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen’s dolly 
mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes; the difference from day to day is barely 
discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather.’

Dettori v Moore for Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>
 top jockey

The race for the QIPCO Leading Jockey Award at Royal Ascot 2016 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot-2016> looks set to go down to 
the wire with Frankie Dettori and Ryan Moore head to head. Dettori currently 
leads the way with four winners to Moore’s three.

Moore has ridden substantially more placed horses (four seconds to Dettori’s 
one) this week however, which could prove vital if the pair finish on the same 
number of winners and a countback on placed horses is required. Going into the 
final day, Moore has a full book of six rides, while Dettori is down to three 
mounts following the defection of Eagle Top in the Hardwicke Stakes. 

Frankie Dettori’s rides today: 2.30pm Chesham Stakes - Magillen; 4.20pm 
Diamond Jubilee Stakes - Magical Memory; 5.35pm Queen Alexandra Conditions Race 
- Sandro Botticelli

Dettori is seeking to win the QIPCO Leading Jockey Award for a sixth time, 
having landed the honour in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2003 and 2004. He has ridden 56 
RoyalAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> winners at the start of 
day five, more than any other current jockey. 

Ryan Moore’s rides today: 2.30pm Chesham Stakes - Churchill; 3.05pm Wolferton 
Handicap - Sir Isaac Newton; 3.40pm Hardwicke Stakes - Exosphere; 4.20pm 
Diamond Jubilee Stakes - Twilight Son; 5.00pm Wokingham Handicap - The Happy 
Prince; 5.35pm Queen Alexandra Conditions Race - Clondaw Warrior.

2.30 Chesham Stakes

After Frankel’s first runner at Royal Ascot

place yesterday, he has two sons running for him here over a distance of seven 
furlongs that might be more suitable than the six at which Queen Kindly ran 24

one in Churchill, who was a major eye-catcher when running on for third at The

3.05 Wolferton Handicap

Fiercely competitive, including a couple of horses with multiple recent wins 
to their names. But Maleficent Queen (unbeaten since May last year!) seems 
unfancied for some reason, perhaps because people imagine a 10lb hike for her 
fifth win will stop her in her tracks. Revolutionist has won twice on a much

has also had a productive year but on the all-weather; turf is not his thing,

him at York in May. A case can be made for Educate but my hat is off to you if 
you can keep the faith with a talented horse that has somehow failed to win for 
almost three years.

3.40 Hardwicke Stakes

If there’s one race in which to follow a trainer at the Royal meeting, this 
would be it. Sir Michael Stoute has won this Group Two for older horses a total 
of nine times, including six times in the past decade. But you’d still have a 
choice to make, as he runs two here and they head the market. Exosphere looks 
the one to me, having apparently improved bundles over the winter, cuffing 
Simple Verse and others at Newmarket in April. Stoute’s other one is Dartmouth, 
four times a winner in his last six but starting to look exposed and perhaps 
fortunate to hold off Wicklow Brave at Chester. The Irish raider reopposes but 
might prefer a longer distance. Astronereus is a course winner who put up a 
career best last time but Eagle Top would probably prefer a drier surface.


4.20 Diamond Jubilee Stakes

A top-class sprint, rather lacking in numbers this year but not in quality. 
Magical Memory has been gradually working his way to the top of the tree, 
keeping on to bag a Group Two at York last time. He was edged out at Haydock in 
September, his only attempt on a Group One, but the winner, Twilight Son, is 
under suspicion after a disappointing return to action. Meanwhile, The Tin Man 
is coming through the ranks and appears, to me, a horse worth sticking with. He 
wasn’t quite ready for his first Group One tilt in October but seemed to have 
improved again when hacking up at Windsor on his reappearance. Undrafted, last 
year’s winner, is a powerful beast but probably needs a drier surface to show 
his best.


5.00 Wokingham Handicap

The last of the week’s tricky handicaps and another six-furlong sprint. The 
overnight rain might change things but it has begun to look in the last couple 
of days as if those drawn high, towards the stands’ side, might be at an 
advantage. Perhaps that will help Tupi, who ran Magical Memory to a neck in 
April when tried at this distance for the first time. First-time blinkers ought 
to assist and he looks a big price. Coulsty is another from the Richard Hannon 
yard wearing first-time blinkers but lacks the same evident scope to be ahead 
of his mark. The progressive Brando will be well fancied but has been raised 
13lb for two races, despite having got beat the last time. Spring Loaded has 
grown into himself this season but his best form is on the all-weather. Flash 
Fire and Buckstay have shown they can cope with these big-field, 
straight-course races and their stamina will help them stay on at the finish.


5.35 Queen Alexandra Stakes

The last race at Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> is an 
extreme test of stamina, won twice by Willie Mullins in the past four years as 
well as by jumps trainers like Nicky Henderson and Gary Moore in the past 
decade. Mullins’s Clondaw Warrior, narrowly beaten in the Doncaster Cup, has an 
obvious chance with Ryan Moore aboard. Oriental Fox hacked up in last year’s 
race but is not so fresh this time and would prefer fast going. Sandro 
Botticelli must have more to offer after just five outings and has been keeping 
good company. For Sir Mark Prescott, Amour De Nuit has won five of his last 
seven. He has more to prove in this company and was well beaten in a Group Two 
here last year but is going the right way.
 
Reason to be cheerful

Congratulations to thereason1986, who won our final Royal Ascot

Fighter. Thanks so much to all of you who have played our competitions during 
the week. We don’t run one today, it being a Saturday, but feel free to comment 
below if you fancy one today.

Hello and welcome to the final day of Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. It’s far from the most 
prestigious day but it is the most popular and has been a huge success since 
the track decided to extend the Royal meeting and race on Saturday.

The Diamond Jubilee Stakes (4.20pm BST) is the feature race, but there will be 
plenty of interest in the match between Frankie ‘Mr Ascot’ Dettori and Ryan 
Moore to see who comes out as top jockey. Moore might have had three winners at 
the meeting so far but has had some well-publicised reverses and knowing what a 
perfectionist he is will be determined to overhaul Dettori, who currently has 
four winners on the board.

The opening race features two of the mighty Frankel’s sons while the Wokingham 
Handicap at 5.00 is one of the big betting races of the year. We have Chris 
Cook at the track and you’ll find all the latest news and comment here where 
you won’t miss a minute of the action.
