The first reference to the Armenian genocide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/armenian-genocide> in the Manchester 
Guardian was on 24 May 1915:
 The Manchester Guardian, 24 May 1915. 
This was followed by a report from L’Humanité:

A French Report
We have received from a trustworthy source terrible news from Armenia. The 
Turkish Government and the Mussulman population are making the Armenians 
responsible for the war. Turkish regulars, aided by Kurds, brigands and the 
dregs of the population, are systematically pursuing a work of ruin and 
devastation throughout the whole ofArmenia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/armenia>. Obligatory requisitions have been 
succeeded by pillage and merciless murder and violation. All physically 
incapable men who have not been swept into the nets of the military authorities 
and all the male children have been killed. All the good-looking women and 
young girls have been carried off. No one remains in the devastated and ruined 
villages except old women.

In Constantinople and in all the Armenian centres the Government is arresting 
all persons of the educated classes, many of the clergy, and almost all the 
members of the old Armenian revolutionary party. These men have been exiled to 
Konia. The Young Turk Government is surpassing in cruelty its predecessors. In 
rage at its impending defeat it is avenging itself on the Christians in Armenia 
for its moral and political failure.

Two days later, a Guardian editorial noted that the massacres did not come as 
a surprise:
