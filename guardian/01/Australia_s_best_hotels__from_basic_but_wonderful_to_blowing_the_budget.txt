Luxury hotels! Is there anything more sublime and wasteful to spend money on? 
After the money’s spent, all that remains of the experience is pilfered 
stationery and the scent of Jo Malone bubblebath.

But then the best hotel rooms are so good you don’t want to leave, instead 
staying forever, ordering in room service and lolling about in sheets with a 
thread count that matches the rack rate and bathrobes as fluffy as roof 
insulation.

Even the most basic hotel rooms have their pleasures, though – watching TV in 
a bed that someone else has made, unwrapping little soaps (although once I 
unwrapped and ate a soap I found on my pillow, thinking it was a chocolate), 
finding the kettle to make a cup of tea after a long journey.

If I won the lottery I wouldn’t buy a mansion. Instead I’d just spend the rest 
of my life checking in and out of expensive hotels.

It’s a habit our former prime ministers have pursued: Bob Hawke lived for a 
time in the Ritz-Carlton in Double Bay, Sydney, while Ben Chifley enjoyed the 
more modest pleasures of Canberra’s Hotel Kurrajong.

Oscar Wilde spent his last days at Hotel d’Alsace in Paris and moaned at the 
end: “I am dying beyond my means.” Coco Chanel was a long-term resident of the 
Ritz in Paris. In 1937 Vogue wrote: “Just the basics are enough, when tasteful, 
to make even the most banal room personal. Mademoiselle Chanel, who has been 
staying at the Ritz for several months, is at home with a folding screen and a 
few flowers.”

So say your ship comes in, where are the best places to stay in Australia?


On Tuesday night Gourmet Traveller, after sending teams of reviewers across 
Australia, reviewed and listed what it now deems to be our best hotels.
