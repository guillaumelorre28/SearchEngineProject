Q I am a UK resident who doesn't work and I am below the tax threshold to pay 
tax on my interest and share dividend receipts. I have completed documents for 
the HM Revenue & Customs so I receive interest payments gross on bank/building 
society receipts. However, my share dividends seem to be taxed and I receive 
only the net proceeds, along with a tax voucher covering the deduction.

I filled in a tax refund form recently to recover tax paid on interest 
receipts prior to registering for gross payments, and I included on this form 
the tax paid on my share dividends. I have just received the assessment from 
the Revenue and it has not refunded the tax paid on the dividends. It told me: 
"Dividend income is taxed at 10% up to the basic rate limit and at 32.5% after 
that. There is an associated tax credit for each dividend which is set against 
the tax due - but the tax credit cannot be repaid". Who has this "tax credit" 
and is there anyway I can get it refunded?

A Non tax-paying investors in stocks and shares get a poor deal. A tax 
"credit" of 10% is automatically deducted from all dividend income. However it 
is only a "credit" if you are a higher-rate taxpayer liable to pay 32.5% tax. 
In that case you can use the "credit" to reduce the amount of tax payable by 
10% to 22.5%.

Unfortunately non-taxpayers, and standard rate taxpayers, get no benefit. The 
Revenue argues that income tax has not been deducted from the dividend paid - 
the investor has simply been given a "credit" against income tax due. This is, 
of course, an absurd claim, but it is in keeping with the Revenue's policy of 
imposing "stealth" taxes, even if they harm the less well off.
