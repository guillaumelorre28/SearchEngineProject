And so the Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> 
ends and Novak Djokovic is the champion.It was ever thus. Andy Murray played a 
great tournament but he just couldn’t drag himself out of that slump from the 
middle of the third set onwards. Djokovic showed no mercy. He rarely does. 
Still, it’s encouraging to see Murray playing these matches again. He can be 
proud of what he’s achieved over the past fortnight. But not as proud as the 
remarkable Novak Djokovic! Five Australian Opens. He’ll be back for more next 
year. Thanks for reading and sending those emails over the past fortnight. Bye.

And now it’s over to Novak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic>, who walks up to receive his 
trophy.He’s given a grand reception. How many more of these is he going to win.

“Firstly I want to return the favour and thank Andy for a great tournament,” 
Djokovic says. “I want to wish you all the best for the end of the season. Most 
of all I want to congratulate you and Kim on your engagement and wish you a 
wonderful wedding and many kids.”

Murray looks nonplussed, but Kim is  swearing  laughing. See? There are more 
important things than sport. Djokovic says he thinks about these things now 
that he’s a father.

Andy Murray steps up to receive his runners-up trophy. He musters a a weak 
smile. “Hello,” he says. “I’d like to congratulate Novak on his fifth 
Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>. Fantastic. 
Well done.” Djokovic gives him a thumbs up.

“I’d also like to thank everyone who came out the whole fortnight,” he says. 
“I’ve had amazing support here and it’s been probably my most consistent grand 
slam over my career, but I just haven’t been able to win, but I’ve had 
fantastic support, so thanks for that. I’d also like to thank my team, who are 
over down that end. We put in a lot of hard work to try and get back in that 
position after a difficult year.

“We couldn’t do it tonight but I’m a little bit closer than I was a few months 
ago. I’d also like to say thanks to the ex-player who have come to watch the 
last few weeks. It’s so amazing to play in front of all these great players. 
It’s a real privilege. I’ll try and come back next year and hopefully have a 
slightly different outcome in the final.”

And with that, he walks off with a laugh. THE MISERABLE GIT.

Murray gives Djokovic a short, sharp handshake at the net and then storms back 
to his chair. He’s livid with himself. Losing 12 of the last 13 games was not 
great. But it’s Djokovic’s day. He’s made history by becoming the first man in 
the open era to win theAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> five times. He’s some 
competitor. He celebrates by chucking his racket into the crowd. Not a bad 
memento for whoever got it.

NOVAK DJOKOVIC IS THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN CHAMPION! HE WINS 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-0

Murray locates some fleeting resistance at 15-0, hammering a backhand winner 
down the line, but it’s too little, too late. He’s out of juice. Soon it’s 
30-15 to Djokovic, before Murray nets a backhand to give Djokovic two 
championship points. A record-breaking fifthAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> is within touching 
distance. He can almost feel it in his hands. There’s one last hurdle to get 
over, though, and he prolongs the wait by drifting a backhand long, but only 
for a few seconds. Djokovic pings a forehand into the corner, romps foward and 
Murray’s backhand flies into the net. That’s it! Djokovic is the champion!

Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 5-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Djokovic is 
all over Murray now, banging a forehand down the line for a 0-15 lead. It’s 
getting a bit embarrassing now. Djokovic fancies a bagel. Murray sends a 
backhand wide to make it 0-30, before Djokovic overwhelms him to earn two more 
break points. This set has turned into aNovak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> masterclass, which is 
utterly out of keeping with the rest of the match. Murray’s head is gone. He 
calls for HawkEye when a Djokovic goes deep with a forehand, but the shot was 
right on the baseline, which means it’s Djokovic’s point. Murray was already 
walking back to his chair as HawkEye whirred into action and he looks like he’s 
about to burst into tears. “As I’m not watching on telly, your words are my 
only source. Murray’s winning bigtime, yes?!” says Andrew Benton. “Go on, you 
know you want to...”

Fourth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 4-0 Murray (*denotes server): The Murray 
from the first two and a half sets is nowhere to be seen, replaced by this 
leggy, weary, sad version that doesn’t have a hope against a rampantNovak 
Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic>. Maybe that leads 
to some complacency from Djokovic, who lets Murray take this game to deuce when 
he had it in the bag at 40-15. Djokovic slaps himself across the chops, furious 
himself for some poor shot selection, and then jams Murray with a second serve 
that allows him to punch a forehand away. A huge forehand seals Djokovic’s 
seventh consecutive game.

Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 3-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray is 
fading fast. His forehand is betraying him. It’s supposed to be his closest 
friend, but it’s quickly becoming his worst enemy. They’re going to have to sit 
down and have a serious chat about what’s gone wrong. And now his backhand’s at 
it too, the ball flopping into the net at 15-all. Then it’s back to the 
forehand. Djokovic has two break points and Murray is starting to feel dizzy. 
Djokovic knows he’s wounded. He raps a backhand return away and it’s hard to 
see Djokovic throwing this away. Murray buries his face in his towel.

Fourth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 2-0 Murray (*denotes server): Everything 
Djokovic hits is clipping the line at the moment. It’s tough for Murray out 
there. He’s going to have to fight like he’s never fought before. Although 
here’s some amusement at 40-15. Murray tries to lob Djokovic. His overhead hits 
the top of the net and drops delicately on to Murray’s side. Murray flicks it 
back and Djokovic just knocks it wide. But then Murray wonks a forehand long 
when he had Djokovic right where he wanted him. Djokovic is closing in on 
victory.

Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 1-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Two 
suspiciously tired forehands from Murray give Djokovic a 15-30 lead, and at 
30-all Djokovic clubs a huge forehand return past Murray to earn a break point. 
Murray is entering choppy waters - and he nets another forehand to gift 
Djokovic the break, which is pretty much the last thing he needed to do. 
“Imagine a long stream of expletives here,” says Kara Gone. “He’s gonna lose it 
ain’t he? Tell me Jacob, why do I always chose the difficult one to root for? 
Why?I look at those people with their Federers and their Barcelonas and all and 
envy them.It’s not like life is not stressful enough already. Then why? Why I 
ask you.”

NOVAK DJOKOVIC WINS THE THIRD SET 6-3; HE LEADS 7-6, 6-7, 6-3

If you think this is going to be simple, you’re an idiot; Djokovic loses the 
first point of the game by netting a backhand. But Murray’s forehand lets him 
down on three successive points, handing Djokovic two set points. Murray’s 
picking an unfortunate time to dip. Djokovic sends a serve out wide and a 
stretching Murray can only send his forehand past the baseline. Oh. The third 
set is over. It was quite simple actually. Maybe I’m the idiot.

Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 5-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Another dangerous 
game for Murray - although every game is fraught with danger at this point - 
and he loses the first two points, knocking a backhand and a forehand wide. 
“It’s so unhelpful!” he cries. “So unhelpful! So unhelpful.” He needs to help 
himself by winning this point. But he can’t. A poor volley is a gimme for 
Djokovic and he whacks a forehand past him. More shouting from Murray. Three 
break points. He saves the first, Djokovic blocking a return long, but then he 
double-faults! Oh dear. Djokovic will serve for the third set. That was a 
dismal game from Murray, who tosses his racket to the ground.

Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 4-3 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic wallops 
a forehand long on the first point. 0-15. What next? Your guess is as good as 
mine. It turns out two aces are next, but a stonking return from Murray then 
sets him up for a leaping overhead for 30-all, before he crashes a forehand 
down the line to earn a break point. Djokovic stands firm. He pulls Murray 
forward with a volley and Murray can only drill his backhand into the net, 
before almost hurtling into the ballboy who’s sitting next to the net. That 
could have been a disaster! But thankfully, Murray avoids him. The game goes to 
deuce and Djokovic holds. “Tennis puns,” announces Gordon Inglis. “Djokovic is 
currently having a bit of (Leonardo) Mayer. With regards to his supposed 
ailments, he (Tommy) Haas done this before. I really have to (Sam) Querrey his 
gamesmanship.”

Enjoy.

Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 3-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray could do 
with halting Djokovic’s momentum here and this is a mighty game from him, three 
serene points setting up a 40-0 lead. Murray polishes it off with an ace down 
the middle. Djokovic lets it whizz by. He doesn’t need to waste any unnecessary 
effort.

Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 3-2 Murray (*denotes server): Murray was up a 
break at the start of the second set, but he came back to win four straight 
games, and this third set is starting to fall into a similar pattern. Then 
again, I was busy writing that when he was up 30-0, failing to realise that 
Murray was plotting a charge back to 30-all. This is a tricky game for 
Djokovic, but Murray can’t sustain it, and Djokovic whips a forehand down the 
line to hold. Murray is now swearing a lot. He loves a good old swear. 
Personally, I am outraged.

Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 2-2 Murray* (*denotes server): “Come on! Come 
on!” The words ofAndy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> as 
Djokovic leaps into a second serve and bullets a blistering forehand past him. 
Every point feels crucial. Every point feels like the most important. Djokovic 
seizes a 0-30 lead when Murray nets a forehand. He’s rousing himself and Murray 
hands over two break points when he nets a backhand. “Don’t worry about it,” 
says Murray, “he does it all the time.” No idea what he’s on about. He saves 
the first break point with an ace, but back comes Djokovic, dragging himself 
back into the set when the net again stands in the way of Murray’s hopes and 
dreams.

Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 1-2 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic speeds 
into a 40-0 lead thanks to some solid serving and then seals the game with an 
accurate backhand down the line. I fancy that around 1,056 twists and turns are 
on the way. That’s a rough estimate, but I think I’m close to the right figure. 
Djokovic won’t be panicking. He knows how to break Murray.

Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 0-2 Murray* (*denotes server): Biff! Bash! Bosh! 
Murray holds to love. “Novak Djokovic is a classic case of beware a wounded 
animal,” says Mark Puttick. “Or at least, an animal that is clearly pretending 
to be wounded for purposes psychological ploys.”

Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 0-1 Murray (*denotes server): Are you tired? I 
bet you’re tired. I’m tired. You would finish most matches in the time it’s 
taken these two to get through two sets and there are at least two more to go. 
So, if you’re feeling knackered, imagine how Murray and Djokovic are feeling. 
Pretty. Damn. Knackered. Maybe Djokovic is feeling it a bit more at the moment, 
a limp forehand into the net giving Murray two break points at 15-40. Murray 
hangs in there and Djokovic slips and nets a forehand. Murray breaks! But I’m 
not going to get excited because I have watchedNovak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> play tennis before. He’s 
come back from worse.

ANDY MURRAY WINS THE SECOND SET 7-6 TO LEVEL THE FINAL!

Second-set tie-break: Djokovic* 4-7 Murray (*denotes server): A delightful 
forehand return down the line from Murray is too much even for Djokovic! He’s 
done it! The final is level! I am tired! That took 80 minutes to settle. My

Second-set tie-break: Djokovic 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray starts 
with an ace! Djokovic claims it clipped the top of the net. “Everybody heard 
it!” he shouts. The umpire heard nothing. Nor did his machine.

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-6 Murray (*denotes server): These two 
preposterous fellows pack a full five-set match into the first point, which 
ends with Murray whistling a backhand inches wide. Djokovic holds to love, 
arrowing a backhand from left to right. Tie-break time. “These two are 
incredible, so absolutely stressing and marvellous to watch that I couldn´t 
bear it anymore and went out to have coffee,” says Diana Badder. “It looks like 
they’ll still be at it at teatime, like two dogs with a bone. Hope you have 
your victuals ready to keep you going!”

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 5-6 Murray* (*denotes server): Sitting to my right, 
Daniel Harris concurs when I turn to him and say that Djokovic is going to 
break here. “It reeks of it,” he says. But Murray’s doing his best to hold his 
nose. At 15-all, his forehand clips the top of the net. Djokovic drop-shots 
him. He lobs him. The ball goes long and Murray is running around pumping his 
fist as if he’s won the tournament and been told he’s got free steak for life. 
But then Djokovic rips into a second serve to make it 30-all, before clubbing a 
splendid forehand down the line to earn a break point. It’s positively reeking 
of it. Murray saves it with a big serve down the middle, but Djokovic carves 
out another with a smooth forehand down the line. Djokovic jumps into the 
attack - but, incredibly, he angles a backhand wide. He calls for HawkEye, but 
it was out and he’s got no challenges left. He’ll just have to back his talent, 
which isn’t the worst thing in the world, and Djokovic has a third set point 
when Murray nets a forehand. Murray’s response? A curving, wondrous ace down 
the middle that bends bewildering out of Djokovic’s grasp and then, despite an 
absurd defensive lob from Djokovic, Murray spanks a cracking volley past that 
flipping brilliant Serbian who’s driving him mad up the other end of the court. 
Finally, Murray holds when Djokovic sends a return long, and it’s fair to say 
that my nerves are frayed.

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 5-5 Murray (*denotes server): This Novak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> chap. He’s not bad, is he? 
He looks like he’s got no hope of winning the first point when he stumbles at 
the back of the court; instead he picks Murray off with a backhand pass. Murray 
is then furious with himself when he batters a very easy backhand volley wide 
with Djokovic stranded. He’s had his chances. He looks down and out at 40-0. 
But he hauls himself back into contention at 40-30 thanks to some stunning 
tennis. The athleticism of these guys is staggering. Djokovic should then wrap 
the game up with a backhand volley but instead of sending it down the line, he 
tees it up for Murray to pass him down the line with a backhand, forcing the 
game to deuce. Murray has won three straight points here. Two more would bring 
him the set and Djokovic then flails a forehand wide to give Murray a set 
point. Is this it? Djokovic bounces. And bounces. And bounces. And bounces a 
bit more. And serves. Murray’s in the rally, but he nets a very easy backhand; 
oh dear. Another chance goes to waste. It’s the kind of thing that makes you 
think it’s not going to be his day. But Murray can’t let himself think like 
that. He’s not going to let Djokovic wriggle clear that easily, though he 
should have another set point with a forehand pass, only to send it too long. 
Eventually Djokovic holds when Murray nets a backhand. What odds on him 
breaking now? Djokovic is seriously pumped up after surviving that game.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-5 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray needs two 
stabs at putting away an overhead at 30-0 but he gets there in the end. He 
holds to love and now Djokovic has to hold to stay in the fourth set. What a 
confusing match. “I’ll fix a cup of coffee for Andy if it will help him get 
back on his game,” says Donna Will. “Milk and sugar, love?”

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 4-4 Murray (*denotes server): You may recall that 
something similar happened in the 2013 French Open final between Rafael Nadal 
and David Ferrer. Anyway. Back to the tennis. At 15-all, Djokovic is knocked 
off-balance when a Murray return skids off the line and he hoicks a forehand 
well wide, but Murray then nets a forehand off a second serve to make it 
30-all.But then a string of deep and powerful shots from Murray force Djokovic 
back and he nets a forehand to give Murray a break point at 30-40. Murray is 
nothing if not stubborn and resilient and when he drives through a forehand 
into the left corner, Djokovic is floundering! Murray is back in it!

Once again, I reiterate: For a sport that has KNOWS what happens when 
spectators get close to players, this break of security is APPALLING.

Drama before the start of this game as someone in the crowd unfurls a banner 
with some kind of statement. I’ve got no idea what it was about, the cameras 
aren’t showing it. Security are dealing with it. They’re being escorted out, 
while the jaunty sound of Taylor Swift blares around Rod Laver Arena in the 
background. A few stewards are standing around the players. Eventually it’s all 
sorted out and play can resume.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray is all over 
the place here. He’s in danger of losing the plot, starting this game with a 
double-fault. But he digs deep, willing himself into a 40-15 lead and holds to 
30 with an ace. He’s desperately trying to gee himself back into life. After 
all, we know it’s not beyond Murray to break Djokovic. But he needs to cut out 
the errors.

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 4-2 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to 
love. He rattles an ace down the middle and although it’s called out, a 
challenge shows it was in. “Oh!” says Murray. “Oh thank you!” Four straight 
games.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 3-2 Murray* (*denotes server): Djokovic looked he 
had no energy in his legs at the start of the second set, but now he’s 
threatening to wear Murray down. He glides into a 0-30 lead when Murray drags a 
forehand wide and earns three break points thanks to a decisive return, taking 
the first with a comfortable smash. Murray is in trouble here. It was all going 
so well, but Djokovic has come roaring back to win three straight games.

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 2-2 Murray (*denotes server): This is a hard match 
to read. Just when it seems someone is about to run away with it, they start 
playing as if their shoelaces are tied together, tripping over to let the other 
man right back in it. Sure enough, Murray is quickly into a 0-30 lead and 
Djokovic’s mood darkens. But then it’s Murray’s temper that’s reaching boiling 
point when he cracks a backhand into the net at 15-30. Djokovic grins and 
Murray then completely mishits a forehand to make it 40-30. He holds when a 
Murray volley sits up invitingly, allowing him to slither a backhand past him 
and into the open court.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-2 Murray* (*denotes server): “Caarrrmmmm 
aaaarrrrrrnnnn,” yelps Murray as Djokovic nets a return for 15-0. But he looks 
like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders when Djokovic wins the 
next two points and he’s in trouble when Djokovic punishes a tame second serve 
at 30-all to earn himself a break point. Murray nets a forehand and suddenly 
Djokovic’s ankle seems fine. Break points cure any ailment, don’t they? Murray

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 0-2 Murray (*denotes server): Then again, consider 
this: Murray has never beaten Djokovic after losing the first set. Oh. Shall we 
all just go home? Well, no, but it’s going to take a supreme effort from here. 
But hang on. A few sloppy misses from Djokovic, who appears to be limping a 
bit, gives Murray two break points! Murray probably won’t be fooled by 
Djokovic’s limp, but this is a lame game from the world No1, who duffs a 
backhand into the net to give Murray the early advantage in this second set. 
“Murray must take the positives, says me, the life-coach and motivational 
expert sitting at home with a bacon roll while Andy plays his eighth Grand Slam 
final,” says Simon McMahon. “He should have won that set despite being 4-1 
down. This is ON!”

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray has to keep 
his composure. A rather peculiar first set was only settled by a few points 
here or there. It’s not like he was totally outplayed, he was just guilty of a 
couple of bad misses at bad moments. But I think he might be encouraged by the 
way that he played. It’s far from over and Murray makes a good start to this 
set, holding to 15.

NOVAK DJOKOVIC WINS THE FIRST SET 7-6!

First-set tie-break: Djokovic* 7-5 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic 
momentarily thinks he’s got an ace. It’s called out. He challenges. It was just 
wide. But it doesn’t matter. Murray nets a backhand off a second serve and 
Djokovic is eyeballing his box and has his fist in the air. It only took 72 
minutes to prise them apart.

First-set tie-break: Djokovic 6-5 Murray* (*denotes server): What a miss from 
Murray! He was at the net and had the ball on his racquet but puts a forehand 
long! A challenge isn’t going to save him. Djokovic has the first set point! 
Murray has really let this tie-break go.

And so the Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> 
ends and Novak Djokovic is the champion.It was ever thus. Andy Murray played a 
great tournament but he just couldn’t drag himself out of that slump from the 
middle of the third set onwards. Djokovic showed no mercy. He rarely does. 
Still, it’s encouraging to see Murray playing these matches again. He can be 
proud of what he’s achieved over the past fortnight. But not as proud as the 
remarkable Novak Djokovic! Five Australian Opens. He’ll be back for more next 
year. Thanks for reading and sending those emails over the past fortnight. Bye.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/feb/01/australian-open-final-2015-novak-djokovic-andy-murray> 
And now it’s over to Novak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic>, who walks up to receive his 
trophy.He’s given a grand reception. How many more of these is he going to win.

“Firstly I want to return the favour and thank Andy for a great tournament,” 
Djokovic says. “I want to wish you all the best for the end of the season. Most 
of all I want to congratulate you and Kim on your engagement and wish you a 
wonderful wedding and many kids.”

Murray looks nonplussed, but Kim is  swearing  laughing. See? There are more 
important things than sport. Djokovic says he thinks about these things now 
that he’s a father.
 
Andy Murray steps up to receive his runners-up trophy. He musters a a weak 
smile. “Hello,” he says. “I’d like to congratulate Novak on his fifth 
Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>. Fantastic. 
Well done.” Djokovic gives him a thumbs up.

“I’d also like to thank everyone who came out the whole fortnight,” he says. 
“I’ve had amazing support here and it’s been probably my most consistent grand 
slam over my career, but I just haven’t been able to win, but I’ve had 
fantastic support, so thanks for that. I’d also like to thank my team, who are 
over down that end. We put in a lot of hard work to try and get back in that 
position after a difficult year.

“We couldn’t do it tonight but I’m a little bit closer than I was a few months 
ago. I’d also like to say thanks to the ex-player who have come to watch the 
last few weeks. It’s so amazing to play in front of all these great players. 
It’s a real privilege. I’ll try and come back next year and hopefully have a 
slightly different outcome in the final.”

And with that, he walks off with a laugh. THE MISERABLE GIT. 
 
We’re going to hear a word or 17,000 from the sponsors. This is it. This is 
what everyone was waiting for.
 
It’s time for the trophy presentation. This is probably going to last longer 
than the match itself.
 
Murray gives Djokovic a short, sharp handshake at the net and then storms back 
to his chair. He’s livid with himself. Losing 12 of the last 13 games was not 
great. But it’s Djokovic’s day. He’s made history by becoming the first man in 
the open era to win theAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> five times. He’s some 
competitor. He celebrates by chucking his racket into the crowd. Not a bad 
memento for whoever got it.
 
Murray locates some fleeting resistance at 15-0, hammering a backhand winner 
down the line, but it’s too little, too late. He’s out of juice. Soon it’s 
30-15 to Djokovic, before Murray nets a backhand to give Djokovic two 
championship points. A record-breaking fifthAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> is within touching 
distance. He can almost feel it in his hands. There’s one last hurdle to get 
over, though, and he prolongs the wait by drifting a backhand long, but only 
for a few seconds. Djokovic pings a forehand into the corner, romps foward and 
Murray’s backhand flies into the net. That’s it! Djokovic is the champion!

Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 5-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Djokovic is 
all over Murray now, banging a forehand down the line for a 0-15 lead. It’s 
getting a bit embarrassing now. Djokovic fancies a bagel. Murray sends a 
backhand wide to make it 0-30, before Djokovic overwhelms him to earn two more 
break points. This set has turned into aNovak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> masterclass, which is 
utterly out of keeping with the rest of the match. Murray’s head is gone. He 
calls for HawkEye when a Djokovic goes deep with a forehand, but the shot was 
right on the baseline, which means it’s Djokovic’s point. Murray was already 
walking back to his chair as HawkEye whirred into action and he looks like he’s 
about to burst into tears. “As I’m not watching on telly, your words are my 
only source. Murray’s winning bigtime, yes?!” says Andrew Benton. “Go on, you 
know you want to...”
 
Fourth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 4-0 Murray (*denotes server): The Murray 
from the first two and a half sets is nowhere to be seen, replaced by this 
leggy, weary, sad version that doesn’t have a hope against a rampantNovak 
Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic>. Maybe that leads 
to some complacency from Djokovic, who lets Murray take this game to deuce when 
he had it in the bag at 40-15. Djokovic slaps himself across the chops, furious 
himself for some poor shot selection, and then jams Murray with a second serve 
that allows him to punch a forehand away. A huge forehand seals Djokovic’s 
seventh consecutive game.

Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 3-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray is 
fading fast. His forehand is betraying him. It’s supposed to be his closest 
friend, but it’s quickly becoming his worst enemy. They’re going to have to sit 
down and have a serious chat about what’s gone wrong. And now his backhand’s at 
it too, the ball flopping into the net at 15-all. Then it’s back to the 
forehand. Djokovic has two break points and Murray is starting to feel dizzy. 
Djokovic knows he’s wounded. He raps a backhand return away and it’s hard to 
see Djokovic throwing this away. Murray buries his face in his towel.
 
Fourth set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 2-0 Murray (*denotes server): Everything 
Djokovic hits is clipping the line at the moment. It’s tough for Murray out 
there. He’s going to have to fight like he’s never fought before. Although 
here’s some amusement at 40-15. Murray tries to lob Djokovic. His overhead hits 
the top of the net and drops delicately on to Murray’s side. Murray flicks it 
back and Djokovic just knocks it wide. But then Murray wonks a forehand long 
when he had Djokovic right where he wanted him. Djokovic is closing in on 
victory.

Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 1-0 Murray* (*denotes server): Two 
suspiciously tired forehands from Murray give Djokovic a 15-30 lead, and at 
30-all Djokovic clubs a huge forehand return past Murray to earn a break point. 
Murray is entering choppy waters - and he nets another forehand to gift 
Djokovic the break, which is pretty much the last thing he needed to do. 
“Imagine a long stream of expletives here,” says Kara Gone. “He’s gonna lose it 
ain’t he? Tell me Jacob, why do I always chose the difficult one to root for? 
Why?I look at those people with their Federers and their Barcelonas and all and 
envy them.It’s not like life is not stressful enough already. Then why? Why I 
ask you.”
 
If you think this is going to be simple, you’re an idiot; Djokovic loses the 
first point of the game by netting a backhand. But Murray’s forehand lets him 
down on three successive points, handing Djokovic two set points. Murray’s 
picking an unfortunate time to dip. Djokovic sends a serve out wide and a 
stretching Murray can only send his forehand past the baseline. Oh. The third 
set is over. It was quite simple actually. Maybe I’m the idiot.

Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 5-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Another dangerous 
game for Murray - although every game is fraught with danger at this point - 
and he loses the first two points, knocking a backhand and a forehand wide. 
“It’s so unhelpful!” he cries. “So unhelpful! So unhelpful.” He needs to help 
himself by winning this point. But he can’t. A poor volley is a gimme for 
Djokovic and he whacks a forehand past him. More shouting from Murray. Three 
break points. He saves the first, Djokovic blocking a return long, but then he 
double-faults! Oh dear. Djokovic will serve for the third set. That was a 
dismal game from Murray, who tosses his racket to the ground.
 
Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 4-3 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic wallops 
a forehand long on the first point. 0-15. What next? Your guess is as good as 
mine. It turns out two aces are next, but a stonking return from Murray then 
sets him up for a leaping overhead for 30-all, before he crashes a forehand 
down the line to earn a break point. Djokovic stands firm. He pulls Murray 
forward with a volley and Murray can only drill his backhand into the net, 
before almost hurtling into the ballboy who’s sitting next to the net. That 
could have been a disaster! But thankfully, Murray avoids him. The game goes to 
deuce and Djokovic holds. “Tennis puns,” announces Gordon Inglis. “Djokovic is 
currently having a bit of (Leonardo) Mayer. With regards to his supposed 
ailments, he (Tommy) Haas done this before. I really have to (Sam) Querrey his 
gamesmanship.”

Enjoy.
 
Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 3-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray could do 
with halting Djokovic’s momentum here and this is a mighty game from him, three 
serene points setting up a 40-0 lead. Murray polishes it off with an ace down 
the middle. Djokovic lets it whizz by. He doesn’t need to waste any unnecessary 
effort.
 
Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 3-2 Murray (*denotes server): Murray was up a 
break at the start of the second set, but he came back to win four straight 
games, and this third set is starting to fall into a similar pattern. Then 
again, I was busy writing that when he was up 30-0, failing to realise that 
Murray was plotting a charge back to 30-all. This is a tricky game for 
Djokovic, but Murray can’t sustain it, and Djokovic whips a forehand down the 
line to hold. Murray is now swearing a lot. He loves a good old swear. 
Personally, I am outraged.
 
Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 2-2 Murray* (*denotes server): “Come on! Come 
on!” The words ofAndy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> as 
Djokovic leaps into a second serve and bullets a blistering forehand past him. 
Every point feels crucial. Every point feels like the most important. Djokovic 
seizes a 0-30 lead when Murray nets a forehand. He’s rousing himself and Murray 
hands over two break points when he nets a backhand. “Don’t worry about it,” 
says Murray, “he does it all the time.” No idea what he’s on about. He saves 
the first break point with an ace, but back comes Djokovic, dragging himself 
back into the set when the net again stands in the way of Murray’s hopes and 
dreams.
 
Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 1-2 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic speeds 
into a 40-0 lead thanks to some solid serving and then seals the game with an 
accurate backhand down the line. I fancy that around 1,056 twists and turns are 
on the way. That’s a rough estimate, but I think I’m close to the right figure. 
Djokovic won’t be panicking. He knows how to break Murray.
 
Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 0-2 Murray* (*denotes server): Biff! Bash! Bosh! 
Murray holds to love. “Novak Djokovic is a classic case of beware a wounded 
animal,” says Mark Puttick. “Or at least, an animal that is clearly pretending 
to be wounded for purposes psychological ploys.”

Third set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 0-1 Murray (*denotes server): Are you tired? I 
bet you’re tired. I’m tired. You would finish most matches in the time it’s 
taken these two to get through two sets and there are at least two more to go. 
So, if you’re feeling knackered, imagine how Murray and Djokovic are feeling. 
Pretty. Damn. Knackered. Maybe Djokovic is feeling it a bit more at the moment, 
a limp forehand into the net giving Murray two break points at 15-40. Murray 
hangs in there and Djokovic slips and nets a forehand. Murray breaks! But I’m 
not going to get excited because I have watchedNovak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> play tennis before. He’s 
come back from worse.
 
Second-set tie-break: Djokovic* 4-7 Murray (*denotes server): A delightful 
forehand return down the line from Murray is too much even for Djokovic! He’s 
done it! The final is level! I am tired! That took 80 minutes to settle. My 
word.

a smash away. Murray has seen two set points come and go.
 
Second-set tie-break: Djokovic 3-6 Murray* (*denotes server): Djokovic just 
gets his return over the net and Murray charges forward and wallops a backhand 
too far!

backhand long and Murray has four set points!

Second-set tie-break: Djokovic 1-4 Murray* (*denotes server): Djokovic hooks a

Second-set tie-break: Djokovic* 0-2 Murray (*denotes server): This point takes 
around 45 minutes to finish and Djokovic eventually fires a forehand long!
 
Second-set tie-break: Djokovic 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray starts 
with an ace! Djokovic claims it clipped the top of the net. “Everybody heard 
it!” he shouts. The umpire heard nothing. Nor did his machine.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-6 Murray (*denotes server): These two 
preposterous fellows pack a full five-set match into the first point, which 
ends with Murray whistling a backhand inches wide. Djokovic holds to love, 
arrowing a backhand from left to right. Tie-break time. “These two are 
incredible, so absolutely stressing and marvellous to watch that I couldn´t 
bear it anymore and went out to have coffee,” says Diana Badder. “It looks like 
they’ll still be at it at teatime, like two dogs with a bone. Hope you have 
your victuals ready to keep you going!”
 
Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 5-6 Murray* (*denotes server): Sitting to my right, 
Daniel Harris concurs when I turn to him and say that Djokovic is going to 
break here. “It reeks of it,” he says. But Murray’s doing his best to hold his 
nose. At 15-all, his forehand clips the top of the net. Djokovic drop-shots 
him. He lobs him. The ball goes long and Murray is running around pumping his 
fist as if he’s won the tournament and been told he’s got free steak for life. 
But then Djokovic rips into a second serve to make it 30-all, before clubbing a 
splendid forehand down the line to earn a break point. It’s positively reeking 
of it. Murray saves it with a big serve down the middle, but Djokovic carves 
out another with a smooth forehand down the line. Djokovic jumps into the 
attack - but, incredibly, he angles a backhand wide. He calls for HawkEye, but 
it was out and he’s got no challenges left. He’ll just have to back his talent, 
which isn’t the worst thing in the world, and Djokovic has a third set point 
when Murray nets a forehand. Murray’s response? A curving, wondrous ace down 
the middle that bends bewildering out of Djokovic’s grasp and then, despite an 
absurd defensive lob from Djokovic, Murray spanks a cracking volley past that 
flipping brilliant Serbian who’s driving him mad up the other end of the court. 
Finally, Murray holds when Djokovic sends a return long, and it’s fair to say 
that my nerves are frayed.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 5-5 Murray (*denotes server): This Novak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> chap. He’s not bad, is he? 
He looks like he’s got no hope of winning the first point when he stumbles at 
the back of the court; instead he picks Murray off with a backhand pass. Murray 
is then furious with himself when he batters a very easy backhand volley wide 
with Djokovic stranded. He’s had his chances. He looks down and out at 40-0. 
But he hauls himself back into contention at 40-30 thanks to some stunning 
tennis. The athleticism of these guys is staggering. Djokovic should then wrap 
the game up with a backhand volley but instead of sending it down the line, he 
tees it up for Murray to pass him down the line with a backhand, forcing the 
game to deuce. Murray has won three straight points here. Two more would bring 
him the set and Djokovic then flails a forehand wide to give Murray a set 
point. Is this it? Djokovic bounces. And bounces. And bounces. And bounces a 
bit more. And serves. Murray’s in the rally, but he nets a very easy backhand; 
oh dear. Another chance goes to waste. It’s the kind of thing that makes you 
think it’s not going to be his day. But Murray can’t let himself think like 
that. He’s not going to let Djokovic wriggle clear that easily, though he 
should have another set point with a forehand pass, only to send it too long. 
Eventually Djokovic holds when Murray nets a backhand. What odds on him 
breaking now? Djokovic is seriously pumped up after surviving that game.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-5 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray needs two 
stabs at putting away an overhead at 30-0 but he gets there in the end. He 
holds to love and now Djokovic has to hold to stay in the fourth set. What a 
confusing match. “I’ll fix a cup of coffee for Andy if it will help him get 
back on his game,” says Donna Will. “Milk and sugar, love?”
 Andy Murray reacts. Photograph: Thomas Peter/Reuters  
Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 4-4 Murray (*denotes server): You may recall that 
something similar happened in the 2013 French Open final between Rafael Nadal 
and David Ferrer. Anyway. Back to the tennis. At 15-all, Djokovic is knocked 
off-balance when a Murray return skids off the line and he hoicks a forehand 
well wide, but Murray then nets a forehand off a second serve to make it 
30-all.But then a string of deep and powerful shots from Murray force Djokovic 
back and he nets a forehand to give Murray a break point at 30-40. Murray is 
nothing if not stubborn and resilient and when he drives through a forehand 
into the left corner, Djokovic is floundering! Murray is back in it!

Drama before the start of this game as someone in the crowd unfurls a banner 
with some kind of statement. I’ve got no idea what it was about, the cameras 
aren’t showing it. Security are dealing with it. They’re being escorted out, 
while the jaunty sound of Taylor Swift blares around Rod Laver Arena in the 
background. A few stewards are standing around the players. Eventually it’s all 
sorted out and play can resume.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray is all over 
the place here. He’s in danger of losing the plot, starting this game with a 
double-fault. But he digs deep, willing himself into a 40-15 lead and holds to 
30 with an ace. He’s desperately trying to gee himself back into life. After 
all, we know it’s not beyond Murray to break Djokovic. But he needs to cut out 
the errors.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 4-2 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to 
love. He rattles an ace down the middle and although it’s called out, a 
challenge shows it was in. “Oh!” says Murray. “Oh thank you!” Four straight 
games.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 3-2 Murray* (*denotes server): Djokovic looked he 
had no energy in his legs at the start of the second set, but now he’s 
threatening to wear Murray down. He glides into a 0-30 lead when Murray drags a 
forehand wide and earns three break points thanks to a decisive return, taking 
the first with a comfortable smash. Murray is in trouble here. It was all going 
so well, but Djokovic has come roaring back to win three straight games.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 2-2 Murray (*denotes server): This is a hard match 
to read. Just when it seems someone is about to run away with it, they start 
playing as if their shoelaces are tied together, tripping over to let the other 
man right back in it. Sure enough, Murray is quickly into a 0-30 lead and 
Djokovic’s mood darkens. But then it’s Murray’s temper that’s reaching boiling 
point when he cracks a backhand into the net at 15-30. Djokovic grins and 
Murray then completely mishits a forehand to make it 40-30. He holds when a 
Murray volley sits up invitingly, allowing him to slither a backhand past him 
and into the open court.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-2 Murray* (*denotes server): “Caarrrmmmm 
aaaarrrrrrnnnn,” yelps Murray as Djokovic nets a return for 15-0. But he looks 
like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders when Djokovic wins the 
next two points and he’s in trouble when Djokovic punishes a tame second serve 
at 30-all to earn himself a break point. Murray nets a forehand and suddenly 
Djokovic’s ankle seems fine. Break points cure any ailment, don’t they? Murray 
is seething. That’s a blow.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 0-2 Murray (*denotes server): Then again, consider 
this: Murray has never beaten Djokovic after losing the first set. Oh. Shall we 
all just go home? Well, no, but it’s going to take a supreme effort from here. 
But hang on. A few sloppy misses from Djokovic, who appears to be limping a 
bit, gives Murray two break points! Murray probably won’t be fooled by 
Djokovic’s limp, but this is a lame game from the world No1, who duffs a 
backhand into the net to give Murray the early advantage in this second set. 
“Murray must take the positives, says me, the life-coach and motivational 
expert sitting at home with a bacon roll while Andy plays his eighth Grand Slam 
final,” says Simon McMahon. “He should have won that set despite being 4-1 
down. This is ON!”

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray has to keep 
his composure. A rather peculiar first set was only settled by a few points 
here or there. It’s not like he was totally outplayed, he was just guilty of a 
couple of bad misses at bad moments. But I think he might be encouraged by the 
way that he played. It’s far from over and Murray makes a good start to this 
set, holding to 15.
 
First-set tie-break: Djokovic* 7-5 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic 
momentarily thinks he’s got an ace. It’s called out. He challenges. It was just 
wide. But it doesn’t matter. Murray nets a backhand off a second serve and 
Djokovic is eyeballing his box and has his fist in the air. It only took 72 
minutes to prise them apart.

First-set tie-break: Djokovic 6-5 Murray* (*denotes server): What a miss from 
Murray! He was at the net and had the ball on his racquet but puts a forehand 
long! A challenge isn’t going to save him. Djokovic has the first set point! 
Murray has really let this tie-break go.
 
First-set tie-break: Djokovic 5-5 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray belts a
