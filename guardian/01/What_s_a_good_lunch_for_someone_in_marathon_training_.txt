My fiance is training for a marathon, and has no facilities at work for 
heating up/assembling lunch: can you suggest anything healthy, filling and easy 
to eat at a desk (apart from pasta and sandwiches)? Isis Stafford, London

You need to get your nutrition right if you're training for a marathon, and 
your fiance will need to up the carbs. I'd suggest getting into some of the 
lesser-used carbs such as buckwheat, spelt, lentils and quinoa. These are great 
vehicles for all the salad and vegetables you could wish for.

How about (gluten-free) buckwheat pancakes? These can be prepared in stacks, 
frozen and thawed each morning as required and they provide a good base for 
some interesting lunches. For four generous pancakes, you'll need 115g 
buckwheat flour, 1 egg, 20g melted butter, a pinch of salt and 275ml milk. Beat 
the egg and the milk together, whisk in the flour and salt, then gently whisk 
in the butter.

Ladle the batter into a hot frying pan with a little butter and cook for 3 
minutes on each size. Once chilled, freeze as required.

In the morning, fill them with pre-grilled slices of aubergine (or other 
pre-roasted veg), mozzarella and pesto. Roll them up and eat them after your 
run like a wrap. Cream cheese, chopped herbs and cooked flaked smoked haddock 
also work.

If eating cold grains such as quinoa and spelt, cook them with stock and stir 
through a tapenade before loading with veg and salad. This will keep your 
lunches lively. Likewise, try cooking your lentils with diced celery, carrot 
and shallots. When they're done stir in some lightly sauteed eating apple then 
spike with some Dijon mustard and a little red wine vinegar. Delicious cold and 
topped with grilled chicken.
