A number of families have been evacuated from their homes because of a 
continuing security alert in the south of CountyArmagh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/armagh> close to the border with the Irish 
Republic.

Army technical officers have been dealing with a suspicious device that was 
found near a road in the area yesterday.

Six houses had to be evacuated after the device, a beer keg with wires 
attached, was found by a member of the public alongside the Castleblaney road 
in Keady.

A bomb warning with a recognised codeword used by republican dissidents was 
given to a local newsroom this week.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland <> cordoned off a five-mile stretch of 
the Castleblaney road after the discovery of the keg.

Meanwhile, a man was still being questioned today over the attempted bombing 
of Keady police station in February, when a suspicious vehicle was abandoned in 
Davis Street near the building. The 39-year-old was arrested in the Lurgan 
area, the PSNI confirmed.
