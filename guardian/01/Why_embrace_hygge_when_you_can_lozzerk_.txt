I’m 55 and, like the people in your article (‘I have more fun now than I did 
when I was 20’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/16/fun-in-50s-ucl-study-long-life>
, 17 December), I too have a positive outlook on life. I work full-time and 
every week I swim, go to the gym, do pilates, cycle, go for long walks, do 
voluntary work and have my granddaughter to stay over for a night. I’m also 
studying for two qualifications. Unfortunately, my self-employed husband and I 
will never be able to afford to retire, so I can’t agree with Ashley Naylor’s 
suggestion (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/16/uks-gambling-culture-must-be-challenged>
, 17 December) of scrapping the lottery; it’s the only, albeit faint, hope we 
have of not working until we drop.

• My father, a Cheshire man, used the dialect word “lozzerk” for the English 
version of the now fashionable hygge (Bring some hygge to work 
<https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/dec/16/end-of-year-burnout-bring-hygge-work-productivity>
, theguardian.com, 16 December). For example, we would lozzerk on the sofa on a 
Sunday evening to watch the classic serial on TV. Lozzerking involved the whole 
family, with absence not really allowed, so that as a teenager in my bedroom I 
would hear him ask where I was, not at ease to lozzerk without the family 
circle being complete.

• Jimmy Hibbert (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/16/buckfast-malt-extract-and-antisocial-daleks>
, 17 December) attributes the speculation regarding the appearance of WH 
Auden’s scrotum to Noël Coward. It has also been attributed to David Hockney, 
supposedly following a meeting between the playwright and the painter. Since 
Hockney is still with us, and given the importance of getting the historical 
record straight, perhaps he should be consulted.
