The Police Service of Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> (PSNI) said tonight it has 
rescued 20 people who were potential people trafficking victims.

The Romanian nationals were rescued at different two locations in County Armagh
 <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/armagh>, a PSNI spokesman said.

The police said they found 14 men and six women aged between 20 and 48.

As part of an investigation into exploitation of workers in the food 
production industry, which a spokesman said had been running since last 
Wednesday, three men, aged 23, 27 and 31, were arrested in counties Antrim and 
Armagh.

The three suspects are being questioned on suspicion of human trafficking, 
forced labour and slavery and money laundering.

Police have also been liaising with the Gangmasters Licensing Authority 
<http://www.gla.gov.uk/> in this investigation.

Detective Inspector Todd Clements, from the PSNI's organised crime branch, 
said: "This has been a fast-moving and complex operation which may continue for 
some time.

"The 20 people we have identified as potential victims of human trafficking 
for labour exploitation are in places of safety now. Our inquiries are 
continuing."

Police added that they have also liaised with the UK Human Trafficking Centre 
and other agencies to make sure the potential victims are safe.

The PSNI said in a statement on Monday: "Additional translators have been 
flown to Northern Ireland from England to cope with the number of victims 
involved and the volume of information which needs to be processed."

Devolved justice minister David Ford warned earlier this year in an interview 
with the Guardian that the majority of those illegally trafficked into Northern 
Ireland were probably beingexploited as low paid, illegal labour in industries 
such as catering and agriculture

.

TV adverts are currently being broadcast on Northern Ireland commercial 
television by the Home Office detailing exploitation in the sex industry, 
agriculture and domestic slavery.

The Human Trafficking Foundation charity estimates 20,000 people are working 
in slavery in the UK and says that number is rising.
