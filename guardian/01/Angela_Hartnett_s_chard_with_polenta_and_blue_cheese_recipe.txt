It's lovely to eat out and get inspired by other chefs. This idea came from a 
great dish I had at Zucca in London recently – it's really simply done, so 
delicious, and makes a fabulous starter or main. You can get extravagant and 
serve it with a fried duck egg on top.

Serves 2 as a main
300g swiss chard, leaves and stalks blanched 
300ml milk
50g butter
300g polenta flour
100g gorgonzola or stichelton
Pinch of salt
Freshly milled black pepper, to serve

Blanch the chard in boiling water, drain, chop lightly and leave to one side 
(the stalks will need longer to blanch and should be lightly peeled).

Put the milk and butter in a large pan with a pinch of salt and bring to the 
boil. Turn down to a simmer and add the polenta flour, gradually, whisking 
continuously to avoid lumps.

Cook the polenta according to packet instructions: the coarser type takes 
longer – about 20 minutes compared to five – requires more attention and 
stirring, but in my opinion is far better. When the mixture has reached a 
pouring consistency, transfer it into a serving dish.

Add the chard, divide some knobs of the cheese on top and place under a medium 
grill until it starts to bubble.

Finish with the pepper and serve immediately.
