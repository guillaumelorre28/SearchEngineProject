Ah, Christmas lunch: strange brown foods served up at odd hours of the day: 
3.50pm, for example. Large birds, soggy veg, pork wrapped in more pork and 
things you never eat at any other time of year, such as sprouts. Sprouts! And 
all of it smeared in gravy and speckled in some of that stuffing stuff that 
looks and tastes like wool. Paper hats, plastic tat on your sideplate and jokes 
you’ve not heard since last Christmas.Kate Bush

inside a steaming pudding. Lovely.

But probably anachronistic. Like just about everything, Christmas lunch has 
changed. Turkey’s too dry apparently. People are tryingwild boar samosas

. These days my brother-in-law brings his own quinoa. A shamelessly 
unscientific survey I just took of three people who happened to be within 
earshot found that none even has a formal Christmas lunch. “Everybody knows a 
turkey and some mistletoe can help to make the season bright”, the crooners 
sing. But they don’t know what they’re talking about. Or singing about.

The only people who do are you. So help us build up a picture of Europe’s 
Christmas meal. What will be on your plate this year? Is it traditional fare 
washed down with a light Burgundy? Or just a slice of toast ? Does anyone 
actually like swede? And what’s it to be: panettone orChristmas
