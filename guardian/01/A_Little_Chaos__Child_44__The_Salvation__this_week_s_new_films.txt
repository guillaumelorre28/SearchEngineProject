The traditions, and cliches, of British costume drama are grafted on to French 
history in this fairly orthodox tale of an unorthodox landscape gardener. 
Winslet’s wild designs shake up Louis XIV’s clipped Versailles, hunky 
landscaper Schoenaerts in particular. The result is somewhere between Dangerous 
Liaisons and Gardeners’ Question Time.

Child 44 (15) 
(Daniel Espinosa, 2015, US/UK/Cze/Rom) Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman. 137 mins

Non-Russians put on their accents for a dense, fact-based thriller detailing 
the hunt for a postwar Soviet serial killer – hampered by the authorities’ 
refusal to admit that murder itself exists.

The Salvation (15) 
(Kristian Levring, 2014, Den/UK/SA/Swe/Bel) Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green. 92 mins

A solid, Nordic take on western conventions, as Mikkelsen takes a stand, High 
Noon-style, against a tyrannical gang leader.

The Last Five Years (12A) 
(Richard LaGravenese, 2014, US) Anna Kendrick, Jeremy Jordan. 92 mins

Kendrick’s singing and acting strengths are to the fore in this dissection of 
a failed romance – which doesn’t have many other strengths.

The Town That Dreaded Sundown (15) 
(Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, 2014, US) Addison Timlin, Veronica Cartwright. 84 mins

Generic small-town slasher remake with meta references to the 1976 original.


Glassland (15) 
(Gerard Barrett, 2014, Ire) Jack Reynor, Toni Collette, Will Poulter. 93 mins

Reynor stands out in a powerful Irish indie, playing a hard-up taxi driver 
facing difficult choices to support his alcoholic mother (an equally forceful 
Collette).


Home From Home: Chronicle Of A Vision (15) 
(Edgar Reitz, 2013, Ger/Fra) Jan Dieter Schneider, Maximilian Scheidt, Marita 
Breuer. 231 mins

Accomplished sort-of prequel to Reitz’s towering Heimat series, faithfully 
chronicling village life in 19th century Germany.


Amar Akbar & Tony (15) 
(Atul Malhotra, 2015, UK) Rez Kempton, Sam Vincenti, Martin Delaney. 96 mins

Cheery Hounslow-set multicultural comedy.

Father-son drama with a non-judgmental eye for Colombia’s rich-poor divide.

Cry Of The City (12A) 
(Robert Siodmak, 1948, US) Victor Mature, Richard Conte, Shelley Winters. 91 
mins

Atmospheric cop/killer noir capturing a New York Italian-American 
neighbourhood.

103 mins

Tin (12A) 
(Bill Scott, 2014, UK) Jenny Agutter, Dudley Sutton. 94 mins

Low-budget Cornish drama involving travelling actors caught up in a mining 
swindle.


The Amityville Playhouse (15) 
(John R Walker, 2015, Can) Monèle LeStrat, Linden Baker. 99 mins

Teen horror “inspired by” the notorious name.

Last Knights (12A) 
(Kazuaki Kiriya, 2015, Cze/S Kor) Clive Owen, Morgan Freeman, Aksel Hennie. 
115 mins

Overblown medieval action saga clearly hoping for some Game Of Thrones 
crossover.
