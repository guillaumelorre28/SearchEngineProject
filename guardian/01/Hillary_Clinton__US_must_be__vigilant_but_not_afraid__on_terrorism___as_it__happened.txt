Adelson to channel millions to Trump

Billionaire casino mogul  Donald Trump  Sheldon Adelson has committed roughly 
$45 million to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and other Republican 
candidates,CNN reports 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/politics/sheldon-adelson-2016-spending/index.html>
.

Adelson’s gifts reportedly include $20m to the Senate leadership fund, a super 
Pac to elect Republican senators, and as much for the Congressional leadership 
fund. He was reportedly giving $5m to a political organization backing Trump.
Nick Confessore (@nickconfessore) 
Almost half of the $40m in August money for GOP Senate super PAC, per WSJ last 
wk, is coming from Adelson, per CNN.https://t.co/fzrayTnP8S

And if my math is right, Adelson is going to account for over 2/3 of the 
*disclosed* cash. One dude.https://t.co/7jCQCjQUAq <https://t.co/7jCQCjQUAq>

Clinton and Trump meet Egyptian president

In advance of a meeting of the UN General Assembly, Egyptian president Abdel 
Fatah al-Sisi met, separately, with both Clinton and Trump at a Manhattan 
hotel. Clinton also met Monday evening with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.

Here is the Clinton camp’s description of her meeting with Sisi:

Secretary Clinton and President Sisi had a constructive discussion about 
bilateral ties and cooperation on a wide range of issues, including 
counterterrorism. They also discussed the importance of economic development 
and investment in Egypt. Secretary Clinton emphasized the importance of respect 
for rule of law and human rights to Egypt’s future progress. Secretary Clinton 
called for the release of U.S. citizen Aya Hijazi and raised concerns about 
prosecution of Egyptian human rights organizations and activists. Secretary 
Clinton discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in 
the fight against ISIS. She and President Sisi exchanged views about the Middle 
East, and Secretary Clinton underscored the importance of the Egyptian 
cooperation with Israel on counterterrorism, and her commitment to defeating 
ISIS, to addressing foreign fighters, and to countering radicalization.

Here is Trump’s campaign’s description of his meeting with Sisi:

Donald J. Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> today during his visit to the UN 
General Assembly. Mr. Trump and President el-Sisi discussed the strategic 
bilateral relationship between the U.S. and Egypt focusing on political, 
military and economic cooperation between the two countries. The meeting also 
included Mr. Trump’s senior advisors, Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and 
Lieutenant General Michael Flynn (Ret.).


Mr. Trump thanked President el-Sisi and the Egyptian people for what they have 
done in defense of their country and for the betterment of the world over the 
last few years. He expressed great respect for Egypt’s history and the 
important leadership role it has played in the Middle East.
Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt’s war on 
terrorism, and how under a Trump Administration, the United States of America 
will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days 
and years ahead.
Mr. Trump emphasized the strong partnership that the United States and Egypt 
have shared for so many years and how this relationship is vital to help 
promote peace and stability in the Middle East, broader region and the world. 
Mr. Trump also expressed his recognition of Egypt’s close relationship with 
Israel on countering terrorism.Mr. Trump highlighted how Egypt and the U.S. 
share a common enemy and the importance of working together in defeating 
radical Islamic terrorism, not only politically and militarily, but also 
addressing the ideology.
Mr. Trump emphasized to President el-Sisi his high regard for peace-loving 
Muslims and understands that every day there are people of goodwill that 
sacrifice their lives and fortunes to combat the growing threat of radical 
Islamic terrorism.
Mr. Trump said that if he were fortunate enough to win the election in 
November, he would invite President el-Sisi on an official visit to the United 
States and would be honored to visit Egypt and the Egyptian people who he has a 
great fondness for.

Pence sidesteps 'birther' question

Our campaign isn’t focused on the past, Pence says. Back when the candidate at 
the top of the ticket regularly espoused the race-poison “theory” that Barack 
Obama was born in Africa.

Does this image say it all? This image is a bowl of Skittles. It’s tempting to 
get literal about this bowl of Skittles and point out that there have been zero 
lethal attacks in the USA by our 10,000+ Syrian refugees, so three out of what 
looks to be about 100 Skittles is a gross overstatement, just statistically 
speaking, of whatever threat we’re imagining here.

But why are we talking about Syrian refugees? Because of a man suspected of 
planting a bomb in Chelsea who came here in 1995 as a 7-year-old asylum-seeker 
with his family from Afghanistan?

We’ve spent too much breath on this bowl of Skittles. P.S. It’s dehumanizing 
and crass to compare people to Skittles.
Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) 
This image says it all. Let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't

Mother Jones interviews New Yorkers on the street near the Chelsea bombing, 
about whether they think Trump or Clinton has better ideas for combatting 
terrorism.

The folks are for Clinton: “I think he’s a nutjob”:

Residents and workers along 23rd Street near 7th Avenue were getting on with 
life Monday afternoon, as police oversaw a complicated crime scene nearby. 
Meanwhile, presidential candidatesHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Donald Trump engaged 
in a war of words over terrorism, and over who would make Americans feel safer. 
“They are looking to make this into a war against Islam, rather than a war 
against jihadists, violent terrorists,” Clinton said about potential terrorists 
attacking America. “The kinds of rhetoric and language Mr. Trump has used is 
giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.”

Trump could create new US recession with trade war – study

Trump Trade Plan Could Push U.S. into Recession, Study Says 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-trade-plan-could-push-u-s-into-recession-study-says-1474257662?mod=wsj_nview_latest>


Bob Davis writes in the Wall Street Journal that “imposing stiff tariffs on 
China and Mexico, as Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<http://topics.wsj.com/person/T/Donald-Trump/159> has proposed, could push the 
U.S. into recession and cost 5 million U.S. jobs, according toa study by the 
Peterson Institute for International Economics 
<https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefing/assessing-trade-agendas-us-presidential-campaign>
”:


The Peterson Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank that favors free trade, 
ran three computer simulations of the economic impact of placing 45% tariffs on 
Chinese goods and 35% tariffs on Mexico’s. Under the most dire outcome, China 
and Mexico would retaliate with tariffs on U.S. goods and services, U.S. 
exports and imports would shrink, import prices would rise, stock prices would 
tumble and investment would plunge, resulting in recession within three years.

Well, at least a president Trump wouldn’t have the power, unilaterally, to 
totally remake US trade policy, right?

Wrong, writes Justin Wolfers in a Bloomberg piece headlined Why a President 
Donald Trump could start a trade war with surprising ease 
<http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/54405287.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst>
:

Americans often dismiss populist promises that emerge on the presidential 
campaign trail because they are unlikely to be passed by Congress. ShouldDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> get elected, Congress 
most likely would moderate his proposals to cut taxes, increase spending and 
even to build a border wall.

But international trade policy is one area where a President Trump could 
unilaterally deliver on the changes that he has promised.

Obama praises 'outstanding police work'

Obama made his remarks about the apprehension of Chelsea bombing suspect Ahmad 
Khan Rahami <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmad-khan-rahami> at a New 
York meeting with Iraq prime minister Haider al-Abadi.

(Trump has been talking a lot about the US withdrawal from Iraq. He does not 
mention the status of forces agreement signed by George W Bush or the prime 
minister who presided over it. Can Trump name the last prime minister of Iraq?)

Obama hailed the “extraordinary work and coordination that is taking place 
between the FBI and law enforcement,” according to a pool report.

Obama said he talked with injured officers and said they were in good spirits. 
Obama declined to speculate on what motivated the attacks.

Update: Here are Obama’s further remarks, via the press pool. Obama describes 
a plan to “go right at the heart of the Isil operation in Mosul”:

Since I met with him [Abadi] a year ago, we have significant progress in 
rolling back ISIL ... Now, what we have been discussing and focusing on is to 
go right at the heart of the ISIL operation in Mosul.

This is going to be a challenging battle, Mosul is a large city. But because 
of the prepositioning of forces, because of the cooperation between the 
collation and the Iraqi security forces and because of the cooperation the 
courage of the Kurdish Peshmerga, we feel confident that we will be in a 
position to move forward fairly rapidly ... It will be a tough fight ... One of 
the things we discussed is the importance of not just driving ISIL out of Mosul 
but (...) that we are prepared to provide humanitarian assistance and that we 
can rebuild the city in a way that assures not only ISIL does not come back but 
that extremist ideology born out of desperation will not return.”

Trump’s done. He used the appearance to blame terror attacks on “our extremely 
open immigration system.” The suspect in the NYC bombing at the weekend was a 
naturalized American citizen born in Afghanistan who arrived in the USA as a 
boy.

Trump lamented the January 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris earlier, in his 
list of terror attacks illustrating the insecurity of life these days.

Trump says the way to fix terrorism is to stop immigration. But that wasn’t 
always his solution. Directly after the attacks, Trump heralded the corrective 
power of market forces:
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
If the morons who killed all of those people at Charlie Hebdo would have just 
waited, the magazine would have folded - no money, no success!

Trump is telling another fairy tale, in which Obama is nursing a wish that he 
never would have appointed Clinton secretary of state.

But he’ll never admit it, Trump says. The caveat here is very Trump:

I would never expect him to – although maybe if he gets a lot of money for a 
book – to admit he would not have picked her as secretary of state.

We’re going to wrap up our live blog politics coverage for the day. Thank you 
for reading and see you back here in the morning.
 
Billionaire casino mogul  Donald Trump  Sheldon Adelson has committed roughly 
$45 million to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and other Republican 
candidates,CNN reports 
<http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/politics/sheldon-adelson-2016-spending/index.html>
.

Adelson’s gifts reportedly include $20m to the Senate leadership fund, a super 
Pac to elect Republican senators, and as much for the Congressional leadership 
fund. He was reportedly giving $5m to a political organization backing Trump.
Nick Confessore (@nickconfessore) 
Almost half of the $40m in August money for GOP Senate super PAC, per WSJ last 
wk, is coming from Adelson, per CNN.https://t.co/fzrayTnP8S

In advance of a meeting of the UN General Assembly, Egyptian president Abdel 
Fatah al-Sisi met, separately, with both Clinton and Trump at a Manhattan 
hotel. Clinton also met Monday evening with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.

Here is the Clinton camp’s description of her meeting with Sisi:

Secretary Clinton and President Sisi had a constructive discussion about 
bilateral ties and cooperation on a wide range of issues, including 
counterterrorism. They also discussed the importance of economic development 
and investment in Egypt. Secretary Clinton emphasized the importance of respect 
for rule of law and human rights to Egypt’s future progress. Secretary Clinton 
called for the release of U.S. citizen Aya Hijazi and raised concerns about 
prosecution of Egyptian human rights organizations and activists. Secretary 
Clinton discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in 
the fight against ISIS. She and President Sisi exchanged views about the Middle 
East, and Secretary Clinton underscored the importance of the Egyptian 
cooperation with Israel on counterterrorism, and her commitment to defeating 
ISIS, to addressing foreign fighters, and to countering radicalization.

Here is Trump’s campaign’s description of his meeting with Sisi:

Donald J. Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> today during his visit to the UN 
General Assembly. Mr. Trump and President el-Sisi discussed the strategic 
bilateral relationship between the U.S. and Egypt focusing on political, 
military and economic cooperation between the two countries. The meeting also 
included Mr. Trump’s senior advisors, Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and 
Lieutenant General Michael Flynn (Ret.).


Mr. Trump thanked President el-Sisi and the Egyptian people for what they have 
done in defense of their country and for the betterment of the world over the 
last few years. He expressed great respect for Egypt’s history and the 
important leadership role it has played in the Middle East.
Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt’s war on 
terrorism, and how under a Trump Administration, the United States of America 
will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days 
and years ahead.
Mr. Trump emphasized the strong partnership that the United States and Egypt 
have shared for so many years and how this relationship is vital to help 
promote peace and stability in the Middle East, broader region and the world. 
Mr. Trump also expressed his recognition of Egypt’s close relationship with 
Israel on countering terrorism.Mr. Trump highlighted how Egypt and the U.S. 
share a common enemy and the importance of working together in defeating 
radical Islamic terrorism, not only politically and militarily, but also 
addressing the ideology.
Mr. Trump emphasized to President el-Sisi his high regard for peace-loving 
Muslims and understands that every day there are people of goodwill that 
sacrifice their lives and fortunes to combat the growing threat of radical 
Islamic terrorism.
Mr. Trump said that if he were fortunate enough to win the election in 
November, he would invite President el-Sisi on an official visit to the United 
States and would be honored to visit Egypt and the Egyptian people who he has a 
great fondness for.

Does this image say it all? This image is a bowl of Skittles. It’s tempting to 
get literal about this bowl of Skittles and point out that there have been zero 
lethal attacks in the USA by our 10,000+ Syrian refugees, so three out of what 
looks to be about 100 Skittles is a gross overstatement, just statistically 
speaking, of whatever threat we’re imagining here.

But why are we talking about Syrian refugees? Because of a man suspected of 
planting a bomb in Chelsea who came here in 1995 as a 7-year-old asylum-seeker 
with his family from Afghanistan?

We’ve spent too much breath on this bowl of Skittles. P.S. It’s dehumanizing 
and crass to compare people to Skittles.

Mother Jones interviews New Yorkers on the street near the Chelsea bombing, 
about whether they think Trump or Clinton has better ideas for combatting 
terrorism.

The folks are for Clinton: “I think he’s a nutjob”:

Residents and workers along 23rd Street near 7th Avenue were getting on with 
life Monday afternoon, as police oversaw a complicated crime scene nearby. 
Meanwhile, presidential candidatesHillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> and Donald Trump engaged 
in a war of words over terrorism, and over who would make Americans feel safer. 
“They are looking to make this into a war against Islam, rather than a war 
against jihadists, violent terrorists,” Clinton said about potential terrorists 
attacking America. “The kinds of rhetoric and language Mr. Trump has used is 
giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.”
 
Pretty strong.

Trump Trade Plan Could Push U.S. into Recession, Study Says 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-trade-plan-could-push-u-s-into-recession-study-says-1474257662?mod=wsj_nview_latest>


Bob Davis writes in the Wall Street Journal that “imposing stiff tariffs on 
China and Mexico, as Republican presidential nomineeDonald Trump 
<http://topics.wsj.com/person/T/Donald-Trump/159> has proposed, could push the 
U.S. into recession and cost 5 million U.S. jobs, according toa study by the 
Peterson Institute for International Economics 
<https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefing/assessing-trade-agendas-us-presidential-campaign>
”:


The Peterson Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank that favors free trade, 
ran three computer simulations of the economic impact of placing 45% tariffs on 
Chinese goods and 35% tariffs on Mexico’s. Under the most dire outcome, China 
and Mexico would retaliate with tariffs on U.S. goods and services, U.S. 
exports and imports would shrink, import prices would rise, stock prices would 
tumble and investment would plunge, resulting in recession within three years.

Well, at least a president Trump wouldn’t have the power, unilaterally, to 
totally remake US trade policy, right?

Wrong, writes Justin Wolfers in a Bloomberg piece headlined Why a President 
Donald Trump could start a trade war with surprising ease 
<http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/54405287.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst>
:

Americans often dismiss populist promises that emerge on the presidential 
campaign trail because they are unlikely to be passed by Congress. ShouldDonald 
Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> get elected, Congress 
most likely would moderate his proposals to cut taxes, increase spending and 
even to build a border wall.

But international trade policy is one area where a President Trump could 
unilaterally deliver on the changes that he has promised.

Obama made his remarks about the apprehension of Chelsea bombing suspect Ahmad 
Khan Rahami <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmad-khan-rahami> at a New 
York meeting with Iraq prime minister Haider al-Abadi.

(Trump has been talking a lot about the US withdrawal from Iraq. He does not 
mention the status of forces agreement signed by George W Bush or the prime 
minister who presided over it. Can Trump name the last prime minister of Iraq?)

Obama hailed the “extraordinary work and coordination that is taking place 
between the FBI and law enforcement,” according to a pool report.

Obama said he talked with injured officers and said they were in good spirits. 
Obama declined to speculate on what motivated the attacks.

Hotel in New York. Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/AP 
Update: Here are Obama’s further remarks, via the press pool. Obama describes 
a plan to “go right at the heart of the Isil operation in Mosul”:

Since I met with him [Abadi] a year ago, we have significant progress in 
rolling back ISIL ... Now, what we have been discussing and focusing on is to 
go right at the heart of the ISIL operation in Mosul.

This is going to be a challenging battle, Mosul is a large city. But because 
of the prepositioning of forces, because of the cooperation between the 
collation and the Iraqi security forces and because of the cooperation the 
courage of the Kurdish Peshmerga, we feel confident that we will be in a 
position to move forward fairly rapidly ... It will be a tough fight ... One of 
the things we discussed is the importance of not just driving ISIL out of Mosul 
but (...) that we are prepared to provide humanitarian assistance and that we 
can rebuild the city in a way that assures not only ISIL does not come back but 
that extremist ideology born out of desperation will not return.”
 
Obama praises the police work that went from an 8am be-on-the-lookout phone 
alert to a midday arrest. “Outstanding” police work, Obama says:

Trump’s done. He used the appearance to blame terror attacks on “our extremely

naturalized American citizen born in Afghanistan who arrived in the USA as a 
boy.

Trump lamented the January 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris earlier, in his 
list of terror attacks illustrating the insecurity of life these days.

Trump says the way to fix terrorism is to stop immigration. But that wasn’t 
always his solution. Directly after the attacks, Trump heralded the corrective 
power of market forces:

Trump is telling another fairy tale, in which Obama is nursing a wish that he 
never would have appointed Clinton secretary of state.

But he’ll never admit it, Trump says. The caveat here is very Trump:

I would never expect him to – although maybe if he gets a lot of money for a 
book – to admit he would not have picked her as secretary of state.
