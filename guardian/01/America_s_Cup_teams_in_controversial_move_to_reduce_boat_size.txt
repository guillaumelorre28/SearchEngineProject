The America’s Cup teams have voted to reduce the size of boats to be sailed in 
the 2017 regatta in Bermuda, a cost-cutting move that could lead to the two 
strongest challengers dropping out.

The organisers said a majority of teams favoured the move from 62ft (AC62) 
catamarans to AC45s in the 45ft to 50ft range. They also said a majority of 
teams supported having all the racing take place in Bermuda rather than having 
a qualifying regatta in Auckland, New Zealand.

Italy’s Luna Rossa said last week it “will be obliged to withdraw” should the 
race boat be downsized. Team New Zealand supported the Italians.

Team New Zealand said on its Twitter account Monday that it had filed for 
arbitration to reinstate the Auckland qualifier. The New Zealanders maintain 
they need the qualifier at home to secure government funding. A Luna Rossa 
spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

There is some question as to how much the downsizing of the boats will save 
considering some teams have already spent several months and tens of millions 
of dollars designing 62ft catamarans. They were said to be a cost-saving 
measure over the 72ft catamarans used in the 2013 America’s Cup.

The decision by the two-time defending champion Oracle Team USA to contest the 
America’s Cup in Bermuda rather than in the United States has also made it 
difficult for some teams and the event itself to raise sponsorship money.

While smaller boats would mean reduced costs and a smaller crew, they could 
also mean less excitement for spectators. A boat in the 45-50ft class would 
also be the smallest in America’s Cup history.

If Italy and New Zealand drop out, Oracle Team USA would conceivably have an 
easier shot at retaining the trophy.

Oracle Team USA rebounded from an 8-1 deficit to defeat Emirates Team New 
Zealand in the 2013 America’s Cup, winning eight straight races in one of the 
biggest comebacks in the event’s history.
