To be kidnapped and buried in a box like in that film Buried 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3NClUkY700>.

What is your earliest memory? 
I was three and convinced I could leap from the top of the stairs and land at 
the bottom. I remember the feeling of flying and how exciting it was. Either my 
memory is wrong and it was only a few steps, or I had special powers that have 
now gone.

Which living person do you most admire, and why? 
My wife, because she is so great, and can cook the heck out of tuna.

What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? 
I have a long list that I can fax over.

What is the trait you most deplore in others? 
Mass murder – it's totally unnecessary and inconsiderate.

Probably a camera. I could open a museum of digital cameras.

Apart from my winkie, my family.

The ability to locate keys and wallets.

All parts visible to other humans.

If you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose? 
David Bowie <https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie> – he extincted 
himself.

What is your most unappealing habit? 
Rearranging my nether regions.

What is your favourite smell? 
My daughter's hair.

What is the worst thing anyone's said to you? 
I am so oversensitive, pretty much everything gets twisted in my mind.

What do you owe your parents? 
An over-exaggerated sense of the importance of manners.

What or who is the greatest love of your life? 
My wife, Sarah. She's as lovable as the day I first undressed her.

The people I would invite to my normal dinner parties.

"Man" and "shit biscuits".

Not interviewing Bowie at Glastonbury in 2000.

How often do you have sex? 
Pretty much every day, but not always with someone else.

In my personal life, my family; in my career, the podcasts with Joe.

How would you like to be remembered? 
If I am remembered, that'll be fine.
