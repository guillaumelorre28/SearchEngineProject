Paramount has removed a planned Terminator sequel from its release schedule 
for 2017, after last year’s reboot of the cyborg franchise underwhelmed at the 
box office.

Terminator: Genisys was meant to be the first film in a new trilogy uniting 
original star Arnold Schwarzenegger with younger actors Emilia Clarke and Jai 
Courtney. It was released last summer to middling reviews (theGuardian’s Peter 
Bradshaw called it “intensely unnecessary” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/terminator-genisys-review-arnies-back-in-a-cynical-franchisebot>
) and underperformed at the US box office, bringing in less than $90m (£64m).

But its surprising global pick-up (it made around $350m outside the US) meant 
that a new Terminator 2 still seemed like a possibility. Paramount have now 
decided otherwise, with a summer 2017 date vacated and replaced withDwayne 
Johnson’s Baywatch

 movie.

Paramount had also ambitiously scheduled a new Terminator 3 for June 2018, as 
North American rights to the franchise would revert to series creator James 
Cameron in 2019. The studio is now pinning its franchise hopes on the 
continuation of the Star Trek, Mission: Impossible and Transformers films. This 
year will also see a reimagining of video horror The Ring, hope for some JJ 
Abrams’ magic in spin-off 10 Cloverfield Lane and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back.

The studio is also hoping its Baywatch adaptation will appeal to younger 
audiences unfamiliar with the original, bringing in Zac Efron as Johnson’s 
co-star.

“We’re going to make it badass, but we still want to pay homage to the 
original show, so it’s really a careful combination,” Efron said toMTV 
<http://www.mtv.com/news/2244339/zac-efron-baywatch-interview/> last year. 
“We’re going to beat up some dudes, and swim a lot.”
