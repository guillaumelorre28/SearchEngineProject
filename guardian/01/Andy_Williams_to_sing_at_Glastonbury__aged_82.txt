The 81-year-old singer Andy Williams has announced plans to perform at the 
Glastonbury festival <https://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury> next year. 
The American crooner revealed that the event organiser Michael Eavis had 
invited him to perform at the Somerset festival's 40th anniversary. A packed 
audience at Cheltenham literature festival cheered when Williams said he had 
been booked. John Wilson, a host with BBC Radio 4's Front Row, said: "I had 
asked him if he had any plans to play any more gigs and he said he had been 
asked to play at the festival."

Eavis has kept quiet over the line-up for next year's event, which sold out in 
less than 24 hours this month, but it has been rumoured that the Rolling Stones 
arte likely to appear.

This year's festival attracted 137,000 music fans and featured acts such as 
Blur, Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen. It was hailed as one of the best by 
festival-goers and organisers alike.

Eavis said of the 2010 event, which takes place between 23-27 June: "The 
expectations are really high. We're trying to get the best headliners in the 
world."

Full weekend tickets cost £185, up £10 from last year, and there is a £5 
booking fee. The registration system, which does not guarantee a ticket, was 
introduced in 2007 to combat touting.

Last year fans were able to extend their registration for three years.

Williams has been in the UK in recent weeks promoting his autobiography, Moon 
River And Me.
