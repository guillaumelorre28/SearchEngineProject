Angola and Algeria advanced to the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations 
thanks toa goalless draw in Luanda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jan/18/africa-cup-nations-angola-algeria-live>
. With Mali beating Malawi in the other Group A match, a point apiece proved 
enough in a game that started brightly before petering out in the second half.

All four nations went into their final group games with the hope of 
qualifying, with the leaders Angola knowing a draw would be enough to guarantee 
their progress. Although the hosts created early chances,Algeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/algeria> could have taken the lead 
through Madjid Bougherra after 22 minutes but the defender failed to beat the 
goalkeeper Carlos Fernandes from five yards out.

Minutes later, Faouzi Chaouchi was forced to pull off a brilliant save in the 
Algeria goal from Zé Kalanga's superb free-kick. Chaouchi then blocked Djalma's 
shot with his legs as the first half ended goalless.

The Desert Hawks began the second half on the offensive and Karim Matmour just 
failed to get a touch on Hameur Bouazza's low cross. Bouazza then poked wide 
from a tight angle on the hour mark but, with both sides looking set to book 
their spots in the last eight, the pace dropped markedly.

While the draw could have provided Malawi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/malawi> with a route to the 
quarter-finals, they were immediately put on the back foot by an electric start 
from Mali, who were two goals up inside the first five minutes.

The Malians needed to win and hope for an Algeria defeat and their hopes were 
lifted by Frédéric Kanouté's first-minute strike following a goalkeeping 
blunder from Swadick Sanudi. Seydou Keita then added a second with a thumping 
free-kick two minutes later.

Russel Mwafulirwa pulled one back for Malawi after 58 minutes but he will rue 
a missed header after 71 minutes which could have put his side through. 
Instead, Mamadou Bagayoko added another forMali 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/mali> with four minutes to play.

Angola <https://www.theguardian.com/football/angola> topped the group thanks 
to their victory over Malawi and two draws while Algeria finished level on four 
points with Mali but progress courtesy of their 1-0 victory over their rivals – 
the only match in which they have found the net.
