Australian Test pace bowler Ryan Harris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ryan-harris> is expected to be out of action 
for at least six months after undergoing knee surgery.


Veteran Harris, who took two late wickets to help clinch Australia’s 2-1 Test 
series win over South Africa, underwent an operation on his right knee in 
Melbourne on Tuesday.


Australian team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said the surgery “included a 
clean out of some loose bits of bone and removing bone spurs within the joint”.


“Ryan will be on crutches for a few weeks and we expect a long rehabilitation 
period,” he added.


Cricket Australia hope Harris will be fit to play in the Test series against 
Pakistan scheduled for October, likely in the United Arab Emirates, and 
Kountouris said his progress would be monitored in the meantime.
