Winning tip: Wander through the vineyards

From anywhere along the Ringstrasse, take the D tram to its end station, 
picturesque Nussdorf. From therefollow Wildgrubgasse as it curves its way 
through Vienna’s wine area. Dotted along the way are smallHeuriger (wine 
taverns) where you can sit among the grapevines and soak up the city view. The 
best time of year to visit is autumn, when these guesthouses serve up the 
year’s new wines,sturm (fermented, pressed grape juice) and cold platters of 
cheeses, pickles and breads. If your legs are a little wobbly after the wine, 
there’s a train back into the city..

Most tourists look up to see history but in Vienna, and many other European 
cities, the history of the Holocaust is under your feet. Small brass 
cobblestones calledStolpersteine (stumbling blocks) are placed around the city 
outside the homes from which Jewish, gay, socialist, Gypsy and other victims 
were sent to their murder –ermordet in the evocative language on the small 
plaques. The effect is moving, but also positive, for there are now more than 
48,000 of these remembrances in 18 countries.

Visit a micronation


In 1984, after disputes with the Austrian government, artist Edwin Lipburger 
created the independent republic of Kugelmugel. Located in the Vienna Prater, 
the ball-shaped building is surrounded by barbed-wire fences and its address is 
1 Anti-fascism Square. Its government (one President Lipburger) is currently in 
exile, as are its many hundreds of citizens.

If there’s one film that is synonymous with Vienna, it’s The Third Man. The 
1949 classic is a fascinating insight into the city that was divided between 
the Allies. The Third Man walking tour retraces Harry Lime’s footsteps through 
the city’s cobbled streets, visiting many of the original locations and telling 
the tales of the black market, spying and hardships of post-second world war 
Vienna. If you are a fan of the film, or just want a historic tour with a 
twist, it’s a must.

Praterturm

The Prater is best known for the Riesenrad, and while no trip is complete 
without a spin on the famous old wheel, venture further into the park to enjoy 
the Praterturm. The 117-metre swing ride is the tallest of its kind in the 
world, and offers a great view of the city and its surroundings.

Not far from the Schönbrunn Palace is a little-visited gem: Vienna’s museum of 
technology, which is fun for children and fascinating for adults (captions in 
German and English). There are interactive exhibits (how much electrical power 
can you generate?), the oldest operating motor vehicle, a full-size train kids 
can “drive” and some darker pieces of Austrian history like the Third Reich 
radio that received only approved radio stations.

Urbanek


In the midst of the north end of the Naschmarkt is Urbanek, a temple of 
porcine indulgence. It is a family run charcuterie and cheese joint with plenty 
of local wines stashed in the cellar. Put yourself in the hands of the owner, 
Gerhard, by asking for a glass of something crisp and a platter of his 
selection. Cut by hand, the fruits of his labour will arrive as the wine 
settles. A world of culinary delight will unfold before you. Gorgeous roast 
beef, cold-sliced pork belly and hard cheese pressed with the mountain flowers 
the cows enjoyed. Never disappointing, always revelatory and an excellent way 
to meet some proper locals. A true, if – due to its size – often overlooked, 
Viennese institution.

 Pratersauna 

Berlin may be Europe’s current hipster capital but electronic music has been 
making waves in Vienna and the scene gives the city an atmosphere of collected 
cool, making nights out accessible and enjoyable. For dancing till dawn visit 
Pratersauna in the second district, a prefab venue that also has a pool and 
outdoor cinema screenings in the summer. To hear experimental acts head to the 
bunker-like Fluc and Fluc Wanne, or for a chilled drink go to Donau on 
Karl-Schweighofer-Gasse and enjoy relaxed beats accompanied by artistic 
projections – but you’ll have to find the hidden entrance first.

Aunt Dorothy’s, as the Dorotheum auction house is sometimes fondly known, is 
just a short stroll from the Hofburg Palace and around the corner from the 
stables of the Spanish Riding School’s Lipizzaner horses. Items up for auction 
can range from fur coats to Damien Hirst paintings, and for those who prefer to 
shop without the high-octane stress of an auction, there’s a host of items to 
“buy now”. From furniture, carpets, and paintings to jewellery, toys, stamps 
and even bundles of old hand-penned letters, the temptations are endless and 
ever-changing.
