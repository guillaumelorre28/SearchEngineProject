Newspaper commentators confessed yesterday to a feeling of déjà vu. They were 
greeting the return to the news pages of an organisation that we all seemed to 
have forgotten for the best part of a quarter of a century, namely theTUC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tuc>.

The reactions from at least three of them were utterly predictable and not 
without irony, given that in thundering about the risks of returning to the 
1970s their opinions were little more than repetitions of arguments advanced at 
the time. Déjà vu indeed.

For Janet Daley, in the Sunday Telegraph, The nightmare of union power is back 
again 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/janetdaley/8010988/The-nightmare-of-union-power-is-back-again.html>
. "Seeing the trade unions rise up like the undead has been a salutary 
experience," she wrote.

"Following the horror show of threats and blackmail staged by the TUC last 
week, we have had a specific notice of intent from the GMB to call a national 
dustmen's strike, thus conjuring up one of the great iconic images of the 
winter of 1979."

Ah, that infamous winter. William Rees Mogg in his Mail on Sunday column, also 
reminded us of it, though I would guess that the headline,Don't let the old 
enemy win this time 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1313242/WILLIAM-REES-MOGG-Dont-let-old-enemy-win-time.html>
, referred to inflation rather than the unions.

He summoned up the past to awaken us to the dangers of a return to the 1970s 
by contending that not only were public sector unions "moving to the left... 
they may be followed by the Labour party."

According to Mogg, if Labour elects Ed Miliband as its new leader, the party 
will once again be "shackled to an unelectable left wing."

That left is evidently represented by Bob Crow, the leader of the RMT 
transport union, who - wrote Mogg - "seems to be a reincarnation ofArthur 
Scargill." 

This so-called similarity also struck the disgraced former Tory MP, Neil 
Hamilton, in his Sunday Express "trip down memory lane", TUC dinosaurs will 
kill unions 
<http://express.co.uk/posts/view/200362/TUC-dinosaurs-will-kill-unions>. 

The trio were echoing newspaper reportage and comments earlier in the week. 
Hamilton may even have readAnn Treneman's TUC conference sketch in The Times 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/sketch/article2724935.ece> since 
she remarked that she had been "watching prehistory being made". She wrote:

"The dinosaurs are back, roaming if not yet the Earth then certainly the 
salmon-pink carpet at the TUC conference centre. We watched yesterday as they 
emerged from the primordial gloop, very much alive and bellowing their hatred 
of the bankers and the coalition."

Her piece had the virtue, as so often with her work, of being amusing. But 
there was less to laugh at in theDaily Express, which railed against (allegedly)
toxic talk from the TUC 
<http://express.co.uk/posts/view/199420/-TUC-must-realise-what-a-perilous-state-we-are-in->
 while theDaily Mail took TUC general secretary Brendan Barber to task for his 
"fantasy economics" 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1213238/MAIL-COMMENT-TUC-abandon-fantasy-economics.html>
.

On reading DJ Taylor in the Independent on Sunday 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dj-taylor-lady-gaga-and-the-tuc-prove-theres-nowt-new-under-t-sun-2083211.html>
, I was relieved to discover that I was not alone in viewing all this knee-jerk 
stuff as evidence of an anti-union agenda rooted in social class distinctions. 
He wrote:

"The exercise in shadow-boxing conducted by the TUC... and the middle-class 
media [was] antiphonal and combative, a master-class in non-communication that 
reminded one of PG Wodehouse's aunts bellowing to each other 'like mastodons 
across a primeval swamp.'

This offered an uncannily accurate definition of the adjective 'proleptic' – 
attempting to come to terms with something that has yet to happen, or, to put 
it more cynically, getting your retaliation in first."

In other words, nothing has happened yet, despite some sabre-rattling from 
Crow, and yet "media reaction has been almost uniformly hostile."

So the spectre of the three-day week has been much invoked, and Barber has 
been "reminded of his duty to protect his members' interests rather than tell 
democratically elected governments what to do."

Taylor added: "Beneath it pulses that age-old tremor of bourgeois anxiety 
that, 30 years ago, used to relieve itself in talk about 'holding the country 
to ransom' and in letters to the Daily Telegraph written 'by candlelight'".

That's a reminder of the title of a wonderful collection of essays by the 
late, lamentedEP Thompson. He understood why people struck back at power. So he 
would certainly have approved of Taylor's concluding sentence:

"In a week when a man widely regarded as a slot-machine capitalist assumed a 
pivotal role in the British banking system, Mr Barber and his allies are 
entitled to protest as loudly as they can."
