For someone who spent 11 years studying the French - their language, 
literature and cultural riches - I managed to feel pretty Francophobic by the 
end of a recent long weekend on the Cote d'Azur.

It was meant to be a cheeky short break, gatecrashing my parents' early summer 
holiday and capitalising on the bonus bank holidays doled out to mark the 
Queen's Jubilee. It was also, I thought, a great opportunity to leave the 
country during this unappetising event.

 After a cheap flight to Nice and a 10-minute train ride to the next bay of 
Villefranche-Sur-Mer, I was soon stretched out on a lounger with a view of the 
glistening sea. But the relaxation was shattered by a burglary - from my 
bedroom at night. The intruder took my mobile phone from a bedside table just 
inches from my head - but it was a while before I realised anything was gone, 
which did not go down too well with the local police.

 In fact, I might as well have forgotten I was on holiday for the remaining 
two days of my break. I spent hours trying to contact English banks and mobile 
networks from a French payphone and the rest of the time dealing with the 
excruciatingly uncooperative policemen down at the station - a 40-minute, 
sun-baked walk away.
