Over the past few years, decoding the secret messages that Taylor Swift 
sprinkles through each of her albums’ liner notes has become something of a 
sport for both diehard fans and gossip-mongers. Swift’s lyric sheets are 
designed so that certain letters stand out (Speak Now and Red featured 
individual capitalized letters amid the lower-case lyrics, whileher new record, 
1989 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/taylor-swift-1989-album-review-bold-gossipy-confection>
, does the opposite). These spell out secret messages meant to clue fans into 
the meanings of her diary-entry recordings.

Back to December <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUwxKWT6m7U>, a song 
purportedly about ex-flame Taylor Lautner included the simple message “TAY”. 
All Too Well, believed to be about her romance with Jake Gyllenhaal, showcased 
a more cryptic message: “MAPLE LATTES,” which, when Googled, revealed a slew of 
articles about a New York coffee date between the pair.

But the secret messages on Swift’s 1989 aren’t nearly as explicit, and they 
certainly don’t provide winking clues about her ex-boyfriends’ identities. They 
are, instead, sentimental reflections like “Her heart belonged to someone who 
couldn’t stay” (on Style) and “He drove past her street every night” (on I Wish 
You Would). Taken individually, the vaguely poetic musings don’t provide much 
detail about their respective songs, except for a moody shade in keeping with 
each track’s tone. Here’s the full list of them:

Welcome to New York 
<http://www.stereogum.com/1712817/taylor-swift-welcome-to-new-york/mp3s/> We 
begin our story in New York
Blank Space There once was a girl known by every one and no one
Style Her heart belonged to someone who couldn’t stay
Out of the Woods They loved each other recklessly
All You Had To Do was Stay They paid the price
Shake It Off 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/aug/19/taylor-swifts-shake-it-off-video-yahoo-livestream-event>
 She danced to forget him
I Wish You Would He drove past her street each night
Bad Blood She made friends and enemies
Wildest Dreams He only saw her in his dreams
How To Get The Girl Then one day he came back
This Love Timing is a funny thing
I Know Places And everyone was watching
Clean She lost him but she found herself and somehow that was everything

Clearly, 1989’s liner note messages aren’t meant to be read in the same way as 
her previous albums: namely, as separate clues with separate meanings. Instead, 
they collectively tell a story that reflects Swift’s own life over the past two 
years. The tale chronicles Swift’s move to New York during a broken and 
ill-timed relationship that “everyone was watching”, and, in true Swift 
fashion, it concludes with a moment of self-discovery – the overall theme of 
the album.

The embedded story is an entertaining twist on the playful gimmick that has 
helped to make all of Swift’s albums feel like slumber party secrets whispered 
in your ear, and it helps to shift the narrative around the pop star from her 
former perception as a boy-crazy serial dater to her current status as a 
thoughtful and self-assured adult.

For a different take on Swift, meanwhile, cartoonist and broadcaster David 
Rees has mashed up eight of her songs with those of the Aphex Twin 
<http://www.nme.com/news/aphex-twin--2/80653>. Our pick is 4 combined with I 
Knew You Were Trouble, retitled T4ouble.

In a blogpost, Rees said 
<http://howtosharpenpencils.tumblr.com/post/100850668059/a-few-words-about-aphex-swift>
:

This summer I decided to make an album of Aphex Twin / Taylor Swift mashups. 
<https://soundcloud.com/david_rees/sets/aphex-swift> I am a big fan of both 
these artists — I think they’ve each written some thrilling pop hooks and their 
production is amazing. I also just wanted to see if it could be done.
