Although the temptation is to stay indoors, winter is an ideal time to walk. 
Crisp air, lack of humidity and relatively quiet tracks make the experience 
much more enjoyable in winter than struggling through summer’s heat.


These five tracks are great for a weekend walk.

National Pass, Blue Mountains, New South Wales

One of Australia’s most celebrated walks, the near-vertical descent down the 
plunging cliff side to the bottom of the magnificent, three-tiered Wentworth 
Falls is an undoubted highlight. The Grand Stairway’s steps were painstakingly 
hewn with picks, shovels and dynamite in the early 1900s and this epic 
undertaking is detailed in a series of interpretive boards along the route.

The National Pass, built into the face of sandstone escarpment, takes in 
awesome views of the Blue Mountains, the trademark tobacco-smoke hues of which 
are actually created by short-wave rays of blue light being scattered by dust 
particles and droplets of eucalyptus oil from the lush gorge forest.

Allow a good three hours to complete the whole 5.4km walk. The drier winter 
months are a great time to tackle the trek with less chance of getting rained 
on, although you might get splashed walking under the cascade of one of the 
route’s waterfalls.

 The Blue Mountains is a handy day trip from Sydney and home to some of 
Australia’s best walks. 
Coastal track, Noosa national park, Queensland


Noosa’s must-do walk can be overrun in the summer and long weekends, but take 
a walk in winter and you’ll have more breathing room to enjoy the fresh air – 
plus it’s the season to spot migrating whales.

Starting at the main beach boardwalk in Noosa Heads, this ramble represents 
the longest uninterrupted stretch of rocky coast in south-east Queensland. 
Leading first through fragrant eucalyptus forest, in which you can spot koalas, 
the trail then weaves through paperbark woods dotted with the endangered swamp 
orchid, which flowers from August to October. Continue on to the Boiling Point 
lookout, where locals throw lines into the water and you can watch surfers 
catch the famous breaks down at Tea Tree bay.

Birdlife abounds along the track, which is wheelchair accessible up to Dolphin 
Point (about 2km from the beach), so take a picnic and stop for lunch at the 
appropriately named Picnic Point and watch as pied cormorants and magnificent 
ospreys pepper the brine, plunging through the waves to emerge with a meal of 
their own.

Make sure you push on to the trail’s highlight, Hell’s Gates. On these 
towering bluffs, an invigorating bluster buffets you from every direction, 
which is both refreshing after the uphill push to get here, and thrilling as 
you take in the panoramic views from the brink.

Eastern Sherbrooke forest, Dandenong ranges, Victoria

The Dandenong ranges is a mere hour’s drive from Melbourne. 

The most accessible track (you can also get there from Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/melbourne> using public transport) is the 
eastern Sherbrooke walking trail, taking in lovely fern-filled gullies and 
pretty picnic spots.

Most of this two-hour trek through tree fern glades and over creek crossings 
is manageable for anyone with a reasonable degree of fitness, although there 
are steep sections along Paddy Road and Welch Track which may be slippery when 
wet.

The Mountain Ash forests surrounding the 7.1km track provide the perfect 
habitat for the superb lyrebird, and June to August is the best time to find 
them because it’s peak mating season, when lyrebirds sing with the most 
intensity for up to four hours a day.
Look out also for treecreepers – small birds that cling to trunks, foraging 
for insects – and, if you’re lucky, the elusive blue-winged parrot.

Manly to Spit Bridge, Sydney, NSW

Sydneysiders are blessed with a network of local walking tracks, but Manly to 
Spit Bridge, or vice versa, is arguably the most scenic – and it has penguins.

Taking in iconic harbour views, verdant bushland and pristine beaches, this 
10km walk is well sign-posted from both ends, and there are several entry 
points along the route, allowing you to dip in and out as ability or time 
allows. It takes three to four hours to complete the whole hike.

Combining modern waterfront development with ancient Indigenous sites, this 
track jumps forwards and back through the ages like a time machine with a 
busted flux capacitor.

 One of Sydney’s best walks – the Spit to Manly. You’d scarcely believe you are 
in Australia’s biggest city.Photograph: Christopher Eden/flickr 
<https://www.flickr.com/photos/chriseden/4989957756/> 
Starting at Spit Bridge, the trail winds through subtropical rainforest around 
Fisher Bay, past sandy swathes and the wave-shaped rock at Duke of Edinburgh 
reserve, to the century-old Grotto Point lighthouse. Take a 20-metre detour 
from the track here to see Indigenous engravings of boomerangs, fish and 
wallabies.

From May to November you can spot migrating whales here or at Arabanoo 
lookout, which offers stunning views over north and south head and the Pacific 
Ocean. Between July and February, try to time your stroll to end at Manly wharf 
as the sun goes down, when the only mainland breeding colony of little penguins 
in NSW comes in to nest.

Yarra Bend park, Melbourne, Victoria

Melbourne’s largest area of natural, inner-city bushland is spacious enough to 
accommodate 12km of the Yarra river, five marked walking tracks to suit all 
abilities, two golf courses, and innumerable birdlife spotting opportunities.

If you have neither the means nor time to get out of the city, it doesn’t mean 
you’ll have to spend your weekends wandering shopping malls: this 260ha park is 
in Kew, just four kilometres from the CBD.

Adjoining the park is the Collingwood children’s farm and community garden, 
where your kids can pet goats, and the Abbotsford convent, where you can lunch 
at the social enterprise chain Lentil As Anything.

Unlike many national parks where pets are not allowed, most areas of Yarra 
Bend are open to dog walkers.
