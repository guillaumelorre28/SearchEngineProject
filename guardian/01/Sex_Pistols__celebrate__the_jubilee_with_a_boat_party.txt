Inspired by the Situationists, Sex Pistols 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/sexpistols> manager Malcolm McLaren knew the 
importance of creating a spectacle. What could be more spectacular than his 
band – public enemy number one following their foul-mouthed appearance on the 
Today show – promoting their anti-jubilee anthem God Save the Queen by sailing 
a boat past the Houses of Parliament? The authorities tried to stop it, and 
McLaren and others were arrested. He'd have been delighted – a great pop stunt 
as well as proof that punk terrified the mainstream.
