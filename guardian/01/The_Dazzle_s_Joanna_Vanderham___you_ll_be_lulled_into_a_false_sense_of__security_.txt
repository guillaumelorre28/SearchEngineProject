You’re starring with Andrew Scott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/live/2015/nov/13/andrew-scott-webchat-the-dazzle-spectre-sherlock>
 andDavid Dawson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jan/16/the-duchess-of-malfi-review> in 
The Dazzle by Richard Greenberg, who is probably best known for his playsThree 
Days of Rain <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/feb/11/theatre> and Take 
Me Out <http://www.ibdb.com/Production/View/13460>. Did you know Greenberg’s 
work beforehand?
No, I have to admit. I was sent the script on a Monday, I gave it a read, and 
a phone call was set up for the Tuesday. So I read the play again and had the 
call with Simon Evans, the director. By the end of the call I was attached to 
it … I’ve just fallen it love with The Dazzle since. It’s a little gem of a 
play.

The Dazzle review – Andrew Scott is hypnotic in disturbing tale of eccentricity

It’s often very funny. There are some great lines – the humour is really 
offbeat.
Yes, we hope so. We hope there’s comedy in it at all, really. In the rehearsal 
room, everyone has heard the script a million times and it’s just not funny any 
more. You’re there going, “Is this a comedy?” It deals with some quite epic 
life scenes too. We did have to remind ourselves in the tech week that our 
comic timing had to come back – we had to make the jokes land. We hope it 
starts off like a drawing-room comedy. You’re going to be lulled into a false 
sense of security, then it turns out to be like Beckett.

You play Milly, an heiress who meets the reclusive Collyer brothers 
<http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/collyer-brothers-brownstone-gallery-1.1187698>
. They’re based on real-life siblings who lived and died in a junk-filled 
mansion in New York.
I really adore the brothers. Playing Milly, I have to. My understanding of 
them is that they are a wonderfully eccentric pair but you could really judge 
them. I try not to. Milly is a made-up character – she’s Richard Greenberg’s 
way of allowing the outside world to see what it would have been like to meet 
these brothers. She’s the audience’s eyes as it were.

The play is staged in a temporary space, Found 111 
<http://www.thedazzle.co.uk/about/>, in the old Central Saint Martins School of 
Art. There’s a piano on the stage, piles of bric-a-brac around and we sit on an 
array of old chairs. It all feels a bit precarious.
Yes! It hasn’t been a theatre for long. We were rehearsing in that space for 
three weeks, which was invaluable. The set is almost like another character in 
the play so we had to be familiar with it. And there’s a big pillar in the 
room. I had to get my head around having the audience on three sides, and 
remember not to hide behind the pillar. It’s a derelict building so there was 
no central heating. You got an idea of what sort of place these men were living 
in – Simon celebrates it as well as showing it’s a struggle.

The actors are so close to the audience…
I had to really get over that – it had to be a thrill for me otherwise it 
would be terrifying. But I didThe Promise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/nov/21/the-promise-review> at Trafalgar 
Studios, which is an intimate space. You can hear everything from the audience.

Does that bother you?
The audience is a wonderful gauge of how a show is. If they’re laughing when 
we hoped they would be, if they’re silent when we hoped they would be, then 
it’s a real thrill. It’s so gratifying to feel the effect your show is having 
on a person. It’s addictive.

You can hear the noise from Charing Cross Road throughout.
Hopefully it’s not too distracting! But we’re supposed to be in Harlem and New 
York is a vibrant hub of a city. On press night someone was setting off 
fireworks during the poignant silences of the last scene. We were just 
thinking, Oh no...!

 ‘She’s got some guts’ … Vanderham as Desdemona with Hugh Quarshie as Othello.

You played Desdemona in the RSC’s Othello 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/12/othello-rsc-stratford-hugh-quarshie-lucian-msamati-joanna-vanderham>
 earlier this year. She’s an interesting character in that she seems to lose 
her sense of independence throughout the play.
I think that’s incredibly common for young women. You maybe don’t know exactly 
who you are, but have a sense, and the people you surround yourself with really 
have an impact on how you perceive yourself. I think that’s a very common story 
and one that needs to be told.

Desdemona defies her father, then suggests that she goes to a war zone … she’s 
got some guts, this girl. My interpretation was that what she fights for is her 
belief in love and her belief in her ability to make a relationship work. In an 
era when so many marriages end in divorce, that could perhaps be perceived as 
naive but in order to play the character with truth and integrity I had to 
believe that was a strength and something to be admired … After the show, I did 
have to remind myself that there is love out there. I had to cheer myself back 
up.

For The Dazzle, Simon said during rehearsals that a lot of plays are about 
people hating each other but this play is about people loving each other. 
That’s very special. I think he’s right.

Othello review – history is made with RSC's fresh take on the tragedy

Milly talks about having had a life of “sleepy terror”. She has a history of 
mental health problems. How did you find your way into the role?

I researched all the things she would have gone through. She has a line about 
having had treatment in Vienna. As a rich American girl, she might have been 
one of the women Freud met. So I researched his methods, got into what kind of 
education she would have had, what a public asylum was like, what living on the 
streets as a woman in 1930s New York was like. All those cheery things you want 
to think about right before Christmas. We also looked at how Milly moved – 
there’s a contrast between the first and second halves of the show. I keep 
playing characters who bring a new energy into their surroundings. That’s 
really fun for me, to think you can do that to a space – you enter and it 
changes.

That’s certainly true of Denise in The Paradise. You must have been delighted 
when you got that role.

I thought the audition had gone dreadfully. I was meeting a friend afterwards 
and I had to go and give myself a pep talk in the bathroom – to let it go and 
move on. So I was over the moon; to be in a BBC1 drama was a dream come true. 
Denise was a fantastic character – she had wonderful ideas, she could convince 
people to listen to her. Nothing about her was ordinary or limited. That’s 
quite inspiring, to watch someone succeed like that. I remember she always had 
this kind of “Denise eyebrow”, along with a smug look on her face, when she got 
things right. I miss that. Maybe I need to be right in my own life more often.

Your first TV role was in Martina Cole’s The Runaway.
I was at the Royal Welsh <http://www.rwcmd.ac.uk/> drama school and Emma Style 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/01/emma-style>, the casting 
director, came to our college to teach us how to audition. Five months later, 
she was casting The Runaway and she called my head of acting and said: “Can 
that girl with the funny surname come and audition?” Luckily, a week before I’d 
been learning an Essex accent so a Cockney one wasn’t a huge stretch. I was a 
bit of a nerd: I got the novel and read the whole thing before the audition. I 
haven’t had a role like that since. Martina Cole is not for the faint-hearted.

You had a great cast: Alan Cumming, Keith Allen, Ken Stott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ken-stott> …
Alan was like my mum! Me, him and Ken were all sat at a table in Cape Town 
during the shoot. We said to ourselves, “Look at us Scots taking over the 
world!” My naivety came into play. I thought we were all going to be best 
friends for ever. So I forced a friendship. But Alan and I are still very good 
friends, bless him.

And you’ve been back in Scotland making a new series, One of Us
It’s a crime drama by the same writers as The Missing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/29/the-missing-james-nesbitt-review>
. My character’s brother is murdered and so is his wife. And then the murderer 
turns up at our house. I’m not allowed to tell you anything else! It’s not for 
everyone – it really goes like the clappers. It’s not an easy one to watch. My 
mum is already saying: “Oh dear, do I have to watch this one, Jo?”
