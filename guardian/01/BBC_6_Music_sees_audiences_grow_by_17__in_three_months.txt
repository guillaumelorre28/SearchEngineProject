BBC 6 Music <https://www.theguardian.com/media/6music>, which was saved from 
closure last month after an unprecedented campaign of public support, saw its 
average weekly audience grow to 1.2 million in the three months to the end of 
June, a 17% increase on the previous quarter.

 Listener numbers are up over 100% year-on-year thanks to a surge in 
popularity after the publicity that surrounded the BBC's controversial plan to 
close the digital station.

BBC Asian Network <https://www.theguardian.com/media/asian-network>, which is 
still earmarked for closure, also managed to increase its audience by 3.8% 
quarter-on-quarter and 22% year-on-year to 437,000.

However, Chris Evans <https://www.theguardian.com/media/chris-evans>, who 
recorded a big increase in audience to more than 9.5 million in the first three 
months of 2010 after he took over the Radio 2 breakfast show from Terry Wogan, 
has lost listeners.

Evans's audience declined by 11% to 8.47 million in the last three months, 
377,000 listeners ahead of Wogan's average audience in the final three months 
of 2009, and 761,000 in front of BBCRadio 1 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-1> breakfast rival Chris Moyles's 7.7 
million listeners.
