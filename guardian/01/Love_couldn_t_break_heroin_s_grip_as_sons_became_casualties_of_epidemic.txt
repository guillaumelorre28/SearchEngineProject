Penny Stringfield sits in the church where she buried her son Johny, 
recounting his death from an heroin overdose. She is composed, doesn’t raise 
her voice and doesn’t break down. She has told this story many times in the 
year since his death, and she is determined to tell it many more. “We need to 
end the stigma and shame of addiction,” she says.

An epidemic of illegal drugs is scarring America, with a twofold increase 
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6426a3.htm> in use and fourfold 
increase 
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6450a3.htm?s_cid=mm6450a3_w> in 
deaths in the last decade. The bulk of the damage is from opioids, mostly 
heroin, which has captured the attention of politicians and scientists. TheUS 
Congress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/29/obama-administration-opioid-heroin-funds>
 is slowly starting to offer more funds as scientists offeralternative 
treatments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/07/pain-medication-heroin-addiction-alternative-treatment>
. Still, the damage from drugs continues to grow.

Penny lives in Binghamton, New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york>, a midsized town at the northern 
end of the Appalachians. As you travel south, along the hills and valleys, the 
use and deaths from drugs intensifies. The damage isn’t confined by geography; 
heroin and its noxious effects are overwhelming the US. What was once a big 
city problem is now a smaller city problem.

Penny was born into a working-class neighborhood in Binghamton, and raised her 
sons there. “I grew up four blocks from this church. I raised Johny four blocks 
from this church. He went to Sunday school, sang in the choir in this church, 
and then I buried him in this church.”
 Penny Stringfield’s son, Johny. 
The story she tells – of Johny’s descent into the world of prescription 
painkillers, then “smoking a little weed”, then OxyContin, then any pills, then 
heroin – is shockingly typical. Like anyone dealing with a loved one’s 
addiction, she tries to identify that moment when things began to unravel, when 
Johny’s life shifted from mundane problems like sports, girlfriends and grades, 
to theft, jails, hospitals and eventually a funeral. “He played every sport in 
high school, was the co-captain of his team, won letters for the sport, and 
then he tore his knee. And they prescribed him painkillers.”

She spent the last five years fighting to save her child, immersed in the 
world of clinics, rehabs, hospitals, detox units, prisons, jails, out-patient 
treatments, in-patient treatments and crisis centers. She spent countless hours 
calling for help, being put on hold, put on lists, waiting for one of the 18 
beds available in the county for treatment to open up. “Once, he detoxed in my 
house because it was a bad rainstorm and no bed was going to open up – nobody 
was going to leave the shelter during the rain.”
She learned of the maddening complexity of insurance companies, of the 
confused and limited network of support available. “I was uneducated about 
addiction and about what was available. I was bullied by people who were 
supposed to help. I took no for an answer at first, then I quickly learned and 
refused to take a no.”
Plenty of people helped her. The pastor of the church sat in the ER with Johny 
one night for seven hours, providing physical and spiritual comfort. Still, she 
was slow to ask for help and scared of the stigma surrounding heroin: “I didn’t 
want my friends thinking my personal life was a mess.”

epidemic

Now her nights are spent telling anyone who will listen about heroin addiction 
– at fundraisers, charity events, lectures, politicians’ offices.

One of those people is county legislator Jason Garnar, who has also dealt with 
the devastation from heroin. A brother’s addiction ripped into his family. 
“When you are a legislator in a small county like this, you don’t think to ask, 
‘well how many people are dying from heroin?’ But it is happening. And for me 
it was very personal”, he says. It prompted him to run forcounty executive 
<http://jasongarnar.com/>. 

“We are in the greatest public health crisis in this county’s history and we 
can’t find the money to spend on it? We don’t spend the money because we still 
think it is not a disease, but a personal failing.”

Dig deeper and a question arises: why an epidemic now? Why in quiet towns such 
as Binghamton? You get a similar answer from almost everyone: boredom, 
hopelessness and availability. “I ask people, why heroin here, why now?”, 
Garnar says. “They all give me the same answer, ‘there is literally nothing to 
do here.’ There are not enough good paying jobs.”

The statistics say Binghamton’s unemployment and wages are just slightly below 
the national average. Yet relative to the past, things seem far worse. In the 
last 60 years the city has lost half of its population and many of the best 
jobs. IBM and GE, once central to the town, have fled.
This is not unique to Binghamton. Everyplace where drugs are entering, hope 
has been exiting.

Alexis Pleus sits across from me at a small café, wiping her eyes. Two years 
of retelling the story of her son Jeff’s death – to anyone who will listen, and 
to some who “don’t want to but need to” – and she still cries. “I don’t know. I 
think about it way too much. I can’t stop thinking about it.”

Pleus was born into poverty and had her first child at 15. She then dedicated 
herself to doing things differently: she went to college, got a good job and 
raised a family of three boys. She was determined they had more hope than she 
did: “I raised my kids well, maybe too well.”

Jeff went to the same college Alexis did, started a series of jobs like she 
did, but he never found a permanent job as good as she had. And then addiction 
took over.

Pleus works as an engineer; she has spent her life studying bridges, thinking 
about numbers, and she now thinks about the epidemic of addiction in both 
emotional and analytical terms.
“Jeff was such a good kid, played football and then he injured himself, and 
then came the pain meds, and well, you have heard this before. After he died I 
was given his phone. I reconstructed his final days and the extent he was able 
to deal with boredom was 10 minutes. Every 10 minutes he would reach out to 
someone and eventually that someone had drugs.”

She was working on a construction site in Baltimore when she got the call. 
Since then she has stopped working on bridges. Instead her time is spent trying 
to change people’s minds about addiction.

“This is a disease, and an epidemic, and we need more resources and more 
compassion. There is so much heroin around. Kids are growing up around it, 
without hope. Why do we shame someone when so many people are suffering? When 
they do get resources, 90% fail recovery, and made to feel more shame. Why do 
we shame someone when 90% fail? The shaming has to stop, and the compassion has 
to begin.”
