More on Andy Duncan and his decision to make amends for his vast pay packet 
while at Channel 4 by wearing a pin-stripe suit andregaling the Oxford Media 
Convention with stories of his recent holidays in Miami and South Africa 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediamonkeyblog/2010/jan/25/media-monkey-diary>
. Andy is listed as a client and contact of "leadership" consultants Steve 
Radcliffe Associates. Apparently the company offers "high-impact consulting 
that grows leaders at all levels of organisations of all kinds".The company's 
website goes on <http://www.steveradcliffe.com/>: "We are not really into tools 
and techniques â€“ we like to go deeper. We are more into the human aspects of 
leading like high aspiration, truth-speaking, self-awareness, the importance of 
relationships, sparking energy, committing to other's success and the like." 
Monkey wonders if Andy should revisit the session on self-awareness.
