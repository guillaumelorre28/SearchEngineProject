Al-Qaeda is behind the explosion after ONLY 5 minutes of the explosion and 
without any investigations is not for our interest.

Subject: Who is behind the explosion - it is not Al-Qaida as the Syrians claim

It is not in our interest to say that Al-Qaida is behind the operation because 
such statements clear the US administration and the Syrian opposition of any 
responsibility; America is fighting Al-Qaida and it will condemn the operation.

Based on what we saw from events on the ground yesterday, we have to 
acknowledge how well orchestrated it was, and we have to say that the US 
administration, the opposition and the states which infiltrated weapons are 
behind the operation so that we can start the attack.

But blaming Al-Qaida alone won't be in anyone's interest but Al-Qaida's, 
because the organisation has been in existence for decades and this is nothing 
new. I have even received contacts from Iran and Hezbollah - me being the head 
of many Iranian and Lebanese media channels - and they directed me not to 
mention that Al-Qaida was behind the operation cause it would be a blatant 
media and tactical mistake and futile.

The matter should be amended with extreme speed and I won't broadcast on my 
channels any news related to Al-Qaida.

This point is in your interest and to help you; please make use of it, Syria
