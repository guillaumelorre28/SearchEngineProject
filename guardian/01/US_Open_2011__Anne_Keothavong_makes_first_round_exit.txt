Anne Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> could not 
make it three British women into the second round of the US Open when she lost 
7-5, 6-3 to the South African Chanelle Scheepers.

After waiting all day to play, the 27-year-old made a blistering start, coming 
out on top of three consecutive breaks and establishing a 5-2 lead. But she 
wobbled serving for the set. A set point came and went and, when Scheepers 
created a break point, the Londoner double-faulted.

The South African broke again to win the first set and then made it six games 
in a row with another break at the start of the second set. Keothavong stopped 
the rot at seven games and had her chances to get back on level terms but she 
could not take them, and a tally of 52 unforced errors and only 19 winners told 
its own story.

The defeat was doubly disappointing for Keothavong after victories for Elena 
Baltacha and Laura Robson, while Heather Watson gave third seed Maria Sharapova 
a huge scare.

The 27-year-old said: "She didn't hit me off the court, she just didn't miss. 
That's the way she plays. She's someone I've practised with quite a lot in the 
past. I knew what to expect, I felt like I had to try to be more aggressive.

"I got myself into a winning situation in the first set, I just wasn't able to 
close it out. I kept fighting, I kept trying my best, it just wasn't good 
enough. The tennis is there, it's just finding the consistency again that has 
been the hard thing for me to do. It's infuriating for me playing that kind of 
tennis when I know I'm capable of better stuff but it's not life or death."
