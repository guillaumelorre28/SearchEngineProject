Suu Kyi, who is barred from the presidency under an army-drafted constitution, 
has made clear she will be “above the president” and Htin Kyaw is expected to 
act as a proxy.

Reporters in the capital, Naypyidaw, were not allowed to enter the parliament 
chamber when the voting took place.

A final tally giving Htin Kyaw 360 out of 652 votes was met with applause. The 
two runners up, military nominee Myint Swe and ethnic minority Chin candidate 
Henry Van Thio, will become first and second vice-presidents respectively.

Aung San Suu Kyi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi>, herself 
a member of parliament, cast her vote and later smiled broadly and clapped when 
the results were announced.

The parliament chamber was mostly a light orange, the colour of the NLD 
majority who wore Burmeselongyi skirts and traditional hats. Also present were 
members of ethnic parties and military representatives.

Myanmar <https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar> held elections in 
November, with the NLD winning a majority in both houses of parliament.


Suu Kyi’s majority allowed her to effectively handpick a successor to the 
current president, Thein Sein, a former generalwho implemented reforms in 2011

moving the country away from dictatorship.

Although Thein Sein retired from the army to take office, the 2010 elections 
that preceded his appointment were widely dismissed as fraudulent and his 
political party is a military creation.

Htin Kyaw was elected under a complex system in which the two chambers of 
parliament nominated two presidential candidates and military MPs nominated a 
third, assuring the army continued influence.


The army also retains 25% of seats in parliament under a 2008 constitution 
that it drafted, giving it an effective veto on constitutional change. It also 
keeps key ministerial portfolios related to security.

Myint Swe, 64, the military’s nominee, is a hardline conservative blacklisted 
by the US. He is a close ally to former junta leader Than Shwe and has been 
criticised for dealing harshly with opposition activists under military rule.

US State Department spokesman John Kirby said at a briefing on Friday in 
Washington that he had no indication Myint Swe would be taken off the sanctions 
list.

“We have made our concerns known about this individual and this process, quite 
frankly, and we’ll monitor it going forward,” hetold 
<http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2016/03/254629.htm> reporters.

Htin Kyaw, however, comes from the other side of Myanmar’s long history of 
oppression under military rule. He went to school in Yangon alongside Aung San 
Suu Kyi before winning a scholarship to study at university in the UK, and 
spent four months in jail in 2000 after trying to help the NLD leader travel 
outside Yangon.

Htin Kyaw is also a senior executive at a charitable foundation named after 
Aung San Suu Kyi’s mother. He is the son of Min Thu Wun, a respected author and 
poet.

Thant Myint-U, a historian and the grandson of the former UN secretary general 
U Thant, has said Htin Kyaw is “from a family that’s been at the heart of 
Burma’s [long submerged] liberal tradition for nearly a century”.

The constitution prevents the top job from going to anyone with foreign 
children. Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent 15 of 21 years under house arrest, has 
two British sons.

In a sign of the mandate that Suu Kyi commands in this parliament, the final 
count suggested that 54 independent and ethnic party members voted for the NLD 
candidate.

Myint Swe received 213 votes and Henry Van Thio took 79 votes.

NLD spokesman Win Htein said this month that Aung San Suu Kyi still planned to 
become the president – “it just depends on whether it is earlier or later”.
