MPs should examine the evidence that the home secretary, Amber Rudd, used to 
make a decision to block an independent inquiry into the Orgreave clashes 
between police and miners, the home affairs select committee chair,Yvette Cooper
 <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/yvette-cooper>, has said.

Cooper will write to Rudd to request the information she was given before she 
came to herdecision not to allow the inquiry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/31/government-rules-out-orgreave-inquiry>
, and all the information held by the Home Office on policing at Orgreave.

The influential committee also hopes to examine evidence held by South 
Yorkshire police about the 1984 clashes, which saw some of the most violent 
scenes of the miners’ strike, as well as an unredacted copy of the Independent
Police <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/police> Complaints Commission (IPCC) 
investigation into Orgreave and any information it considered.

“Concern about policing at Orgreave will not go away as long as there are 
fears that the truth has not come out,” Cooper said.

“That is why we are seeking answers from the home secretary, South Yorkshire 
police and the IPCC about what information they have seen and what remains 
unpublished or unexamined.”

Striking miners say they were set upon by baton-wielding officers on 
horseback, with 95 people charged with riot and violent disorder, but all the 
cases collapsed and South Yorkshire police were later required to pay 
compensation.

Rudd’s decision not to hold an inquiry into the violence at the South 
Yorkshire coking plant angered families, who say they were led to believe the 
Home Office was on side.

Cooper said MPs “need to know what information the home secretary looked at 
before taking her decision and whether she examined papers from the time from 
South Yorkshire police or government files”.

She said South Yorkshire police should also submit the evidence they held. “We 
also need to hear from SYP about what information they have in their archives 
and what they are doing to publish it, and from the IPCC about what information 
they looked at and what lies behind their redacted report into Orgreave 
policing. We want to know the facts and not have information hidden away.”

The Conservative backbencher Sir Edward Leigh has also suggested a special 
select committee could be set up to investigate Orgreave, backed by a 
cross-party group of MPs including the former shadow home secretaryAndy Burnham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham>, the Lib Dem leader, Tim 
Farron, the Green co-leader Caroline Lucas, the former SDLP leader Mark Durkan 
and the SNP MP Joanna Cherry.
