"What do you have to forget?"
It was a week or two later. Another hotel suite, another country. She'd paid 
for my ticket out there, my car from the airport, my room next to hers. My 
friends had been impressed by the glamour, but they didn't know at all.

She looked at her fingernails. They were bitten and dirty. A woman would come 
to the room and apply fake ones before the show.
"Oh you know," she said, "my dad never wanted me, my mum pushed me too hard."
She said it so off-handedly that I couldn't tell if she was serious.

"Is that true?"
She rolled her eyes. 
"Didn't you read last month's Heat? My auntie Sandra told them that's just 
what happened to me. God," she rubbed at her chewed fingernails, "sometimes I 
forget what my real life story is."
"But is it true?"
"Why does anyone want to be famous, do you think?" she said at last. 
"I don't know."
"I'll have to be a lot drunker before I tell you why I wanted it."

Later, drunker.
"My dad, right, my dad," she rolled over on to her back on the bed. Her top 
had ridden up, exposing her midriff.
"Yeah?" I said. 
"What my auntie Sandra said about my dad, didjoo read it? Didjoo? Oh no you 
din't I forgot."
I leaned in a little closer to her. I could smell her perfume, fresh and 
citrus, under the scent of the alcohol. She sat up abruptly, sloshing her drink 
over the bed.
"She said, right," she waggled her finger at me, "she said I wanted him to 
love me and thas why I was'driven to succeed' 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/24/gladiator.crowe>, right? But thas 
not it."
"No?" I said. 
"No," she said, "I want him to hear about me, right? I want him to know who I 
am. And one day I want him to turn up at the stage door just so that I can tell 
him â€¦" she hiccoughed, "just so that I can tell him to piss off."
