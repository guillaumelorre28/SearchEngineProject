Here’s a video tutorial for one of my favourite hairstyles, the half-crown 
braid.

I wear this style a lot because it’s both pretty and practical. You can wear 
your hair down but the braids keep your hair back and away from your face. Plus 
it takes less than two minutes to do.

This hairstyle works on both curly and straight hair and you can find my 
picture tutorial for the half-crown braid in straight hair here.

 * Start by taking a 1-2 inch section of hair on the left side of your hair 
above your ear. Split this section in three and make a braid (plait).

 * Angle the braid back around your head and secure the end of the braid with 
a small clear hair elastic.

 * Repeat on the right side, taking a section above your ear and making a 
braid. Secure the end with a small clear elastic.

 * Bring one braid across the back of your head and pin in place with bobby 
pins.

 * Cross the other braid over the first and tuck the end in behind the first 
braid. Secure with bobby pins.
