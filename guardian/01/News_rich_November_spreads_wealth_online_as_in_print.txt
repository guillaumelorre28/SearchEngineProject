Notes on a Paris weekend of terror, as reflected in Audit Bureau of 
Circulation figures for November: theTimes does spectacularly well – print 
circulation up 3.38% in a month and 4.47% year on year to 407,566 – and the
Telegraphmanages a 1.21% monthly rise so it’s only 2.72% down (to 480,730). The 
Guardian and the Independent are both up month on month, though by under 1%. 
But theSun, Mail, Express and Mirror all fell a little in news-rich November. 
Naught for print comfort there.

Except that news has a way of bursting through artificial barriers. Online, 
the Guardian had a brilliant November, putting on 1.1 million (to 9.3 million a 
day) and boasting a 53.6% rise over 2014. Digitally the Telegraph, Mail, Mirror 
and Sun had great months as well. Indeed, it was a splendid November on the 
news web.

Did the Times do well, then, because its paywall damped down the surge it 
might have had on the open net? Perhaps that’s part of it, and perhaps the 
Telegraph’s own mini-boost has something to with its more porous paywall. One 
more more reason for ABC – the great auditor of sales facts and figures – to 
press on with its new policy of bringing print and digital statistics together. 
There is a divide, to be sure. But – transition talk or no – there’s also the 
feeling of a bigger news ballpark where stories (buoyed by broadcast exposure) 
develop a force of their own and find audiences who want the facts in an 
instant and a careful explanation as soon as possible afterwards.
