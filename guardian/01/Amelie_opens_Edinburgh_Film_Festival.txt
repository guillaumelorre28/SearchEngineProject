The Edinburgh Film Festival opened last night with the international premiere 
of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film Am√©lie, which has been a box-office smash in 
France, although it has divided the critics.

Among the 161 films, including four world and 20 British premieres, that will 
be screened during the next two weeks, the festival is to host the first 
showing of Full Monty director Peter Cattaneo's new film, Lucky Break, about a 
group of prisoners who attempt to escape while staging a musical. The film, 
starring James Nesbitt, Timothy Spall and Olivia Williams, premieres tomorrow.

Mick Jagger is also expected at the festival to see the premiere of an 
adaptation of Robert Harris's thriller, Enigma, which he produced.

Sean Penn is scheduled to appear to promote The Pledge, starring Jack 
Nicholson, Vanessa Redgrave and Benicio Del Toro, which he directed.

Billy Connolly's face was projected onto the rock face below Edinburgh Castle 
to launch the event and Sean Connery and Ewan McGregor are also to be honoured 
with the impressive tribute.
