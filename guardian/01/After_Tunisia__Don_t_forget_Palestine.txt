Your 10 Arab writers gave voice to the wave of optimism that is sweeping 
through their countries in the wake of the peaceful revolution in Tunisia (
"After Tunisia", 29 January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/after-tunisia-arabic-writers-reflect>
). It was melancholy to note, however, that Raja Shehadeh, the Palestinian 
lawyer and writer, cannot share in this optimism. While the rest of the Arab 
world is at long last moving towards participatory democracy, a police state is 
emerging in Palestine with active western support.

Until a few years ago, Palestine was the only democracy in the Arab world. In 
January 2006, Hamas won a free and fair election but was not allowed to enjoy 
the fruits of its victory. Israel, the US and the European Union refused to 
recognise the Hamas-led government and did everything in their power to 
undermine it. These countries never tire of extolling the virtues of democracy 
but when the people vote for the wrong party, they condemn the outcome. It was 
always a mistake to pursue security at the expense of freedom and democracy. 
And it would be short-sighted to persist in this policy towards any Arab 
country, including Palestine, for without democracy there can be no lasting 
peace.
