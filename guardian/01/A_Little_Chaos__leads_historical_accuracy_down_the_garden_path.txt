 A Little Chaos – video review 
The film begins in Paris in 1682, with a tiny French prince soiling himself at 
court. “Your majesty, I’ve stink in my linen,” he tells Louis XIV (Alan 
Rickman). Alas, it’s downhill from here. Moody hunk André le Nôtre (Matthias 
Schoenaerts) interviews a bunch of wigs for a gardening job at Versailles. In 
real life, Le Nôtre began work at Versailles in 1661; he was pushing 70 by 
1682, twice Schoenaerts’s age in the movie. Among the wigs is the blatantly 
fictional Sabine de Barra (Kate Winslet), who fails to impress Le Nôtre with 
her fluffy hat and fluffier ideas. “Are you a believer in order? Order over 
landscape?” barks le Nôtre. “Order seems to demand that we hark back to Rome or 
the Renaissance,” she replies. To be fair to the film, order versus chaos was 
the central conflict in 17th and 18th-century garden design: the formal 
parterres, topiary and orderly construction of French and Italian gardens 
versus the naturalistic (yet still contrived) rolling hills and reflecting 
lakes which were pioneered by Capability Brown in Britain in the mid-1700s. 
Humiliated, De Barra skulks off home, showing the good sense to bung her hat in 
the composting bin on the way.

Le Nôtre may have loathed De Barra’s plans, but the film needs him to give her 
the job anyway – and can’t really be bothered to think of a good reason he 
might do so. So he follows her home because he just does, and lights all the 
candles in her private boho cliché garden. “This abundance of chaos – is this 
your Eden?” he asks, even though it all looks quite neat: the film has 
effectively given up on its own theme already. At Versailles, De Barra will 
build the extremely orderlyBosquet de la Salle du Bal 
<http://en.chateauversailles.fr/discover-the-estate/the-gardens/the-copses/the-groves>
, also known as the Bosquet des Rocailles. It was really laid out by Le Nôtre 
between 1680 and 1683.


People

More characters turn up, though you may wish they wouldn’t. Le Nôtre has a 
mean wife (played by Helen McCrory), who wants to destroy him and De Barra for 
no apparent motive other than that the film needs some sort of villain. Le 
Nôtre’s real wife, Françoise Langlois, bore him three children who all died 
young; she probably wasn’t evil. Then there is Philippe, Duke of Orléans 
(Stanley Tucci), a character with no function and no arc at all. “I simply do 
as I’m told. Even down to marrying large German women,” he says, indicating the 
Princess Palatine (Paula Paul). The film is right that Orléans was probably 
gay, but it does go on about it rather – and to no effect.

The dialogue is relentlessly dire, lacking any subtlety or feel for the 17th 
century. Le Nôtre thinks his marriage should make him “feel special”; his wife 
says things like: “André, I feel us at the edge of something here.” A gardener 
tells De Barra: “You need to be the boss man.” There is a painfully overwritten 
scene about ageing women being like roses who lose their bloom, delivered for 
the benefit of Louis’s mistress Madame de Montespan (Jennifer Ehle), who is 
being passed over for the implicitly younger and fresher Madame de Maintenon. 
This is not only bad, but wrong: in real life, La Maintenon was five years 
older than La Montespan.

Romance

Almost everything – the sight of a wheel, a loud sound, construction work – 
triggers a flashback for De Barra, who is carrying a dark secret about a lost 
child. It’s like Gravity, but on Earth. “Do you admire the master [Le Nôtre]?” 
Louis XIV asks De Barra. She replies, inexplicably: “He is the most complete 
person I know.” Since his character remains opaque, we’ll have to take her word 
for it. There is no chemistry between Le Nôtre and De Barra, but you know 
they’re going to have to have sex eventually. When they finally get down, it 
triggers yet more heavy-handed lost-child flashbacks, and is so boring even Le 
Nôtre falls asleep.

Verdict

Solid performances from some extremely talented actors can’t coax this wilted 
blossom back to life.
