Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is bouncing around Rod Laver Arena after wrapping up a fine 
6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Marcos Baghdatis, who was overpowered by the 
Frenchman’s big serving, variation and overall greater quality despite showing 
why he once got to a final here. That was a long time ago, though, and 
Baghdatis is more of a throwback showman these days, good enough to test the 
best in a five-set match, not durable or consistent enough to actually beat 
them. He’s out in the first round, while Tsonga is through to face Australia’s 
Omar Jasika, who’s only 18.

That’s the end of today’s action. It’s been a fun first day. There were no 
shocks of seismic proportions, with Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Nick Kyrgios 
and other big names in the men’s draw sailing through and Serena Williams, 
Maria Sharapova, Agnieszka Radwanska and Petra Kvitova untroubled in the 
women’s draw, but there were a few surprising results about, the 17th seed 
Benoit Paire losing to young American Noah Rubin and a host of top women going 
out. Caroline Wozniacki was the biggest name to fall, losing to Kazakhstan’s 
Yulia Putintseva. From a British perspective, Kyle Edmund andHeather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> both suffered disappointing 
defeats. Ah well. There’s always Andy Murray. His match against Alexander 
Zverev is up second on Margaret Court Arena tomorrow.

The big story of the day, though? Those match fixing allegations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/18/novak-djokovic-match-fixing-tennis-australian-open>
. Now there’s a story that could run and run. Thanks for reading. Goodbye.

Tsonga has broken again and will serve for the match at 5-2. You have to feel 
for Baghdatis, who played so well in the first three sets.

The pressure tells. Tsonga breaks for a 3-2 lead in set four and the final 
match on day one has taken what should be a decisive turn.

Tsonga is pressing for a break in the fourth set here. Baghatis is doing all 
he can to hold him off, but the pressure is growing.

Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut, who could have made it as a footballer, given 
that he was on the books of Villarreal until he was 14, has beaten Martin Klizan
. The 24th seed overcomes a curious mid-match wobble to win 6-2, 6-3, 4-6, 2-6, 
6-2. An odd five-setter.

Roberto Bautista Agut has steadied himself in the fifth set against Martin 
Klizan. The Spaniard leads 3-1 and it appears that normal service has been 
resumed after the weirdness of the previous two sets.

Sam Stosur is on shaky ground, but she’s still standing. Krystyna Pliskova 
served for the match at 5-4, but they’re still going and Stosur has a 6-5 lead 
in the second set.

An hour or so ago, Roberto Bautista Agut was feeling pretty good about life. 
He led 6-2, 6-3 against Martin Klizan. Since then? Eh. They’ve gone into a 
fifth set, Klizan taking sets three and four 6-4, 6-3. This is an impressive 
fightback from the Slovakian.

They’re level on Margaret Court Arena, where Marcos Baghdatis turned on the 
style at the end of the second set and took it 6-4. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is 
unhappy with the behaviour of some fans in the crowd and he’s had a word with 
the umpire during the changeover.

Heather Watson is out of the Australian Open. I’m not going to call it a brave 
effort. Timea Babos secures her first ever win in the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>, at the fourth time of 
asking, battering a backhand down the line to win 6-7, 7-5, 7-5. The 
22-year-old Hungarian enjoyed that. It’s a huge win for her, but a dreadful 
disappointment for Watson. The British No2 served for the match in the second 
set, but she failed to take her chances and Babos took full advantage, 
levelling the match and then overpowering her opponent in the end. Watson will 
be feeling pretty sick after letting a lurching, topsy-turvy contest got away 
from her. There was some excellent tennis out there, but that won’t be much of 
a consolation. The 23-year-old’s miserable record in Melbourne, where she has 
made the second round on only one occasion, continues and the question now is 
whether Judy Murray will stay on as her coach.
 Babos is through to the next round. Photograph: Jason O'Brien/Reuters

Watson breaks back! This is absurd. Babos plonks a forehand wide on a second 
break point and they’re back on serve after four consecutive breaks. You have 
to admire Watson’s spirit, but she still trails 5-4 and has to hold now.

dropping her serve to love.That was poor. Babos will serve for the match at 5-3.

Heather Watson had it all to do. She’s done all she had to do. For now,

responding to being broken by zinging a backhand down the line to haul herself

A smooth enough ride for Jo-Wilfried Tsonga against the wily Marcos Baghdatis 
so far, the No9 seed winning the first set 6-4.It’s been an unsurprisingly

Petkovic, who’s lost 7-5, 6-4 to Elizaveta Kulichkova. A huge win for the 
19-year-old Russian, a massive disappointment for the 22nd seed.

They’re still locked on serve in the third set on Court 8, Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> and Timea Babos both 
refusing to give each other an inch so far. It’s 2-2, with Babos serving.

Another break point for Babos, though, and this time she takes it. Watson will 
be kicking herself. She served for the match and now look, she finds herself 
serving to force a second-set tie-break at 6-5 down. She still needs to develop 
more of a ruthless streak in her game.

Nick Kyrgios has beaten Pablo Carreno Busta in unfussy style, winning 6-2, 
7-5, 6-2. The 29th seed will presumably celebrate by listening to some loud 
music or getting a garish tattoo of a skull on his chest. Kids, eh? Tsk. He 
faces Argentina’s Pablo Cuevas in the second round.

On Margaret Court Arena, we’ve got an intriguing match between two fabulously 
entertaining players, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the ninth seed and a losing finalist 
in 2008, and Marcos Baghdatis, the erratic and engaging Cypriot talent who was 
a losing finalist in 2006. Baghdatis is ranked 46th in the world, but he 
possesses the kind of wildcard game to cause problems for anyone on his day.

Kevin Mitchell has filed a story on Novak Djokovic’s  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/18/novak-djokovic-match-fixing-tennis-australian-open>
thoughts on the match fixing allegations. The world No1 responded to an 
incident in 2007 when it was alleged he was offered $200,000 to throw a match.

After seeing off the exciting young Korean Hyeon Chung in three quick sets on 
the first day of the 2016Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>, the defending champion 
Djokovic said: “I’ve heard about the story and I read that there were a couple 
of players mentioned who are not active anymore,” he said, “talking about the 
matches that have happened almost 10 years ago. Of course, there is no room for 
any match-fixing or corruption in our sport. We’re trying to keep it as clean 
as possible. We have, I think, a sport that has evolved, and have upgraded our 
programs and authorities to deal with these particular cases.

“I don’t think a shadow is cast over our sport. People are talking about 
names, guessing who these players are. But there’s no real proof or evidence 
yet of any active players, for that matter. As long as it’s like that, it’s 
just speculation.”

He spoke too about an incident in 2007 when it was alleged he had been offered 
$200,000 to throw a first-round match in Petersburg, a tournament he did not 
eventually attend.

“I was not approached directly,” he said. “Well... I was approached through 
people that were working with me at that time, that were with my team. Of 
course, we threw it away right away. It didn’t even get to me, the guy that was 
trying to talk to me, he didn’t even get to me directly. There was nothing out 
of it.

“Unfortunately there were some, in those times, those days, rumours, some 
talks, some people were going around. They were dealt with. In the last six, 
seven years, I haven’t heard anything similar. I personally was never 
approached directly, so I have nothing more to say about that.”

“It’s a nice opening,” Federer says. “I’m happy I played so well. I agree I 
played great. I’m feeling much better than I did in Brisbane.”His victory was 
never in doubt, but he could find it tougher in his second match, when he’ll 
face the Ukrainian world No35, Alexandr Dolgopolov. That one promises to be

It’s all over on Rod Laver Arena. You’re not going to believe this, but Roger 
Federer <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> has beaten Nikoloz 
Basilashvili for the loss of only five games. If you blinked, you missed it.

Nice to know you, Nao Hibino. Good of you to join us. But it’s time to leave. 
She’s been outclassed by Maria Sharapova, which is no surprise, and the No5 
seed is through after a 6-1, 6-3 victory.

Nick Kyrgios has Pablo Carreno Busta right where he wants him. He’s up 6-2, 
7-5 against the Spaniard and it doesn’t seem that he’s being held back by any 
fitness problems.

Judy Murray’s influence appears to be doing wonders for Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson>. The British No2 has willed 
herself into a first-set lead, winning a tie-break 7-4 against Hungary’s Timea 
Babos. But there’s still a way to go in this one. Don’t be surprised if it goes 
into a third set.

Grigor Dimitrov comes through a testing encounter with Paolo Lorenzi, beating 
the Italian 6-3, 7-6, 6-3.It looks like a straightforward result, but Dimitrov 
could easily have lost the second and third sets. That probably helps explain 
why he’s seeded 27th.

Roger Federer is making serene progress towards the second round. He leads 
6-2, 6-1 and he’s playing so well that it actually represents an achievement 
for Nikoloz Basilashvili that he took a game in that second set.

Andrea Seppi, who knocked out Federer last year, has recovered well from the 
loss of the first set against Teymuraz Gabashvili. He leads 3-6, 7-6, 6-4. 
Sounds like a ding-dong battle over on Court 13.

Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is bouncing around Rod Laver Arena after wrapping up a fine 
6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Marcos Baghdatis, who was overpowered by the 
Frenchman’s big serving, variation and overall greater quality despite showing 
why he once got to a final here. That was a long time ago, though, and 
Baghdatis is more of a throwback showman these days, good enough to test the 
best in a five-set match, not durable or consistent enough to actually beat 
them. He’s out in the first round, while Tsonga is through to face Australia’s 
Omar Jasika, who’s only 18.

That’s the end of today’s action. It’s been a fun first day. There were no 
shocks of seismic proportions, with Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Nick Kyrgios 
and other big names in the men’s draw sailing through and Serena Williams, 
Maria Sharapova, Agnieszka Radwanska and Petra Kvitova untroubled in the 
women’s draw, but there were a few surprising results about, the 17th seed 
Benoit Paire losing to young American Noah Rubin and a host of top women going 
out. Caroline Wozniacki was the biggest name to fall, losing to Kazakhstan’s 
Yulia Putintseva. From a British perspective, Kyle Edmund andHeather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> both suffered disappointing 
defeats. Ah well. There’s always Andy Murray. His match against Alexander 
Zverev is up second on Margaret Court Arena tomorrow.

The big story of the day, though? Those match fixing allegations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/18/novak-djokovic-match-fixing-tennis-australian-open>
. Now there’s a story that could run and run. Thanks for reading. Goodbye.
 
Tsonga has broken again and will serve for the match at 5-2. You have to feel 
for Baghdatis, who played so well in the first three sets.
 
The pressure tells. Tsonga breaks for a 3-2 lead in set four and the final 
match on day one has taken what should be a decisive turn.
 
Tsonga is pressing for a break in the fourth set here. Baghatis is doing all 
he can to hold him off, but the pressure is growing.
 
Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut, who could have made it as a footballer, given 
that he was on the books of Villarreal until he was 14, has beaten Martin Klizan
. The 24th seed overcomes a curious mid-match wobble to win 6-2, 6-3, 4-6, 2-6, 
6-2. An odd five-setter.
 
All’s well in the world of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga again, as the Frenchman wins the 
third set against Marcos Baghdatis.He leads 6-4, 4-6, 6-4
 
Another seed falls in the women’s draw. There’s deflation on Rod Laver Arena 
as Australia Sam Stosur, the 25th seed, loses 6-4, 7-6 to Kristyna Pliskova.
 
Here’s some audio of John Whittingdale’s thoughts on today’s match fixing 
allegations. Feast your eyes on that.
 
Roberto Bautista Agut has steadied himself in the fifth set against Martin 
Klizan. The Spaniard leads 3-1 and it appears that normal service has been 
resumed after the weirdness of the previous two sets.
 
Sam Stosur is on shaky ground, but she’s still standing. Krystyna Pliskova 
served for the match at 5-4, but they’re still going and Stosur has a 6-5 lead 
in the second set.
 
An hour or so ago, Roberto Bautista Agut was feeling pretty good about life. 
He led 6-2, 6-3 against Martin Klizan. Since then? Eh. They’ve gone into a 
fifth set, Klizan taking sets three and four 6-4, 6-3. This is an impressive 
fightback from the Slovakian.
 
They’re level on Margaret Court Arena, where Marcos Baghdatis turned on the 
style at the end of the second set and took it 6-4. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is 
unhappy with the behaviour of some fans in the crowd and he’s had a word with 
the umpire during the changeover.
 
Heather Watson is out of the Australian Open. I’m not going to call it a brave 
effort. Timea Babos secures her first ever win in the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>, at the fourth time of 
asking, battering a backhand down the line to win 6-7, 7-5, 7-5. The 
22-year-old Hungarian enjoyed that. It’s a huge win for her, but a dreadful 
disappointment for Watson. The British No2 served for the match in the second 
set, but she failed to take her chances and Babos took full advantage, 
levelling the match and then overpowering her opponent in the end. Watson will 
be feeling pretty sick after letting a lurching, topsy-turvy contest got away 
from her. There was some excellent tennis out there, but that won’t be much of 
a consolation. The 23-year-old’s miserable record in Melbourne, where she has 
made the second round on only one occasion, continues and the question now is 
whether Judy Murray will stay on as her coach.

A huge forehand down the line from Babos brings up a match point. Watson is on 
the brink.
 
It’s Babos’s turn to hold. She leads 6-5 and Watson will have to hold to stay 
in the match again/
 
Watson holds. An actual hold. This is what it looks like. It’s 5-5 in the 
third set.
 
Watson breaks back! This is absurd. Babos plonks a forehand wide on a second 
break point and they’re back on serve after four consecutive breaks. You have 
to admire Watson’s spirit, but she still trails 5-4 and has to hold now.
 
Watson undoes all her good work in the previous game, tightening up and 
dropping her serve to love.That was poor. Babos will serve for the match at 5-3.
 
Andrea Seppi is finally through to the second round, winning a titanic 
fourth-set tie-break 12-10 and securing a hard-fought 3-6, 7-6, 6-4, 7-6 
victory over Georgia’s Teymuraz Gabashvili.
 
Heather Watson had it all to do. She’s done all she had to do. For now, 
anyway, after she responds to being broken by hitting back straight away, 
responding to being broken by zinging a backhand down the line to haul herself 
level in the third set. Babos leads 4-3 and it’s Watson to serve.

Australia’s Sam Stosur, a former US Open champion and the 25th seed, is 
disappointing the home fans on Rod Laver Arena.She’s dropped the first set 6-4 
to Krystyna Pliskova.
 
A smooth enough ride for Jo-Wilfried Tsonga against the wily Marcos Baghdatis 
so far, the No9 seed winning the first set 6-4.It’s been an unsurprisingly 
enjoyable match.
 
And Watson doesn’t hold. Babos gets the precious break and she leads 4-2 in 
the decider. Watson has it all to do here.
 
Watson saves both break points, though, and the game goes to deuce! She’s 
hanging on. But she still has to hold.
 
Timea Babos has two break points against Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> in the third set. This could 
be a critical moment.
 
Another seed bites the dust in the women’s draw. We’ve already said farewell 
to Sloane Stephens, Caroline Wozniacki, Sara Errani and Anastasia 
Pavlyuchenkova today and now it’s time to wave goodbye to Germany’s Andrea 
Petkovic, who’s lost 7-5, 6-4 to Elizaveta Kulichkova. A huge win for the 
19-year-old Russian, a massive disappointment for the 22nd seed.
 
They’re still locked on serve in the third set on Court 8, Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> and Timea Babos both 
refusing to give each other an inch so far. It’s 2-2, with Babos serving.
 
It’s going with the form book on Margaret Court Arena, where Jo-Wilfried 
Tsonga leads 4-2 in the first set against Marcos Baghdatis. The winner faces 
Australia’s Omar Jasika in the next round.
 
Roger Federer has been asked about the matchfixing allegations in his press 
conference.

Federer on match-fixing allegations: Clearly you've got to take it 
super-serious

Quite the collapse from Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson>. Broken to 15, she loses the 
second set 7-5 to Timea Babos, having served for the match at 5-4. Oh dear.
 
Another break point for Babos, though, and this time she takes it. Watson will 
be kicking herself. She served for the match and now look, she finds herself 
serving to force a second-set tie-break at 6-5 down. She still needs to develop 
more of a ruthless streak in her game.
 
Watson saves the break point! It’s deuce.
 
After winning a 40-stroke rally, Britain’s Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> is serving for a place in 
the second round at 5-4 in the second set.But hang on just a moment. Timea 
Babos has a break point here.
 
Nick Kyrgios has beaten Pablo Carreno Busta in unfussy style, winning 6-2, 
7-5, 6-2. The 29th seed will presumably celebrate by listening to some loud 
music or getting a garish tattoo of a skull on his chest. Kids, eh? Tsk. He 
faces Argentina’s Pablo Cuevas in the second round.
 
On Margaret Court Arena, we’ve got an intriguing match between two fabulously 
entertaining players, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the ninth seed and a losing finalist 
in 2008, and Marcos Baghdatis, the erratic and engaging Cypriot talent who was 
a losing finalist in 2006. Baghdatis is ranked 46th in the world, but he 
possesses the kind of wildcard game to cause problems for anyone on his day.
 
Andrea Petkovic has some work to do on Court 6. The 22nd seed has lost the 
first set 7-5 to the 19-year-old Russian, Elizaveta Kulichkova.
 
Kevin Mitchell has filed a story on Novak Djokovic’s  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/18/novak-djokovic-match-fixing-tennis-australian-open>
thoughts on the match fixing allegations. The world No1 responded to an 
incident in 2007 when it was alleged he was offered $200,000 to throw a match.

After seeing off the exciting young Korean Hyeon Chung in three quick sets on 
the first day of the 2016Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>, the defending champion 
Djokovic said: “I’ve heard about the story and I read that there were a couple 
of players mentioned who are not active anymore,” he said, “talking about the 
matches that have happened almost 10 years ago. Of course, there is no room for 
any match-fixing or corruption in our sport. We’re trying to keep it as clean 
as possible. We have, I think, a sport that has evolved, and have upgraded our 
programs and authorities to deal with these particular cases.

“I don’t think a shadow is cast over our sport. People are talking about 
names, guessing who these players are. But there’s no real proof or evidence 
yet of any active players, for that matter. As long as it’s like that, it’s 
just speculation.”

He spoke too about an incident in 2007 when it was alleged he had been offered 
$200,000 to throw a first-round match in Petersburg, a tournament he did not 
eventually attend.

“I was not approached directly,” he said. “Well... I was approached through 
people that were working with me at that time, that were with my team. Of 
course, we threw it away right away. It didn’t even get to me, the guy that was 
trying to talk to me, he didn’t even get to me directly. There was nothing out 
of it.

“Unfortunately there were some, in those times, those days, rumours, some 
talks, some people were going around. They were dealt with. In the last six, 
seven years, I haven’t heard anything similar. I personally was never 
approached directly, so I have nothing more to say about that.”

“It’s a nice opening,” Federer says. “I’m happy I played so well. I agree I 
played great. I’m feeling much better than I did in Brisbane.”His victory was 
never in doubt, but he could find it tougher in his second match, when he’ll 
face the Ukrainian world No35, Alexandr Dolgopolov. That one promises to be 
entertaining.
 
It’s all over on Rod Laver Arena. You’re not going to believe this, but Roger 
Federer <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> has beaten Nikoloz 
Basilashvili for the loss of only five games. If you blinked, you missed it.

Nice to know you, Nao Hibino. Good of you to join us. But it’s time to leave. 
She’s been outclassed by Maria Sharapova, which is no surprise, and the No5 
seed is through after a 6-1, 6-3 victory.
 
Nick Kyrgios has Pablo Carreno Busta right where he wants him. He’s up 6-2, 
7-5 against the Spaniard and it doesn’t seem that he’s being held back by any 
fitness problems.

the Australian Open. Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images 
Eugenie Bouchard is through, sweeping past Andrea Krunic 6-3, 6-4. That should 
do the young Canadian a world of good.
 
Judy Murray’s influence appears to be doing wonders for Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson>. The British No2 has willed 
herself into a first-set lead, winning a tie-break 7-4 against Hungary’s Timea 
Babos. But there’s still a way to go in this one. Don’t be surprised if it goes 
into a third set.
 
Grigor Dimitrov comes through a testing encounter with Paolo Lorenzi, beating 
the Italian 6-3, 7-6, 6-3.It looks like a straightforward result, but Dimitrov 
could easily have lost the second and third sets. That probably helps explain 
why he’s seeded 27th.

the Australian Open. Photograph: Pat Scala/Getty Images 
Heather Watson is into a tie-break with Timea Babos. She had an early break, 
but it’s been a tight first set.
 
Roger Federer is making serene progress towards the second round. He leads 
6-2, 6-1 and he’s playing so well that it actually represents an achievement 
for Nikoloz Basilashvili that he took a game in that second set.
 
Grigor Dimitrov appears to be over his third-set wobble against Paolo Lorenzi. 
Already two sets up, the Bulgarian has broken back against the Italian.
 
Andrea Seppi, who knocked out Federer last year, has recovered well from the 
loss of the first set against Teymuraz Gabashvili. He leads 3-6, 7-6, 6-4. 
Sounds like a ding-dong battle over on Court 13.
 
Nick Kyrgios has pulled himself together, the little scamp. He breaks back in 
the second set and leads 6-2, 3-2.
