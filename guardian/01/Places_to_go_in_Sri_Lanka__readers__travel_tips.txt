Winning tip: Sri Lankan gothic


Have tea, dinner or cocktails in Helga’s Folly, a fabulously spooky gothic 
mansion in the midst of jungle flora with to-die-for views of the historic city 
of Kandy. Every inch is covered in paintings, photographs, mirrors and dripping 
candles. This is where Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier and Zandra Rhodes stayed 
and where the Stereophonics wrote an ode to its owner, Madame Helga. The 
eccentric proprietor, former model Helga de Silva Blow Perera, moves in circles 
of artists, politicians and intrigue, lives in the Folly and introduces herself 
personally to guests. Rooms may be a bit run-down and pricey, but the

A half-hour bus ride from the coastal towns of Tangalle and Dikwella, the rock 
ofMulkirigala erupts 205 metres tall from the surrounding jungle. The temple 
complex features dagobas and caves adorned with reclining Buddhas and ancient 
paintings. Well off the tourist trail, Mulkirigala provides an authentic escape 
into Buddhist tranquillity, and isn’t as busy as the famed Sigiriya and 
Dambulla rock fortresses. After climbing 533 rock-hewn steps, you are rewarded 
with a wonderful view and welcome breeze from the summit.

Galle Face Green is an urban park in Colombo overlooking the Indian Ocean. 
During Ramadan, local Muslims gather in groups unpacking picnics, waiting for 
the sun to set over this bustling city. Children fly kites. Street vendors sell 
local snacks. Professionals exercise in business suits and trainers after work. 
Young couples hold hands and stroll along the beach. The choppy waters crash 
into the concrete wall creating a dramatic backdrop. But while sitting on a 
bench facing the ocean, one can see a different side to this city and can 
appreciate the rich diversity of religions and socioeconomics that make up Sri 
Lanka.

To get a real feel of Sri Lanka, spend a day at the cricket in Galle if 
there’s a match on. There are plenty of distractions as you sit on the grassy 
banks overlooking the old fort and watch the waves rolling in from the Indian 
Ocean while soaking up the sun. The local fishermen turn up in the afternoon to 
chat and grill their catches. Spectators can try street curries from vendors 
all around the ground. Tickets and food won’t be more than £10 and you’ll make 
a lot of friends.

I spent an exhilarating day in Yala national park, a pristine 130,000-hectare 
wilderness on the south-eastern tip of Sri Lanka. The landscape here feels 
alien: a flat expanse of twisted, bleached-white trees and hunched rock 
formations that evoke images of a prehistoric time. The beaches are vast and 
wild, rising cliffs against grey sand and empty sky. Best of all though is the 
jeep safari: bouncing along sandy tracks, binoculars in hand, in joyful 
anticipation of glimpsing elephants, peacocks, monkeys, and saltwater 
crocodiles. And if you are very, very lucky you may even spot the elusive Sri 
Lankan leopard.

For a magical free view to rival that from Adam’s Peak, take a trip from 
Haputale in the tea plantations out to the near 2,000-metre-highLipton’s Seat. 
Don’t bother with the tuk tuks - the fun is in climbing up the mountain through 
the tea plantations, past schools and hospitals. Bright saris butterfly the tea 
bushes. At the very top is a panoramic view as far as the southern Sri Lankan 
coast and a tiny cafe selling magnificent short eats, tea and jaggery (cane 
sugar). Sit and survey the world just like Sir Thomas Lipton did more than 100 
years ago.

This summer my wife and I stayed off the usual tourist circuit in a secluded 
bay near the centre of Trincomalee, at a small B&B called Dyke’s Rest, right on 
the beach. The bay was deserted except for the occasional friendly fishermen 
coming and going. The water was clean, warm and safe and good snorkelling could 
be had by the rocks at the edge of the bay – an eco-conscious alternative to 
visiting the coral reef at Pigeon Island, which is suffering greatly because of 
unchecked tourism. You can watch the sun rise at breakfast and eat fresh fish 
barbecued on the beach at night. The hospitality was some of the best we have 
ever received and we cannot recommend this idyllic spot enough.

Dewmini, a small family-owned roti cafe off the beaten track in Mirissa, is 
well worth the 10-minute walk inland from the beach for a tasty breakfast or 
lunch roti. A plethora of savoury and sweet flavours are available, so there’s 
something for everyone.

 Geoffrey Bawa’s house on Bagatelle Road, Colombo. Photograph: Alamy 
Sri Lanka’s celebrated architect, Geoffrey Bawa, coined a tropical modernism 
style based on Sri Lanka’s multi-ethnic traditional and colonial influences. 
His buildings blend seamlessly with their surroundings – their interiors, too. 
A splendid way to learn about the man, his work and his art collection is to 
visit his house just off Bagatelle Road in Colombo. The style is unique and the 
tour by occupants of the house who knew Bawa before his death in 2003 is very 
personal and insightful. The guidebooks say visitors have to book in advance, 
but we just turned up and were welcomed. One of the best cultural experiences 
in Sri Lanka and you can also stay there though it is not run as a hotel.

A taxi driver advised us to visit Mackwoods Labookellie 
<http://www.mackwoods.com/tea-plant.asp> factory, about six miles from Nuwara 
Eliya. There, we enjoyed a freshly brewed cup of orange pekoe while looking out 
over emerald-green fields. On the way back, we stopped off at 100-metre-high 
Ramboda Falls, where visitors can walk along the top of the cascade toward its 
source. We also had a great trip toCinnamon Island in the Madu Ganga wetlands 
an hour’s drive north of Galle. You can only get there by boat, but this won’t 
cost you more than $20. There, our little group was shown how cinnamon is made 
from the inner bark of certain trees; the bark looks like rolled up paper when 
they are done.

While Jaffna is an interesting place to visit, the islands of the northern 
peninsula are the highlight of this area. We set off early from Jaffna, on 
scooters borrowed from our guesthouse, to Punkudutivu. From here, we took the 
free ferry, run by the Navy, toDelft

 (named after the Dutch town), on the northern tip of Sri Lanka. Wild ponies 
roam among the Palmyra palms on this sparsely populated island. After taking in 
the ruins of a 1,000-year-old temple, the Dutch colonial fort and the numerous 
coral walls, we headed back. We rode along the causeways connecting 
Punkudutivu, Kayts and Karainagar, as if aquaplaning on the shallow waters, 
against a backdrop of fishermen and cormorants in the setting sun. Within the 
islands, the quiet, well-maintained roads were shared with the solitary 
fisherman, farmers passing by in tractors, and the occasional (harmless!) snake 
making a dash to the other side. Our tranquil island road trip, traversing the 
Jaffna peninsula on our scooters, was the most memorable moment in my visit to 
this sometimes chaotic part of the world.
