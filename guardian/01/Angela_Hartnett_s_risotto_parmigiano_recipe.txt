We love a simple risotto at Murano, but it is great spiced up with sweet and 
mild Italian taggiasca olives.

(Serves 4 as a starter)
100g taggiasca, or any small, spicy olives
1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped
4 tbsp olive oil
1 small onion, finely diced
350g risotto rice
170g butter, diced
200ml white wine
1-1.5 litres hot vegetable stock
200g fresh parmesan or vegetarian parmesan-style cheese, grated 

Combine the olives and parsley with half the olive oil and leave to one side.

Add the rest of the oil to a large pan with the onion and cook on a medium 
heat for around five minutes, until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the 
rice and a spoon of butter and stir, toasting the rice for three to four 
minutes. Add the white wine and continue stirring until it has been absorbed 
into the rice.

Add the hot stock a ladle at a time, stirring regularly and allowing the rice 
to absorb each lot before adding the next ladle. This should take about 
12 minutes.

Remove from the heat and add the rest of the butter and the cheese, mixing 
well until it has all come together. Serve immediately with the olives and 
parsley mix on top.
