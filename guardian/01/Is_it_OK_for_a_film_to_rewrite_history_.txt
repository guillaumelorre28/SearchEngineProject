Mel Gibson's Braveheart was deemed by historians as "almost totally 
sacrificing historical accuracy for epic adventure 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braveheart#Historical_accuracy>" for its 
portrayal of the first Scottish war for independence; Jude Law's performance as 
a Red Army soldier at the battle of Stalingrad in the 2001 blockbuster Enemy at 
the Gates was so lacking in historical fact that Soviet veteranscalled for it 
to be banned <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/87984/enemy.at.the.gates>. 
Now the suggestion in Roland Emmerich's new film, Anonymous, that Shakespeare 
didn't write his plays has so infuriated Shakespeare diehards in 
Stratford-upon-Avon thatthey've launched a counter campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/25/shakespeare-film-anonymous-stratford>
.

The jury's still out on whether Anonymous 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1521197/> is sheer fantasy or raises some 
interesting, revisionist points, but we want to know if the historical accuracy 
of a film matters to you when you watch. Do you think that turning a blind eye 
to historical facts in favour of making a film more watchable is acceptable? Or 
should all films purporting to reflect a historical moment stay close to the 
truth, no matter dull it might really be?
