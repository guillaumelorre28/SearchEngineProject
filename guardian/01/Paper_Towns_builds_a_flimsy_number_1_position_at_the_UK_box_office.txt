The fake winner: Paper Towns

For the second week in a row, Inside Out has been denied the top spot by an 
official chart champ boosting its “weekend” tally with hefty previews. A week 
ago it was Pixels that elbowed aside the Pixar hit, thanks to four extra days 
of takings. Now it’s the turn of Paper Towns, boosting the £744,000 it earned 
over the Friday-to-Sunday period with an additional £1.33m grossed on Monday to 
Thursday last week. Without that extra box office, Paper Towns would have 
landed in sixth place, behind Inside Out, Sinister 2, Mission: Impossible – 
Rogue Nation,The Man from UNCLE 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-man-from-uncle> and Pixels. But with 
official takings of £2.07m, Paper Towns nabs the top spot. The chart win may 
not be deserved, but distributor Fox nevertheless has just cause to celebrate 
the film’s box office so far. In the US, after five weeks on release, Paper 
Towns has earned $31m, and has now run out of puff. An equivalent UK result, by 
rule of thumb, is £3.1m. Fox UK has already achieved over £2m after just seven 
days of play, and should sail past that £3.1m target.

The real winner: Inside Out

Once again, the Pixar animation must console itself with a moral victory. 
Disney will be pretty pleased to see the film earn more at the weekend than any 
other film on release, and this in Inside Out’s fifth week of play. The last 
time a film occupied the chart summit so deep into its run was back in December 
2012 with Skyfall. Inside Out added £3.25m over the past seven days, bringing 
its total to £30.65m. That sees it overtake A Bug’s Life in the all-time Pixar 
chart (although ticket prices were significantly lower in 1999). It’s also 
breathing down the neck of Monsters University, on £30.76m. The effect of the 
weather at the weekend can be clearly viewed with Inside Out’s daily tallies. 
Takings rose from Friday to Saturday, as you’d expect on a family film, and 
then rose again on a rainy Sunday (whereas traditionally you’d expect to see a 
dip). Outside holiday periods, family films usually drop significantly on 
weekdays. In the summer, it’s a different story, andInside Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/inside-out> has been remarkably consistent 
all last week, with Wednesday better than any of the weekend days, and Tuesday 
and Thursday both ahead of Friday and Saturday. There’s also a strong adult 
skew on this title, so it’s by no means just about the family audience.

The top new entrant: Sinister 2

If Paper Towns’ extensive previews are excluded from its tally, top new 
release at the weekend was Sinister 2, the latest hit from prolific producer 
Jason Blum. The original Sinister debuted in October 2012 with £1.44m. This one 
has begun with a softer £1.07m. It’s fair to say that the Sinister brand isn’t 
as potent as fellow Blumhouse franchises Paranormal Activity and Insidious. 
Across the weekend, takings dipped from Friday to Saturday and again on Sunday 
– par for the course with a horror sequel, but not even the rain on Sunday (a 
boost to box office for most films in the market) could arrest the decline.

The battling comedies: Vacation and The Bad Education Movie

While the performance of a film like Sinister 2 was moderately guessable, the 
same could not be said of The Bad Education Movie. It was reasonable to assume 
that it would perform significantly below the bar set by The Inbetweeners 
Movie, but even a third – or a quarter, fifth or sixth – of that number would 
be a fine result, given that the 2011 sitcom spinoff began with £8.64m plus 
previews of £4.57m. In fact, Bad Education has kicked off with just 9% of the 
initial tally for The Inbetweeners Movie, and that’s ignoring the earlier 
film’s rich previews. TheJack Whitehall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jack-whitehall> comedy opened with a 
so-so £595,000. There’s still time before schools, sixth-form colleges and 
universities return for the autumn, so Bad Education is well placed to grab 
some more end-of-summer cash from the target audience, before a rich afterlife 
on DVD and VOD. Still, even Keith Lemon: The Film opened with £1.20m in the 
exact same late-August spot three years ago, more than double The Bad Education 
Movie’s debut. Thanks to previews totaling £29,400, Vacation sneaks one place 
higher than The Bad Education Movie in the chart, with official takings of 
£609,000. It’s a middling result for a middling reboot of a comedy franchise 
that may be fondly remembered in some quarters, but has never been commercially 
potent in the UK.

 Ant-Man - video review 
Admissions totals are in for July, and the number of tickets sold shows a big 
rise on July 2014. Thanks to July hits, including Inside Out and Ant-Man plus 
sustained runs by June releases Jurassic World and Minions, cinemas saw 20% 
more bums on seats than the same month a year ago. For the first seven months 
of the year overall, admissions are running an impressive 11% ahead of 2014. 
However, box office for August so far has been down on 2014, so the increase in 
admissions for the year will not be so high when new figures are announced in a 
month’s time.

Next Bank Holiday Monday signals the end of the summer movie season. This 
column takes a break next week, so we are getting in early with a summer 
overview, and the Top 10 is below. What emerges is a story of remarkable 
disparity within the chart, with top title Jurassic World (£63.8m) grossing 
more than five times the 10th-placed San Andreas (£11.5m). This contrasts with 
summer 2014, when the biggest hits were The Inbetweeners 2 (£33.3m) and Dawn of 
the Planet of the Apes (£32.7m), which were less than double 10th-placed 
Godzilla (£17.2m). None of the summer 2015 movies landed in the £20-30m range, 
which is normally the sweet spot for summer blockbusters. Last year, Guardians 
of the Galaxy (£28.5m), X-Men: Days of Future Past (£27.1m), How to Train Your 
Dragon 2 (£25.0m) and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (£24.0m) all delivered numbers 
in this range.

 Straight Outta Compton producer Ice Cube: ‘Seeing the ills of the world will 
piss you off’ – video interview 
Even by the standards of late August, box office was pretty flat at the 
weekend, 16% down on the equivalent weekend in 2014, when new entrant Lucy 
topped the chart, with The Inbetweeners 2 sturdy in second place. Cinema 
bookers are now pinning their hopes on Straight Outta Compton, arriving Friday, 
fresh from its US box office triumph. NWA were not quite the phenomenon in the 
UK that they were in the US, but hopes remain high for a strong commercial 
result.
