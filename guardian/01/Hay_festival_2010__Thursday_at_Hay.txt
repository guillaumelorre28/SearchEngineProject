<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/audio/2010/jun/03/hay-festival-children-literature>
 to it. Our children's books editor, Julia Eccleshare, talked about the 
Guardian children's fiction prize, which launches at Hay, and Sarah Crown spoke 
to last year's winner, Mal Peet, about his novel Exposure. The afternoon found 
the children's laureate, Anthony Browne, being quizzed on his favourite animal, 
while Lucy Mangan hosted a debate on thePuffin of Puffins, in which the 
superlative Goodnight, Mister Tom finally triumphed
