Serious newspapers are seriously complex beasts, a mesh of history, contacts 
and personalities: which is why Lionel Barber at theFT, John Witherow at the 
Times, Amol Rajan at the Indy, Chris Evans at the Telegraph and Zanny Beddoes 
at theEconomist were all essentially appointments from within. And now, after 
much worldwide headhunting and advertising, the inside wins again, as Katharine 
Viner emerges as editor-in-chief at theGuardian, the first woman in that role.

It has taken three months to find Alan Rusbridger’s successor: roughly the 
same time as electing a new Labour leader, with manifestoes and hustings in a
Scott Trust <http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/the-scott-trust/>effort to give staff a 
voice <http://gonuj.org/> and outside applicants a chance. But, in the end, the 
new boss will be one of Alan Rusbridger’s longstanding deputies, beating former 
deputy and rival Ian Katz in a last round.

Too many twists on a road to produce the answer many first thought of and the 
staff overwhelmingly endorsed in an indicative ballot? Perhaps. Next time the 
contest will probably be shorter and sharper. There are longterm dangers in 
making newspapers feel too much like political parties, with their ideological 
cliques. Editors will of course be democrats: but democracy has limits in the 
24/7 rush of deadlines.

Viner has done many jobs over the past 18 years. She’s a known, experienced 
quantity. She has the staff behind her. There’s a popular will to make this new 
page of history work. And theGuardian she inherits, like the one Rusbridger 
inherited, is hugely changed and hugely challenging. So newsroom support isn’t 
some optional extra: it’s the bedrock of whatever the future brings.
