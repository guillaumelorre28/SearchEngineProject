Three months after posting its first revenue and profit growth in eight years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/14/archant-reports-first-increase-in-revenues-and-profits-in-eight-years>
, regional newspaper publisher Archant has increased cover prices at most of 
its titles.

In a message to the National Federation of Retail Newsagents 
<https://www.nfrnonline.com/News-Magazines/News-and-Magazines-Latest-News/Cover-Price-Changes>
 (NFRN), the Norwich-based company said the increases would result in £1.9m in 
extra revenues for retailers and thereby make them £370,000 in additional 
profits.

Most of the rises, which came into effect earlier this month, involved weekday 
issues going up by 5p and Saturday issues going up by 10p.

Some 40 papers were listed, including Archant’s main daily titles, the Eastern 
Daily Press, East Anglian Daily Times and Ipswich Star. Also affected are 
several London weeklies, such as the Ilford Recorder and Islington Gazette, 
along with local titles in Norfolk, Devon and Cambridge.


Archant’s circulation chief, Neil Bowman, said in his letter to NRFN: “I hope 
we can work together to protect this opportunity by retaining existing readers 
and developing new purchasers.”Protect this opportunity? Me neither.

Bowman also promised “initiatives” to promote the more expensive papers, such 
as radio campaigns and adverts on buses, plus “an increase in ‘on the ground’ 
merchandising resource”. Eh? Shouldn’t these commercial guys consult their 
newspapers’ subeditors before writing this stuff?
