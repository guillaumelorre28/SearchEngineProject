Chinese tourist spending in Australia soared to $7.7bn over the past year, 
rising at more than three times the rate of increase in overall visitor 
spending.

Spending by visitors from China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> rose 
43% in the 12 months to September compared with the previous year. A fall in 
the value of the Australian dollar helped make the country more affordable to 
overseas visitors.

Chinese visitor expenditure has exceeded the tourist industry’s annual target 
of $7.4bn – set in 2010 – five years ahead of schedule. It is more than the 
combined $7.5bn spent by Britons, Americans and Canadians.

Total inbound visitor spending grew 13% to a record $34.8bn, said Tourism 
Research Australia.

The tourist industry has received a welcome boost from the decline in the 
Australian dollar. Even after its recent mini recovery, the currency is down 
almost 15% against the US dollar compared with this time last year.

Tourism Research Australia’s managing director, John O’Sullivan, said the 
priority was to get visitors out of the capital cities and spending their 
dollars across the country.

“The tyranny of time, distance and cost mean that Australia will never be a 
high- volume destination,” O’Sullivan said.

“Our Tourism 2020 strategy is unashamedly focused upon yield: encouraging 
international visitors to stay longer, disperse further and ultimately do more 
and spend more while in our country.”

Food and wine spending by visitors is approaching $700m, far exceeding the 
$500m target the industry set when it launched a Restaurant Australia 
advertising campaign in December 2013.
