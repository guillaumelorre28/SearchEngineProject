His premiership started in sunlight in the Downing Street Rose Garden and 
ended in June outside No 10 after Britain voted to leave Europe, and there were 
other ups and downs along the way.

2010

Ups: Formation of the coalition

David Cameron became prime minister 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/11/david-cameron-uk-prime-minister>
 in 2010 after forming a coalition with Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader. Their 
agreement was marked by an iconic press conference in the Rose Garden of 
Downing Street, in which they promised to work together for the sake of the 
economy for a fixed term of five years. Relations would never be so good again, 
but their partnership did last the course of the parliament until 2015.

fee rises

Cameron seriously disappointed the Conservatives by failing to win an outright 
majority 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/07/david-cameron-right-govern> 
against the unpopular incumbent prime minister, Gordon Brown, whose party had 
been in power for 13 years. It was an embarrassment after he had pitched 
himself so carefully as a modernising centre-ground candidate, and a sign the 
electorate still did not trust the Tories. His first year in office was soon 
plunged into controversy after the coalition parties agreed to proceed with a 
rise in tuition fees, contrary to the Lib Dem election pledge, triggering
protests by students

The prime minister was already having trouble with the Eurosceptics in his 
party, who were applying pressure for an EU referendum. He tried to show he was 
able to stand up to Brussels byvetoing an EU treaty relating to the bailout of 
the eurozone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/09/david-cameron-blocks-eu-treaty>. 
This was held up at the time as a great victory but ultimately such dramas 
appeared merely to inflame Eurosceptic feeling among Conservatives. Cameron 
also claimed military intervention in Libya as a success, as he wasreceived as 
hero in Tripoli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/15/cameron-sarkozy-libya-leader-tripoli>
 alongside French president Nicolas Sarkozy after removing Colonel Gaddafi. It 
would become clear in the months and years ahead that this was far from the 
triumph depicted by them at the time, with the country descending into disorder 
and violence.

The first half of the year was politically difficult for Cameron as his 
director of communications, Andy Coulson, resigned over allegations there was 
phone-hacking at the News of the World while he was the editor at the Sunday 
newspaper. The scandal revealed by the Guardian prompted even more questions 
about Cameron’s links to Rupert Murdoch’s News International and its chief 
executive, Rebekah Brooks, forcing him to announce theLeveson inquiry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/leveson-inquiry> into the media. A tough 
period was intensified by riots in cities across the UK over the summer.

Cameron said the Olympics were a moment of national pride 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/12/olympic-games-legacy-london-2012-cameron>
 and an opportunity for an economic boost. The construction of the park was a 
huge feat of organisation and the games passed off without significant mishap. 
Although Labour was responsible for the winning bid for London and the 
chancellor at the time, George Osborne, was booed while attending an event, it 
was generally claimed as a success for the government and Cameron.

This was the year of George Osborne’s ‘omnishambles’ budget, which reflected 
badly on Cameron’s government. It contained the controversial decision to cut 
the top rate oftax for the highest earners from 50% to 45% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/21/george-osborne-millionaires-budget-miliband>
, and Osborne eventually had to U-turn on the so-called “pasty tax” that raised 
VAT on hot-baked goods. Cameron also suffered some damaging rebellions over the 
EU, as John Baron, a Tory backbencher, led a letter from 100 colleagues
demanding a referendum on the EU in June 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/29/cameron-no-eu-referendum>. 
Over the summer, there were a series of damaging revelationsat the Leveson

Cameron’s authority was wounded when he was defeated in his bid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/30/cameron-mps-syria> to launch 
airstrikes in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad. Labour refused to 
support him and there were too many Tory rebels for him to get it through the 
Commons. The other momentous occasion in the year was the prime minister’s
announcement of a referendum on the EU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/22/eu-referendum-2017-david-cameron>
 under duress from dozens in his parliamentary party who wanted to settle the 
issue for good. Those in favour of leaving the EU would characterise it as a 
triumphant moment, but the prime minister was pushed into a political gamble 
that ultimately sealed his professional fate.

Ups: Victory for no in the Scottish referendum

It was Cameron’s decision to grant a vote, and he later admitted to severe 
jitters in the run-up to the result. However, it was a bigvictory for the prime 
minister and fellow unionists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/scotland-independence-no-vote-victory-alex-salmond>
 when Scotland voted to stay part of the UK. The referendum appeared to give 
the prime minister too much confidence that the electorate would always vote on 
the issue of the economy when it came to a major question, setting him up for a 
fall at the EU referendum.

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/27/tory-mp-mark-reckless-defects-ukip>

speculation that more Tories could cross the floor en masse to Nigel Farage’s 
party. The victory was shortlived for Reckless as he later lost his seat again, 
but the chaos overshadowed that autumn’s last Conservative conference before 
the general election. To top off a terrible autumn, Cameron had toapologise to 
the Queen

 for breaking convention to tell the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg 
that she “purred down the line” when he informed her that Scotland had voted

Cameron succeeded where he had failed in 2010 by winning outright 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/07/exit-poll-conservatives-win-david-cameron-general-election-labour>
 on a message of economic competence, confounding the polls and his critics. It 
was a slim victory but an unexpected one, which gave the Conservatives the 
right to govern for another five years without having to compromise with the 
Liberal Democrats. However, it combined with the no victory at the Scottish 
referendum to give the prime minister an impression he could win any poll by 
convincing voters he was right about the economy, giving a false sense of 
confidence about the EU referendum.

The prime minister quickly discovered the difficulties of governing with only 
a small majority when a group of Conservative backbenchers refused to accept 
his proposals for reducing tax credits, after suggesting in the election that 
they would be safe from cuts. The House of Lords also rejected the measures, 
forcing the government toscrap the cuts altogether

. The party’s conference was also a tricky time after an unauthorised biography 
by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft and journalist Isabel Oakeshott made an
unsubstantiated allegation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/conservative-sources-deny-david-cameron-pigs-head-allegations>
 that he had put “a private part of his anatomy” into a dead pig’s mouth as 
part of an initiation rite at university.

Ups: Securing a renegotiation with the EU 

Cameron claimed it as a success when he managed to get a deal with 27 other 
member states of the EU 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/feb/19/eu-summit-all-night-negotiations-deal-cameron-live>
. They agreed to restrictions on benefits for new arrivals for up to seven 
years, concessions for the City of London and an opt-out from “ever closer 
union”. The measures were nowhere near enough to satisfy Eurosceptic MPs or 
many voters, setting him up for failure in the EU referendum, but many had 
suspected he would get even less from Brussels.

It was a significant moment in March when US president Barack Obama laid part 
of the blame for post-Gaddafi conflict in Libya at Cameron’s door for having 
been“distracted” by domestic issues at the time of the intervention 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/10/david-cameron-distracted-libya-conflict-barack-obama>
. The year got worse for Cameron as he came under pressure over revelations 
about hisfather’s tax affairs in the Panama Papers leak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-admits-he-profited-fathers-offshore-fund-panama-papers>
. But the worst time of his political life came in July when he lost the EU 
referendum, after fighting for weeks on the campaign trail to keep Britain in. 
The result was unexpected for both Cameron and the remain camp, triggering his
resignation as prime minister the next morning 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-resigns-after-uk-votes-to-leave-european-union>
. He was gone from No 10 within the month when Theresa May was chosen as his 
successor. Cameron has now decided to step down as an MP after reflecting over 
the summer on his future plans.
