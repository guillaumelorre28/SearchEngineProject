How can a London-based writer of Middle Eastern origin protest against the 
violence in Syria? Here's one way: enlisting the help of a graphic artist, 
Shahrazad (a pseudonym) designed this poster expressing her disgust atSyrian 
first lady Asma al-Assad's silence 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/28/arab-first-ladies-of-oppression>.

The poster is free; you can get your copy by emailing Shahrazad at 
iamnotlikeyou@safe-mail.net <mailto:iamnotlikeyou@safe-mail.net>. It was first 
distributed two weekends ago at a protest in London and has been picking up 
steam ever since: theBritish Solidarity for Syria 
<http://www.facebook.com/BritishSolidarityforSyria> campaign took 500 posters, 
and more will be heading north to Edinburgh with the organisers of Reel Syria 
2012. "At first, some Syrians were put off by the image of Asma on the poster," 
says Shahrazad. "You might think the photo is glamorous, but if you examine it 
closely she looks perturbed." She hopes it will be displayed all over the world.

Shahrazad once saw al-Assad up close when she joined her in a women's bike 
ride for peace several years ago and had hoped it was the beginning of a new 
era inSyria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>. "We could have been more 
than friends; we could have been sisters," she has written on the poster. "But 
you are a sister no longer, and each and every one of us feels played like a 
sucker."
