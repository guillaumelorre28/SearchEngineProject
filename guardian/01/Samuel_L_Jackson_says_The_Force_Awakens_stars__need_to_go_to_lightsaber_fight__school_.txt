George Lucas <https://www.theguardian.com/film/georgelucas> was famously so 
enamoured of Samuel L Jackson’s swashbuckling turn as Jedi master Mace Windu in 
the Star Wars prequels that he granted the Pulp Fiction star’s request for a 
unique purple lightsaber. Now Jackson has laid into the laser-sword battles in 
new episode The Force Awakens, calling for cast members Daisy Ridley, John 
Boyega and Adam Driver to up their game in future episodes.

Speaking to ABC News’s Pete Travers 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgr0LK6HVYM> about JJ Abrams’s 
critically-acclaimed space opera sequel, Jackson offered only muted praise for 
the new film, which has smashed box office records on both sides of the 
Atlantic.

“It’s done in the spirit of the Star Wars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> films,” he said. “It’s 
adventuresome and exciting in a way. I think the kids need to go to lightsaber 
fight school, but that’s just me thinking that. They’ve got time to get better.”

Jackson also revealed on Tuesday, during an appearance on the Seth Meyers talk 
show, that he had only ever intended to make a cameo in the prequel films. “I 
just want to run across the screen,”he revealed 
<http://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/06/samuel-l-jackson-star-wars-lightsaber>, 
but said when he turned up for filming in London he was handed Jedi robes.

“Then somebody came in and gave me some sides,” Jackson said. “I was like, 
‘Who’s this?’ They said, ‘Well, Mace Windu is you.’ ‘Oh. Wait, I’m talking to 
Yoda? OK, all right! So I’m definitely not dying right now!’ Then somebody came 
in with a haliburton full of lightsaber handles and said ‘pick one’ and I about 
died.”

In other Star War news, the latest ambitious fan theory regarding The Force 
Awakens’ mysterious First Order villain Supreme Leader Snoke suggests the 
character could be Darth Vader brought back from the dead. Fans have previously 
focused on a Sith Lord mentioned in the prequels, Darth Plagueis, when trying 
to come up with plausible arguments as to Snoke’s true identity. But the new 
theory points out that both villains have a large dent on the right hand side 
of their heads.

Not all fans were convinced, however, with many quipping that there were 
surely alternative suggestions as to Snoke’s true identity.
