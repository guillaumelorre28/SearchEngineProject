“BBC boss ‘raged at reporter investigating sexual abuse at Kids Company’” 
screamed a Daily Mail headline on Friday morning. The story went on: “BBC 
creative directorAlan Yentob <https://www.theguardian.com/media/alan-yentob> 
publicly tore into a senior journalist yesterday as she prepared an 
investigation into the Kids Company charity he chairs. He launched what was 
described as ‘a verbal attack’ on BBC special news correspondent Lucy Manning, 
who was compiling a report into allegations of sexual abuse at the charity.” 
The inference most readers would take away is that Yentob had sought out 
Manning to complain. What the story does not say is that, according to a 
source, Yentob was actually approached by Manning in the BBC’s News 
Broadcasting House lobby. Just a suggestion but perhaps those circumstances – 
with Yentob responding to Manning rather than seeking her out – did not quite 
fit with the angle the Mail or whoever leaked the story wanted?

 * This article was corrected to on Saturday 9 August to remove a suggestion 
that the clash resulted from Manning pursuing Yentob with a camera crew through 
New Broadcasting House.
