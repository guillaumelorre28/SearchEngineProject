The chairman of an organisation set up to honour the memories of the victims 
of the 7/7 terrorist strike on London has labelled a new trailer for the 
Hollywood disaster movieLondon Has Fallen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/london-has-fallen> “extremely insensitive”.

Babak Najafi <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619836/?ref_=tt_ov_dr>’s film, a big 
budget sequel to 2013 action thriller Olympus Has Fallen, stars Gerard Butler, 
Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman in the story of an attack on the capital. 
Chair of the 7/7 Memorial Trust, Philip Nelson, said the timing of the 
trailer’s release was wrong just a few days before the 10th anniversary of 
Britain’s worst terrorist strike of recent times.

“This is not the first time that Hollywood has been insensitive,” he told the 
Mirror 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gerard-butler-film-london-fallen-5985310>. 
“If the story is about terrorism then this is extremely insensitive. People 
have also recently died of a terrorist attack in Tunisia.

“I have seen an image of Big Ben with the clock face blown out, that’s also 
insensitive. “[Our Trust] has had lots of help from America so I just think 
that these are the wrong images to portray. Is the summer the best time to be 
promoting this film anyway?”

It was not clear whether Nelson contacted the Mirror to express his concerns 
or was approached for a comment by a reporter seeking to put together a story. 
However, the trailer forLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> Has 
Fallen has also provoked upset on Twitter.

surely releasing the trailer for 'london has fallen' just under a week before 
the 10th anniversary of 7/7 is a touch insensitive?

Probably not the best idea to release the trailer for a film called "London 
Has Fallen" a week before the 10 year anniversary of 7/7...
