In 1983, Violent Femmes reached chart-topping heights with their single 
Blister in the Sun <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE-dqW4uBEE> from their 
self-titled debut. The album went platinum and the Milwaukee trio went on to 
release seven further LPs, making them one of the most successful alternative 
rock outfits of the 1980s. Irreconcilable differences arose between the band 
members and they went their separate ways in 2009 – with a brief reunion at
Coachella 2013 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itrT4gjVWtY> – until this year, 
when lead singer Gordon Gano announced that Violent Femmes had reunited. They 
release their first album in 16 years,We Can Do Anything 
<http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/violentfemmes>, on 4 March.

He Who Gets Slapped <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_RV0FmAjbg> (1924) 


This is the story of someone who is robbed of everything in his life, then 
reinvents himself as a clown whose name is He Who Gets Slapped. It’s about 
taking the ultimate pain and humiliation and destruction of somebody’s life and 
turning it into what makes him famous: he’s a clown who everybody hits, and 
everybody laughs at him. The film questions what it is in society that takes 
pleasure in another human’s degradation and pain. I was struck by some of the 
techniques that were used in the cinematography, which were surreal and 
amazing. It has quite an exciting ending.

The Robber by Robert Walser 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/feb/11/abriefsurveyoftheshortst7>
 (1925)


This would be more of an all-time favourite because I found it a little while 
ago, but I do read Robert Walser with some frequency. He wrote lots of short 
pieces for newspapers and magazines: observational things, little vignettes of 
two or three pages. He does have longer novels, of whichThe Robber is the last 
one. It was found after he died on little scraps of paper, written in anold 
German script <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurrent> that someone deciphered. 
Now it’s this strange, amazing piece. He was somewhat popular at his time – 
it’s often referred to that Kafka admired him – but I had never heard of him 
before. He spent his last several decades locked up in an asylum, and I think 
that kept him from being well known.

The Playground Ensemble <http://playgroundensemble.org/black-angels/> 
performing George Crumb’s Black Angels


This was something I have just recently seen, and I was really excited about 
it before, during and after. The Playground Ensemble is a group based in Denver 
whose focus is 20th- and 21st-century music. Besides the traditional string 
quartet being electrified, there are numerous percussive instruments, and other 
things that the musicians are asked to do in the score that create all these 
different kinds of sounds. I think it’s beautifully written with all this air 
and space. It’s not an onslaught of dense madness; there’s a real intelligence 
to all these different sounds that are happening. It’s abstract and I think 
thoroughly interesting, enjoyable music.

Walking to the Next Bar <http://fritzscholder.com/gallery.php> by Fritz 
Scholder (1974, oil on canvas)


One of the pieces I enjoyed very much at a Fritz Scholder show I saw recently 
is calledWalking to the Next Bar. The things that I like about it are the 
things that probably translate into a lot of his works, but I love his use of 
colour in this one: the yellow and red and various combinations. Even though 
it’s an oil on canvas, it could easily be a lithograph or a woodcut. I love 
completely abstract work, but in this, absolutely everything is recognisable. I 
also like the flow of it all, the shapes and the energy. It seems dynamic. This 
is one that I particularly like, but there’s really so much of his work that I 
love.

Lou Reed & John Cale: Songs for Drella  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziYus0j85oM>


Drella was a nickname for Andy Warhol, and the idea is that these are all 
songs about him or songs written to him after he’s died. There’s an overall 
concept to it all, and yet each song is great separated out of that context. 
It’s the writing, it’s Lou Reed’s lyrics, it’s the arrangement – it’s the 
simplicity of just the two of them. I love the songs individually, but I also 
love how they all work together. I was fortunate enough to be in New York at a
live concert <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziYus0j85oM> when they first did 
it for the public. I revisited it after not listening to the whole thing in 
years.

El Taco de Mexico <http://eltacodemexicodenver.com>, Denver, Colorado 


I like Mexican food very much, and this is my all-time favourite Mexican 
restaurant. One thing that’s very popular in Denver and the southwest of the 
United States is green chilli, and theirs is just a beautiful balance of the 
flavours. It goes on whatever you’re ordering. I’m vegetarian, so it limits 
what I get, but theirs is the best cheese enchilada I’ve ever had. There’s a 
simplicity to it, and I think the flavours they use just work. The place itself 
is very much like a diner: there’s a counter you can sit at, it’s very old 
school, and it’s an open kitchen so all the cooking is done right in front of 
you.
