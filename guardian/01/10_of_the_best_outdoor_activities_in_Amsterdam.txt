swaying reeds along the banks of the river. For afternoon tea, put your feet up

Swimming at SportPlaza Mercator
 Swimming at SportPlaza Mercator 
Summer afternoons can be quite humid in the city (it's all that water in the 
canals) so cool down with a swim at SportPlaza Mercator, an unusual building in 
an area of the usually city usually devoid of tourists. As well as several 
indoor pools, it has one of three outdoor pools in the city and an unusual 
exterior with a "living wall" of green plants.

Architectural cycling route

Rent a bike and pedal away from the Dam Square crowds to Borneo and KNSM 
islands, the new neighbourhoods in the former docklands to the east of the 
city. Follow the dedicated cycle path past intriguing townhouses and small 
modern canals to create your own "new architecture" route. Look out for artist 
Mark Manders' rust-red iron couple gazing out to sea on the edge of a deserted 
quay at PE Tegelbergplein, at the far end of Sporenburg island overlooking the 
mouth of the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal. You can also walk over the intriguing red 
curved footbridge which links the Borneo and Sporenburg islands.

Catch tram 26 to Ijburg – the architecturally stunning new suburb constructed 
entirely from reclaimed land in the past few years – and clamber down large 
boulders to reach the frozen lake (only safe on seriously cold winter days). 
Amsterdammers will be there with their children cautiously holding on to chairs 
for balance, alongside barking dogs and babies in prams – it's like walking 
into a 17th-century landscape painting. You can also skate on the circular 400m 
outdoor track, Jaap Eden Ijsbanen, which rents out blades. After dark, the 
lit-up rink looks magical.

Rollerblading in Vondelpark

Rent a pair of inline skates in Vondelpark to explore the city on eight very 
environmentally-friendly wheels. This popular Amsterdam park can get rather 
crowded, which makes weaving in and out of groups of people promenading in the 
leafy cycle lanes sometimes quite lively. A map of a rollerblading route can be 
found atrouteyou.com 
<http://www.routeyou.com/route/view/809/fietsroute-rollerbladeskeelerroute-amsterdam-vondelpark.nl>
. Afterwards, have a drink at Vondeltuin just by the Amstelveenseweg entrance 
(Vondelpark 7, +31 62 756 5576,vondeltuin.nl <http://www.vondeltuin.nl>).

Secret gym in the woods
 Secret gym in the woods, Rembrandt Park 
It's hard to get into the members-only gyms in the city, and they can be 
expensive, but there is a green alternative. Peaceful Rembrandtpark has a free 
outdoor gym with built–in weights and various body-building machines. Instead 
of noisy, out-of-date pop music, listen to the blackbirds in the trees while 
doing your press-ups. To get there, start at the Amstelveenseweg entrance of 
Vondelpark and cross the bridge over the Schinkel river, turn left at a 
children's playground and carry on jogging for about three minutes – the gym is 
on the right, behind some trees. For even more vigorous exercise, join in a 
bootcamp fitness session from the Bootcamp Club,thebootcampclub.nl

Unlike a hundred years ago, only a few horses and carriages for tourists can 
be seen on Amsterdam's streets today, but anyone can still explore the outlying 
areas of the city on horseback. In the leafy district of Amstelveen horses and 
saddlery can be rented by the hour from the Manege Nieuw Amstelland riding 
stables. Ride your trusty Dutch steed in the nearbyAmsterdamse Bos 
<http://www.amsterdamsebos.nl/algemene_onderdelen/english_site/>, a huge wooded 
common on the southern edge of the city. Anyone with limited mobility or a 
learning difficulty can also join in the Saturday afternoon lessons for adults 
and children with a disability.

Join a t'ai chi class in Oosterpark
 Photograph: Sifu Chan <http://www.taopai.nl> 
Practise the gentle art of t'ai chi in an elegant park surrounded by huge lime 
trees and tranquil ponds. Warm up with chi gong, then follow the graceful moves 
of t'ai chi. At the weekend, Sifu Chan's classes end with an hour of kung fu. 
Find the class practising next to the bandstand by the Linnaeusstraat/Eerste 
van Swindenstraat entrance. Look out for the stone benches laid out in a 
circular pattern. Bring a raincoat if it's drizzling as the lessons take place 
even in bad weather. You might even catch an occasional glimpse of a heron 
while practising.
