Trinity Mirror regularly publishes the numbers of its Facebook and Twitter 
followers and likes (examplehere

). Archant has also boasted of itssocial media success

 when doing the same.

Many journalists find this less than uplifting, but Trinity Mirror’s digital 
guru, David Higgerson,argues that this “currency of endorsement” has value.

“We live in a world in which revenue follows endorsement,” he writes. But does 
it? Does endorsement lead to real revenue, the currency that can fund public 
service journalism?

I grasp that social media endorsements attract readers and, over time, could 
potentially enhance the status of one’s newsbrand. Only, however, up to a point.

Do people whose interest in an article is piqued by an endorsement warm 
towards the site on which they find it? Reading a single item on a news site - 
or even a series of items on the same site - cannot guarantee loyalty to that 
site.

One of the most obvious features of net-based news consumption is its 
promiscuous nature.Facebook <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> 
referrals undoubtedly boost readership (Twitter less so), but I can’t see how 
this is translated into cash.


For Higgerson, endorsement drives engagement, “and engagement drives, and is 
derived from, a respect for a brand. That’s a powerful thing for journalists to 
have on their side.”

He regards it as the beginning of “the monetisation process”, although he does 
concede that likes and follows do not “convert into pounds instantly.”

In my view, they don’t convert into pounds in the long term either, so I 
cannot believe this process will ever generate money.

I think this is yet another blind alley, not in terms of attracting an 
audience of course (it does that for sure), but in the belief that it will 
magically transform into revenue.

We shouldn’t fool ourselves. We can’t teeter around the edge of this problem. 
We have to make Facebook understand that they are benefiting from our 
journalism. They should be required to pay for that. If not, they will kill the 
goose (newsbrands) that lays the golden egg (content).
