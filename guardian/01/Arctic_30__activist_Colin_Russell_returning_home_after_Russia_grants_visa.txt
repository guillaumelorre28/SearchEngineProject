The Australian activist Colin Russell will finally make his way home after 
Russian authorities granted theGreenpeace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace> campaigner an exit visa on 
Friday.

Russell, 59, was one of 30 activists arrested and detained in September for 
protesting against a Russian oil rig operated by Moscow-based energy company 
Gazprom in the Pechora Sea.

Known as the Arctic 30, the group, made up of 28 Greenpeace activists and two 
freelance journalists, had been accused of hooliganism.

The charges were dropped last week after the Russian parliament passed an 
amnesty law and freed the defendants.

Greenpeace's communications manager, James Lorenz, confirmed Russell, from 
Woodbridge in Tasmania, had been granted an exit visa on Friday night.

"Colin has received a final piece of the puzzle, which is the exit stamp in 
his passport," he said.
