Night time politics

Estimates will continue into the evening, until 11pm. So let’s wrap for today:

 * Family First senator Bob Day has resigned from the Senate. He will be 
replaced by a nominee of the party’s choice. 
 * Former Tasmanian Liberal MP Eric Hutchinson has got a parliamentary job 
with Senate president Stephen Parry using a special allocation from the PM’s 
office for his presidential role. Luckily for the Liberal party, it will 
require lots of representation of the “president” in Tasmania, where the party 
lost three seats. 
 * Tony Abbott has tried to tempt Nick Xenophon into changing 18c of the 
Racial Discrimination Act. Xenophon says nope, nope, nope. 
 * Labor is meeting at a hastily called caucus meeting to calm factional 
tensions as a result of Shorten’s captain call of Kimberley Kitching to replace 
Stephen Conroy. 
 * Malcolm Turnbull has suggested Labor’s Mark Dreyfus was endangering 
national security by asking questions about a citizenship bill – telling him to 
get on “Team Australia”. 
 * Attorney general George Brandis has been verbally jousting with Penny Wong 
all day in Senate estimates. We learned the ministerial standards statements on 
lobbying mean not very much. We learned that the luggage lift in the Lodge, 
approved under the Abbott regime, cost $83,500. We learned the Coalition 
agreement between Turnbull and Barnaby Joyce has not been sighted by anyone in 
the Prime Minister and Cabinet Department.

 * Tomorrow, estimates will focus on George Brandis’s department. Also 
tomorrow the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority will give 
evidence – the body that the deputy prime minister has unilaterally decided 
would move to his electorate. NBN Co is on tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks to Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Katharine Murphy for their 
contributions. Thanks toMike Bowers for his pictures.

Goodnight.

Katharine Murphy

The lively day in Canberra is powering right through to close of business. As 
we speak the Labor left is having a specially convened caucus meeting to deal 
with tensions that have boiled over sinceBill Shorten last Friday night backed 
his friend and factional ally, the controversial lawyerKimberley Kitching, to 
replace the departingStephen Conroy.


Let’s keep this as simple as possible. Tensions in the Victorian left have 
been bubbling away for months, ever since the majority of the faction tried to 
run the veteran leftwing powerbroker,Kim Carr, off the front bench. Folks 
aligned with Carr have been cranky that some of their Victorian colleagues 
lined up with colleagues in Sydney to try and remove Carr from the frontbench 
after the election.

Let’s call that a pre-existing condition.

Then there was the Kitching transaction last week. Victorian Labor has been 
absolutely off the long run since Shorten decided he wanted Kitching in the 
Senate. Normally sedate people were quite literally tearing their hair out over 
that turn of events. Shorten was advised in the strongest possible terms not to 
bring Kitching to Canberra, that it would stir up animosities in the Labor 
caucus.

It appears to have done exactly that. Gavin Marshall (a long time Carr ally) 
decided to tell Fairfax Media early on Monday that he might come after a couple 
of sitting MPs in the left when preselection time rolled around. He namedAndrew 
Giles and Catherine King, the shadow health minister. 

Folks should know by way of background that Marshall lost a position he held 
in the last parliament, deputy Senate president, in the fight over Carr and the 
front bench. Clearly he’s not that happy about it, and thought he might have a 
vent about people he views as being disloyal.

The non-Carr left is now unhappy to put it mildly, hence tonight’s special 
caucus meeting to determine whether peace can be declared, or whether things 
escalate.


We can cut to the chase here, now all the background has been declared. Bill 
Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> is the leader 
of the Labor party because he was underpinned institutionally by support from 
Conroy (now departed) and Carr (now the subject of acrimony from his factional 
fellow travellers).


That underpinning has been eroded since Conroy’s departure. The caucus is 
something of a tinderbox after the Kitching decision. That might sound like an 
exaggeration, but it isn’t.Malcolm Turnbull once talked about exciting times. 
Seems, they are catching.

Xenophon to Abbott on 18c: no, no and no

Nick Xenophon has responded to Tony Abbott’s suggestion that changes to 
section 18C would “readily” pass if the Nick Xenophon Team supported them.


Asked if his party was considering supporting a change, Xenophon told Guardian 
Australia: “the answer is no, no and no. I’ve spoken to my colleagues and we 
agree: not only is there no proposal, there is no pipeline.”


I am deeply offended at the suggestion of any change in section 18C – but I 
realise my complaint is not actionable.

Tony Abbott has regularly come back to his proposal 
<http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/use-of-section-18c-is-out-of-hand-says-tony-abbott/news-story/67eab09aba3d62fc2217e8f83cc84166>
 to amend 18C post prime ministership, despite having dropped it from his 
government’s agenda in order to deal with national security issues.

Now he is seeking what is known around the traps as a more minimalist 
proposal, which would remove the words insult and offend from section 18c, 
notwithstanding the free speech provisions in 18d.

It seems unlikely that Nick Xenophon would overturn his opposition to amending 
the Racial Discrimination Act. But hey, we have put in the call.

Estimates will continue into the evening, until 11pm. So let’s wrap for today:

 * Family First senator Bob Day has resigned from the Senate. He will be 
replaced by a nominee of the party’s choice. 
 * Former Tasmanian Liberal MP Eric Hutchinson has got a parliamentary job 
with Senate president Stephen Parry using a special allocation from the PM’s 
office for his presidential role. Luckily for the Liberal party, it will 
require lots of representation of the “president” in Tasmania, where the party 
lost three seats. 
 * Tony Abbott has tried to tempt Nick Xenophon into changing 18c of the 
Racial Discrimination Act. Xenophon says nope, nope, nope. 
 * Labor is meeting at a hastily called caucus meeting to calm factional 
tensions as a result of Shorten’s captain call of Kimberley Kitching to replace 
Stephen Conroy. 
 * Malcolm Turnbull has suggested Labor’s Mark Dreyfus was endangering 
national security by asking questions about a citizenship bill – telling him to 
get on “Team Australia”. 
 * Attorney general George Brandis has been verbally jousting with Penny Wong 
all day in Senate estimates. We learned the ministerial standards statements on 
lobbying mean not very much. We learned that the luggage lift in the Lodge, 
approved under the Abbott regime, cost $83,500. We learned the Coalition 
agreement between Turnbull and Barnaby Joyce has not been sighted by anyone in 
the Prime Minister and Cabinet Department.

 * Tomorrow, estimates will focus on George Brandis’s department. Also 
tomorrow the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority will give 
evidence – the body that the deputy prime minister has unilaterally decided 
would move to his electorate. NBN Co is on tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks to Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Katharine Murphy for their 
contributions. Thanks toMike Bowers for his pictures.

Goodnight.
 
The lively day in Canberra is powering right through to close of business. As 
we speak the Labor left is having a specially convened caucus meeting to deal 
with tensions that have boiled over sinceBill Shorten last Friday night backed 
his friend and factional ally, the controversial lawyerKimberley Kitching, to 
replace the departingStephen Conroy.


Let’s keep this as simple as possible. Tensions in the Victorian left have 
been bubbling away for months, ever since the majority of the faction tried to 
run the veteran leftwing powerbroker,Kim Carr, off the front bench. Folks 
aligned with Carr have been cranky that some of their Victorian colleagues 
lined up with colleagues in Sydney to try and remove Carr from the frontbench 
after the election.

Let’s call that a pre-existing condition.

Then there was the Kitching transaction last week. Victorian Labor has been 
absolutely off the long run since Shorten decided he wanted Kitching in the 
Senate. Normally sedate people were quite literally tearing their hair out over 
that turn of events. Shorten was advised in the strongest possible terms not to 
bring Kitching to Canberra, that it would stir up animosities in the Labor 
caucus.

It appears to have done exactly that. Gavin Marshall (a long time Carr ally) 
decided to tell Fairfax Media early on Monday that he might come after a couple 
of sitting MPs in the left when preselection time rolled around. He namedAndrew 
Giles and Catherine King, the shadow health minister. 

Folks should know by way of background that Marshall lost a position he held 
in the last parliament, deputy Senate president, in the fight over Carr and the 
front bench. Clearly he’s not that happy about it, and thought he might have a 
vent about people he views as being disloyal.

The non-Carr left is now unhappy to put it mildly, hence tonight’s special 
caucus meeting to determine whether peace can be declared, or whether things 
escalate.


We can cut to the chase here, now all the background has been declared. Bill 
Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> is the leader 
of the Labor party because he was underpinned institutionally by support from 
Conroy (now departed) and Carr (now the subject of acrimony from his factional 
fellow travellers).


That underpinning has been eroded since Conroy’s departure. The caucus is 
something of a tinderbox after the Kitching decision. That might sound like an 
exaggeration, but it isn’t.Malcolm Turnbull once talked about exciting times. 
Seems, they are catching.

 
Nick Xenophon has responded to Tony Abbott’s suggestion that changes to 
section 18C would “readily” pass if the Nick Xenophon Team supported them.


Asked if his party was considering supporting a change, Xenophon told Guardian 
Australia: “the answer is no, no and no. I’ve spoken to my colleagues and we 
agree: not only is there no proposal, there is no pipeline.”


I am deeply offended at the suggestion of any change in section 18C – but I 
realise my complaint is not actionable.
 
Tony Abbott has regularly come back to his proposal 
<http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/use-of-section-18c-is-out-of-hand-says-tony-abbott/news-story/67eab09aba3d62fc2217e8f83cc84166>
 to amend 18C post prime ministership, despite having dropped it from his 
government’s agenda in order to deal with national security issues.

Now he is seeking what is known around the traps as a more minimalist 
proposal, which would remove the words insult and offend from section 18c, 
notwithstanding the free speech provisions in 18d.

It seems unlikely that Nick Xenophon would overturn his opposition to amending 
the Racial Discrimination Act. But hey, we have put in the call.

Re. 18c: if the Nick Xenephon Team put up a proposal, reform could readily 
occur.

The independent national security monitor Roger Gyles is in finance estimates 
committee now. He has confirmed he will be leaving for personal reasons. 
Brandis says he doesn’t want to be tied down as to a timeframe for a 
replacement.
 
MacGibbon agrees that he assumes ministers do not share classified information 
over such apps.

Alastair MacGibbon, cyber security special adviser to the PM, has told Wong 
that prior toJames Massola’s Fairfax story about minister’s usage of Whatsapp 
among others, he had not sought regarding security advice on Whatsapp for 
cabinet ministers.

MacGibbon told the committee that the government’s signals directorate advised 
Whatsapp and other encrypted apps are OK for non-classified information.
 
Wong: Personal safety? He likes strawberries not rasberries?
