The Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o followed up his hat-trick against Angola by 
scoring the first goal as Cameroon beat Togo 2-0 to qualify for the African 
Nations Cup quarter-finals.

The Barcelona striker broke the deadlock with a superb strike in the 68th 
minute before setting up the second for the substitute Albert Meyong Ze with 
five minutes left in the Group B match.

The World Cup finalists Togo, with their key striker Emmanuel Adebayor back in 
the side after his public spat with the coach Stephen Keshi, went out of the 
tournament after losing both their opening games without scoring.

Eto'o came close to opening the scoring with an individual effort only to see 
his goalbound shot turned around the post by a world-class save from Kossi 
Agassa. He was not to be denied, however, and rifled home a loose ball with a 
first-time shot from 25 metres after a series of rebounds in the Togo penalty 
area for his fourth goal of the competition. And with five minutes to go he cut 
inside from the right and found the Portugal-based Meyong Ze, who cleverly 
flicked the ball home. Geremi, pictured left challenging Togo's Mohamed Abdel 
Kader Coubadja, hit the crossbar with a deflected free-kick.

Cameroon, who surprisingly missed out on a place in the World Cup in Germany 
this summer, have a maximum six points from two games.
