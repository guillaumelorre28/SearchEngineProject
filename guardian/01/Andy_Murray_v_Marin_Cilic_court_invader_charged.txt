A man who invaded the Rod Laver Arena court at the end of the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> semi-final between Andy 
Murray and Marin Cilic yesterday will face police charges.

The 22-year-old, wearing a Croatia football shirt, approached Cilic as he was 
preparing to shake the chair umpire's hand just after the match had finished.

After shaking Cilic's hand, the man was intercepted and escorted off court. 
The Croatian Cilic later played down the incident, but the embarrassing 
security breach has thrown the spotlight on security at the tournament.

The man will be "charged on summons with disrupting proceedings and 
unauthorised entry to an arena," a police spokesman told Reuters in a statement 
today.

Tennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Australia described the 
incident as"a major breach of security and completely unsatisfactory".

"A thorough investigation has been undertaken and appropriate measures will be 
implemented," the governing body said in a statement.
