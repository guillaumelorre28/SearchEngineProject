About 20 years ago, a woman named Rose Wong moved to a small town in the heart 
of Silicon Valley and purchased her first computer.

“I had no idea how to use it. I taught myself,” she recalled this week.

She was 82 years old. 

Mrs Wong, who happens to be my grandmother, is now 102. She still lives in a 
retirement community in northern California, and she is still learning how to 
use new forms of technology.

It’s hard to find much tech reporting that focuses on the centenarian market. 
Certainly there is a large industry developing assistive technologies for the 
ageing baby boomer generation, but you’re unlikely to read a review of the new 
iPhone 7 that queries how 102-year-old women with hearing aids and arthritic 
fingers will handle theslim new design

.


Amid the breathless coverage of the latest marginal improvement to existing 
technologies, it’s also hard to keep perspective on what’s actually likely to 
change the world and what’s just self-indulgent marketing.

So I decided to interview my grandmother to get a century’s worth of 
perspective on the latest innovations.

The stuff she already uses 

My grandmother might be the most tech-savvy centenarian in the world (please 
don’t fact-check me on this). She taught herself to use that first computer by 
reading a book (she did attend a few classes for seniors but found the teaching 
ineffectual) and she has continued to adapt to new technologies as they emerge.

This wasn’t always the case. During the 1950s and 1960s, when she worked as a 
math teacher and guidance counselor in Los Angeles, she and my grandfather 
refused to purchase a television. The radio was good enough for news and 
entertainment, and though her children – my father and aunt – pleaded their 
case, she told me, “They needed to study more than television.”

But today, her attitude toward technology is quite positive. 

“If you don’t have it, you’re so backwards,” she said. 

She credits the internet with making people more liberal and tolerant. 
“They’re expanding their minds,” she said. “Their horizons are enlarged.”

When she was growing up on a potato ranch in Lillooet, Canada (about 150 miles 
east of Vancouver) in the 1910s and 1920s, letters to her parents’ families in 
China took a month to deliver by boat.

Today, our family is also widely dispersed geographically (she has 
great-grandchildren living in Boston, Massachusetts and Durban, South Africa), 
but she keeps in touch by email (like any self-respecting techie, she has a 
Gmail address) and Skype.

She does most of her shopping online, preferring to try clothes on at home 
rather than in a cramped dressing room.

If she misses the 3pm airing of the PBS NewsHour with Gwen Ifill (“I get very 
annoyed if somebody calls me at that hour,” she said), she watches it online.

She also bowed to necessity and purchased a cellphone about 10 years ago, 
though she almost never uses it.

“It’s only for emergencies,” she said of her flip-phone. 

The stuff she doesn’t use

A few years ago, my sister bought my grandmother an iPad, in the hopes that 
its intuitive design would make it easier for her to get online. But the 
problem with the touch screen is that it requires a steady touch.

My grandmother’s hands show her age in a way that her face does not. It is 
difficult for her to straighten her fingers enough to place her finger pad on 
the screen. Learning to use iOS after years of using Windows also proved 
challenging.

“I bought a book about it, but I wasn’t too diligent about it,” she said. The 
iPad mostly stays in a drawer.

She is also wary of social media. In 2008, at the behest of my sister, she 
joined Facebook, but she’s never taken to it.

“People come on Facebook and they talk about so many things that are 
irrelevant,” she said.

In the interests of very serious journalism, she agreed to test out Snapchat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/snapchat> and Twitter, both of which 
she had heard about, but never used.

The first time I showed her Snapchat (and its selfie filters), we were eating 
at a Chinese restaurant with my father. Her initial reaction was shocked 
disbelief thatthis had vaulted the startup to an $18bn valuation 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-26/snapchat-raises-1-8-billion-in-latest-funding-round>
, though she laughed heartily at the silliness of it.

“That’s a company?” she scoffed. “That’s a company? Do they sell ads? I can’t 
see the purpose of it.”

After we turned the camera around and Snapped my dad with doggie ears, she 
delivered her verdict: “I think it’s a waste of energy. I don’t have anything 
positive to say.”

A few weeks later, however, we revisited Snapchat and took some more selfies. 

“It’s fun,” she conceded, “but to go and IPO on it 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/snapchat-could-go-public-early-next-year>
? You can only laugh so much. People will get sick of it pretty soon.”

I also managed to convince her to try Twitter, using my account. Prior to our 
experiment, her familiarity withTwitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> was mostly limited to news 
coverage of Donald Trump.

“I know you shorten words,” she told me, though I assured her that was not 
always necessary.

After I opened Twitter.com on her browser (Firefox), she spent a few minutes 
scrolling through my timeline.

“They spend all their time watching this thing?” she asked, referring to the 
people on my timeline. “Is this what they do all day at work?” (The answer to 
both questions is yes, but please don’t tell my grandmother.)

Then, it was time to tweet.

“I am 102 years old and Julia Carrie Wong’s grandmother.”

Twitter responded in typical fashion, with warmth, cat pictures, gifs, and the 
odd highly inappropriate comment.

She even waded into her mentions and responded to a few questions.

Pretty soon, she was tired of the experience, and posted her sendoff.

When we had logged off, I asked her what she thought of my favorite social 
media network.

“I guess if the young people think they can get to know people on it, I guess 
it’s OK,” she said. “I really don’t see the purpose of it.”

Later that day, I checked the continuing response to her tweets. One user had 
senta question <https://twitter.com/caillemillner/status/772906214741073921>: 
“What do you wish you had known when you were younger, Rose?”

It’s a question I have occasionally wanted to ask my grandmother myself. 
After all, my grandmother has lived an extraordinary life. She went from the 
potato ranch to the Universities of British Columbia and Michigan; survived the 
Great Depression and a sojourn in Texas as a Chinese-Canadian immigrant under 
Jim Crow, raised a family while teaching in public schools, and, since 
retirement, has traveled around the world.

I relayed the question. My grandmother laughed. 

“Not Twitter.”
