British athletes heading for the Rio Olympics next month will be dreaming of 
winning a gold medal. But those who cannot bag the top spot may find they are 
happier with a bronze than coming second.

For those who do end up with silver, it might have been better for their 
mental state if they had been soundly beaten – sometimes, it seems, it is 
better to lose by a lot than a little. New research suggests that athletes’ 
perception of their achievements is dependent on what they think might have 
been.

A team at the Centre for Economic Performance <http://cep.lse.ac.uk>, based at 
the London School of Economics, examined the perceived happiness levels of Team 
Great Britain medallists at the London 2012 Olympic Games.

Almost 800 volunteers were asked to examine video clips of the athletes’ faces 
while they were waiting for the awards ceremony to begin, while they were on 
the podium and while they were listening to their country’s national anthem. 
Particular attention was paid to when an athlete exhibited a “Duchenne smile”, 
characterised by raising the corners of the mouth, cheeks and “crinkling” or 
crow’s feet around the eyes, which is considered by psychologists to be an 
expression of genuine positive emotion.

“Our findings show that medallists appear happier the better they perform, 
with the exception of silver medallists, who are happier when they have a 
‘close call’ with bronze medallists”, said one of those behind the study, 
Georgios Kavetsos, assistant professor in behavioural science at the LSE.

The happiness levels of gold winners rated an average score of 6.65 out of 10. 
Silver winners were rated 5.92 and bronze 6.06. One possible explanation is 
that silver medallists are less happy than bronze medallists because they think 
about how they could have won gold, while bronze medallists feel lucky to be on 
the podium.

The research builds on a growing body of literature examining what makes 
humans happy – a fledgling subject known as hedonics. Comparative performance 
seems to be a key component in determining happiness and life chances. One 
study has found that Nobel laureates and Academy Award winners outlive their 
nominated peers.

The Centre for Economic Performance study echoes an earlier one made into the 
emotional expressions of athletes during the Barcelona 1992 Olympics, which 
also suggested that bronze medal winners appeared happier than silver medal 
winners. But the new study finds that the margin of victory by which a medal is 
earned or lost is important.

“The relative margin of performance appears to matter to the relative 
happiness of silver medallists,” Kavetos said. “Silver medallists were 
especially happier than bronze medallists when silvers were closer to being a 
bronze than to being a gold medallist.” Conversely, silver medallists who 
narrowly lost out on gold were judged to be significantly less happy when it 
came to their appearance at the medals ceremony.

The study cites the example of Team GB rowers Mark Hunter and Zac Purchase who 
just lost out on a gold to Denmark and were left visibly distraught at their 
failure to grab top spot.

Kavetos stressed that the study’s findings were about the happiness levels of 
athletes when on the podium. “Later on, they may be very happy with a silver,” 
he said, suggesting a follow-up study should be done. “But as with most things 
in life, context matters. In the context of sports competitions, there is 
little doubt that you will be happiest if you win. But if you cannot win, then 
our study suggests that you might feel better by taking your foot off the gas 
and coming in second by quite a margin; and, perhaps, even coming in third.”
