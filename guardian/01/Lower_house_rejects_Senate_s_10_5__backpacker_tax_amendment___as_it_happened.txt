Night-time politics

 * Today, lots of silliness happened in the parliament. Most developments 
related to the backpacker tax, which seemed to take all day, but there was no 
step forward. The situation remains a stalemate.

 * As growers wait for a stable tax rate for a fair portion of their harvest 
staff, the Senate debated, then amended, the working holidaymakers income tax 
rate to 10.5%, with support from Jacqui Lambie, Labor, the Greens, David 
Leyonhjelm and One Nation. The bill was then sent to the lower house, which 
threw out the 10.5% rate, leaving the rate at 19%. Now the bill goes back to 
the Senate and sits in a queue.

 * The $5 increase in the passenger movement charge passed the house after the 
government lost the vote due to a no-show by One Nation senators. Pauline 
Hanson and Brian Burston apologised to the Senate for their confusion between a 
quorum and a vote.

 * Pauline Hanson said there was reverse racism in Australia while debating a 
private member’s bill to remove a whole part (including 18C) from the Racial 
Discrimination Act. Labor senator Pat Dodson said “it is interesting that 
bigotry is back in favour”, giving a speech from personal experience.

 * Immigration minister Peter Dutton said he had been misrepresented by Bill 
Shorten over his comments regarding Lebanese Muslim Australians but would not 
identify in what way.

 * The Senate economics references committee report into the 2016 census 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/2016Census/Report>
, released on Thursday, found that IBM failed to check the system’s resilience 
and recommended open tendering be used to award the contract in future. The 
2016 census was like a house with “a sinking foundation and cracks in the 
walls”, because IBM and its subcontractors are in dispute over the bad build, a 
Senate committee has said. But it said that “the primary responsibility lies 
with the government” and called on “the current minister, on behalf of the 
government, to take responsibility”. Labor isn’t calling for small business 
minister, Michael McCormack, to resign though, because of how soon before the 
census he took over responsibility for it. 
That’s it for the week. Thanks to Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Katharine 
Murphy. And Mike Bowers for the 13km he ran today with full camera gear. I kid 
you not, that’s what the pedometer says. It was well worth our while. And 
thanks to you dear reader. We could not do it without you.

We will be back next week, bright and early on Monday. At this stage staffers 
are being told to anticipate the last week of sitting will extend into Friday.

Goodnight.

To be clear, the lower house now has to consider the backpacker tax amendment 
for a 10.5% tax rate.

In order to do this, the house had to knock off the adjournment debate.

The lower house is now voting on the question that the 10.5% change not be 
made.

That is, chuck out the 10.5% rate and restore the 19% rate.

In which case, the bill will go back to the government’s preferred option of 
19% and will be punted back up to the Senate.

All I can hear from the backpacker division is Labor’s agriculture shadow, 
Joel Fitzgibbon, yelling at Barnaby Joyce:

You have sold your farmers down the drain.

Presumably the government will reject the amendments.

 * Today, lots of silliness happened in the parliament. Most developments 
related to the backpacker tax, which seemed to take all day, but there was no 
step forward. The situation remains a stalemate.

 * As growers wait for a stable tax rate for a fair portion of their harvest 
staff, the Senate debated, then amended, the working holidaymakers income tax 
rate to 10.5%, with support from Jacqui Lambie, Labor, the Greens, David 
Leyonhjelm and One Nation. The bill was then sent to the lower house, which 
threw out the 10.5% rate, leaving the rate at 19%. Now the bill goes back to 
the Senate and sits in a queue.

 * The $5 increase in the passenger movement charge passed the house after the 
government lost the vote due to a no-show by One Nation senators. Pauline 
Hanson and Brian Burston apologised to the Senate for their confusion between a 
quorum and a vote.

 * Pauline Hanson said there was reverse racism in Australia while debating a 
private member’s bill to remove a whole part (including 18C) from the Racial 
Discrimination Act. Labor senator Pat Dodson said “it is interesting that 
bigotry is back in favour”, giving a speech from personal experience.

 * Immigration minister Peter Dutton said he had been misrepresented by Bill 
Shorten over his comments regarding Lebanese Muslim Australians but would not 
identify in what way.

 * The Senate economics references committee report into the 2016 census 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/2016Census/Report>
, released on Thursday, found that IBM failed to check the system’s resilience 
and recommended open tendering be used to award the contract in future. The 
2016 census was like a house with “a sinking foundation and cracks in the 
walls”, because IBM and its subcontractors are in dispute over the bad build, a 
Senate committee has said. But it said that “the primary responsibility lies 
with the government” and called on “the current minister, on behalf of the 
government, to take responsibility”. Labor isn’t calling for small business 
minister, Michael McCormack, to resign though, because of how soon before the 
census he took over responsibility for it. 
That’s it for the week. Thanks to Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Katharine 
Murphy. And Mike Bowers for the 13km he ran today with full camera gear. I kid 
you not, that’s what the pedometer says. It was well worth our while. And 
thanks to you dear reader. We could not do it without you.

We will be back next week, bright and early on Monday. At this stage staffers 
are being told to anticipate the last week of sitting will extend into Friday.

Goodnight.

The lower house has adjourned so the MPs are off.

The Senate continues.
 
The lower house has rejected the Senate’s amendments 75-70. 

It is not clear whether the bill will go straight back to the Senate for 
another vote.
 
To be clear, the lower house now has to consider the backpacker tax amendment 
for a 10.5% tax rate.

In order to do this, the house had to knock off the adjournment debate.

The lower house is now voting on the question that the 10.5% change not be 
made.

That is, chuck out the 10.5% rate and restore the 19% rate.

In which case, the bill will go back to the government’s preferred option of
