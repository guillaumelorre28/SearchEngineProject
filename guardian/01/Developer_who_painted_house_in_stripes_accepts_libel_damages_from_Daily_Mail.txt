The Daily Mail <https://www.theguardian.com/media/dailymail> has settled a 
libel action brought by a property developer over inaccurate allegations that 
she mistreated her late husband’s son and his family over inheritance claims.

Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring launched high court proceedings over two articles 
that appeared in April last year, whenshe hit the headlines for painting her 
house in red and white stripes after a row with neighbours over a basement 
extension 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/14/candy-stripe-house-redesign-makes-kensington-neighbours-see-red>
.

On Monday, she accepted an undisclosed sum in damages, which she will donate 
to charity, her legal costs and an unreserved apology fromAssociated Newspapers

Her counsel, Sara Mansoori, told Mr Justice Nicol in London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> that the newspaper had now accepted 
that the claims were untrue.

The articles wrongly repeated allegations made by Robert Lisle, her late 
husband’s son, and his second wife, Sally, that Lisle-Mainwaring had 
unreasonably denied them money that they claimed had been promised to them and 
was properly due to them.

The publication had a detrimental effect on her reputation among friends, 
family and business associates, and caused her acute distress and 
embarrassment, said counsel.

Christina Michalos, for Mail publisher Associated Newspapers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers>, said that a few days after 
publication, it added a footnote to the online version of the second article 
explaining Lisle-Mainwaring’s generosity to her late husband’s son and his 
family.

It subsequently removed both articles in their entirety and had undertaken not 
to publish similar allegations in future.
