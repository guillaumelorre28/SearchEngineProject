Satire and Islam do not sit well together, especially if the format is visual 
representation of the prophet Muhammad – and perhaps also the self-proclaimed 
caliph of Islamic State (Isis), now ruling swaths of Iraq and Syria,Abu Bakr 
al-Baghdadi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi>.

Charlie Hebdo, the French magazine whose offices were attacked by gunmen in 
Paris on Wednesday, has published several controversial cartoons portraying the 
prophet, some in pornographic poses. Last October, it portrayed the jihadis of 
Isis as being opposed toIslam <https://www.theguardian.com/world/islam> by 
displaying an image of a masked man cutting the throat of his kneeling, 
turbanned victim, who is saying: “I am the prophet, you brute.”

The killer replies: “Shut your mouth, you infidel.” The cartoon was captioned: 
“If Muhammad returned …”

Observant Muslims anywhere would be angered by such images. That is especially 
true of fundamentalist Salafis, who adhere to traditions laid down in 
7th-century Arabia, or of the small minority who hold to the jihadi-takfiri 
world view espoused by Isis and al-Qaida. Their doctrines permit the killing of 
so-called apostates. But devout Sunni Muslims of all stripes avoid visual 
depictions of Muhammad or other prophets such as Moses or Abraham.

Islam is not unique. Judaism forbids the use of “graven images” and 
Christianity has at times frowned on visual representations of sacred figures, 
allowing only the cross to be depicted in churches.

The Qur’an does not explicitly forbid images of Muhammad, but several hadith 
(sayings and actions attributed to the prophet) prohibit Muslims from creating 
visual depictions of human figures. Traditionally, the concern has been that 
images may encourage idolatry, the scourge of the jahiliyya period of 
pre-Islamic Arabia.

The most common visual representation of the prophet Muhammad in Islamic art 
is by elaborate swirling Arabic calligraphy. The Qur’an is never illustrated.

The destruction by the Taliban in Afghanistan of statues of Buddha in Kandahar 
is a notorious example of the intolerance of images, part of the school of 
tawhid – usually translated as Islamic monotheism. Sunni disapproval of Shia 
Muslim shrines reflects this too. Shia are more flexible than Sunnis and 
display images of Husayn, the grandson of Muhammad.

The differences between the two main branches of Islam are often compared to 
those between Protestants and Catholics in the Christian world. Isis in Iraq 
has demolished shrines to Sunni or Sufi figures, while Shia mosques have also 
been destroyed – hence the Iraqi Shia militiamen and Iranian Revolutionary 
Guards protecting the revered Sayyida Zeinab shrine in the Syrian capital, 
Damascus.

In a cartoon published just before Wednesday’s killings, Charlie Hebdo 
portrayed Baghdadi, apparently based on a photograph of him preaching in a 
mosque after the capture of the Iraqi city of Mosul last June and his 
proclamation of a new caliphate. It sarcastically wished him “especially good 
health”.

In November 2010, the magazine’s office was hit by a firebomb and its website 
hacked after it announced plans for an edition with Muhammad as its chief 
editor, and the title page with a cartoon of him was posted on social media.
