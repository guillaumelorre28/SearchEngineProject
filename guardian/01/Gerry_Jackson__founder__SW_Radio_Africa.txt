 Activate London 2012: Gerry Jackson 
Gerry is the founder of SW Radio Africa, a radio station broadcasting into 
Zimbabwe on shortwave from the UK. Increasingly the station is using social 
media to expand its audience and to expose the crimes of human rights abusers. 
Gerry worked as a journalist and film producer in Zimbabwe for over twenty 
years before challenging the government's broadcasting monopoly in the Supreme 
Court and winning the right to set up the country's first independent radio 
station. This was forcibly closed by armed paramilitary after just six days.
