One of the government's key arts funding strategies is to encourage more 
private philanthropy – and what a week it's been for that. The NationalTheatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre> is getting £10m from Travelex 
entrepreneur Lloyd Dorfman, renaming the Cottesloe after him; and the 
Serpentine gallery is getting an undisclosed "major donation" from the Dr 
Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation to annexe The Magazine building in 
London's Kensington Gardens as a new exhibition space. The Ashmolean in Oxford, 
meanwhile, has just announced that Lord Sainsbury's Linbury Trust is 
contributing most of the money required for its £5m redesign. The plan is to 
close the galleries on January 1 2011; the new galleries, designed by Rick 
Mather Associates, will then open in the winter. And the Courtauld Institute of 
Art in London has, for its part, raised £7m in private funding for the Higher 
Education Funding Council for England's "matched funding challenge". The 
challenge is to raise £8.25m by July next year in order to get a third of that 
(£2.75m) matched by the government .
