If there's one single event that pinpoints the birth of heavy metal's satanic 
image, it would be when a Birmingham band called Earth renamed themselvesBlack 
Sabbath <https://www.theguardian.com/music/blacksabbath>. Guitarist Tony Iommi 
had already developed a down-tuned way of playing, to cope with the loss of 
fingertips in an industrial injury, and the combination of his doomy riffing 
and that name gave us the first true metal band.
