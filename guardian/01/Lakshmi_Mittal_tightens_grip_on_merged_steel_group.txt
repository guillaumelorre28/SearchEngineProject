Lakshmi Mittal <https://www.theguardian.com/business/lakshmi-mittal>, the 
billionaire steel magnate, today tightened his family's control over Arcelor 
Mittal, the world's biggest steel group, by taking over as chief executive.

Mr Mittal, who will remain president, is replacing Roland Junck, a 
dyed-in-the-wool Arcelor executive, just three months after completing his 
family company's €25bn (£16.74bn) takeover of the Luxembourg-based rival.

Joseph Kinsch, the combined group chairman, said: "We are making these changes 
to clarify the leadership of the company. It had become clear over the past 
months that the interests of the company were not best served by the previous 
structure."

It is understood that Mr Junck, who remains on the management board, felt his 
authority constantly undermined by the very "hands-on" presence of Mr Mittal 
and argued for one person to be put in charge of the chain of command.

The supervisory board unanimously supported Mr Mittal but shareholders have 
yet to approve.

The move gives the two top executive posts to the Mittal family, with 
Lakshmi's son Aditya remaining as chief financial officer and CEO-apparent.

Mr Mittal père said the group's overarching priority was successful 
integration to deliver the promised multibillion synergies; he is understood to 
have been dissatisfied with progress so far.

Ironically, Mr Junck, who will officially advise Mr Mittal, enacted the role 
of the predator steel baron during the seven-month takeover war, trying to 
second-guess his moves and motives for the Arcelor board.

The combined group, meanwhile, delivered third-quarter pre-tax profits of 
$4.35bn on sales of $22bn. It is in the throes of assuming complete control of 
Arcelor's Brazilian interests in a controversial $2.6bn buy-out of shares.
