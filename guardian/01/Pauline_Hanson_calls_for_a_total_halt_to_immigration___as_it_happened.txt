Night time politics

That’s enough for me. I need to go and stick my eyeballs in a glass of water 
and my spirit in a decompression chamber.

Today:

 * The budget omnibus bill - agreed on by the Coalition and Labor - passed 
through the lower house but not without protests from Greens MP Adam Bandt and 
Andrew Wilkie. Fellow crossbenchers Cathy McGowan and Bob Katter joined them to 
oppose the bill. There appeared to be some funny business going on around the 
$800m put back into the renewable energy agency Arena (which was going to lose 
$1.3bn). It remains a net loss.

 * Malcolm Turnbull introduced the same sex marriage plebiscite bill. Bill 
Shorten let it be known that he would recommend blocking the bill. But we don’t 
have it from his mouth because he jetted off to meet Canadian prime minister 
Justin Trudeau. There is some suggestion via Paul Karp that a Coalition 
briefing note suggests conscientious objectors in the non-religious sphere may 
achieve protections of some sort.Blessed are the cakemakers. Stay tuned for 
that one.

 * The government announced a national amnesty for illegal guns.

 * The Coalition has referred a number of matters from the last election to 
the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (Jscem). They include 
political donations, funding political parties, electronic voting and foreign 
political donations.

 * Eighteen years after her first first speech, Pauline Hanson used her second 
first speech to move her targets from Indigenous people and Asian people to 
Asian people and Muslim people. She wants a ban on all immigration, a ban on 
new mosques, Muslim migration if she can’t get the full ban, burkas, Islamic 
schools, mosques. She wants to look after the old and sick Australians but 
without the growing tax base from migration. Like the government, Hanson wants 
to make kids out of schools wait for welfare and instead teach them to get a 
job. Even where there are no jobs. And so it went.

 * Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy followed her with a speech talking about 
her Indigenous and non-Indigenous heritage and her long path to the senate. She 
contrasted with Hanson to say she was in the senate for all people, Indigenous 
and non, from all around the world. Underline. She said she understood the 
trepidation over Indigenous recognition, the idea of asking for recognition 
again was difficult. She wants reforms for the Northern Territory, perhaps 
including moving to becoming the seventh state and increasing the 
representation numbers for the territory. At the end, Hanson congratulated her, 
lingered and gave her a hug. Cameras whirled. 
Tomorrow, Shorten will still be hanging with his new bestie, Justin Trudeau. 
It will be the final day of the sitting week. Thanks toPaul Karp, Katharine 
Murphy, Gareth Hutchens, Katharine Murphyand Greg Jericho. Mike Bowers’ 
pictures were outstanding. And thanks everyone for your input. We couldn’t do 
it without you.

Goodnight.

The other quote I have pulled out of Pauline Hanson’s speech relates to her 
call for a halt to further immigration.

At present our immigration intake is 190,000 year. High immigration is only 
beneficial to multinationals, banks and big business seeking a larger market 
while everyday Australians suffer from this massive intake. They are waiting 
longer for their lifesaving operation, the unemployment queues grow longer, and 
even longer when government jobs are given priority to migrants. Our city roads 
have become parking lots, schools are bursting at the seams. Our aged and sick 
are left behind to fend for themselves and many towns and cities struggle to 
provide water for an ever-growing population. Our service providers struggle to 
cope due to lack of government funding, leaving it to charities to pick up the 
pieces. Governments both state and federal have a duty of care to the 
Australian people. Clean up your own backyard before flooding our country with 
more people who are going to be a drain on our society.I call for a halt to 
further immigration and look after our aged, sick and helpless first.

OK, I have located that final quote from Pauline Hanson. 

I can guarantee the name Pauline Hanson carries with it independence, honesty, 
assurance, quality and reliability. Something the Chinese can never buy. And 
halal snack packs never provide it.

Please reconsider your plebiscite bill ... make marriage equality a reality.

She reminds Malcolm Turnbull of the hateful debate that ended Adam Goodes’ 
football career, in a challenge to the idea that hate speech will not feature 
in the plebiscite debate.

To the sister girls and brother boys who struggle with their sexuality, I say 
to you stay strong. I stand with you.

She says she understands Indigenous recognition is a bitter pill to swallow to 
ask again for recognition from other people.

(But she does not urge a change to Labor policy supporting recognition on 
that.)


Is it not time to consider a vision for the north?

We need a vision that unites over 100 Indigenous language groups in the NT 
alone?

She raises the possibility of the NT becoming a seventh state and urges the 
government to consider a way of getting more NT senators and members into the 
parliament.

Let the people of the NT have a say.

McCarthy says she has been questioned as to how she is so educated, given she 
is an Indigenous woman.

That’s enough for me. I need to go and stick my eyeballs in a glass of water 
and my spirit in a decompression chamber.

Today:

 * The budget omnibus bill - agreed on by the Coalition and Labor - passed 
through the lower house but not without protests from Greens MP Adam Bandt and 
Andrew Wilkie. Fellow crossbenchers Cathy McGowan and Bob Katter joined them to 
oppose the bill. There appeared to be some funny business going on around the 
$800m put back into the renewable energy agency Arena (which was going to lose 
$1.3bn). It remains a net loss.

 * Malcolm Turnbull introduced the same sex marriage plebiscite bill. Bill 
Shorten let it be known that he would recommend blocking the bill. But we don’t 
have it from his mouth because he jetted off to meet Canadian prime minister 
Justin Trudeau. There is some suggestion via Paul Karp that a Coalition 
briefing note suggests conscientious objectors in the non-religious sphere may 
achieve protections of some sort.Blessed are the cakemakers. Stay tuned for 
that one.

 * The government announced a national amnesty for illegal guns.

 * The Coalition has referred a number of matters from the last election to 
the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (Jscem). They include 
political donations, funding political parties, electronic voting and foreign 
political donations.

 * Eighteen years after her first first speech, Pauline Hanson used her second 
first speech to move her targets from Indigenous people and Asian people to 
Asian people and Muslim people. She wants a ban on all immigration, a ban on 
new mosques, Muslim migration if she can’t get the full ban, burkas, Islamic 
schools, mosques. She wants to look after the old and sick Australians but 
without the growing tax base from migration. Like the government, Hanson wants 
to make kids out of schools wait for welfare and instead teach them to get a 
job. Even where there are no jobs. And so it went.

 * Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy followed her with a speech talking about 
her Indigenous and non-Indigenous heritage and her long path to the senate. She 
contrasted with Hanson to say she was in the senate for all people, Indigenous 
and non, from all around the world. Underline. She said she understood the 
trepidation over Indigenous recognition, the idea of asking for recognition 
again was difficult. She wants reforms for the Northern Territory, perhaps 
including moving to becoming the seventh state and increasing the 
representation numbers for the territory. At the end, Hanson congratulated her, 
lingered and gave her a hug. Cameras whirled. 
Tomorrow, Shorten will still be hanging with his new bestie, Justin Trudeau. 
It will be the final day of the sitting week. Thanks toPaul Karp, Katharine 
Murphy, Gareth Hutchens, Katharine Murphyand Greg Jericho. Mike Bowers’ 
pictures were outstanding. And thanks everyone for your input. We couldn’t do 
it without you.

Goodnight. 
 
The other quote I have pulled out of Pauline Hanson’s speech relates to her 
call for a halt to further immigration.

At present our immigration intake is 190,000 year. High immigration is only 
beneficial to multinationals, banks and big business seeking a larger market 
while everyday Australians suffer from this massive intake. They are waiting 
longer for their lifesaving operation, the unemployment queues grow longer, and 
even longer when government jobs are given priority to migrants. Our city roads 
have become parking lots, schools are bursting at the seams. Our aged and sick 
are left behind to fend for themselves and many towns and cities struggle to 
provide water for an ever-growing population. Our service providers struggle to 
cope due to lack of government funding, leaving it to charities to pick up the 
pieces. Governments both state and federal have a duty of care to the 
Australian people. Clean up your own backyard before flooding our country with 
more people who are going to be a drain on our society.I call for a halt to 
further immigration and look after our aged, sick and helpless first.

OK, I have located that final quote from Pauline Hanson. 

I can guarantee the name Pauline Hanson carries with it independence, honesty, 
assurance, quality and reliability. Something the Chinese can never buy. And 
halal snack packs never provide it.
 
I’m just trying to track down the text of the Hanson speech.

Please reconsider your plebiscite bill ... make marriage equality a reality.

She reminds Malcolm Turnbull of the hateful debate that ended Adam Goodes’ 
football career, in a challenge to the idea that hate speech will not feature 
in the plebiscite debate.

To the sister girls and brother boys who struggle with their sexuality, I say 
to you stay strong. I stand with you.
 
She says she understands Indigenous recognition is a bitter pill to swallow to 
ask again for recognition from other people.

(But she does not urge a change to Labor policy supporting recognition on 
that.)


Is it not time to consider a vision for the north?

We need a vision that unites over 100 Indigenous language groups in the NT 
alone?

She raises the possibility of the NT becoming a seventh state and urges the 
government to consider a way of getting more NT senators and members into the 
parliament.

Let the people of the NT have a say.

McCarthy says she has been questioned as to how she is so educated, given she 
is an Indigenous woman.
 
McCarthy commends Indigenous journalists, of which she was one before entering 
politics.

She talks about her ancestors, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. Their 
support for theWave Hill walkoff 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/19/wave-hill-walk-off-anniversary-birth-of-indigenous-land-rights-battle>
, which she says attracted support from many Australians, not just Indigenous. 
She thanks a range of people, including her fellow Indigenous colleaguesPat 
Dodson and Linda Burney. 
 
Hanson’s mob has left but she stays to listen to McCarthy.
