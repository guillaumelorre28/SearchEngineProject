Aviva <https://www.theguardian.com/business/avivabusiness> has reduced the 
maximum payout for its chief executive under a long-term share plan following 
opposition to the potential £3.4m award for this year.

The insurer had proposed granting Mark Wilson shares worth up to 3.5 times his 
£980,000 salary. The award could have taken his total earnings for 2015 to 
£6.7m.

However,after an objection this week by the shareholder adviser, believed to 
be Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), the maximum payment under the 
long-term incentive plan was cut to three times Wilson’s salary, or £2.9m.

ISS also took issue with the maximum long-term incentive plan award for 
Aviva’s finance director Tom Stoddard. The company cut his maximum payment to 
2.25 times his £675,000 salary from 2.5 times. The change means the most he can 
earn from plan is £1.52m.

Patricia Cross, who chairs Aviva’s remuneration committee, said: “The board 
was disappointed to receive feedback this week from a shareholder voting agency 
which expressed concern over the proposed [long-term incentive plan] awards, 
despite the tangible progress made by the management team and the award being 
within the company’s remuneration policy.”

Cross said shareholders had generally supported Aviva’s pay proposals before 
ISS’s late intervention. The revised package is intended to head off any 
investor revolt at Aviva’s AGM on 29 April.

Executive pay is a touchy subject at Aviva after its former chief executive 
Andrew Moss wasforced out

 during the shareholder spring of 2012. At an acrimonious AGM, 60% of 
shareholders withheld support from Moss’s pay deal of up to £5m, sealing his 
fate.

Last month, Aviva announced better-than-expected annual operating profit

 up 6% to £2.17bn as it prepared to take over Friends Life in a deal engineered 
by Wilson. Aviva’s asset management arm was fined £17.6m this year by the 
Financial Conduct Authority for systems failures in 2013.

Executives at some of Britain’s biggest companies are braced for battles over 
pay and other matters during this year’s AGM season

. WPP and BG Group are in investors’ sights over pay along with the insurer 
Prudential. Aviva’s rival paid its chief executive Tidjane Thiam £11.8m in 2014.

ISS is the biggest adviser to institutional investors on how to vote on pay 
and other governance matters. The US-based group demonstrated its clout last 
year whenits objections helped force a climbdown at BG

 over the pay deal for new boss Helge Lund.
