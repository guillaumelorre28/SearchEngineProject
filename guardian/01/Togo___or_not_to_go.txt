Togo's preparations for the African Cup of Nations have been hit by financial 
wrangling over qualifying bonuses.

The squad was due to leave Lom√© last night for Egypt, but the players refused 
to board until they were guaranteed $40,000 each by the Togolese Football 
Federation. Reports suggest that an offer of $20,000 per player, tabled by a 
special nine-man government commission, has been rejected.

"They were asking for the money as some kind of morale booster," said coach 
Stephen Keshi.

"I know they [the federation and the government] are really trying their best 
to make the boys happy. This is out of my hand - they just have to sort it out 
themselves."

The faltering negotiations have impacted on two days of pre-tournament 
training for the Hawks, and Keshi hopes further talks today will lead to 
resolution, allowing the team to fly to Cairo tonight. They face DR Congo there 
on Saturday.
