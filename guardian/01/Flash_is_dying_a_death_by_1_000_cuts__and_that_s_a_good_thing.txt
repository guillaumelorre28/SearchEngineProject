Adobe’s Flash, hated the world over for slowing down computers, containing 
more holes in security than swiss cheese and stubbornly being the video carrier 
of choice until recently, is dying.


Video players are migrating to other systems, even if Microsoft’s Silverlight 
isn’t much better. HTML5-based video and animations are becoming mainstream, 
and uploaders and other more advanced web-based features can now be replaced 
with code that doesn’t rely on Flash.

And it’s happening for a good reason. As other components of a web browser and 
operating system have become more secure, Flash is one of the biggest sources 
of security vulnerabilities. Hackers love it.

Hacking Team’s commercially available government-supplied tools relied on 
holes in Flash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/08/warning-adobe-flash-vulnerability-hacking-team-leak>
 to hack individuals and companies, for instance, just by users browsing sites 
unknowingly being digitally broken into.

Even Adobe <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/adobe>, Flash’s developer, 
doesn’t seem to love the much maligned system. Like Microsoft with Windows XP, 
Adobe’s been trying to migrate companies away from using its own tools while 
putting out fires left, right and centre.

The one major hold out for dumping Flash wholesale has been advertisers. In 
June, over 100m adverts were displayed to users globally with Flash, while 84% 
of banner ads are still Flash,according to Ad Age 
<http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/flash-obsolete-time-agencies-adapt/298946/>
.

Google took the first step by announcing that come September its Chrome 
browser will not run Flash adverts by default, meaning that the user has to 
click to enable the advert. Something virtually no one is likely to do. Firefox 
also blocked Flashover security concerns

.

Now Amazon has banned Flash ads from appearing on its ad platform across its 
sites.Amazon <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon> is not the biggest 
advertising platform, but it is one of the first big name ones to adopt such a 
policy.

It marks the beginning of the end for Flash (Occupy Flash 
<http://occupyflash.org/> will be happy). More advertising platforms are likely 
to follow. When Chrome and its 51% of global browsers, according to data from 
Statcounter, start to “intelligently pause” Flash ads in September advertisers 
will be forced to switch wholesale.

The reasons for Flash to exist will then, hopefully, peter out to embedded 
tools and systems built within Flash, such as administrative tools. Most home 
users will no longer be burdened with Flash, which will be good for your 
computer, your battery, your security and your sanity.

For those that want to experience a Flash-free world right now, it is possible 
to disable Flash entirely within your browser or set it to require a click to 
enable it each time something wants to use Flash.

Mobile devices such as iOS and Android smartphones and tablets have mostly 
been Flash-free for years and they work just fine for the most part. Soon 
everything will have that speedy, Flash-free existence and humanity will be all 
the better for it.
