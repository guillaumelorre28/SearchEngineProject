Strictly private and Confidential

My dear Fawaz

Thank you for your email about next week's BSS meeting. I know that this is an 
extremely important meeting but unfortunately I cannot attend as I shall be in 
Turkey with my family for a long standing commitment which I cannot change.

Our Society is facing a very difficult and delicate situation. We have to be 
sympathetic to the concerns of all our Members and in particular the British 
ones. They have served us well and we should make them comfortable by trying to 
understand their position - it is sad because I cannot see any light at the end 
of the tunnel. The current situation inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> is simply unacceptable and the 
continuing killings and violence are indefensible. It is a fact that, in the 
circumstances, the BSS cannot fulfil its mission and I believe that there is 
little the Society can do for the foreseeable future. Our position has become 
untenable and unfortunately our Society will be dormant for a long period.

I have to say that I would myself have resigned had you not been our chairman 
because you are my dear friend and I do not want to put you in any way in an 
awkward or embarrassing position.

I hope you will understand how very sad it makes me to be writing like this. I 
have always been so proud to be a director of the BSS and of our achievements 
under your leadership. It has been a pleasure working with you and Ghayth and 
our other directors and members to advance relations between Britain and our 
beloved country and I hope that one day we will be able to do so again.

With warm wishes

Wafic
