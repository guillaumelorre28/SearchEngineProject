So that’s it for now. I’ll be back tomorrow for the final between Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> and Milos Raonic, a match in 
which the Canadian is unlikely to enjoy the same freedom he had here. It’ll be 
fascinating to see if McEnroe can devise a tactical plan that will help his 
charge to contain the Scot. Raonic will surely face a far sterner examination 
of his serve – not to mention a more arduous test from the baseline – than he 
did against the labouring Tomic. As for Murray, he looks to be in fine fettle, 
much as he has been all year. Playing a big server like Cilic was perfect 
preparation for the challenge that lies ahead, and you wouldn’t bet against him 
making it five titles, a feat that would eclipse men with the grass-court 
pedigree of John McEnroe and Boris Becker. That would be some achievement. 
Thanks for reading and look forward to your company again tomorrow.

The price of victory for Raonic? A courtside chat with John Inverdale. “It’s 
great to be able to return tomorrow and play for something big, so I look 
forward to that challenge,” says Raonic. And what of the super-coach scenario 
that will pit old foes John Mcenroe and Ivan Lendl against one another? “That’s 
for you guys to talk about, not for me to worry about,” says the Canadian, 
perhaps not too keen to add further fuel to that fire.

Game, set and match Raonic, 6-4, 6-4!

Second set: Tomic 4-6, 4-5 Raonic* (*denotes server)

As the clock strikes the hour mark, Raonic fires down two consecutive aces to 
bring up a couple of match points. Tomic saves the first, a solid return 
eliciting a netted forehand from Raonic, but a humongous serve-and-forehand 
routine seals the deal for Raonic. That was a clinical performance.

Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 4-5 Raonic (*denotes server)

Credit to Tomic, who wraps up the hold in mere seconds to force Raonic to 
serve for the victory. It’s a measure of the kind of match it’s been that a few 
people in the crowd are asleep. Will Raonic care? Not a bit.

Second set: Tomic 4-6, 3-5 Raonic* (*denotes server)

At 30-40, Raonic faces his first break point of the match and seventh of the 
week. You probably don’t need me to tell you how things pan out. Tomic reads 
the serve but can’t return it. An ace whistles past him on the next point 
before a big, kicking serve sets up an easy volley. Raonic is within a game of 
the final.

Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 3-4 Raonic (*denotes server)

Tomic completes a fine hold with a whipped forehand pass, but in many ways 
that seems less notable than some of the tactics Raonic is employing here. 
Serves into the body, chip-and-charge routines off his opponent’s second serve, 
surprise forays into the forecourt – we’re only a few days in to his coaching 
alliance with John McEnroe, but already the Canadian seems to have more 
dimensions to his game.

Second set: Tomic 4-6, 2-4 Raonic* (*denotes server)

A delightful backhand pass on the opening point gives Tomic a sniff, which is 
more than he’s had in most of Raonic’s service games. But the Canadian is just 
brutal. Serve after blistering serve whistles down towards the Australian, and 
within moments the third seed has consolidated the break.

Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 2-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

Oh dear. Facing two break points at 15-40, Tomic throws in a horrible 
double-fault. He looks listless, and you can only imagine that back injury is 
troubling him. He certainly looks to be in physical discomfort at the change of 
ends. Whatever the problem, this match is passing him by all too quickly.

Second set: Tomic 4-6, 2-2 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Raonic rattles his way swiftly to 40-0, only to be stopped in his tracks by a 
double-fault. No matter: a big serve, a brief rally, and Tomic swats a forehand 
wide. He needs to be tougher than that, the rangy righty.

A good hold from Tomic, who has served well by and large. He just needs to 
keep his nose in front and hope he can conjure something against the Raonic 
serve.

Second set: Tomic 4-6, 1-1 Raonic* (*denotes server)

As Raonic romps to another hold, it’s hard to know what Tomic can do to start 
making an impression against the serve. He’s been struggling with a back injury 
that has apparently required injections, and that won’t be helping. But could 
he alter his position, take the serve earlier or deeper? Something needs to 
change.

Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 1-0 Raonic (*denotes server)

He’s not the most charismatic player, Milos Raonic, but he certainly has all 
the tools of the trade. A forehand winner at 30-15 followed by some lovely 
approach play, culminating with a winning forehand volley, bring up break 
point. What Raonic perhaps lacks is the metronomic consistency of a Djokovic or 
a Murray, a point highlighted when he squanders the chance with a wayward 
approach shot. Tomic recovers well, sealing the game with a forehand winner, 
and that’s an important hold for the Aussie.

Milos Raonic wins the first set 6-4!

First set: Tomic 4-6 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Classic grass-court tennis from Milos Raonic: hold serve, bide your time until 
the business end of the set, break, hold. Pete Sampras, eat your heart out.

First set: Tomic* 4-5 Raonic (*denotes server)

A lovely off-backhand return winner – think Boris Becker circa 1985, but with 
two hands – sets Raonic on the way to what should prove a set-sealing break of 
serve. It’s a close-fought thing, though, Tomic digging in to save three break 
points before succumbing with a netted backhand pass after an angled volley 
from Raonic. Nice play from the Canadian.

First set: Tomic 4-4 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Colossal serve, monstrous forehand, deft volley: that’s how Milos Raonic seals 
his 41st consecutive hold of serve at this tournament. He has yet to be broken 
– he’s faced just six break points all week, according to the BBC’s Andrew 
Castle – and in this kind of form he should be a real threat at the All England 
Club, where he was a semi-finalist two summers ago.

First set: Tomic* 4-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

And here we see how Tomic could come a cropper in this match. Facing a server 
of Raonic’s quality, the Aussie can ill-afford to lose concentration, even for 
a moment. Yet that’s precisely what he does, a couple of loose shots handing 
Raonic a foothold in the game. Tomic recovers well, guiding home a forehand 
winner to seal the game to 30, but that’s a warning shot across the bows.

First set: Tomic* 3-2 Raonic (*denotes server)

Tomic doesn’t have the biggest serve in the world, but what he does have is 
variety, placement and depth. Those attributes are working in his favour so far 
as he holds again to keep pace with Raonic. It’ll be interesting to see how the 
contest evolves because, while the Canadian certainly has the edge in terms of 
sheer weight of shot, Tomic has more options from the back. Raonic probably 
won’t want to get involved in too many long rallies.

First set: Tomic 2-2 Raonic*(*denotes server)

Winding up an elaborately long swing, Raonic swats home a short return to hold 
to 15. It followed an absolutely booming second serve. The Canadian may have 
hired McEnroe to help him at the net during the grass-court season, but how 
many volleys he’ll actually have to hit is debatable. That serve is truly 
enormous.

First set: Tomic* 2-1 Raonic (*denotes server)

Another convincing hold from Tomic, who was involved in a bizarre third set 
against Gilles Müller of Luxembourg last night. Not always noted as the 
grittiest of competitors, Tomic enjoyed the novel experience of facing an 
opponent who was barely in contention for long stretches. He can expect a very 
different match today.

First set: Tomic 1-1 Raonic* (*denotes server)

It’s a case of anything you can do, as Raonic likewise makes short of his 
opening service game. Sitting at courtside, the Canadian’s coach, John McEnroe, 
looks happy. For now.

Raonic and Tomic are limbering up, and it promises to be a fascinating match. 
The pair have played three times previously, with Raonic, the world No9 – he 
has been as high as fourth – winning all three. Tomic, of course, has a 
reputation for being a flaky competitor, but there’s no doubting his talent.

That was quite a finish. Where Murray found the energy to take the opening 
point of that final game, I really don’t know. Cilic drew him in, forced him 
back, ran him from side to side, but still couldn’t find a way through, Murray 
running down everything the Croatian could throw at him. That was pretty much 
the story of the entire match. Cilic maintained a high level throughout – and 
played superbly towards the end of the second set – but Murray was always able 
to find a response. He also showed the kind of aggression, both on serve and, 
particularly, on his forehand, that he is so often accused of lacking. A fifth 
title looks well within his sights.

Murray is talking to John Inverdale at courtside, poor lad. “It’s great to get 
to the final again,” he says. And the prospect of a record-breaking fifth 
title? “There have been many great players that have played here over the years 
… some of the best players of all time … if I can do better than them, that’s a 
good sign.”

Third set: Cilic* 3-5, 6-4, 3-6 Murray (*denotes server)

“It seems that Andy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> has 
a square mouth,” writes Andrew Benton. “Contrast this left/right symmetry with 
Djokovic’s twisty face, and it’s clear that facial symmetry is a hindrance to 
grand slam victory. Andy needs to loosen up his facial muscles a bit.” I’m not 
sure if you’re right, Andrew, but – if so – I can’t see Lendl being much help. 
Not that Murray needs too much assistance here, because he’s just come within a 
whisker of winning through to yet another Queen’s final, Cilic saving a match 
point with an ace. It was great stuff from the Croatian, who was repeatedly 
pegged back to deuce but produced some lovely winners – a drop shot that kissed 
the line, two blistering forehands, and finally a winning backhand pass – to 
stay in the hunt.

Third set: Cilic 2-5, 6-4, 3-6 Murray* (*denotes server)

He’s still chuntering and chattering, is Murray, but that doesn’t stop him 
from flying through this service game to move within a game of the match. His 
first-serve percentage in this set is 77%, which explains why he’s lost barely 
a point on his delivery (two, if I’m not mistaken). Cilic will have to serve to 
stay in it.

So that’s it for now. I’ll be back tomorrow for the final between Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> and Milos Raonic, a match in 
which the Canadian is unlikely to enjoy the same freedom he had here. It’ll be 
fascinating to see if McEnroe can devise a tactical plan that will help his 
charge to contain the Scot. Raonic will surely face a far sterner examination 
of his serve – not to mention a more arduous test from the baseline – than he 
did against the labouring Tomic. As for Murray, he looks to be in fine fettle, 
much as he has been all year. Playing a big server like Cilic was perfect 
preparation for the challenge that lies ahead, and you wouldn’t bet against him 
making it five titles, a feat that would eclipse men with the grass-court 
pedigree of John McEnroe and Boris Becker. That would be some achievement. 
Thanks for reading and look forward to your company again tomorrow.
 
The price of victory for Raonic? A courtside chat with John Inverdale. “It’s 
great to be able to return tomorrow and play for something big, so I look 
forward to that challenge,” says Raonic. And what of the super-coach scenario 
that will pit old foes John Mcenroe and Ivan Lendl against one another? “That’s 
for you guys to talk about, not for me to worry about,” says the Canadian, 
perhaps not too keen to add further fuel to that fire.
 
Second set: Tomic 4-6, 4-5 Raonic* (*denotes server)

As the clock strikes the hour mark, Raonic fires down two consecutive aces to 
bring up a couple of match points. Tomic saves the first, a solid return 
eliciting a netted forehand from Raonic, but a humongous serve-and-forehand 
routine seals the deal for Raonic. That was a clinical performance.
 
Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 4-5 Raonic (*denotes server)

Credit to Tomic, who wraps up the hold in mere seconds to force Raonic to 
serve for the victory. It’s a measure of the kind of match it’s been that a few 
people in the crowd are asleep. Will Raonic care? Not a bit.
 
Second set: Tomic 4-6, 3-5 Raonic* (*denotes server)

At 30-40, Raonic faces his first break point of the match and seventh of the 
week. You probably don’t need me to tell you how things pan out. Tomic reads 
the serve but can’t return it. An ace whistles past him on the next point 
before a big, kicking serve sets up an easy volley. Raonic is within a game of 
the final.
 
Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 3-4 Raonic (*denotes server)

Tomic completes a fine hold with a whipped forehand pass, but in many ways 
that seems less notable than some of the tactics Raonic is employing here. 
Serves into the body, chip-and-charge routines off his opponent’s second serve, 
surprise forays into the forecourt – we’re only a few days in to his coaching 
alliance with John McEnroe, but already the Canadian seems to have more 
dimensions to his game.

Second set: Tomic 4-6, 2-4 Raonic* (*denotes server)

A delightful backhand pass on the opening point gives Tomic a sniff, which is 
more than he’s had in most of Raonic’s service games. But the Canadian is just 
brutal. Serve after blistering serve whistles down towards the Australian, and 
within moments the third seed has consolidated the break.
 
Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 2-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

Oh dear. Facing two break points at 15-40, Tomic throws in a horrible 
double-fault. He looks listless, and you can only imagine that back injury is 
troubling him. He certainly looks to be in physical discomfort at the change of 
ends. Whatever the problem, this match is passing him by all too quickly.
 
Second set: Tomic 4-6, 2-2 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Raonic rattles his way swiftly to 40-0, only to be stopped in his tracks by a 
double-fault. No matter: a big serve, a brief rally, and Tomic swats a forehand 
wide. He needs to be tougher than that, the rangy righty.
 
Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 2-1 Raonic (*denotes server)

A good hold from Tomic, who has served well by and large. He just needs to 
keep his nose in front and hope he can conjure something against the Raonic 
serve.
 
Second set: Tomic 4-6, 1-1 Raonic* (*denotes server)

As Raonic romps to another hold, it’s hard to know what Tomic can do to start 
making an impression against the serve. He’s been struggling with a back injury 
that has apparently required injections, and that won’t be helping. But could 
he alter his position, take the serve earlier or deeper? Something needs to 
change.
 
Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 1-0 Raonic (*denotes server)

He’s not the most charismatic player, Milos Raonic, but he certainly has all 
the tools of the trade. A forehand winner at 30-15 followed by some lovely 
approach play, culminating with a winning forehand volley, bring up break 
point. What Raonic perhaps lacks is the metronomic consistency of a Djokovic or 
a Murray, a point highlighted when he squanders the chance with a wayward 
approach shot. Tomic recovers well, sealing the game with a forehand winner, 
and that’s an important hold for the Aussie.
 
First set: Tomic 4-6 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Classic grass-court tennis from Milos Raonic: hold serve, bide your time until 
the business end of the set, break, hold. Pete Sampras, eat your heart out.

First set: Tomic* 4-5 Raonic (*denotes server)

A lovely off-backhand return winner – think Boris Becker circa 1985, but with 
two hands – sets Raonic on the way to what should prove a set-sealing break of 
serve. It’s a close-fought thing, though, Tomic digging in to save three break 
points before succumbing with a netted backhand pass after an angled volley 
from Raonic. Nice play from the Canadian.
 
First set: Tomic 4-4 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Colossal serve, monstrous forehand, deft volley: that’s how Milos Raonic seals 
his 41st consecutive hold of serve at this tournament. He has yet to be broken 
– he’s faced just six break points all week, according to the BBC’s Andrew 
Castle – and in this kind of form he should be a real threat at the All England 
Club, where he was a semi-finalist two summers ago.

First set: Tomic* 4-3 Raonic (*denotes server)

And here we see how Tomic could come a cropper in this match. Facing a server 
of Raonic’s quality, the Aussie can ill-afford to lose concentration, even for 
a moment. Yet that’s precisely what he does, a couple of loose shots handing 
Raonic a foothold in the game. Tomic recovers well, guiding home a forehand 
winner to seal the game to 30, but that’s a warning shot across the bows.
 
First set: Tomic 3-3 Raonic* (*denotes server)

Long rallies, did I say? None of those to see here. Another ultra-quick hold 
by Raonic.
 
First set: Tomic* 3-2 Raonic (*denotes server)

Tomic doesn’t have the biggest serve in the world, but what he does have is 
variety, placement and depth. Those attributes are working in his favour so far 
as he holds again to keep pace with Raonic. It’ll be interesting to see how the 
contest evolves because, while the Canadian certainly has the edge in terms of 
sheer weight of shot, Tomic has more options from the back. Raonic probably 
won’t want to get involved in too many long rallies.
 
First set: Tomic 2-2 Raonic*(*denotes server)

Winding up an elaborately long swing, Raonic swats home a short return to hold 
to 15. It followed an absolutely booming second serve. The Canadian may have 
hired McEnroe to help him at the net during the grass-court season, but how 
many volleys he’ll actually have to hit is debatable. That serve is truly 
enormous.
 
First set: Tomic* 2-1 Raonic (*denotes server)

Another convincing hold from Tomic, who was involved in a bizarre third set 
against Gilles Müller of Luxembourg last night. Not always noted as the 
grittiest of competitors, Tomic enjoyed the novel experience of facing an 
opponent who was barely in contention for long stretches. He can expect a very 
different match today.

First set: Tomic 1-1 Raonic* (*denotes server)

It’s a case of anything you can do, as Raonic likewise makes short of his 
opening service game. Sitting at courtside, the Canadian’s coach, John McEnroe, 
looks happy. For now.
 
First set: Tomic* 1-0 Raonic (*denotes server)

Watched by Lleyton Hewitt and Nick Kyrgios, Tomicic races through his opening 
service game, sealing it to love.
 
We’re about to get underway, Tomic to serve …
 
Raonic and Tomic are limbering up, and it promises to be a fascinating match. 
The pair have played three times previously, with Raonic, the world No9 – he 
has been as high as fourth – winning all three. Tomic, of course, has a 
reputation for being a flaky competitor, but there’s no doubting his talent.
 
Stay right here for coverage of the second semi-final between Milos Raonic, 
the powerful Canadian who reached the Australian Open final at the start of the 
year, and the mercurial Ausssie Bernard Tomic. The players will be out shortly.
 
That was quite a finish. Where Murray found the energy to take the opening 
point of that final game, I really don’t know. Cilic drew him in, forced him 
back, ran him from side to side, but still couldn’t find a way through, Murray 
running down everything the Croatian could throw at him. That was pretty much 
the story of the entire match. Cilic maintained a high level throughout – and 
played superbly towards the end of the second set – but Murray was always able 
to find a response. He also showed the kind of aggression, both on serve and, 
particularly, on his forehand, that he is so often accused of lacking. A fifth 
title looks well within his sights.
 
Murray is talking to John Inverdale at courtside, poor lad. “It’s great to get 
to the final again,” he says. And the prospect of a record-breaking fifth 
title? “There have been many great players that have played here over the years 
… some of the best players of all time … if I can do better than them, that’s a 
good sign.”
 
Third set: Cilic 3-6, 6-4, 3-6 Murray* (*denotes server)

After a lung-busting opening point – of which more in a second – Murray wins 
through to the final, sealing the victory with an ace!
 
Third set: Cilic* 3-5, 6-4, 3-6 Murray (*denotes server)

“It seems that Andy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> has 
a square mouth,” writes Andrew Benton. “Contrast this left/right symmetry with 
Djokovic’s twisty face, and it’s clear that facial symmetry is a hindrance to 
grand slam victory. Andy needs to loosen up his facial muscles a bit.” I’m not 
sure if you’re right, Andrew, but – if so – I can’t see Lendl being much help. 
Not that Murray needs too much assistance here, because he’s just come within a 
whisker of winning through to yet another Queen’s final, Cilic saving a match 
point with an ace. It was great stuff from the Croatian, who was repeatedly 
pegged back to deuce but produced some lovely winners – a drop shot that kissed 
the line, two blistering forehands, and finally a winning backhand pass – to 
stay in the hunt.
 
Third set: Cilic 2-5, 6-4, 3-6 Murray* (*denotes server)

He’s still chuntering and chattering, is Murray, but that doesn’t stop him 
from flying through this service game to move within a game of the match. His 
first-serve percentage in this set is 77%, which explains why he’s lost barely 
a point on his delivery (two, if I’m not mistaken). Cilic will have to serve to 
stay in it.
