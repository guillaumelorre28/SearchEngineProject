Twenty activists including Masha Alyokhina from Pussy Riot were arrested in 
Moscow on Wednesday yesterday, after staging an all-night protest against the 
conviction of the Kremlin criticAlexei Navalny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexei-navalny> and his brother Oleg.

Several thousand anti-Putin demonstrators gathered in central Moscow on 
Tuesday after a court handed Navalny – Vladimir Putin’s most high-profile 
opponent – a suspended sentence, but jailed his brother for three-and-a-half 
years. Navalny broke a house arrest order to attend the rally and was swiftly 
detained. Riot police arrested more than 100 people.

A small group of activists including Alyokhina, and the anti-Putin blogger 
Arseny Bobrovsky,took refuge in a giant Christmas ball 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdao62XYvxQ&feature=youtu.be> on Moscow’s 
Manezh Square, directly in front of the Kremlin. Despite freezing conditions 
they spent the night inside.They held up banners 
<https://twitter.com/MashaAlekhina/status/550125979235274752> saying that they 
would “occupy the globe” until Oleg Navalny was freed.

At 8am Moscow time, the police moved in and arrested those inside

from two directions, took everyone’s documents, and then literally used their 
arms to drag us out,” Alyokhina told the news portal Mediazona.

She added: “I consider all those who came out and spent the night in the ball 
to be heroes. It was -20C.”

Bobrovsky – whose spoof Vladimir Putin account @KermlinRussia has more than 1 
million followers – sent a series of tweets from inside a police van. One showed
a view of the Kremlin through bars

know how to view power in our country correctly.” Another added:“The riot 
police tells us we’re being paid by the United States. Facepalm.”

Police took the protesters in two vans to Moscow’s Luzhniki police station. 
According to Bobrovsky, Alyokhina demanded her passport back. The officer told 
her: “Don’t worry, we’ll return it”, but failed to hand it over. Other arrested 
activists included Maria Baronova, Polina Nemerovskaya and German Petukhov. On 
Tuesday, Aloykhina and other members of Pussy Riotreleased a new video 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-IEfKLkL1w&feature=youtu.be> urging 
protesters to support the Navalny protest.

Police released Alyokhina and the other activists after holding them for three 
hours. “They said that they hadn’t arrested us [and were] just checking our 
passports, as usual,” Alyokhina told the Guardian. She added that she was 
thinking of returning to Manezh square to stage another protest. In the 
meantime the authorities have blocked access to the giant Christmas ball.

Critics say the case against the Navalny brothers was politically motivated. 
On WednesdayYesterday, Navalny was back in his Moscow flat. Five police guards 
were posted outside to stop him from leaving. Navalny tweeted that they had 
declined his offer of coffee and tea. He also noted that his popular blog may 
have been hacked.

It is unclear whether Navalny will now face a similar jail term to his brother 
 <http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2242074&2242074>after deliberately breaking 
his bail conditions. He is under house arrest following a previous conviction. 
Navalny’s supporters said that Tuesday’s verdict showed the Kremlin was 
returning to the sinister Soviet-era practice of punishing the relatives of 
those it disliked.
