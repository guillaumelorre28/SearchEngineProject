Can you tell me some light and quick pasta sauces to cook midweek?

Craig MacCormick, Colchester

As spring is here, try your favourite dried pasta with some lighter, more 
varied sauces. Blister 3-4 red peppers. Sweat finely diced banana shallots in 2 
tbsp lemon oil with a dessertspoon of fresh thyme. Season. Skin and chop the 
peppers, then add to the shallots with a glass of dry white wine. Bring to the 
boil, stir well and check the seasoning. Take off the heat and stir in 50g 
pecorino. A joy with orecchiette.

Fennel is a great match for pasta. Choose 2 firm bulbs, halve and chop. Soak a 
pinch of saffron in 1 tbsp white wine, and peel and thinly slice 4 cloves 
garlic. Saute the fennel with the garlic in a little olive oil until it starts 
to caramelise. Add the saffron liquid and 300ml double cream and bring to the 
boil. This goes well with fresh pappardelle. Add thin slices of courgette cut 
lengthways. Garnish with basil leaves and mini capers.

Mushrooms always make a great pasta sauce. Soak 25g dried porcini for a few 
hours, or overnight. Slice 250g fresh mushrooms, add to a preheated pan, cover 
and cook until juices begin to appear, then set aside. Squeeze and chop the 
porcini and add them to a pan with 1 finely diced red onion. Strain the liquid, 
then add to the covered pan. Bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, whisk in 100g 
mascarpone and a tbsp of tarragon, then check the seasoning. Serve with 
strozzapreti or linguine.

If you're cooking with fresh pasta, an Italian friend once told me it doesn't 
require sauce, merely "moisturiser".
