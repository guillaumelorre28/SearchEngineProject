A leading university in Northern Ireland has been keeping human tissue without 
informing the relatives of those involved, it emerged today.

The admission by Queen's University in Belfast that it retained samples for 
research purposes has left family members shocked and angry.

The university says it was unaware that material held belonged to those 
families who had contacted the Royal Group of Hospitals in connection with 
retained tissue.

Relatives of six-year-old Colin Bingham, killed by car thieves in 1991, were 
informed six samples of his brain had been kept.

Colin's family thought all his organs had been returned a year ago. The Royal 
Victoria hospital in Belfast had kept them following the post mortem.

His aunt, Kate Moore, insisted no permission had been sought.

"We had no idea even last year when we buried the other parts that they had 
anything. We should have been told. The Royal knew Queen's had these," she 
said, adding that several parts of Colin's brain and spinal cord had still not 
been returned.

The samples are believed to have been discovered during an audit report. The 
university said the material had been used for research purposes and to help 
with diagnosis.

A human organs inquiry was set up last year to investigate the practice, 
following revelations that organs had been held in Northern Ireland.

A university spokesman said it was difficult to comment on the issue because 
it is still informing three families about what had happened to their 
relatives' remains, but he welcomed the inquiry.
