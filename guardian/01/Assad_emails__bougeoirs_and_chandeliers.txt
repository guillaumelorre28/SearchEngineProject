Good Morning [XXXXXXXXXXXX]

Thanks for getting back to me and for sending the samples, which I have 
finally received. I would like to confirm the color of the console empilee as 
PRUNE. I would also like to add the lustre confusion No 350 to my order - 
please send me the relevant paperwork to process the request. I will be 
contacting you shortly with shipping details.

Many thanks

Dear Alia

I hope you're doing fine.

You will receive the samples of lacquer tomorrow morning (by ups).

Thank you for the deposit of 10528 Euros I received this morning (I guess the 
difference is from the incoming fees)

You order of 1 console empilee is confirmed to the workshop, it will be ready 
in January.

The two pots bubbling and the two candle sticks pistils (small and medium) are 
in stock, I will hold them for you.

Of course if the goods have to be shipped out of Europe, you won't have to pay 
for the VAT.

Do you already know the company you will use for the crating and the shipping?

Can you please confirm me the complete invoice name and address + final 
delivery address?

Feel free to ask me for any further information.

Best regards

Dear [XXXXXXXXXXXX]

I fear that I will never receive the samples from you and so I have decided to 
go ahead with the order as per your invoices in July. (I have attached them for 
reference).

I calculated the total amount for the two invoices to be Euro 35,118.60. I 
will be arranging tomorrow a payment of 30% (Euro 10,540) into your account as 
mentioned in the invoice and will send you confirmation. I would appreciate it 
if you could confirm the above and get back to me on the following:

1. How can I claim TVA as I will be shipping the items out of the EU

2. Is anything else required to confirm the order and when is the expected 
delivery time?

Looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible

Alia

I received a bank transfer during the holidays but I am not sure if it comes 
from you? If yes can you please confirm me the name of the sender?

I will send you the samples tomorrow morning (3 different dark colours)

Have a nice evening.

Dear [XXXXXXXXXXXX]

I hope you had a good weekend. For the candlestick pistil I would like to take 
one in size medium and the other in size small.

For the empilee, I accept the offer and will arrange to make payment once I 
have a final quote from you for the Pistil and Bubblings .

I am still hoping you can send me a sample for the dark wood alternative for 
the empilee? Is this possible??

I look forward to hearing from you

Alia

I hope you are well. I have not heard back from you and was a little worried. 
Is everything ok? I have not received any samples yet and was wondering if you 
had sent them.

Please get back to me when you can
