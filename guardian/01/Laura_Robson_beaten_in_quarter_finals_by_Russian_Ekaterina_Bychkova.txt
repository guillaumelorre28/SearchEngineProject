Laura Robson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/laura-robson> was unable to 
build on her impressive victory over Heather Watson as she was knocked out of 
the Aegon GB Pro-Series tournament in Barnstaple at the quarter-final stage by 
Ekaterina Bychkova.

On Wednesday the 17-year-old won the eagerly anticipated match against her 
fellow British teenager Watson, their first meeting at either junior or senior 
level, to move into the last eight.

But Russia's Bychkova proved too strong, defeating Robson 6-4, 6-4 at the 
second-tier ITF event.

The Londoner is, though, likely to move up to a career-high ranking thanks to 
her run in Devon as she closes in on a place in the top 100.

There was better news for Anne Keothavong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong>, with the British No3 
continuing her fine recent form by beating Switzerland's Stefanie Voegele 6-3, 
7-6 (7/4) to set up a semi-final meeting with the top seed, Mona Barthel.
