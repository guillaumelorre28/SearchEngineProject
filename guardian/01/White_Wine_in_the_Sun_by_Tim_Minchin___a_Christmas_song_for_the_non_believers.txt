“I really like Christmas,” sings Tim Minchin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/tim-minchin> in White Wine in the Sun. “It’s 
sentimental, I know, but I just really like it.”

Christmas. It’s a time for celebration. Being with your family. Missing your 
friends. Thinking about those less fortunate.Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> highlights difference and 
exaggerates your situation. Makes the happy feel happier, the lonely feel 
lonelier.

It’s a time for celebrating the birth of baby Jesus, a religious holiday that 
excludes most of the world, one that is tainted by consumerism and mawkish 
sentiment but still holds sway in the western world. It’s lovely, all these 
symbols of peace and Christianity and Father Christmas with his snowy white 
beard and the carols with their stirring melodies and dubious lyrics, and pop 
songs preaching unity.

But what about those of us who don’t believe? What about those of us who live 
in countries without snow? Where are our songs?

Cue Tim Minchin:

And yes, I have all of the usual objections
To consumerism, the commercialisation of an ancient religion
To the westernisation of a dead Palestinian
Press-ganged into selling PlayStations and beer
But I still really like it

An avowed atheist and scourge of religious fanatics, Australian-British 
comedian Minchin understands all this. He likes Christmas – loves having the 
opportunity to get together with his family in Perth, 9,000 miles from his home 
in north London (and latterly, LA), enjoys many of its trappings – but dislikes 
having to wrap it all up in a cosy nativity pageant bow.

The song he wrote about it, White Wine in the Sun, dedicated to his young 
daughter Violet, resonates strongly with many Australians because it rings so 
true. All the lines about jetlag, disorientation, isolation and distrust of 
institutionalised religion. We know what it feels like. We’ve been there.

There’s little artifice here, just universal emotion laid bare. Minchin 
acknowledges the contradictions inherent in celebrating a festival he doesn’t 
believe in, and moves on. He turns it into a positive.

And you, my baby girl
My jetlagged infant daughter
You’ll be handed round the room
Like a puppy at a primary school
And you won’t understand
But you will learn someday
That wherever you are and whatever you face
These are the people who’ll make you feel safe in this world
My sweet blue-eyed girl

Beautiful sentiments that no one could take issue with, you might think. 

You’d be wrong. 

In 2010, when a Kate Miller-Heidke cover of White Wine in the Sun 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLp2DfsW5Cw> was used on a CD of songs 
designed to raise money for the Salvation Army’s charity work in Australia, it 
immediately ran into trouble. The Family Council of Victoriaasked if it was 
someone’s idea of a sick joke 
<http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2010/11/28/12252/christians_slam_minchin_for_aiding_charity>
, and the Salvation Army spoke up against it, saying “We do not in any way 
support the statements made in this song.”

To which Minchin responded: 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/nov/28/tim-minchin-comedian> “Christmas 
means much to billions of people who don’t believe in Jesus, and if you think 
that Christmas without Jesus is not Christmas, then you’re out of touch, and if 
you think altruism without Jesus is not altruism, then you’re a dick.”

(Proceeds from sales of the song during November, December and January now go 
to theNational Autistic Society 
<http://www.timminchin.com/2014/11/04/white-wine-in-the-sun-reminder-proceeds-from-november-to-january-sales-go-to-the-nas/>
.)

Australian pop singers have a bit of a tradition of going against the grain 
when it comes to Christmas songs. Maybe it’s the lack of snow. For every 
traditional chestnuts-roasting, season-affirming ode like the Seekers’ lovely 
festive reworking ofMorningtown Ride 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grVrFEd-4YM>, there’s an earthy Santa Never 
Made it into Darwin <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJi_kBIiZ4A> – country 
singers Bill & Boyd’s response to thegreat cyclone of Christmas Eve, 1974 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Tracy>.

Or there’s Paul Kelly’s sobering How to Make Gravy 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb4YWJgfmQE>, the song’s falteringly upbeat 
narrative told from behind state bars. In its realistic sentimentalism, the 
song is reminiscent of Tom Waits’s beautifulChristmas Card from a Hooker in 
Minneapolis <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxVo5mjK4eg>. 

And there’s the bittersweet taste of the Triffids’ elegiac Save What You Can 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUQyDfg8rfE>, made all the more poignant by 
singer David McComb’s untimely death in 1999. A meditation on the inevitability 
of death, the song begins with the line “It doesn’t look much like we’ll see 
the New Year”.

Hopefully, that won’t be the case for too many of you out there, cyclones and 
religious fanatics notwithstanding. Instead, may Minchin’s sweet and simple 
chorus summarise your holiday season:

I’ll be seeing my dad
My brothers and sisters, my gran and my mum
They’ll be drinking white wine in the sun
