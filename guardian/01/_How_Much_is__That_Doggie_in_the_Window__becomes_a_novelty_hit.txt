Lita Roza became the first British woman to have a No 1 hit in the UK with her 
version of Bob Merrill's song, already a hit in the US for Patti Page. The song 
had been so popular in the US that registrations for the American Kennel Club 
jumped 8% in its wake. It might not have been the first ever novelty song, but 
it was one of the biggest of all time â€“ paving the way for staples such as The 
Birdie Song.
