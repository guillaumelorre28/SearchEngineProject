It was the second successive Eredivisie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/eredivisie> title for Phillip Cocu’s PSV 
and the 23rd in the Eindhoven club’s history.

Ajax <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ajax> went into the final day of 
the season ahead of PSV on goal difference and only needed to beat De 
Graafschap to seal their 34th Dutch league title.

Amin Younes gave Ajax the lead in the 16th minute, but Bryan Smeets levelled 
the scores 10 minutes after the break and Ajax could not break through for a 
winning goal in the remainder of the second half.

In Zwolle, Jürgen Locadia opened the scoring and PSV’s captain, Luuk de Jong, 
scored twice.
