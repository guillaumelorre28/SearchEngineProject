Great Britain were condemned to losing their Fed Cup World Group Two play-off 
against Sweden in Boras after a creditable singles debut forLaura Robson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/laura-robson> ended in defeat to Sofia 
Arvidsson.

The teenager acquitted herself better than her senior partners, Elena Baltacha 
andAnne Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong>, on 
Saturday, when the pair suffered respective straight-sets defeats to Johanna 
Larsson and Arvidsson.

Robson was beaten 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 on Sunday as Arvidsson wrapped up Sweden's 
promotion to World Group Two.

A similarly emphatic result to Saturday appeared on the cards when Arvidsson 
roared into a 4-0 first-set lead. Robson battled back to extend the set but 
could not force a tie-break. She took her momentum into the second set, though, 
powering to a 6-1 win to force a decider.

The Swede, No54 in the world rankings, broke to lead 4-2 in the final set. 
Robson dug deep to save eight match points before Arvidsson finally wrapped up 
victory.

Robson said: "I'm pretty upset but my team-mates are proud of me. Maybe in a 
few days I'll think it was a pretty good effort, but right now I'm devastated.

"In Fed Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/fed-cup> you're not just 
playing for yourself, you're playing for your country, and all the emotion that 
built up on court just came through."

Arvidsson said: "I played a really great match; I had to play really well to 
beat her. She played well and it was a fun match."

The result means Britain will play in Europe/Africa Zone Group One next year.
