The New European <http://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/home> has landed something 
of a scoop in its second week of existence. It carries an article by Alastair 
Campbell calling for another EU referendum.

Written in the form of a memo to Theresa May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay>, it draws on Campbell’s 
experience in No 10 as Tony Blair’s director of communications.

After acknowledging that the new prime minister has a tough job, he writes:

“I note you have said ‘Brexit means Brexit.’ I note too that you think the 
fixed term parliament act means you can govern without a specific mandate from 
the people until 2020...

I do not see how the politics of the situation will allow you to cruise to 
2020 while negotiating the most important decisions in modern UK history with a 
mandate as PM that came, not from the people, but from Tory MPs.”

He contends that May “will quickly see” that Brexit “as it was sold by the 
Johnsons and Farages will be impossible without enormous economic damage.” He 
continues:

“If you conclude that Brexit means there is no realistic way of staying inside 
the single market, which you decide is a fundamental part of our economic 
future, then you should say so and fight for us to stay in that single market.”

And how should she do that? Campbell writes: “Do not trigger article 50 
quickly... Instead go into discussions with fellow EU leaders.”

But, he says, she should enter those negotiations without her foreign 
secretary, Boris Johnson, “whose appointment has gone down like a global dose 
of the Zika virus.”

He advises May to tell her EU counterparts that although the British people 
voted to leave the EU, “you would like to explore the possible terms on which 
we might stay, including another look at immigration.”

And she should also discuss “other issues”, such as “CAP reform, and 
completion of the single market, in areas like energy and digital services.”

Having done so, writes Campbell, May should put to the British public “the 
terms on which we leave. And the terms on which we could remain. A real choice 
of real options.”

The public could then be consulted about such options in “a new referendum on 
a new question” followed by a new general election.

He concludes: “I don’t know you well. But I do at least get the sense you 
won’t be driven by the mania of the modern media but by cold-headed analysis of 
the options.

“Options are what the country needs right now. A leader who sets them out, and 
leads a debate that rises above the awful level of the one we have just had, 
would be doing the country and the world a massive service, showing leadership 
and winning respect, mine included.”

It is doubtful if the call, also repeated on Campbell’s blog 
<http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2016/07/14/memo-to-pm-may-not-a-second-referendum-but-a-first-referendum-on-a-proper-choice-of-options-after-real-debate/>
, will raise more than a eyebrow in No 10. But remainers, the constituency The 
New European aims to reach, may take heart from his positive contribution to 
the debate.

And the scoop is something of a fillip for the paper’s editor, Matt Kelly, and 
its publisher,Archant <https://www.theguardian.com/media/archant>.
