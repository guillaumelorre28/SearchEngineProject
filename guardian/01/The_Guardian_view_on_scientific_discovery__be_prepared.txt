The discovery that there are bacteria in mucus in the human nose

 that secrete an antibiotic that kills other, more dangerous, forms of
Staphylococcus before they can kill us, illustrates some important truths of 
science. The first is that properly trained minds can make the study of almost 
anything, however unlikely, rewarding. Microbiota turn out to be a playground 
for the enquiring mind. If the new substance is proved to work in humansas it 
does in mice 
<http://www.nature.com/news/the-nose-knows-how-to-kill-mrsa-1.20339>, it may 
save thousands of lives a year from MRSA infections. The second is that, from 
the discovery of antibiotics to the methods of gene sequencing andnow gene 
editing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/09/guardian-view-genetic-engineering-crispr-cas>
, modern medicine often depends on co-opting to our purposes tricks that nature 
has already found. The human ingenuity consists in recognising the prior 
ingenuity of evolution. Science has often appeared to depend on chance, 
although what looks like chance may be more to do with the scientific mind. The 
attention to detail that makes the unexpected plain to see, and, once it’s 
identified, the capacity to ask questions about it, are often the essence of 
discovery.
