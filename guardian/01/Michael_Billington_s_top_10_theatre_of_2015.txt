1. Hangmen
Royal Court, London

Martin McDonagh’s play, his first in London in over a decade, haunts me still. 
Its ostensible theme was the aftermath of the abolition of hanging in 1965. But 
behind that lay a whole series of questions. How do professional executioners 
overcome the instinct to kill? How can any civilised state sanction a system 
that allows no scope for the correction of injustice? Does violence, even when 
approved by law, breed more violence? But the great thing about McDonagh’s play 
was that the issues emerged only through a riveting story and a deluge of black 
humour.

It was fascinating to see the retired hangman, beautifully played by David 
Morrissey <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/david-morrissey>, being treated as 
a local celebrity by the sycophantic barflies in his Oldham pub. And when 
Johnny Flynn turned up in the pub as a brash young Cockney intruder, we were 
never quite sure whether he was an agent of retribution, an act of homage to 
the menacing piss-takers in Pinter’s The Homecoming and Orton’s Entertaining Mr 
Sloane or simply an innocent abroad.

Everything about the play felt right, from Bronwyn James’s performance as the 
publican’s shy daughter to Anna Fleischle’s smoky fug of a set, Kate Waters’ 
terrifying fights and Matthew Dunster’s needle-sharp production. Most 
reassuring of all was to be reminded that McDonagh’s early work, including The 
Beauty Queen of Leenane and The Cripple of Inishmaan, was no flash in the pan. 
He has a gift for suspenseful storytelling, rich dialogue and dark laughter 
that allows him to handle big themes in an entertaining way. Which is why this 
was the best new play of 2015.Read the full review

Helen Gardner points out in The Business of Criticism (1959) that no work of 
art is autonomous but has “an historical relation to the author’s other works”. 
You could hardly have more dazzling proof than in this brilliant triptych of 
Chekhov’s Platonov (1880), Ivanov (1887) and The Seagull (1896). In the course 
of a single day, it was possible to see Chekhov experimenting with farce and 
melodrama before achieving his own peculiar brand of symphonic realism in The 
Seagull. David Hare’s texts were fresh and funny; Jonathan Kent’s productions 
were visually immaculate and handsomely acted. I shall not quickly forget 
Olivia Vinall’s portrayal of three different women destroyed by love or the 
instinctive self-absorption of Anna Chancellor’s Arkadina, glancing at her 
watch while tending her suicidal son.Read the full review

This was another triumph for Chichester, where it first appeared last year, 
and for Jonathan Kent as director. I make no apology for citing it again, since 
it got even better when played in a proscenium theatre with scope for a pit 
band (superbly conducted by Nicholas Skilbeck). But the real revelation was 
Imelda Staunton as Mamma Rose. She took a role associated with musical titans 
like Ethel Merman and Angela Lansbury and played her as a bustling little 
woman, not without charm and warmth, who sought vicarious fame through her 
daughters. Staunton’s Mamma secretly craved stardom but knew deep down that “if 
I could have been, I would have been.” A great piece of acting in a great show 
that, happily, will be shown on BBC TV this Christmas. Don’t miss it.Read the

I was a bit of a Johnny-come-lately to Florian Zeller’s play since I’d missed 
it at Bath’s Ustinov and London’s Tricycle but I was as impressed as everyone 
else. Zeller taps into a common fear, that of losing one’s mind to Alzheimer’s, 
but rescues it from easy pathos. The fascinating thing about Kenneth Cranham’s 
Andre – the high point of a distinguished acting career – was not that he was 
some generalised everyman but an ex-engineer still clinging to the vestiges of 
an authority he was no longer capable of executing. He was testy, awkward, 
cantankerous but also dependent, vulnerable and confused. We could all 
understand that and Christopher Hampton’s translation, like James Macdonald’s 
production, was a model of precision about mental slippage.Read the full review

 Maxine Peake in The Skriker by Caryl Churchill. Photograph: Tristram Kenton 
for the Guardian 
First time round, in 1994, Caryl Churchill’s play had me baffled. Now I felt I 
had got a handle on it thanks to Sarah Frankcom’s richly environmental 
production and Maxine Peake’s magnetic central performance. Peake played a 
skriker – or ancient, shape-shifting fairy – who craves to be part of the human 
cycle while haunting two young girls. What emerged unforgettably was 
Churchill’s appalled horror at climate change and the eroding of our assumption 
that we could always rely on nature and the fact that “spring will return even 
if it’s without me.” I still hear the cadence in Peake’s voice as she said 
those terrifying words in a play that, like so many of Churchill’s, was way 
ahead of its time.Read the full review

Another play that stays with me, after nearly a year. Daniel Kitson made his 
mark as a cult theatrical storyteller. Here, he came up with something that was 
definably a play in that it had characters, a plot and a surprise twist. Kitson 
was a man living in a tree, like a suburban Tarzan, as a form a of protest 
against the council’s policy of pollarding, while down below Tim Key was a daft 
git waiting for a date with a girl who, after a 10-year gap, had identified him 
as “you pillock”. I loved the piece for its oddity, humour and gift for 
language, as when Kitson complained of “an insurmountable pestilence of 
squirrels”.Read the full review

Tom Morton-Smith’s play came as a bolt from the blue: a big, panoramic piece 
about Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, leader of America’s 
Manhattan project and tragic hero haunted by the implication of his 
discoveries. “I feel,” he says, “like I’ve dropped a loaded gun in a 
playground”. What was strongly conveyed, however, by Morton-Smith’s play, Angus 
Jackson’s production and John Heffernan’s compelling central performance was 
the excitement of working on the initial atomic experiments in wartime 
Berkeley. A fine addition to the growing catalogue of scientific drama.Read the

Shaw is always being rediscovered. What was stimulating was to sit with a 
National audience and feel them delighting in Shaw’s musicality, wit and 
dancing ideas. Even the most devoted Shavian usually finds the long Don Juan in 
Hell sequence hard going. That too was a pleasure here thanks to some sensible 
cutting and nifty staging by Simon Godwin and a choice performance from Tim 
McMullan as a suavely ironic, drinks-dispensing Devil. The central sex-comedy 
was also in good hands with Ralph Fiennes exuding impotent despair in the face 
of Indira Varma’s sumptuous charisma.Read the full review

A terrific revival by Howard Davies of a little-known Somerset Maugham play 
from 1932 that cast a bilious eye on the ruinous legacy of the first world war 
and our creation of a society unfit for heroes. It all takes place in the home 
of a Kentish country solicitor whose son is a sightless, embittered wreck and 
whose daughters are despairing, damaged casualties of the late conflict. 
Outside Chekhov, there wasn’t much better ensemble acting to be seen all year, 
especially from Justine Mitchell, Jo Herbert and Yolanda Kettle as the three 
shattered sisters.Read the full review

Robert Icke’s bold rewrite of Aeschylus’s great trilogy had its duff moments 
(why on earth was Orestes reliving his past actions to a therapist?), but it 
began and ended superbly. Lia Williams was all rage and power as a Klytemnestra 
horrified by the decision of Angus Wright’s anguished Agamemnon to sacrifice 
their daughter to prosecute a war. The climax with Orestes judicially absolved 
of matricide but morally guilty was equally memorable. Tension occasionally 
sagged over three hours 40 minutes but, in a year packed with Greek tragedy, 
this was the most adventurous of all raids on the Attic.Read the full review
