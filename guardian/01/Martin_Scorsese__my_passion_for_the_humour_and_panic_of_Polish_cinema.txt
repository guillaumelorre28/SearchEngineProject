As for many other people, my introduction to Polish cinema came with Andrzej 
Wajda <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/02/1>’s trilogy: Ashes and 
Diamonds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/may/06/derekmalcolmscenturyoffilm.derekmalcolm>
, Kanal and A Generation – actually, they were released out of order here in 
the US, and we saw Kanal first, followed quickly by Ashes, both in 1961, and 
then we got to see A Generation later. Among the three, it was Ashes and 
Diamonds that had the greatest impact on me. It announced the arrival of a 
master film-maker. It was one of the last pictures that gave us a real 
testament of the impact of the war, onWajda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/11/man-of-marble-andrzej-wajda-philip-french-classic-dvd>
 and on his nation. It introduced us to a whole school of film-making, related 
to what was coming out of the Soviet Union but quite distinct. And it gave us

, a great actor and a new generational icon.

But all Wajda’s films made an impression on me. Whenever I had the opportunity 
to see one I was impressed by his mastery. I also lovedJerzy Kawalerowicz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/08/obituaries.news>’s films: Night 
Train, Mother Joan of the Angels and in particular Pharaoh, which had a fresh 
approach to the historical picture.Wojciec Has 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/05/guardianobituaries.filmnews>’s 
films,The Hourglass Sanatorium <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QqwhdNDu9E> 
and laterThe Saragossa Manuscript <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41ZknpulXwk>
, really astonished me.Andrzej Munk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/18/polish-cinema-classics-dvd-philip-french>
 I caught up with a little later, plus, of course,Jerzy Skolimowski 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/24/jerzy-skolimowski-david-thomson> 
andRoman Polanski’s <https://www.theguardian.com/film/romanpolanski> early 
pictures. The 50s and 60s were a great time in Polish cinema. A great time in 
cinema, period.

With Polish cinema <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awul3lNlh3Y>, what I 
especially respond to is the mixture of passion, meticulous craftsmanship, 
dynamic deep focal-length compositions, moral dilemmas and religious conflicts, 
often done with a very sharp sense of humour. Humour and tragedy are very close 
in Polish cinema.

Plus, the struggle against official censorship and government clampdowns gives 
Polish cinema that was made during the communist era a heightened urgency. You 
can feel it in the rhythm, the intensity, even in pictures that have no obvious 
political subject matter. Or, in pictures that take the then-contemporary 
political situation and transpose it to an earlier period. For instance,Danton 
by Wajda <https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/dec/03/tvandradio.telecoms>, 
which he made in France during theSolidarity period in the early 1980s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/13/poland-union-solidarity>
. There’s a restlessness, an unease, a desperation, an existential panic.

Many Polish film-makers spent some time in exile. Polanski left very early. 
Skolimowski has gone back and forth during the years. They adapted very well to 
the circumstances, wherever they went. But such a condition goes way beyond 
Polish cinema. What would the history of American cinema have been without the 
flood of directors from Europe in the 1920s through the 40s?Fritz Lang

, and on and on and on. Obviously, exile creates a very different perspective 
on the country in which you end up making films. Take Polanski’sChinatown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/aug/22/my-favourite-city-film-is-chinatown>
. It’s impossible to imagine an American-born director making that picture. You 
can imagine a version of it, but not the finished film we know as Chinatown.

by Bronislaw Zelek. Photograph: BFI 
This unique perspective stretches even to the movie posters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2015/jan/30/polish-film-posters-bfi-special-collection-in-pictures>
. I own quite a few myself. They can seem odd to non-Polish viewers. Sometimes 
you look at them and wonder: what bearing does this image have on this picture? 
And then you see that there’s a rare place for cinema in the culture itself, 
because the relationship between the films and their posters is so unique. Most 
often, they capture the concept of the film itself.
