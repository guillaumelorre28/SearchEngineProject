It's an intermittent, and probably fair, complaint that this blog can get a 
bit negative. I'm hoping to counter that, through a roundabout and slightly 
contradictory method, with a backhanded celebration of the fact that the UK 
isn't always such a bad place to be a cyclist – that is to say, there are 
plenty worse.

A recent trip took me to two cities which, in their own ways, have 
significantly more limited cycling cultures. They fall into two distinct camps, 
so I'll treat them separately. I'd be very happy to hear your views on both 
places, or other towns and cities where the cyclist faces a (metaphorical) 
uphill struggle.

• Cities where cycling will seemingly never thrive. Example: Hong Kong

I lived and worked in Hong Kong for just under 18 months and cycled less than 
at any other time since I resumed the pursuit in my early 20s. I occasionally 
trundled around the minor,car-free island where I lived 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamma_Island>, but as for commuting, or even 
riding at all around Hong Kong island (the main business and residential area) 
– forget it.

I was reminded of this a few weeks back when stopping over in Hong Kong for 24 
hours. It's one of the very few cities where, in the centre, you barely see any 
riders at all. There's several perfectly good reasons, not least that for more 
than six months of the year the climate is so hot and steamingly humid that 
even walking more than a few hundred metres raises a fair old sweat. Plus, it's 
pretty hilly.

But even if you were tempted – and winter-time temperatures of around 15C or 
so can be ideal – you're taking your life into your hands. I'd forgotten till 
my return how dominated by cars the roads are. The centre is bisected by 
multi-lane highways filled with Hong Kong'spillar box red 1980s-vintage Toyota 
taxis 
<http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://images.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/02/hongkong-taxi.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/tag/taxis/&h=280&w=420&sz=57&tbnid=4MWodA4Q3f6aXM:&tbnh=90&tbnw=135&zoom=1&docid=I7_9FILZWA4FfM&sa=X&ei=AUdvT-mHF4eX8QPeiZW_DQ&ved=0CGgQ9QEwAw&dur=166>
 and homicidally-driven minibuses, generally speeding at a good 50mph. Even on 
foot the only way to get about is to quickly memorise the network of pedestrian 
overpasses.

Hong Kong might never be Amsterdam but it could certainly do with a bit of a 
transport rebalance, not least to alleviate itsnotorious air pollution

So, two questions: can a city like Hong Kong realistically become any more 
bike friendly? And is their a worse city for cyclists? I'm only talking about 
the centre of Hong Kong island and Kowloon, by the way. Cycling on theoutlying 
islands <http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/attractions/outlying.html> or New 
Territories <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Territories> can be a different 
prospect.

• Cities where cycling should be more popular than it is. Example: Auckland

Yes, it's hilly in places and, once you reach the suburbs, very spread out, 
but Auckland really should be awash with cyclists. It has suitably temperate 
weather and that same spread out-ness leaves plenty of potential space for bike 
lanes.

But wander, with the eye of a regular cyclist, around the city centre, and 
you're almost immediately struck by the lack of bikes on the road. Outside peak 
times they're almost non-existent, barring the occasional cycle courier. Those 
you do see generally sport the Lycra garb and haunted expression of the cycling 
enthusiast in a bike-unfriendly environment.

The city is trying to boost numbers and, according to the most recent annual 
cycling survey 
<http://www.aucklandtransport.govt.nz/about-us/News/LatestNews/Pages/Infrastructure-Attracts-More-Cyclists.aspx>
, with some success, with 30% more riders on the roads than five years ago. But 
the numbers remain fairly small – just under 13,500 "cycling movements" 
observed on one day at 82 monitoring sites. It's not helped by a compulsory 
helmet law, in place since the mid-1990s.

I was aghast to learn that the city's harbour bridge, the main link between 
the centre and suburbs to the north, has no way at all for cyclists to cross. 
They must either plonk their bike on a ferry or take a fairly long detour. As 
an emblem for a city dominated by cars and roads it's hard to beat.

Like with Hong Kong, it's not as if Auckland couldn't do with more cyclists. 
New Zealand mightmore or less define itself through sport 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/oct/23/rugby-world-cup-richie-mccaw-new-zealand-france>
 but it's simultaneouslyone of the more obese nations on earth 
<http://www.nzherald.co.nz/obesity/news/article.cfm?c_id=271&objectid=10752121>.

My questions here: are things really as bad as they seem in Auckland? What 
other cities should be better than they are on this front? And what can be done?
