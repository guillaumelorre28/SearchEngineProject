This light, zesty palate cleanser is an all-round favourite. Whip it up in 15 
minutes, then just bung it in the fridge for a couple of hours until you need 
it. Substitute the rich figs for roasted plums if you prefer.

Serves 6

For the base
40g lemon juice
70g sugar
Zest of 2 lemons
1 large egg

For the mousse
3 leaves of gelatine
40g lemon juice
3 egg whites
40g sugar
120g low-fat cream cheese
1 tbsp creme fraiche light
2 tbsp honey
6 figs

1. Mix all the ingredients for the base in a heatproof bowl. Make a bain marie 
by sitting the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and heating the mix for 
a few minutes until it starts to thicken. Put it in the freezer as you prepare 
the rest of the ingredients.

2. Rehydrate the leaves of gelatine in very cold water, following the 
instructions on the packet.

3. When the gelatine is ready, gently warm up the lemon juice in a saucepan 
and dissolve the gelatine in it, then remove from the heat.

4. Make a Swiss meringue by mixing the egg whites and sugar in a heatproof 
bowl and sitting the bowl over a saucepan of hot water to form a bain marie. 
Simmer for a couple of minutes until warm to the touch, then remove from the 
heat and work with a whisk until cool.

5. Stir the cream cheese and creme fraiche in a mixing bowl until smooth. Mix 
in the posset base from the freezer, then add the lemon juice and gelatine and 
stir well, and lastly, fold in the Swiss meringue. Spoon into ramekins or glass 
dishes and leave to set in the fridge for 2-3 hours.

6. When it's time to serve, put the honey into a pan, throw in the figs 
and toss them over a low heat for a couple of minutes until evenly coated. 
Cut the figs in half and place a couple on top of each mousse.
