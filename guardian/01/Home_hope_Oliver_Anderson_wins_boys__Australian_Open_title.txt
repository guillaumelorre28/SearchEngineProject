Anderson made a flying start but, in the second set, was troubled by a leg 
injury with Karimov taking advantage.

After being treated by a trainer, Anderson looked in better shape in the 
third, with Karimov’s inconsistency finally bringing him undone.

Tomic won the boys’ title in 2008 and Luke Saville in 2012, while Kyrgios beat 
another local rising star Thanasi Kokkinakis in the final in 2013.

Sydney’s De Minaur, 16, was eliminated in the singles semi-finals on Friday by 
Karimov but rebounded to team with 17-year-old Queenslander Ellis.

The pair came from behind to upset eighth seeds Lukas Klein of Slovakia and 
Czech Patrik Rikl 3-6, 7-5, 12-10.

It also continued Australia’s recent hold on the boys’ doubles at the Open, 
represented in the winning pair in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

In the junior girls’ singles, Vera Lapko followed in the footsteps of Victoria 
Azarenko as the only other Belarusian to win the title.

Lapko overcame defending champion Tereza Mihalikova from Slovakia in the 
girls’ final 6-3, 6-4.

She trailed 1-4 in the second set but managed to claw her way back to overcome 
the second seed.
