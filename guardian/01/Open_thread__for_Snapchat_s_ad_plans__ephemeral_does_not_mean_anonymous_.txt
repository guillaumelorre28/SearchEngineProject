There are a number of social apps promising anonymity or ephemerality – the 
latter meaning self-destructing content, from messages to photos – yet also 
offering their services for free.

When the time comes to make money from advertising, that presents a problem. 
Today’s long read comes from Brett Goldstein on Medium, with hisSnapchat Night 
Vision: Ephemeral Does Not Mean Anonymous 
<https://medium.com/@bg/snapchat-night-vision-ephemeral-does-not-mean-anonymous-7513617e56a4>
 article.

With Snapchat <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/snapchat> kicking off 
its advertising program recently, Goldstein poses the question of how it could 
make more money by targeting ads to specific groups of users “if the content 
necessary to segment users in the first place is deleted”. His conclusion: it’s 
easier than you might think.

The most valuable information is actually the content you generate, not a 
stream of longitude and latitude measures. To capture the information stored in 
your snaps, Snapchat could run each snap you send through a gauntlet of 
metadata extractors in the minutes and hours before it is deleted.

Yes. You read that correctly: Snapchat can analyze the crap out of your 
pictures before they delete them. In fact, Snapchat might already be doing this.

Obligatory caveat: it might not. But the potential for analysing text and 
speech, background sound, faces and other image elements is clear. Is this 
something we should be thinking harder about for a whole range of apps, not 
just Snapchat?
