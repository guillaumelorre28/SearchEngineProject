Mixed Up Nursery Rhymes

 Mixed Up Nursery Rhymes 
Sending Jack and Jill up the hill to fetch a spider or allowing the Queen 
of Hearts to find a crooked sixpence instead of her tarts makes for engagingly 
good fun. With every page divided into three strips there are variations enough 
for plenty of delightfully silly combinations. If you want to keep things 
simple, you can stick to the original versions – but you'd be a bit of a 
spoilsport. (0+)

Picnic

by John Burningham (Jonathan Cape, £11.99)
 Picnic by John Burningham 
There's a measured simplicity to this spare story recalling the delight of a 
summer picnic. Together with their friends – a pig, a sheep and a duck – a boy 
and a girl set off with a well-packed basket. Once they have seen off the 
threat of a bull, things mostly go well; there's a delightful moment when the 
duck quizzically searches for the scarf he has lost in the reeds. After the 
picnic, everyone plays happily before trudging home, tired, to bed. In its 
storyline and illustrations,Picnic is a delicate echo of Burningham's much‑loved
Mr Gumpy's Outing. (0+)

 Just Imagine by Nick Sharratt and Pippa Goodhart 
A busy picture book offering endless opportunities to wonder at all the things 
you might be or do. Imagine being small – small enough to slip down the 
plughole, swim in a teacup or ride a mouse bareback. Or imagine having magic 
powers, or being able to travel through time to find out what living with 
dinosaurs might be like. All the options come vividly to life in a book to 
revisit time and again. (3+)

One Night Far From Here

by Julia Wauters (Flying Eye Books, £15.99)
 One Night Far From Here by Julia Wauters 
As night turns into day across the globe, the local wildlife wakes up or falls 
asleep according to its habits. In the African savannah, as bats fly to their 
rest, giraffes, elephants and zebra are astir; in the Russian taiga, a snowy 
owl returns from hunting and wolves and moose begin their morning prowl; in the 
Amazon rainforest the early morning brings out a spider monkey, a sloth and a 
tapir. The time changes are shown by acetate pages that transpose images of 
night on to illustrations of the daytime creatures. The whole is a revealing 
worldwide bestiary that introduces animals in their habitats. (6+)

 Persephone by by Sally Pomme Clayton 
Sally Pomme Clayton captures all the pathos of this story in her lyrical 
retelling. Beautiful Persephone, cruelly snatched from everything she knows and 
loves by Hades, the dark-hearted King of the Underworld, pines in his cheerless 
kingdom and ignores all food but the tempting pomegranate. Above ground, her 
mother the goddess Demeter curses the earth, making it barren. When the gods 
intervene, Persephone and her mother are reunited – except for three wintry 
months each year, when Persephone must return to Hades as payback for the 
pomegranate seeds she ate. Virginia Lee's vivid illustrations add great power 
to this story of warfare between the gods. (6+)

The Killer Cat Runs Away

by Anne Fine, illustrated by Thomas Docherty (Doubleday, £10.99)
 The Killer Cat Runs Away by Anne Fine 
Tuffy the Killer Cat is back in a terrifically sharp-clawed story. Frequently 
cursed for his acts of terrorism, Tuffy has recently added new misdemeanours – 
spitting at next door's baby, knocking over the TV – to his list of crimes. 
Hardly his fault in either case, he'd argue. But he's had enough of the 
tellings off and he's running away to find a better home. Then his family will 
be sorry – or will they? Tuffy's view of the world is distinctly feline and 
very funny. (7+)

by Matt Whyman (Hot Key Books, £6.99)
 The Savages by Matt Whyman 
Like most girls, Angelica is worried about whether her parents will approve of 
her new boyfriend. And well she might be: although everything about the Savages 
suggests that they're a normal family – two loving parents, two children, a 
spotless house in a nice neighbourhood – they are hiding a terrifying secret. 
When Angelica announces that her new boyfriend is a vegetarian, she knows how 
much trouble she will cause. A dark‑hearted comedy of family life. (12+)
