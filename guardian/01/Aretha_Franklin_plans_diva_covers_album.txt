Aretha Franklin <https://www.theguardian.com/music/aretha-franklin> may cover 
Bootylicious on a new covers album. The singer is apparently mulling Destiny's 
Child's track for a collection of songs recorded by other famous divas.

"It's a concept CD," Franklin recently told Billboard 
<http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5847727/aretha-franklin-covers-album-2014-babyface-don-was-clive-davis>
. "They're records that, musically, I respected and that I liked a lot and that 
I would love to have one go-'round with ... [They were all] things that were 
very, very good and certainly chart-worthy and sold a lot of records."

Franklin already has her shortlist of 10 tracks, which include Barbra 
Streisand's People <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPlQ6EtArSc> and Donna 
Summer's 1978disco hit Last Dance <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG07rYStCjw>. 
She said she was also "thinking of" laying down a version of Bootylicious. The 
71-year-old will begin recording vocals on New Year's Day, working with a 
superstar production team: Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds, Don Was, and executive 
producer Clive Davis.

The last few years have had lots of ups and downs for Franklin: her first 
album inalmost a decade 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/27/aretha-franklin-first-album-eight-years>
, a broken-offwedding engagement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/23/aretha-franklin-calls-off-marriage>
, a bid to become a judgeon American Idol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/16/aretha-franklin-judge-american-idol>
, and a battle with an unspecified medical problem. Although the singer has 
denied reports that she has orhad pancreatic cancer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/09/aretha-franklin-pancreatic-cancer-rumours>
, she was forced to cancel several concerts and even in August, after what she 
called a "miraculous" recovery, Franklin described herself as atonly "85 
percent" 
<http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/08/21/aretha-franklin-says-shes-85-percent-healed/2680287/>
. "The side effects were rough," she said in October.

But this past week, Franklin said she was "feeling well and ready to go". She 
returned to the stage on Saturday night, for a hometownshow in Detroit 
<http://www.theoaklandpress.com/arts-and-entertainment/20131222/aretha-returns-with-a-powerful-healthy-performance-in-detroit>
, and will perform 17 and 18 January in New York City.
