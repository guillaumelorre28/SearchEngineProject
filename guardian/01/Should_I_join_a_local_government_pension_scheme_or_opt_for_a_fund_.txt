Q I am 39-years-old and about to begin a new job. As part of the package I 
have been offered a chance to join the local government pension scheme. Thus 
far I have no pension arrangements, although my wife has. Our plan was to put 
some of my savings into a fund that would enable us to climb the property 
ladder, but we are becoming increasingly aware that this idea may not be as 
strong as it once was.

I have recently cleared most of my debts apart from my student loan (£5,000) 
and mortgage (£80,000). While I would like to make as much money available as 
possible for the future, we have three children and my wife will be on 
maternity leave for a further six months, so it is difficult to save a 
significant amount, ie 20%-25% of my salary. Is it worth me starting a pension 
or should we stick with the first plan?

If you think I should begin a scheme now, which option should I go for? Local 
government pension scheme, appropriate personal pension scheme, state second 
scheme, or a stakeholder pension?

A The person you really need to talk to about this state of affairs is not me 
but anindependent financial advisor <http://www.unbiased.co.uk/gu/>. This is a 
very important decision, not least because of the current property market, and 
I am worried by the way you are approaching it.

Stop second-guessing the decision, put your hand in your wallet and pay for 
the advice you so desperately need. As a percentage of your funds over the next 
25 years, any cost will be so tiny as to be negligible.
