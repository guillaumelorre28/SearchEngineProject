Independent editor Amol Rajan has said he regrets not doing more to counter 
suggestions thatthe paper’s election leader backing the coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/04/independent-conservative-liberal-democrat-coalition-cameron-clegg>
 was voicing support for the Conservatives.


The leader provoked surprise and outrage from the traditionally left-leaning 
newspaper’s readers and journalists, but Rajan remained silent on social media 
in the hours after first tweeting the article.


Rajan told a Media Society and London Press Club event in London that Tory 
advisers told him they would spin the paper’s stance as backing for the
Conservatives <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives>.

“I was culpable for that interpretation, I didn’t react quickly enough,” he 
said. “The Tories got in touch to say they were going to spin that. I should 
have been much more on the front foot.

“I learnt some really interesting experiences in that 24 hours. One is that 
subtlety does not cut through on Twitter. Actually the party we were closest to 
was the Liberal Democrats. It was much less Conservative.”
 The Independent’s editorial supporting the Tory-Lib Dem coalition 
Rajan has repeatedly denied that the decision to back the coalition was driven 
by Independent owners Alexander Lebedev and son Evgeny, the billionaire Russian 
oligarchs who also own the Evening Standard and local TV station London Live.

He said that while it would be naive to think that Evgeny Lebedev 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/evgeny-lebedev>, who acts as publisher, did 
not take an interest in what was published, he did not tell his editors what to 
do.


He said: “I speak to Evgeny most days. We talk about everything that’s going 
on this company. We talk about forthcoming campaigns, events ... we talk about 
editorial policy. Of course I speak to Evgeny about what’s in the paper.”

Rajan also defended the Independent’s decision to print the more harrowing of 
two pictures of Alan Kurdi, the Kurdish refugee who drowned in Turkey with his 
mother and brother while trying to reach Greece last month.The Independent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/theindependent> was the only UK newspaper to 
publish the image of Alan lying face down on a beach in Bodrum on its front 
page.

Will the image of a lifeless boy on a beach change the refugee debate?

He said the images had helped change the tone of debate around the refugee 
crisis, and he had tweeted the Independent cover earlier than usual in a bid to 
persuade the BBC to run the picture.

He said: “The Independent should stand for the moral case for immigration. 
It’s the big story in Europe. It was a moment. That front page went viral, I 
think it won more praise than criticism.

“I wanted to encourage other people at the BBC, my comrades there, I wanted to 
encourage them to do the same ... I think it made a difference. I think the 
British government position changed quite significantly in a couple of days.”
