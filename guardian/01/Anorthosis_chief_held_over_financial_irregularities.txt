Andreas Panteli, the president of Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/anorthosisfamagusta>, has been remanded 
in custody for three days in light of accusations of fraud and embezzlement. 
Police said he was arrested late on Friday night after a complaint by members 
of the board over the alleged theft of €418,498 (£345,000) and a separate 
attempt to extract €500,000 from the Champions League group B contenders.

The 48-year-old, who denies the allegations, said: 'There were never any 
financial discrepancies. Any actions were taken in the full awareness of the 
board of directors and were always done with the best interests of the club at 
heart.'
