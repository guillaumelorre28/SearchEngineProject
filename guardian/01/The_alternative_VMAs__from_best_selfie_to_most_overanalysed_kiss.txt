But there was more to the ceremony than her performance of Lemonade. From 
unlikely shoutouts to bizarre tributes, here are our alternative awards for the 
VMAs 2016.

Most confetti-ed person

Ariana Grande <https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande>’s mum. She sat 
there chewing gum and looking as if she was waiting for a bus in the snow. 
Except the snow was10 tonnes of turbo-charged confetti 
<http://ohfeed.com/17-moments-from-the-vma-audience-cam-you-didnt-see-on-tv/>. 
And the bus wasBritney <https://www.theguardian.com/music/britneyspears>.

Most inappropriate shoutout

Kanye West <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest>, who – during his 
annual incomprehensible speech – spotted ex Amber Rose in the audience and 
said: “I see you, Amber. My wife is a G. Not a lot of people’s wives would let 
them say that; my wife is a G. We came over in the same boat; now we all in the 
same bed. Well, maybe different boats, but ... uh.” To which we say … uh?

Most right-on white carpet moment 

Beyoncé posing before the show with her daughter, Blue Ivy; singers; models; 
and, most notably, the mothers ofMichael Brown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting>, Trayvon Martin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin>, Oscar Grant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/09/oakland-riots-oscar-grant-shooting-verdict>
 andEric Garner <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner>, all black 
men shot by the police in the US.

Most overanalysed kiss

Drake <https://www.theguardian.com/music/drake> and Rihanna. While presenting 
her with the video vanguard award, Drake blurted out: “She is someone I have 
been in love with since I was 22 years old.” Then he leaned in for a full 
Hollywood snog.Rihanna swerved 
<http://www.vulture.com/2016/08/rihanna-broke-drakes-heart-at-the-vmas.html>, 
grabbed his head, and permitted a neck nuzzle. Ouch. Reports have since 
revealed that, after the cameras panned away, they shared a tender kiss. More 
news on who initiated this kiss and how long it lasted as it comes …

Most unfair programming

Putting Britney Spears on after Beyoncé, which made the princess of pop’s 
highly anticipated VMAs comeback 
<http://tvline.com/2016/08/28/britney-spears-vma-2016-performance-mtv-video-music-awards-make-me/>
 look more lemon than lemonade.

Best selfie

Simone Biles <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/simone-biles> and Kim 
Kardashian <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian>. The 
Olympic gymnast confessed her plan to meet Kardashian and send over some 
leotards before the VMAs. The result was a gold medal-winning selfie: a massive 
grin from Biles and a full-strength pout from Kardashian.

Cutest hug

Four of the final five US gold gymnasts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/how-the-usa-womens-gymnastics-team-swept-to-olympic-gold>
 and Beyoncé. As they presented her with the award for best female video, 
Beyoncé cuddled each giggling gymnast in turn, proving herself to be both 
gracious and at least three times as tall as them.

Most kickass Beyoncé moment 

When she growled “Who the fuck do you think I am? 
<http://tvline.com/2016/08/28/beyonce-vma-2016-performance-mtv-video-music-awards-lemonade/>
” with a mink coat slung around her sweaty shoulders, hair cartwheeling around 
her head, and giant puffs of candyfloss-coloured smoke billowing around her. 
Meanwhile, the words “GOD IS GOD I AM NOT” flashed behind her on a screen. Then 
the stage set on fire.

Best response to Beyoncé being God 

Ariana Grande, who responded as only an American pop star and actress can: she 
fell over 
<http://hollywoodlife.com/2016/08/29/ariana-grande-falls-vmas-2016-mtv-beyonce-watch/>
. Then, in true Broadway style, she got up and wiped tears of pure diva-bred 
joy from her cheeks.

Worst Grease tribute

Nick Jonas performing Bacon 
<http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/vma/7487938/nick-jonas-bacon-vmas-2016>
 at Tick Tock Diner in midtown New York. With an actual side order of bacon. It 
was all a bit silly.
