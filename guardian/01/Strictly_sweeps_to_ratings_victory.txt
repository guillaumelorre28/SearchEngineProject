More than 11 million viewers watched Alesha Dixon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alesha-dixon> win the final of BBC1's 
Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday, December 22.

The final results show averaged 11.4 million viewers from 9.25pm, peaking with 
11.6 million just before 10pm, when Dixon, a former member of girl band 
Mis-Teeq, and her partner Matthew Cutler, beat EastEnders actor Matt Di Angelo 
and Flavia Cacace in the final of the hit BBC1 series.

The main 5.50pm show averaged slightly fewer viewers - 10.9 million - but with 
a higher peak of 12.1 million at 7pm, according to unofficial overnight figures.

It gave the channel a convincing win over ITV. ITV1's movie Peter Pan, which 
was up against the first edition of Strictly Come Dancing, averaged 2.9 million 
viewers.

An Audience with Celine Dion, which had the challenge of going up against the 
Strictly Come Dancing results show, also averaged 2.9 million viewers.

Later, Michael Parkinson said another farewell to viewers in another "final" 
show, this time a look back at some of his greatest guests. It averaged 5.6 
million viewers, against 4.4 million for Match of the Day on BBC1.
