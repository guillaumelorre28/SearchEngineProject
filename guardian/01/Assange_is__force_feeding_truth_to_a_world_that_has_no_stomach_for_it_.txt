Here's an interesting assessment of the Wikileaks <http://wikileaks.org/> 
phenomenon and its prime mover,Julian Assange, that makes a lot of sense.

Alex Moore argues that Assange's countercultural mission is having a hard time 
finding a home in a world without counterculture 
<http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/33545/julian-assange-life-is-hard-in-a-world-without-hippies/>
.

He points up the differences between the way in which Daniel Ellsberg's leak 
of Vietnam war secrets, known as thePentagon Papers 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers>, was greeted in 1971 and the 
response to Assange's recent web postings of secret information on the wars in 
Afghanistan and Iraq.

In the 1970s - when hippies were alive and kicking - there was "a generation 
that valued integrity and the principle of truth." People were concerned about 
the substance of the leaks, the discovery that the US president had lied to the 
people.

By contrast, even though the Wikileaks revelations tell of killings and 
torture in Iraq that are more shocking than those exposed by the Pentagon 
Papers, "all anyone seems to talk about is what a jerk the guy [Assange] is."

Ellsberg may have told the New York Times, "I've been waiting 40 years for 
someone to disclose information on a scale that might really make a difference",
 <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/24assange.html> but, writes Moore, 
"the world has changed."

In Ellsberg's time, Assange's revelations would have incited mass protests and 
indignant calls for accountability. The government was the target. Now, we seem 
to be unsurprised by the substance of the leaks and instead of protesting about 
that, we appear to accept that Assange is a fair target.

Moore writes: "Assange's leaks do not inspire marches on Washington or 
palpable protests of any kind.President Barack Obama, for all his campaign 
rhetoric of transparency and integrity, hasn't praised Assange as a champion of 
truth...

"Even foreign governments whose agendas aren't complicated by hiding military 
secrets are hesitant to take him in.

"Assange may have been born at the wrong time. It's as if he's force-feeding 
truth to a world that has no stomach for it."
