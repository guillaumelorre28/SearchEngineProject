Anselm Kiefer <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/anselm-kiefer> works 
on a grand scale. On Friday the artist will sign a contractto buy the 
Mülheim-Kärlich reactor 
<http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,795001,00.html>, a 
decommissioned nuclear power station near Koblenz, Germany. And on the same day 
Kiefer, one of Germany's most celebrated postwar artists, will attend the 
opening night of his biggest show ever in Britain, spread over 11,000 sq ft of 
thenewly opened White Cube gallery 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/26/white-cube-empire-record-gallery>
 in south London.

Kiefer's art is deeply serious, dense with both esoteric symbolism and 
political meaning. The show,Il Mistero delle Cattedrali 
<http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/anselm_kiefer_il_mistero_delle_cattedrali/>, 
takes its title from a 1926 book byFulcanelli 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780859780513/the-fulcanelli-phenomenon-story-of-a-twentieth-century-alchemist>
, a mysterious figure who practised alchemy, and contains monumental paintings 
and sculptures alluding to ideas from the philosopher's stone to the second 
world war.

"Art is difficult," says the 66-year-old firmly. "It's not entertainment. 
There are only a few people who can say something about art – it's very 
restricted. When I see a new artist I give myself a lot of time to reflect and 
decide whether it's art or not. Buying art is not understanding art."

Kiefer, 66, misses the days of the 70s and 80s when art collectors such as 
Donald Fisher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/18/donald-fisher-obituary> – 
founder of the Gap clothing stores – took a year to decide whether they wanted 
to buy a work or not. He refuses to allow his works to be auctioned, or even 
for his gallerists to discuss the art market with him.

Though he has been acclaimed by critics such as Simon Schama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/jan/20/art>, who called him 
"incapable of producing trivia", andwas the first artist since Georges Braque 
in 1953 to make a work to go permanently on show at the Louvre 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/arts/design/21sera.html?pagewanted=all>, 
Kiefer regards himself as underground compared with artists likeDamien Hirst 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/damienhirst>, who he says makes 
"anti-art".

But he's at pains to point out that this "anti-art" is itself part of art. 
"Art has something which destroys its own cells," says Kiefer. "Damien Hirst is 
a great anti-artist. To go to Sothebys and sell your paintings directly" –as 
Hirst did in 2008 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/13/damienhirst.art> – "is 
destroying art. But in doing it to such an exaggerated extent, it becomes art. 
I liked this action, the Sotheby's sale, and the fact that it was two days 
before the crash made it even better." In fact, Hirst's auction, which netted 
£93m, and the collapse of Lehman Brothershappened at the same time

September.

It sounds as though Kiefer, who was born in the Black Forest but has lived in 
France since 1991,endorses Charles Saatchi's view 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/02/saatchi-hideousness-art-world>
 that the art world is eurotrashy, vulgar and masturbatory. "He described 
himself, no?" says the artist, laughing uproariously. "[These days] art becomes 
fashion, it becomes [financial] speculation, but Saatchi started it."

Ever since his first famous work Occupations (Bezetzung) 
<http://margotmarr.blogspot.com/2009/05/anselm-kiefer.html>, in which Kiefer, 
then a student, photographed himself giving the Nazi salute in different 
locations around Europe, the artist has interrogated Germany's relationship 
with its dark past. One room in the current exhibition includes four enormous 
paintings depictingTempelhof airport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/germany-architecture> in Berlin, 
which closed down in 2008. Built in 1927, the Nazis intended the enormous 
structure to be their gateway to Europe in Albert Speer's redesigned Berlin. It 
was described as "the mother of all airports" by architect Norman Foster.

"Germans want to forget [the past] and start a new thing all the time, but 
only by going into the past can you go into the future," says Kiefer.

At the moment, he complains, "they have fashion shows at Tempelhof and all 
this nonsense. There's an office, an ice skating rink – it's trivialising. I 
wrote [Berlin's cultural department] a letter, saying 'In the cathedral, you 
don't bicycle.' I spoke with Norman Foster and he said it was a pity they 
didn't do something dignified with the locality."

For instance? "They could give it to me. I could invite five or 10 artists and 
we could do something there, or they could do exhibitions, or use it as a 
private airport likeLe Bourget 
<http://www.azworldairports.com/airports/a1570lbg.cfm> in Paris."

What prevents this, says Kiefer, is that Germans don't distinguish between 
Nazi architecture and Nazi art. "Nazi art is really horrible, it's boring, but 
the architecture of the 30s isn't specifically German, it was the architecture 
of its time.Speer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/olympics2008.architecture>
 was a bad politician, but he wasn't a bad architect."

After unification, says Kiefer, Berlin should have been rebuilt along the 
lines planned out by Speer for Hitler, in the way that Paris wouldn't exist in 
the way it does withoutGeorges-Eugène Haussmann 
<http://www.bookrags.com/biography/baron-georges-eugene-haussmann/>, 
commissioned by Napoleon III to modernise the city, "but in Germany it's 
difficult – they are afraid of taboos". He adds that the Berlin wall - "or part 
of the wall" - should have been left intact as a memorial, "and this empty 
space between east and west. I believe in empty spaces, they're the most 
wonderful thing."The White Cube show features images of apocalypse and 
regeneration, of alchemical scales, Stuka-like bombers and sunflowers, 
heavyweight both literally (Kiefer often works with lead) and figuratively.

An artwork was also planned for the outside wall of the gallery, but decided 
against at the last minute. "It was too busy there," says Kiefer. Not that he 
worried about it being damaged by the public: "they can touch it, they can 
spray on it, I don't care."

Indeed, his pieces are often weathered by the elements – for instance, a 
giant, rusty satellite dish protrudes out of one painting.

Kiefer says that the current turmoil in Europe influences his thinking and the 
meaning of his work, "but you cannot see it immediately in the paintings – I am 
not a daily political artist."

He approves of Angela Merkel. "I'm very happy that a woman is in power, I 
think they are better. We [men] are inferior." Merkel, he says, "doesn't want 
to be charismatic – she does her job in an old, Prussian way, and that 
impresses me. She decided to save Europe, and for that I must congratulate her."

He is fervently pro-European, a theme which he says "pushes me". "On a 
cultural level, we need Europe," he says. "Germany alone is not good." He says 
that he'd like to see Europe like the USA – "I would go so far" – with regions 
likeÎle-de-France 
<http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Tourism-g187144-Ile_de_France-Vacations.html>, 
Bordeux and north Germany the individual states within it. "It doesn't mean 
that you lose any [region's] specific individual charisma. Europe is a big 
political organisation and then you have all these countries – it's wonderful, 
no? We need Europe in an aesthetic way and a political way, and Merkel is now 
on the right way."

So what of the power station? Kiefer professes himself amused by the fuss that 
ensued when he announced that he was buying the Mülheim-Kärlich reactor, since 
"that's what I do all the time: I buy old factories, I move in I transform them 
and then I leave them and give them to some collector as I did in Germany and 
the south of France."

He denies that the decision to buy the building was influenced by the 
Fukushima disaster, and says that standing inside the power station's cooling 
tower was "overwhelming. It's so wonderful it's like the Pantheon. It will be a 
challenge for me to do something with it because it's already very good."

It's all part of his mission to confront the past. "In Germany, if something 
is finished, they like to flatten it, bring it down, make the grass grow over 
it. That's no good. You should keep these old buildings because they played a 
role and they can teach us something. I'm against the idea of bringing all 
these power stations down. I said, 'I'll take them all if you want'."
