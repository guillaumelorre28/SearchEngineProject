Adam Boulton, political editor of Sky News, steps down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/13/adam-boulton-step-down-sky-news-political-editor>
 (or rather a little back from the front line) after 25 years. Open a book on 
who'll succeed him: his deputy Joey Jones? Tom Bradby from ITV? There's a rich 
field of opportunity here. But if you were John Ryley, the editor who 
intrinsically makes the call, what approach might be most tempting of all 
(especially if the budget could be stretched to Premier League levels)?

Nick Robinson <https://www.theguardian.com/media/nickrobinson> has been BBC 
political editor for nine years now, after returning to the corporation from a 
stint at ITN. Is there any sign of onward progression for him – toQuestion Time,
Newsnight, Today? No: the scenery has remained doggedly unchanged. And Nick 
must get awfully fed up in deep midwinter, standing shivering in a deserted 
Downing Street night after night delivering fair and balanced assessments.

Sky doesn't impose such constraints: Boulton's column for the Sunday Times 
contains actual opinions. And as for making waves … think of the tide surging 
up Portland Place if Sky snaffles the BBC's No 1.
