A Most Violent Year, the latest movie from Margin Call and All is Lost 
director JC Chandor, has beennamed the best film of 2014 by the National Board 
of Review 
<http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/2014/12/national-board-review-announces-2014-award-winners/>
.

Each year the US organisation, whose best-of list is voted for by critics, 
film-makers and academics, casts one of the first stones in the annual awards 
season that culminates in the Oscars. Other early best-film prizes have gone to 
Boyhood, awarded by theNew York Film Critics Circle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/02/boyhood-bags-hat-trick-at-new-york-critics-circle-awards>
, and Birdman, winner at the Gotham awards.

Chandor’s film stars Oscar Isaac as Abel Morales, a New York businessman 
trying to build a heating oil empire, and coming up against violent rivals as 
well as law enforcement. Isaac shared the best actor award with Michael Keaton 
for his performance in Birdman, while Isaac’s co-star Jessica Chastain took the 
supporting actress award.Writing in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/07/a-most-violent-year-review-plucky-outsider-draws-blood-in-this-years-oscar-battle>
, Xan Brooks described the film as “rigorous, resourceful and as smart as a 
whip. It surely can’t win [the best picture Oscar]; it’s too nuanced and 
sombre. But its canny tactical struggle remains a joy to behold.”

Also appearing in A Most Violent Year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-most-violent-year> is David Oyelowo, the 
British actor tipped for awards season recognition in civil rights drama Selma, 
which won a Freedom of Expression award.

Other National Board of Review winners included Julianne Moore, who plays a 
woman suffering early onset Alzheimer’s inStill Alice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/12/still-alice-alzheimers-julianne-moore-alec-baldwin-film>
, and Clint Eastwood, awarded best director for American Sniper. British actor 
Jack O’Connell won the Breakthrough performance award for his work in Starred 
Up and Unbroken.

The Lego Movie won the best original screenplay award, suggesting it might 
break out of the animated movie ghetto this season, while Chris Rock was given 
the special Spotlight award for writing, directing and starring in Top Five.
