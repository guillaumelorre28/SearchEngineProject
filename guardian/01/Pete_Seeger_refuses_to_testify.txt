"I have sung for Americans of every political persuasion and I am proud that I 
never refuse to sing to an audience, no matter what religion or colour of their 
skin or situation ... I have sung in hobo jungles and I have sung for the 
Rockefellers and I am proud I have never refused to sing for anybody …" The 
only body Pete Seeger didn't sing to was the House of Un-American Activities 
Committee and he was given a year's prison sentence for his troubles after 
being found guilty of contempt after refusing to testify as part of the 
anti-communist "reds under the bed" witch hunt instituted by Senator Joe 
McCarthy in the 1950s. The case triggered intense protests from the folk 
community and Seeger never served his sentence, although he was blacklisted by 
record companies and TV shows for the next decade. The nascent British folk 
world rallied round to promote concerts for him in the UK and the case became a 
cause célèbre. Other musicians rallied behind him, hardening the backbone of a 
scene suddenly forced to face the reality of an appalling injustice on a 
revered artist of high moral fibre and the realisation that folk music and 
politics had become blatantly intertwined.
