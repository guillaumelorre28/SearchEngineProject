 Dick van Velzen, the pathologist criticised in the Redfern report for 
stripping organs from hundreds of children at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool, 
is to appear before the General Medical Council.
Professor Van Velzen will on Monday go before the fitness to practice panel, 
at the start of a three-week hearing in Manchester. He faces a charge of 
serious professional misconduct, and could be struck off the medical register. 
He is understood not to have worked in medicine since he was dismissed from the 
Medisch Centruk Haaglanden hospital in The Hague three years ago.

He claims he was made a scapegoat by the Redfern report. He was in charge of 
pathology at Alder Hey between 1988 and 1995, and the report found he was 
responsible for the stockpiling of organs at the hospital with out the 
knowledge or consent of parents. He was suspended by the General Medical 
Council in 2001, but the investigation was suspended for police inquiries.

Last December the Crown Prosecution Service said there was no prospect of 
being able to establish that a criminal offence had been committed. One of the 
chief difficulties was proving that the organs in storage had been taken under 
his watch.
