As a result of Park Honan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/19/park-honan>’s inspirational 
teaching of American literature at Birmingham University, I went on to Sussex 
to do a master’s in American studies.

I still have vivid memories of Honan’s lecture on Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The 
Scarlet Letter, delivered in the style of a Hollywood film producer assessing 
the possibilities of making a film of the novel. It was a brilliant 
performance, and one that truly engaged his students.

In seminars, he had the happy knack of allowing the conversation to ramble 
along, and then, with one or two adroit interventions, lifting the 
understanding to a more fulfilling level.

For some reason he would often turn to me when the discussion was flagging, 
and in the kindest tone say: “Well, Turner, what d’you think?” Eventually I 
would ready myself for his question, the result being I became better prepared 
for his seminars than I might have been.

To me, he was a breath of fresh air in the lecture hall, and there was always 
intellectual rigour in seminar and tutorial. What a combination!

I felt very privileged to have been taught by him.
