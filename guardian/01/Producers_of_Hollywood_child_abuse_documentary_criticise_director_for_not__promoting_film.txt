The producers of An Open Secret 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/an-open-secret>, a controversial documentary 
about child sex abuse in Hollywood, have criticised their director, Amy Berg, 
for failing to sufficiently promote it.

Executive producer Gabe Hoffman, who bankrolled early screenings of the film 
with his own money,complained to industry magazine Deadline 
<http://deadline.com/2015/07/an-open-secret-documentary-film-amy-berg-1201487697/>
 that, while Berg had granted some print interviews, she had turned down 
“dozens” of requests from broadcast news networks.

“It’s heartbreaking,” he said. “It’s been a disappointment to everybody. To be 
given a national platform to support an independent film is like a winning 
lottery ticket – a real chance to talk about the issues and raise awareness and 
to do some good. But Amy has declined all these press interviews, citing a busy 
schedule.”

An Open Secret, which airs the testimonies of a number of men who say they 
were sexually abused by Hollywood film-makers as children, was released on 5 
June and had a limited run in the US, charting the lowest grossing box-office 
figure distributor Rocky Mountain Pictures had seen in 26 years.

“We knew it would be challenging subject matter,” Rocky Mountain executive Ron 
Rodgers told Deadline in June

. “[But] I don’t think we’ve had any interference from Hollywood and I don’t 
jump onto conspiracy theories”.

Berg has not commented on Hoffman’s remarks, but sources close to her who 
spoke to Deadline say she warned An Open Secret’s producers that their decision 
to bring forward the film’s release date would conflict with her schedule. She 
is currently working on a documentary about Janis Joplin and promoting her film

 who is serving a life sentence for sexual assault on children.

The director’s previous work includes Deliver Us From Evil 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/13/movies/13evil.html?_r=0>, her 
Oscar-nominated debut about the Irish Catholic priest Oliver O’Grady, who 
served seven years in prison in the US for child molestation, before being 
deported back to Ireland. The film shows O’Grady admitting to molesting and 
raping multiple young victims during his time in America.

An Open Secret has had a tough time gaining traction, despite receiving lots 
of press from print publications,like the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/22/an-open-secret-documentary-reveals-paedophilia-in-hollywood>
. It was given an R rating by US certification body the Motion Picture 
Association of America (MPAA). Many cinemas refuse to show R-rated films and 
they tend to struggle at the box office. Hoffman wrote an open letter to the 
MPAA’s chairman Christopher Dodd, asking for the ratings body to reconsider 
their decision.

“We were extremely disappointed to find our film – which discusses these 
issues maturely and carefully – thrown into the same category as films which 
display gratuitous sex and violence,”he wrote 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/13/an-open-secret-producer-criticises-r-rating-child-sex-abuse-documentary>
.

“If just one single teen … finds their inner strength, and is able to escape 
their current abuse situation because of your decision, wouldn’t that make your 
time spent personally reviewing the film, and its rating, all worthwhile?”
