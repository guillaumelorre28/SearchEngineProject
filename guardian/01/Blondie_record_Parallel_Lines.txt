Although rooted in the New York punk scene, Blondie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/blondie> were the finest pop band of the 
era, with this their pinnacle, as good an advert for the city's musical 
credentials as Tin Pan Alley or the Velvet Underground. Debbie Harry might have 
been the poster girl but, as the album's opening tracks (Hanging On the 
Telephone, One Way Or Another, Picture This) underlined, top-flight songwriting 
was Blondie's real strength, with Heart of Glass even bridging new wave and 
disco.
