"I was left to care for my two sisters when I was 16," says 22-year-old 
Lindiwe Sibeko as she stares out of the cracked window in her one-roomed home 
in Tsakane. "I was very scared, especially as Sihle, the youngest, was only 
eight months old."

Sibeko, herself the mother of three-year old Mbali, has never received any 
formal education. She survives on 560 rand (£43) a month to provide for the 
four of them. "It is hard. I have to make the money stretch so far, but some 
days there is just not enough …"

The South African department of social development issues child grants for 
those hit hardest by poverty, but Sibeko only receives money for one of her 
sisters and her daughter. "My auntie has my other sister's papers and she lives 
far away. With no papers, I can't get the grant."

This belief, though untrue, is common in South African townships. Felicity 
Xaba, a primary healthcare worker, explains: "If they are South African and 
they come forward and have no identification, we refer them to  home affairs 
with their date of birth and they provide an ID number."

However, the problem goes much deeper. Sibeko suspects her little sister may 
have contracted the HIV virus from her mother, but has not had her tested. 
"Maybe it is better not to know," she says, eyes downcast. "People say cruel 
things."
