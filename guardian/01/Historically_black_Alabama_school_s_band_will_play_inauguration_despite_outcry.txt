The president of a historically black college in Alabama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama> says its band will perform in 
Donald Trump’s inaugural parade, despite a barrage of criticism.

Talladega College president Billy Hawkins announced the decision on Thursday. 
It comes after the Presidential Inaugural Committee had announced that the 
Alabama band had accepted its invitation to march in the 20 January parade.

The announcement followed several days of intense debate on social media. Some 
people voiced strong opposition, while others said it would be a good 
opportunity to perform in the parade.

Talladega, founded in 1867, bills itself as Alabama’s oldest private, 
historically black liberal arts college.

Other historically black schools such as Howard University, which performed at 
Barack Obama’s first inaugural parade, have said they will not be marching at 
the event.

“We were a bit horrified to hear of the invitation,” said Shirley Ferrill of 
Fairfield,Alabama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama>, a member of 
Talladega’s Class of 1974, who beganan online petition

 requesting the band withdraw from the parade.

The move has lit up Talladega College’s social media sites with a sharp debate 
about the band’s decision to participate in the parade. Some voiced strong 
opposition, while others support the band’s participation.


“After how black people were treated at Trump’s rallies, you’re going to go 
and shuck and jive down Pennsylvania Avenue? For what?” Seinya SamForay of 
Chicago told the Associated Press. “What they did is a slap in the face to 
other black universities.”

On Monday, the British singer Rebecca Ferguson said

 she would accept an invitation to perform at Trump’s inauguration on condition 
she be allowed to sing the anti-lynching anthem Strange Fruit.
