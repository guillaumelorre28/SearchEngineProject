Thanks to the brand awareness caused by the Formula One racing driver Lewis 
Hamilton, sponsored by Santander, and the onset of the global banking crisis - 
which encouraged UK customers to flock last year to the relatively safely of 
the Spanish owned bank - three well known high street brands are to be removed 
from the high street. Abbey, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley are 
all to be renamed Santander in the next 18 months in a £12m rebranding exercise.
But even before the latest announcement from Santander, data from the
British Bankers' Association <http://www.bba.org.uk> shows that in the past 15 
years, 17 high street names have collapsed into ten.
During the same period, the overall number of branches has fallen from
11,846 to 9,696 as pubs and housing developments have sprung up in former bank 
branches which have fallen victim to consolidation in cost savings in the 
banking sector. More changes could be coming as banking experts believe that 
Lloyds Banking Group, created when HBOS was rescued by Lloyds TSB in January, 
will end up shutting some of its branches.
