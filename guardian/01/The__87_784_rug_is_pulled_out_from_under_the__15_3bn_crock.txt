Blink and you'd have missed it. A press release from Bank of America raved for 
multiple paragraphs about Brian Moynihan, newly appointed to head its global 
wealth and investment management division. Then, almost as an aside, it 
mentioned: "Moynihan replacesJohn Thain who is leaving the company 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/23/john-thain-boa-merrill-lynch>
."

There were none of the usual tributes and thanks extended to a departing 
senior executive. Thain – the former boss ofMerrill Lynch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/merrill-lynch>, which was acquired by BoA 
at the beginning of the year – is leaving on the tersest terms possible.

Thain is in the doghouse because Merrill lost an eye-watering $15.3bn in its 
final three months of independence – which means, to put it mildly, that Bank 
of America has bought a crock.

The knives are out – a carefully timed leak detailed the $1.22m spent by Thain 
on redecorating his office early last year. Aside from the $87,784 rug, the 
$25,713 mahogany table and the $28,091 curtains, the item grabbing the most 
attention was a $35,115 "commode on legs".

What exactly is a commode on legs? On financial discussion boards, there was 
an immediate assumption that it is a posh kind of a toilet. Some suggested that
Thain could be flushed down it

. But no, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica, it's atype of furniture 
<http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/128063/commode> resembling a chest 
of drawers popular in France in the late 17th century.

There's a kind of bitter irony in Wall Street bosses furnishing their offices 
in the style of pre-revolutionary France just before the global financial 
system comes crashing down around their ears.

Historic plea fails to improve Black outlook
What do Conrad Black, the Olympic sprinter Marian Jones and the junk bond king 
Michael Milkin have in common? They are convicted felons, yes, but in addition 
they all suffered the disappointment this week of failing to win clemency from 
President Bush.
The outgoing commander-in-chief felt sufficiently moved to commute the 
sentences of two border guards who shot an unarmed illegal immigrant in the 
back and then tried to cover it up. But he was clearly unimpressed by Black, a 
fellow dyed-in-the-wool conservative, who still proclaims that he is innocent 
of fiddling $6m from shareholders in his Hollinger media empire.

The view of the future from Black's prison cell in Florida is bleak. The 
Canadian-born peer has already failed to get his conviction overturned by the 
court of appeal. Short of an extremely rare successful foray to the supreme 
court, there aren't any legal avenues left.

Under the federal system, he is required to serve at least 85% of his 
six-and-a-half-year sentence before being eligible for parole. By my 
calculations, that means the earliest he's going to see daylight is early 2013.

Sympathy for Black has come from unexpected quarters. In Australia, the former 
New South Wales premier Bob Carr has revealed that he petitioned the White 
House on Black's behalf. Carr, a leftish figure on the Aussie political scene, 
stood up for Black on the peculiar grounds that the peer has written some good 
history books.

"I made the point that he'd done some serious work on American history," Carr 
told Australia's ABC network <>. "I said he'd written two big books on American 
history – a book on Roosevelt and a book on Nixon – and I said that he's paid 
the price for his wrongdoings, his white-collar crimes."

Goodbye to the Cox who failed to steer
It was time to bid farewell this week to America's top financial regulator, 
Christopher Cox. Nobody could honestly say that he went out on a high.
The 28th chairman of the securities and exchange commission left office with 
an official investigation under way into how his agency failed to spot the 
Bernard Madoff scandal – which is widely believed to be the biggest Wall Street 
con trick in history.

Cox's record since the credit crunch began has been far from distinguished. 
Days before Bear Stearns went bust, he was busily assuring the public that he 
was "comfortable" with the capital cushions of top investment banks. The SEC's 
inspector-general later blasted the agency for ignoring red flags at the bank.

Hedge funds remained outside the regulatory orbit, despite looking after 
$1.9tn in assets, and oversight of Wall Street was consistently light.

Appointed by President Bush in 2005, Cox, 57, is a legally trained former 
Republican congressman for California's Orange County whose legislative record 
includedauthoring a report 
<http://www.CNN.COM/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/cox.report/overview/pg1.html> 
claiming that Chinese spies wereinfiltrating US nuclear weapons laboratories 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/may/26/martinkettle>.

When he took charge of the SEC, he made it clear that he shared Bush's 
laissez-faire market philosophy, advocating fewer, simpler rules.

He insisted that business should be conducted in plain English – in one 2006 
interview, he pointed out that Enron had failed because of a business model "so 
exquisitely complex that a mere mortal wasn't expected to understand it". He 
added: "It's an important lesson that if you can't understand the business, 
perhaps it's because there isn't one."

Indeed it was a useful lesson – but it hasn't been applied. How many people 
understood the business model of Wall Street banks that claimed to be making 
billions of dollars by dealing in collateralised debt obligations, credit 
default swaps and option-ARM mortgages? And how many SEC inspectors even tried 
to grasp Bernie Madoff's opaque explanations of his trading strategy?

Lynn Turner, the SEC's chief accountant during the Clinton years, told Reuters 
recently that Cox was the worst chairman ever to lead the SEC: "I can't think 
of anything he did that was really protecting investors."

Cox once told his local paper, the Orange County Register, that his favourite 
food was artichokes and that his motto was "don't quit what you begin". He 
seems to have forgotten that one.
