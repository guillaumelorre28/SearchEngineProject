Restaurante Casa Bigote

Bajo de Guia, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Cádiz, Spain, 0034 956 36 26 96

I judged the Sherry Cup for food and sherry pairing here. We kicked the day 
off slightly hungover, but not only did the grilled gambas and sherry dispel 
any hangover, it was some of the best seafood I've had. A family restaurant 
that punches way above its weight.

Moules et Baucels

Ganges, France, 00 33 46773 9494

Set in a beautiful, 14th-century courtyard, you have whatever is on the menu 
that day. Last time I had a great duck confit, and they make their own foie 
gras and the best potato dauphinoise. Small, low-key, special.

Royal China Club

40-42 Baker Street, London W1, 020-7486 3898

The smallest and best of the Royal Chinas - we went here as a family when I 
was presented with my OBE. The dim sum is ideal for sharing - nourishing, 
simple and beautifully judged. I go whenever I get a chance.

Inopia

Tamarit 104, Eixample Esquerra, Barcelona, Spain, 0034 93 424 5231

Owned and run by Albert Adrià, pastry chef and younger brother to Ferran Adrià 
of El Bulli fame, this is small, hard to get into, noisy and brilliant. The 
quality of the ingredients and cooking stand out. You'll likely end up 
standing, but don't let that put you off.

Robert's Steakhouse 

Penthouse Executive Club, 603 West 45th Street, Far West Side, New York, US, 
00 212 245 0002.

This place is a bit bizarre - it's in a strip club - but the steaks are 
wonderful. We filmed here for the BBC Perfection series, after the great Harold 
McGee recommended it. Chef Adam Perry Lang has done time with some great chefs, 
and it shows.

Malik's

High Street, Cookham, Berkshire, 01628 520085

I've been going here for years, and ordering takeaways, too. About once a 
week, to be honest. The food is first class, and so fresh: they cook the naan 
only when the car is ready to leave.

Porthminster Restaurant

Porthminster Beach, St Ives, Cornwall, 01736 799097

Cornwall's a bit busy for us in summer, but in autumn it's quieter, and 
wonderful, especially on the roof terrace here. The food is simple and 
memorable.
