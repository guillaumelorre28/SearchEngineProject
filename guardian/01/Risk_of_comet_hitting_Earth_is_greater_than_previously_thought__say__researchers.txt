Earth could be at higher risk of being hit by a comet than widely thought, 
according to astronomers who have suggested keeping a closer eye on distant 
objects.


Most studies of potential hazards involved objects in the asteroid belt 
roughly between Mars and Jupiter, the researchers said. But they noted that the 
discovery in the last two decades of hundreds of giant comets dubbed “centaurs” 
requires expanding the list of potential hazards.

, typically 30-60 miles (50-100km) wide, have unstable, elliptical orbits that 
start far beyond Neptune, the most distant planet from the Sun.

Their orbits cross those of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, whose gravity 
fields occasionally deflect a comet towards Earth – once about every 40,000 to 
100,000 years.

As they draw closer to the Sun the comets gradually break up, which is what 
causes the trademark cometary debris tail – “making impacts on our planet 
inevitable”, the research team write inAstronomy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/astronomy> and Geophysics, journal of the 
Royal Astronomical Society.

“The disintegration of such giant comets would produce intermittent but 
prolonged periods of bombardment lasting up to 100,000 years.”

They argue that “assessment of the extraterrestrial impact risk based solely 
on near-Earth asteroid counts underestimates its nature and magnitude”.

A single centaur contains more mass than the entire population of 
Earth-crossing asteroids discovered to date, they write.

“In the last three decades we have invested a lot of effort in tracking and 
analysing the risk of a collision between the Earth and an asteroid,” said 
co-author Bill Napier of the University of Buckingham.

“Our work suggests we need to look beyond our immediate neighbourhood too, and 
look out beyond the orbit of Jupiter to find centaurs.

“If we are right then these distant comets could be a serious hazard and it’s 
time to understand them better.”

Scientists believe a comet bombardment may have kickstarted life on Earth by 
bringing water and organic molecules.

A comet strike is also a leading contender for having ended the reign of the 
dinosaurs 65 million years ago.
