Amy, Asif Kapadia’s acclaimed documentary about Amy Winehouse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse>, is being shown to boys at a 
juvenile detention centre in Thailand in the hopes that it might dissuade them 
from a life of addiction.

The film, which became the second-biggest documentary ever at UK cinemas this 
summer, tracks the singer’s battle with alcohol and drugs, and eventual death. 
The Thai Health Promotion Foundation and the Stop Drink Network have been 
screening the film to boys at the centre near Bangkok. It houses teens who have 
been convicted of serious crimes, some of which are drug-related.

“I think Amy’s story is a real story that reflects real problems in the 
society, especially among teenagers,” Kamron Chudecha of the Stop Drink Network 
toldAP

. “When Amy felt too much pressured, she acted out and started drinking, but 
she was gifted and she found that gift. It’s not too late for the students to 
find their gifts and learn from her mistakes … Amy lost the battle, but these 
kids still have a chance.”

While warmly received by critics upon release (the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw 
gave it five stars and called it“an intimate and passionate tribute” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/amy-winehouse-review-documentary>
), the film was criticised by Mitch Winehouse, Amy’s father, who is rumoured to 
be making his own filmto correct omissions

. He has also since made claims that the singer thought she was pregnant before 
her death at 27.
