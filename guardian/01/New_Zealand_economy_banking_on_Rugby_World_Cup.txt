In the Viaduct neighbourhood of Auckland the official Rugby World Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugbyworldcup2011> store is already decked 
with T-shirts sporting the colours of the various teams, but for the time being 
shoppers prefer anything connected to the home side, theAll Blacks 
<http://www.allblacks.com/>.

With just weeks to go before the start of the tournament (9 September to 23 
October), the excitement inNew Zealand 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand> is already palpable. All over 
Auckland, billboards are publicising the event and newspapers have started a 
countdown to the opening ceremony. Hotels are already fully booked and local 
people are starting to rent out their homes.

It will be the biggest sporting event ever organised by this small country 
(population 4.4 million), with 85,000 visitors expected and the prospect of 
welcome earnings after the 2008 recession. The governor of the Reserve Bank, 
Alan Bollard, has forecast that the competition could bring in $600m.

The main beneficiary will be Auckland, the country's biggest city, which will 
be hosting the semi-finals and final. Sales of tickets, managed by theRugby New 
Zealand <http://www.nzrugby.co.nz/> organisation, should earn $228m.

One estimate suggests the whole operation could cost $1bn, almost half of 
which has been spent on refurbishing the stadiums. Such a lavish outlay is hard 
to swallow as the country struggles to maintain growth. Theearthquake that 
devastated Christchurch

 in February could knock 1.5 points off growth this year.

But others highlight the long-term benefits. "This will giveÂ our country an 
international image it would never have achieved otherwise," saysRugby World Cup
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugby-world-cup> boss Martin Snedden.
