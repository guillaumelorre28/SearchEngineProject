The world No2, who has been a losing finalist on four occasions in Melbourne, 
revealed he will withdraw from the tournament if his wife Kim goes into 
premature labour. The Australian Open runs from 18-31 January, with Murray’s 
first child due in February.

“I’d go home. For sure, yes,” Murray told the Daily Mail. “It’s obviously 
important. I want to make sure at the beginning I’m there as much as I can be 
to try and help out, just be there for whatever is really required of me.”

Murray, who recently led Great Britain to Davis Cup glory

, also explained that the decision to complete his pre-season training camp in 
Dubai was motivated by better transport links back to the UK.

“I was either going to go to Dubai or Miami but because obviously Kim is quite 
heavily pregnant it’s a lot easier to get back from here,” he added. “All the 
flights leave in the evening from Miami, whereas here you can fly at all times 
in the day.”

The British No1 will be back on home shores for the BBC Sports Personality of 
the Year ceremony
