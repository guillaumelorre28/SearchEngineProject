If not precisely the land of lost content, the rubble strewn backwater of the 
Birmingham canal network, with its scrapyards, stubs of old warehouse walls, and
buddleia <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/06/gardens-buddleja>
 sprouting amid white-van parking spaces, is certainly the land of lost 
mischief for Roger Hiorns. The artist is on course tobury a Boeing 737 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/19/roger-hiorns-bury-boeing-737-artwork-plane-ikon-gallery-birmingham>
 seven metres under its battered surface.

“Didn’t you learn to smoke here?” Jonathan Watkins, director of the city’s 
Ikon gallery, <https://ikon-gallery.org/> asks him.

“Er ... yes,” Hiorns says, with a guilty glance around as if his mother might 
still be watching. He points to the distant church spire, beyond the wasteland 
and the council housing blocks of Ladywood, one of Birmingham’s most culturally 
diverse but deprived districts.

Hiorns 
I wasn’t the child who buries his Dinky toys in the back garden
Roger Hiorns 
The Turner prize-nominated artist, whose creations include turning a derelict 
high-rise London flat into aneerily magical cavern of blue copper sulphate 
crystals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/13/seizure-copper-sulphate-crystals-yorkshire>
, grew up over there. However, as a teenager, he found this canal area, with 
its factories, warehouses and smoky Victorian pubs, far more entertaining.

“I used to come here all the time,” he recalls. “It’s always been an 
interesting place. There was a pub, the Waterworks, and there were always 
foreign students there. We were just underage drinkers, we learned ... many 
things.”

For years, Hiorns has contemplated buying an entire plane and burying it, 
complete with every detail of its working life. The seats will be there, the 
lights, the safety instructions, the call bells – except the windows will be 
blinded by piled-up earth. Indeed his ambitions go further: he dreams of an 
entire fleet of grounded planes, buried across the world.

“It’s got something to do with taking something out of the air, and putting it 
under the skin of the land,” he says. “The idea has been in my mind for years. 
I dont know when exactly it started. I wasn’t the child who buries his Dinky 
toys in the back garden – I had a brother and most of the toys were his, so I 
couldn’t.”

Ikon has now commissioned Untitled (buried passenger aircraft), which should 
be landing in summer 2017 inIcknield Port Loop 
<http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/3000-homes-transform-birmingham-inner-10927453>
, 43 acres of weeds and rubble scheduled for a redevelopment of more than 1,000 
homes and businesses.


A suitable plane has already been found, in a specialist breakers’ yard in 
Gloucestershire. “It’s not as expensive as you’d think to buy a 737,” says 
Watkins. “You’d be surprised.”

The pricey bit will be getting it to the site by road – the wings will have to 
come off en route – and digging a plane-sized hole seven metres deep. Entrance 
will be via a spiral staircase leading down into the earth, and passengers will 
be transported to the site by the Ikon gallery’s own canal boat.

Roger Hiorns’s Seizure moves to Yorkshire Sculpture Park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2013/jun/13/roger-hiorns-seizure-yorkshire-video>
Seizure, the Artangel-commissioned crystal-filled council flat in Peckham 
<https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/seizure/>, , was only intended to last for 
a few months before the housing block was demolished – but the crowds kept 
coming and the opening kept being extended. Eventually the entire flat was 
chopped up into sections andreconstructed at Yorkshire Sculpture Park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2013/jun/13/roger-hiorns-seizure-yorkshire-video>
.

“It did have a very strange effect on people,” Hiorns says. “It was never seen 
as having any spiritual dimension, yet prayer groups came and had regular 
prayer sessions there. Other people wanted to have sex in it. Who knows what 
people will want to do in the plane.”
