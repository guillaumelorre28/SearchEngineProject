"Listen up you undead pricks," perhaps isn't the sort of thing one should 
shout out at the Christmas dinner table … but itis the best moment in the 
brilliant, Dawn of the Dead-inspired video for Emmy the Great and Tim Wheeler's 
festive singalong, Zombie Christmas.

In fact, it comes at a point where Father Christmas has just been brutally 
attacked (the whole video is a little bit NSFW) and pre-empts some fairly 
inventive uses for Christmas decorations – including electrified tinsel, a 
candy cane stake and some eye-gauging jingle bells. Taken from last year's This 
Is Christmas album, Zombie Christmas bounds along nicely and has that lovely 
mix of being musically upbeat and lyrically melancholic ("Christmas time is 
here, I hate this time of year"). Also, look out for the bit when Tim Wheeler 
impales a zombie using his splintered Flying V guitar.

• Zombie Christmas is out on 17 December. This Is Christmas is out now.
