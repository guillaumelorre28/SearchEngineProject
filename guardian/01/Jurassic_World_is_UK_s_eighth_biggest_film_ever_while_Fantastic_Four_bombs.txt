The disappointment: Fantastic Four

In the 10 years since Fox presented the first of the two Tim Story-directed 
Fantastic Four <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jul/11/news> films, it’s 
fair to say that the value of the association with theMarvel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/marvel> brand has only increased. Fox’s 
X-Men <https://www.theguardian.com/film/x-men> franchise continues to flourish, 
Sony took just under $1.5bn worldwide with its twoAmazing Spider-Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-amazing-spider-man> films, and Disney has 
proved withThe Guardians of the Galaxy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy> and Ant-Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/16/ant-man-review-paul-rudd-marvel> 
that Marvel success is not limited to the Avengers portfolio of characters. So, 
the logic went, a rebooted Fantastic Four, withChronicle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/02/chronicle-film-review> director 
Josh Trank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/10/fantastic-four-echo-josh-trank-hollywood>
 at the helm, an appealing sounding cast led by Whiplash’s Miles Teller, plus 
the growing cachet of the Marvel brand, must surely add up to an 
audience-pleasing proposition. A brief glance at the UK box office Top 10 (see 
below) suggests the new Fantastic Four has done OK – after all, it’s sitting 
there in the top spot, with a gross of £2.69m. But that would be misleading.

 The film team review Fantastic Four 
Preview takings of £817,000 have been added in to that figure. Without them, 
Fantastic Four recorded a weekend total of £1.87m, only enough for third place, 
behindMission: Impossible – Rogue Nation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/24/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-review-tom-cruise-just-wont-let-this-franchise-self-destruct>
 andInside Out 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/23/inside-out-review-high-iq-family-entertainment>
. Nor do comparisons with the previous attempt at Fantastic Four flatter the 
new film. The first Story-directed effort kicked off with £3.13m plus £415,000 
in previews in July 2005, when cinema ticket prices were 30% lower than they 
are today. It’s sequelRise of the Silver Surfer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jun/15/actionandadventure.family> began 
with £4.14m in June 2007.

Fantastic Four review - a dawdling indie drama dressed up in superhero garb

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/05/fantastic-four-review-marvel-superhero-dawdling>
A big difference this time around is the speed at which audience’s word 
travels on a film. In 2005, and even in 2007, Facebook was in its infancy. As 
it turns out, when word did start circulating, audiences didn’t hugely care for 
either of thoseFantastic Four <https://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-four> 
films, and Rise of the Silver Surfer managed an uninspiring 2.99 times its 
opening weekend number in the UK with its lifetime total of £12.38m.

This time around, Fox faced a perfect storm of negative buzz, which 
intensified when Trank suggested in a tweet that he wasn’t happy with, and 
wasn’t responsible for, the film that was delivered to cinemas. Although that 
tweet was soon deleted, its expression represented one more negative cue. 
Fantastic Four currently enjoys a 4/10 rating from users of IMDb and a 27/100 
score at MetaCritic. Social media platforms are now providing a corrective, 
with some users suggesting the film isn’t quite the anticipated disaster, and 
is entertaining for the younger end of the target audience.

 Jurassic World - video review 
Celebrating its ninth week in the Top 10, Jurassic World has now grossed 
£63.3m. The weekend saw it rise another place in the all time box office chart, 
overtaking The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring to nab eighth 
position. (Adjusted for inflation, it would be a whole other story.)Jurassic 
World <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-world> now looks unlikely to 
ascend any further in the all-time chart, since seventh-placed Harry Potter and 
the Philosopher’s Stone has £66.1m. (The top six films of all time in the UK 
are Skyfall, Avatar, Titanic, Toy Story 3, Harry Potter and the Deathly 
Hallows: Part 2 and Mamma Mia!)

Chart veteran 2: Minions

Minions review – boisterous and cheery Despicable Me spin-off
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/minions-review-boisterous-and-cheery-despicable-me-spin-off>
With £41.8m to date, Minions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/minions-review-boisterous-and-cheery-despicable-me-spin-off>
 has just overtaken the highest-grossing release of 2014, which wasThe Hobbit: 
The Battle of the Five Armies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/11/the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-review-packs-a-punch>
, with £41.3m. Which means that so far this year three films (the others are 
Jurassic World andAvengers: Age of Ultron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/21/avengers-age-of-ultron-review-film-joss-whedon-exhilarating>
) have grossed more than 2014’s biggest hit. That tally is likely to rise to 
five by the timeSpectre <https://www.theguardian.com/film/spectre> (arriving in 
October) andStar Wars: The Force Awakens 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/star-wars-episode-vii> (December) have ended 
their runs. Minions grossed £1.8m over the past seven days, and is currently 
declining by about 50% each week. On that basis, it looks unlikely to match the 
box office of the Universal Illumination franchise’s top performer,Despicable 
Me 2 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/27/despicable-me-2-review>. 

Rival animation Inside Out now stands at £22.8m, after 17 days of play. That 
puts it ahead of the lifetime of Pixar’sBrave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/09/brave-review> (£22.2m) and in 
spitting distance ofWALL-E 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/18/animation> (£22.9m). Next in its 
sights: Toy Story (£24.3m, including the3D rerelease 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/01/toy-story-3d-review>) and 
Ratatouille <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/oct/12/animation.bradbird> 
(£24.8m).

The arthouse alternatives

Creeping back into the Top 10 in its sixth week of release, Amy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/amy-winehouse-review-documentary> 
took another £96,000 at the weekend, for a cumulative total of £3.25m. That was 
enough to take Amy past director Asif Kapadia’s ownSenna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/02/senna-film-review> (£3.17m), 
previously the fourth-biggest non-concert documentary at the UK box office, 
behind Fahrenheit 9/11 (£6.55m), Deep Sea 3D (£3.40m) and March of the Penguins 
(£3.31m). Amy should have no problem overtaking both Deep Sea and Penguins, 
thereby becoming the second-biggest non-concert documentary of all time in the 
UK. If concert films are included, only two have grossed more than any of the 
above-mentioned titles: Michael Jackson’s This Is It (£9.80m) and One 
Direction: This Is Us (£8m).

 The Diary of a Teenage Girl - video review 
Landing in 12th place in the weekend chart is The Diary of a Teenage Girl, 
with £81,000 from 80 cinemas, including £3,200 in previews. Distributor Vertigo 
faced the challenge of having a film with potential teen appeal, but an 18 
certificate that denied access to a big chunk of that audience. Reviews were 
enthusiastic, includinga five-star rave in The Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/06/the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl-review-coming-of-age-comedy>
. Acclaimed Spanish cop dramaMarshland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/06/marshland-review-true-detective-in-post-franco-spain>
 achieved a similar screen average with £37,100 from 32 sites, including 
previews of £2,600. Despite very strong reviews, smart genre filmThe Gift 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/06/the-gift-review-a-sly-thriller-of-social-transgressions>
 didn’t get much traction at independent cinemas. Playing overwhelmingly in 
multiplexes, Joel Edgerton’s directorial debut grossed £585,000 from 333 venues.

The record-breaker

With £3.75m so far, Secret Cinema’s presentation of The Empire Strikes Back 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/12/secret-cinema-the-empire-strikes-back-review-the-force-is-weak-with-this-one>
 had become the biggest ever box office hit in the event cinema category, 
overtaking its ownBack to the Future event 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/31/secret-cinema-back-to-the-future-olympic-park>
 last year (£3.54m). The Empire Strikes Back is currently 58 days into its 
100-date run. Secret Cinema is somewhat anomalous in the event-cinema category, 
which usually means a live performance beamed into multiple cinemas – such as 
the National Theatre’s War Horse, currently No 3 in the chart with £2.93m. 
Secret Cinema involves the showing of a film as part of the immersive 
interactive visitor experience, and in a single location, and really deserves a 
box office chart all its own.
