With their sitcoms 30 Rock and Parks & Recreation both now over and their 
hugely successful stint as Golden Globes hosts also at an end, Tina Fey andAmy 
Poehler <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amy-poehler> have teamed up for a 
new big screen comedy.

Sisters stars the pair as, yep, sisters who come together to hold one final 
party in their childhood home before it gets sold. Fey and Poehler previously 
teamed up in the 2008 comedy Baby Mama and took on the roles of corporate stiff 
and free spirit, respectively. Now the tables have turned and Poehler is “the 
perfect sister” while Fey is “the other sister”.

The trailer also teases some of the film’s cameos, which include fellow 
Saturday Night Live stars Maya Rudolph, Bobby Moynihan and Kate McKinnon as 
well as professional wrestler John Cena, who also stars in Amy Schumer’s new 
romantic comedy Trainwreck.

The film opens against Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the US and Fey has 
already joked that the comedy will “crush” the sci-fi blockbuster.

 * Sisters opens in the US on 18 December and the UK on 11 March
