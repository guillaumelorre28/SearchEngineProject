Suitcases are artfully arranged in the hotel entrance hall … and a striking 
campaign poster opposite the check-in desk urges an end to migrant deaths in 
the Mediterranean. Receptionist Dinis knows a bit about the journey. While “not 
in a small boat like those coming recently”, the 29-year-old from Guinea-Bissau 
tells me he also came toEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
smuggled aboard a ship.

A teenage activist who exposed corruption, Dinis fled his home and is now 
among a team of multilingual former asylum seekers staffing theMagdas Hotel 
<http://www.magdas-hotel.at/home/> in Vienna. This former retirement home was 
turned into a boutique hotel with €1.5m loan from the charityCaritas 
<http://www.caritas.org/> and €60,000 raised through crowdfunding. With 
individual design touches in each of its 78 rooms, its retro style, including 
knitted lampshades and sassy murals, have been charming guests since it opened 
near the city’sPrater <http://www.prater.at/GeneralInformation.php?LI=1> park 
in February.

Of the 28 staff, 20 arrived in Austria as refugees, and the project’s 
underlying purpose is to offer them jobs and training. “We also want to make a 
political statement that whoever is inAustria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/austria> legally should also be able to work 
legally,” says Martin Gantner of Caritas. “It’s pointless for society that 
these people remain unemployed for so long; they often have many untapped 
skills.”

Asylum seekers in Austria (as in the UK) are rarely granted the right to work 
before their application is processed. For 38-year-old Maryam, who greets 
guests at breakfast in several languages, this took until 12 years after she 
escaped her native Morocco, where she was persecuted for being a lesbian.

Thousands like her face long periods of forced unemployment, and difficulties 
in finding jobs afterwards. “Every day we read in the newspapers about Europe’s 
immigration ‘problem,’” says Gantner. “We’re trying to offer solutions. Through 
Magdas, people are learning different ways of relating to migrants.”

The hotel’s workers are paid according to industry standards, from around 
€20,000 a year for the least-qualified.

Dinis is one of the better-educated but even he received numerous rejection 
letters before starting at Magdas, whose “stay open-minded” philosophy he says 
means real career prospects. Ehsan, a shy 24-year-old who walked alone for more 
than six months to escape the Taliban in Afghanistan, says he’s found a new 
family among fellow staff.

Magdas (“mag das”) is a wordplay essentially suggesting you should “like 
this”. As the 1950s-chic bar fills up with music and chatter on a weekend 
evening, it’s clear that guests, staff and the local volunteers who complete 
this social enterprise genuinely do.
