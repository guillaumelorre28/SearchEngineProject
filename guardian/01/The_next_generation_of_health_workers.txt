Boka Dugassa gestures proudly towards a hand-drawn poster on the wall of the 
delivery room. "It's an important tool, and it's easy to understand," he says, 
surrounded by a gaggle of beaming health extension workers (HEWs) who have been 
learning how to deliver babies.

Dugassa has good reason to be proud. As head of health extension at Fitche 
Health Science College, he is responsible for the 167 students on the HEW 
training programme. The facilities at Fitche are basic – sparsely furnished 
classrooms, a handful of computers and two demonstration areas equipped with 
plastic dolls – but for the students, the theoretical instruction they receive 
here is the essential foundation for the practical experience they later gain 
at health posts and centres.

HEW training is also an opportunity for the instructors to push themselves 
professionally. "When I was working as a nurse, I was not keeping up to date," 
Dugassa explains. "I was simply treating cases, but I wanted to keep on reading 
and learning." Through a competitive process he was selected to become an HEW 
instructor, and after only a fortnight's training, he began his new job.

There are still many obstacles to overcome. Teaching resources are much 
improved thanks to textbooks produced by the African NGO Amref, but there is no 
standardised system for teacher training. "We have received the curriculum, but 
it's not enough," says Dugassa. "We just prepare PowerPoint [presentations] for 
the modules and teach from that. It's challenging work." But Dugassa refuses to 
be discouraged: he is already a graduate, and hopes his position at Fitche will 
set him on course to begin a master's degree.
