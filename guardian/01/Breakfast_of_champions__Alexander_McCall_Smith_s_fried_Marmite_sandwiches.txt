The novelist loves fried Marmite sandwiches, ideally cooked over a campfire 
for extra smokiness. Soft white bread is your best bet for these, and make them 
with or without the cheese: both are delicious.

Serves one 
Butter two slices of soft white bread on both sides. Top one with a generous 
smear of Marmite and the other with slices of cheddar. Lay the Marmited slice 
on top of the cheese, then lay the sandwich in a hot frying pan on a medium 
heat. (Add a knob of butter to the pan, if you like, although the butter on the 
outside of the sandwich should suffice).

Cook until golden brown on one side, then flip to cook the other – if you are 
using cheese, it’s important not to have the pan too hot, to give it a chance 
to melt. Once both sides are golden and the cheese is oozing, remove from the 
pan, leave to cool for a minute or two (biting into molten cheese is not fun), 
then eat.
