British troops have arrived in Somalia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia> as part of efforts to tackle the 
threat from Islamist militants.

The military personnel, the first of up to 70 due to be deployed there this 
year, are part of a UN peacekeeping mission to counter the extremist group
Al-Shabaab <https://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab>.

The group of about 10 soldiers will offer medical, engineering and logistical 
support to the African Union Mission in Somalia.

The move reinforces the UK’s commitment to targeting terrorism around the 
world, said the defence secretary, Michael Fallon.

He added: “This deployment is another demonstration of the flexibility and 
global reach of our armed forces.

“Alongside our efforts in Iraq, Syria and Nigeria, it shows our determination 
to tackle terrorism wherever it rears its head.”

Announcing the deployment in September

 as he prepared to attend a summit at the UN general assembly in New York, 
David Cameron said “all the right force protection arrangements” would be put 
in place to minimise the risk of harm.

The prime minister also announced personnel would be sent to South Sudan – 
where inter-tribal fighting has forced people from their homes and left 
millions facing a severe food shortage – to provide engineering work to 
strengthen infrastructure.

The assignments are part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review pledge 
to double the number of UK troops on UN peacekeeping tasks from the 300 
currently deployed.
