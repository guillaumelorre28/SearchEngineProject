Peter Mashaka is a full-time English and biology teacher at a primary school 
in Mfenesini, an area of Stone Town, the capital of Zanzibar. He dedicates his 
free time to working as a community-based mobiliser (CBM) for Marie 
Stopes Tanzania.

Access to family planning services is particularly low in rural areas, where 
there are fewer health facilities. CBMs are trained to distribute 
contraception, provide counselling, teach people how to use condoms and refer 
clients to clinics for further services. Three times a week, Mashaka speaks to 
local youth groups and makes home visits.

His work has been met with some resistance – in February, a 16-year-old girl 
to whom he had given contraceptive pills was beaten by her parents. But young 
people are increasingly coming to him for advice. The sexual and reproductive 
health curriculum at primary school is limited.

"The ministry of education does not allow teaching of family planning," 
Mashaka says. "HIV education is all about abstinence. We need to concentrate 
more efforts on educating men."

Resistance to family planning is common among men, either because they don't 
like condoms or believe children are a gift from God, each with a blessing.

"More male CBMs are needed, because in this culture women are often still too 
shy to talk about sexual health in front of men – especially when demonstrating 
use of condoms," Mashaka says. "But a man can easily demonstrate to his fellow 
man."
