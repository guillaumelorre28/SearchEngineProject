A number of disappointed readers were shocked at the absence of Steve Winwood 
from our list. Labelled by user Aqueuetangle as “one of the greatest voices in 
rock music”, the musician was just 17 when the Spencer Davis Group topped the 
UK charts with single Keep on Running. The artist went on to forge a successful 
solo career, earning two Grammy awards for his single Higher Love.

“No Kate Bush? Come on, this list doesn’t mean anything if an 18-year-old Kate 
Bush <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kate-bush> isn’t on there,” says user 
manic_bunny, and a number of other readers agree. The British singer rose to 
fame in 1978 with her much-loved debut single Wuthering Heights. The song 
topped the UK singles chart for an impressive four weeks, making the talented 
youngster the first female artist to gain a British No 1 with a self-penned 
song.

Sixties starlet Helen Shapiro had a successful, if brief, pop career during 
her teenage years, with her surprisingly mature voice earning her four UK top 
three singles between the ages of 14 and 15. Though her career seemed to end as 
quickly as it began, the teen still had time to rack up an impressive list of 
achievements, including a 19-week chart run with hit Walkin’ Back to Happiness, 
and a UK headline tour – with newly signed band the Beatles as her support.

Of the many teen R&B stars of the 90s, user babylonia says Aaliyah was by far 
the one who had the greatest “impact and merit”. After signing to Jive Records 
at the age of 12, Aaliyah released three successful studio albums, including 
the double platinumOne in a Million. Despite her untimely death in 2001 (the 
singer was sadly killed in a plane crash at the age of 22),Aaliyah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aaliyah> has come to be regarded as one of 
the artists who helped revolutionise 90s R&B. She has been listed byBillboard 
as the 10th most successful female R&B artist of the past 25 years and the 27th 
most successful of all time.

A number of our readers thought Lulu should have been included on the list, 
having released a version of the Isley Brothers’ Shout aged 15. The Lulu and 
the Luvvers single reached No 7 in the UK charts thanks to the singer’s 
distinctive vocals. At such a young age, this was clearly something to shout 
about...

Vanessa Paradis <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/vanessa-paradis> shot to 
international fame at the age of 14 with her single Joe Le Taxi. The song 
topped the French singles charts for an incredible 11 weeks, before going on to 
reach No 3 in the UK charts the following year – an impressive feat for a song 
sung entirely in French.

Love or hate her, user HunkyPants says that Britney is a “global superstar” 
who “exploded” as a teenager and deserves a place on this list. Her debut album,
...Baby One More Time, sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, making it 
the bestselling album by a teenage solo artist and one of the bestselling 
albums of all time. It might drive you crazy, but there’s no denying the 
singer’s success.

“Listen to Debbie Gibson’s intro to Only in My Dreams on her Top of the Pops 
debut in 1987, then you can rearrange your list,” writes user Carlos Hughes. 
The 80s dance-pop single, written by Gibson, reached No 4 on the US Billboard 
Hot 100 singles chart when the singer was just 16. She made history the 
following year, becoming the youngest person ever to write, sing and produce a 
No 1 single, with Foolish Beat.

As user TheOverload says, “Van Morrison was singing in the womb.” OK, maybe 
not, but the Brown Eyed Girl star did begin his professional career while still 
just a teen. He started out playing a variety of instruments for Irish 
showbands, before going on to tour Europe with local band the Monarchs at the 
age of 17. He has since been knighted for his services to the music industry.

User Jason Ma thinks that Justin Bieber

earning him a loyal following of Beliebers.
