I floated this image in the canal for a week. It's a photograph of the place 
where I floated it. The water peeled away the layers of emulsion within the 
transparency to reveal the different colours embedded in the film. There's a 
kaleidoscopic effect as the light dances and ripples through them â€“ just as it 
did on the surface of the canal.

I thought of it for Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> because it seems frosty, 
like those sparkly white lines you get on leaves in the morning in winter. And 
the way the image decomposed was like a small miracle.
