Vinyl, Martin Scorcese and Mick Jagger’s drama about the music biz is set in 
New York in 1973. As such, it’s very fashionable. Here was a city caught 
between a retro shot ripe for a regram and something that’s not too out of 
reach now. It’s got cult cool, with the beginnings of disco, of punk and of hip 
hop. It’sAndy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/29/andy-warhols-intimate-polaroids-from-divine-to-bianca-jagger>
, it’s Patti, it’s Max’s, it’s boys dressed as girls and 
girls-in-leather-jacket bands. It’s the year when the World Trade Center 
opened, as didCBGBs, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/01/every-night-different-band-cbgb-punk-photographs-bettie-ringma-ramones-blondie>
 but it’s pre-gentrification, where there was a sort of no-one’s-looking 
permissiveness. With the city running a $3bn budget deficit by 1975, New York’s 
decaying buildings and abandoned warehouses allowed all sorts of scenes and 
styles to develop. Vinyl, the story of a record label, its stars and its 
coke-addled execs, touches on a lot of them. Sort of likeMad Men

It’s the sweet spot where punk and disco meet

Juno Temple, who plays sandwich girl aka drug administrator Jamie Vine, is a 
good point of reference here. In her ambitions to go from said job to her 
desired position in the A & R department, she deftly moves across all the 
scenes around the city. In the first episode, she goes from a punk gig wearing 
a leather jacket and loads of silver eyeliner, and enjoys an encounter with Kip 
Stevens (aka James Jagger). Fast forward a bit and she’s off to a loft party in 
the appropriate – and fabulous – red satin jumpsuit and cropped faux-fur 
chubby. Special mention here goes to Jagger Junior’s resemblance toRichard Hell 
<https://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://hilobrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Richard-Hell.jpg&imgrefurl=http://hilobrow.com/2015/10/02/richard-hell/&h=374&w=280&tbnid=DsW4V-jVNodpwM:&tbnh=186&tbnw=139&docid=vCNWQGh89-N0_M&itg=1&usg=__zI7HB7WkcseI9E8p9Zl0Ubasqpc=>

There’s a leftover hippy vibe

However you dress it up – call it bohemian if you want – fashion has a soft 
spot for hippy style. Olivia Wilde’s Devon, the long-suffering wife of record 
exec Richie Finestra, provides it here, through an impressive array of kaftans. 
They’re worn with oversized sunglasses and long hair, for a sort of jetset 
version of a Woodstock look. This suits fashion, whether it’s havinga Rachel 
Zoe moment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2012/nov/19/rachel-zoe-look-catwalks-2013>
 or thinking of howKate Moss <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss> 
might accessorise her cigarette and lounger for her next winter sun getaway. If 
the fake Nico who turns up her house going on about Andy and Lou is anything to 
go by, Devon has a Warhol Superstar past too. The Factory! That’s another inspo 
category checked, then.

It always brings the party

The 70s were, as even the most entry-level student of pop culture knows, the 
era of D-I-S-C-O. And a lot of that happened in New York. Left unsupervised, it 
became a centre of in-the-know hedonism at private parties likethe Loft 
<http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/248-the-loft/>, which began in DJ David 
Mancuso’s apartment in Soho. The opening scene of Vinyl sees Bobby Cannavale’s 
Finestra snort coke off his own car mirror, chopped up with a policeman’s 
business card. He then follows a group of outlandishly dressed boys and girls 
as they go into a party in an abandoned building, walks past someone performing 
oral sex on a staircase and watches a performance by a New York Dolls-esque 
band. That is New York in the 70s as far as modern pop culture is concerned. 
Drink it in, fashion.

The collars are impressive

Sometimes it’s less about mood, and more clothes. If all of fashion loves the 
70s, it’sGucci <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci>’s Alessandro Michele 
who is the biggest retro geek. He would love the tailoring in Vinyl, that comes 
with those oversized collars once worn by all men without a whisper of irony. 
Richie’s suits are all about the big – collar, lapel, trouser leg – and worn 
with the open neck and gold chain you’d expect of a man who has more than a bit 
of theTony Montero <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq4ZMKqWk80> about him. Ato 
Essandoh’s casual look as Lester Grimes – poloshirts rather than crisp cotton – 
is more wearable in 2016. London Fashion Week’sGrace Wales Bonner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/apr/09/grace-wales-bonner-menswears-designer-fashion-chanel-blaxploitation>
 had similar styles in her most recent collection.

It predated our idea of am-to-pm dressing

Mad Men only just made it into the 70s, so Vinyl provides the study of the 
decade’s office style. The office of record company American Century is in a 
high rise, comes with that lift moment where the exec arrives, to a secretary 
who bears messages (Richie’s are from Lester Bangs and David Geffen obvs), a 
smoking policy and loads of boardrooms with big glossy tables. The clothes are 
also awesome. Who doesn’t want to work somewhere where men can wear patchwork 
jackets and neckerchiefs and women are in high sandals, flares and puff 
sleeves? Anyone who discounts the 70s daywear is clearly not readingthe fashion 
memo

 properly.
