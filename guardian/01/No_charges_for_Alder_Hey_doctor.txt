 Dick van Velzen, the pathologist who secretly stockpiled hundreds of dead 
children's organs at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool, will not be prosecuted, 
it emerged yesterday.
Christopher Enzor, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: "We advised there 
was no prospect of being able to establish that a criminal offence had been 
committed."

Prof van Velzen was suspended by the General Medical Council in February 2001, 
but the investigation was suspended pending police inquiries. Yesterday a GMC 
spokeswoman said it would now be resumed.

Alice Proctor, of the Alder Hey family support group Pity II, said: "We are 
appalled that Prof van Velzen will not be prosecuted ... We are now waiting for 
the General Medical Council decision."

Ian Cohen, a solicitor who represents many of the families, said: "We would 
urge parliament to get the Human Tissue Act onto the statute book as soon as 
possible, because it provides proper protection," he said. "The fact that 
someone like Van Velzen is immune from criminal proceedings reinforces the 
urgency of this."
