Night time politics

Righteo, I’m off like a fish in the sun.

Today, we know:

 * Turnbull has consulted his department for advice on the dispute between 
attorney general George Brandis and solicitor general Justin Gleeson. He stood 
by Brandis but says both men have his confidence.

 * Julia Gillard says abuse of women in politics deters them from careers.

 * Wayne Swan called on the BHP board to explain their tax policies, accusing 
the big miner of avoiding tax through Singapore. BHP said they pay their fair 
share. 
 * Pauline Hanson has won favour from the government, with the Coalition 
agreeing give her a government spot on a parliamentary committee - not 
something any party gives up easily.

 * Foreign powers could present a cyber security attack but the government 
will not name which ones

 * Resources minister Matt Canavan is bitterly disappointed that BP is pulling 
out of oil drilling in the Great Australian Bight.

 * The Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong addressed the parliament on the Australian 
Singapore relationship.

 * The high court chucked out a case of four former ministers trying to 
protect their parliamentary perks relating to the life time gold pass.

Thanks for your company, as always. And thanks to Gareth Hutchens, Paul Karp, 
Katharine Murphyand Mike Bowers.

Tomorrow Thursday which means it is the last sitting day this week. But then, 
we have Brandis and Gleeson appearing at the senate committee on Friday.

Goodnight.

I have tracked down Tony Burke’s amendment to the International Tax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tax-australia> Agreements bill.

As a result the house agreed to call on “the government to explain why it has 
failed to close tax loopholes and increase transparency in Australia”.

Katharine Murphy reports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/12/pauline-hanson-gets-prized-nationals-spot-on-nbn-committee>
 on an odd story of the government giving up a precious number on a senate 
committee forPauline Hanson.

The Turnbull government has removed a veteran Nationals senator from the 
membership of a parliamentary committee to give one of its own spots to Pauline 
Hanson.

John Williams has confirmed he stepped aside from the parliament’s national 
broadband network committee to accommodate Hanson’s request to participate.

Hanson had tussled with the Nick Xenophon Team senator Stirling Griff for 
membership on the committee, but Griff secured support from Labor and the 
Greens, giving him the numbers in a ballot to take the spot

After she lost the ballot, the government asked Williams to stand back from 
the NBN committee to accommodate the One Nation leader.

This turn of events is unusual; the major parties guard their positions on 
parliamentary committees.

Righteo, I’m off like a fish in the sun.

Today, we know:

 * Turnbull has consulted his department for advice on the dispute between 
attorney general George Brandis and solicitor general Justin Gleeson. He stood 
by Brandis but says both men have his confidence.

 * Julia Gillard says abuse of women in politics deters them from careers.

 * Wayne Swan called on the BHP board to explain their tax policies, accusing 
the big miner of avoiding tax through Singapore. BHP said they pay their fair 
share. 
 * Pauline Hanson has won favour from the government, with the Coalition 
agreeing give her a government spot on a parliamentary committee - not 
something any party gives up easily.

 * Foreign powers could present a cyber security attack but the government 
will not name which ones

 * Resources minister Matt Canavan is bitterly disappointed that BP is pulling 
out of oil drilling in the Great Australian Bight.

 * The Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong addressed the parliament on the Australian 
Singapore relationship.

 * The high court chucked out a case of four former ministers trying to 
protect their parliamentary perks relating to the life time gold pass.

Thanks for your company, as always. And thanks to Gareth Hutchens, Paul Karp, 
Katharine Murphyand Mike Bowers.

Tomorrow Thursday which means it is the last sitting day this week. But then, 
we have Brandis and Gleeson appearing at the senate committee on Friday.

Goodnight.
 
I have tracked down Tony Burke’s amendment to the International Tax 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tax-australia> Agreements bill.

As a result the house agreed to call on “the government to explain why it has 
failed to close tax loopholes and increase transparency in Australia”.

You might ask which minister was in the Parliament at the time?
Answer: Kelly O'Dwyer Minister for Revenue with responsibility for tax

That means the house of reps now has a unanimous resolution about how bad the 
government is on multinational tax avoidance.

Katharine Murphy reports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/12/pauline-hanson-gets-prized-nationals-spot-on-nbn-committee>
 on an odd story of the government giving up a precious number on a senate 
committee forPauline Hanson.

The Turnbull government has removed a veteran Nationals senator from the 
membership of a parliamentary committee to give one of its own spots to Pauline 
Hanson.

John Williams has confirmed he stepped aside from the parliament’s national 
broadband network committee to accommodate Hanson’s request to participate.

Hanson had tussled with the Nick Xenophon Team senator Stirling Griff for 
membership on the committee, but Griff secured support from Labor and the 
Greens, giving him the numbers in a ballot to take the spot

After she lost the ballot, the government asked Williams to stand back from 
the NBN committee to accommodate the One Nation leader.

This turn of events is unusual; the major parties guard their positions on 
parliamentary committees.
