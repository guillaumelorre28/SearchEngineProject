The number of antibiotics being prescribed to patients by GPs in England has 
fallen significantly, latest figures show.

According to NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> Improvement, 
prescriptions for all types of the drug were down by more than 2.6m, compared 
with last year, to about 34m in 2015-16.

Heralding the drop as a “fantastic result” the health watchdog said the 
figures showed doctors were being careful not to over-prescribe antibiotics, 
the BBC reported.

It is part of a wider drive to stop harmful infections developing resistance 
to antibiotics.

Prescriptions for broad-spectrum antibiotics fell by 16%, from 3.9m 
prescriptions in 2014-15 to 3.3m the following year.

Dr Mike Durkin, from NHS Improvement, said: “This [is a] fantastic result 
achieved in just one year.”

Adding that too many people suffer and lose their lives due to 
antibiotic-resistant infections, he continued: “At a time when the NHS has 
advanced in many areas of patient care, science and technology, we must work to 
prevent healthcare going backwards to a time where antibiotics are no longer 
fighting infections.

“This is why efforts in the NHS to reduce the overprescribing of antibiotics 
are crucial, and these latest figures are a significant step forward in this 
fight.”
