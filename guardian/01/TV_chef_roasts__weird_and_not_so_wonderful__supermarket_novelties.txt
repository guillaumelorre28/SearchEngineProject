 TV chef Antony Worrall Thompson yesterday launched a blistering attack on the 
food industry for its obsession with "weird and not so wonderful" products.
 After speaking at the International New Products Forum in London last week, 
Mr Worrall Thompson, a regular contributor to BBC's Ready, Steady, Cook, 
criticised supermarkets for filling their shelves with new products that nobody 
wanted, in lieu of traditional British foods and fresh produce.

 Among the food innovations which roused his ire at the forum were beefburger 
shaped sweets, a clear fruit drink with floating orange balls, KP Nutsters - 
peanuts in cheese and onion or salt and vinegar flavour - and Tre Valli 
Fiordueve Limoncelle, which he describes as "the most disgusting 
lemon-flavoured yellow cream in an aerosol can". "There's variety, and then 
there's coming up with something for its own sake," he said.

 More than 200 new products were presented at the forum, which was organised 
by the Leatherhead Food Research Association.

 Of 3,000 new product lines launched in Britain annually, only 10 per cent 
prove a lasting success.

 David Sawday, corporate affairs manager for Tesco which launches more than a 
1,000 new product lines each year, said that the demand was customer led.

 "Customers want new taste experiences at great value, without having to go to 
a restaurant, which may explain why Anthony is feeling aggrieved."

 Mr Worrall Thompson is one of nearly 100 culinary campaigners to join a 
Greenpeace co-ordinated campaign against genetically modified food.
