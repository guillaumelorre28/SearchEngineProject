FROM Hosein Mortada

In my opinion, we should be in control of all public spaces every evening 
including nights from 1500 to 2100 ...

At the same time, in these public spaces there should be groups of people that 
belong to us - Abbasid Square, Ummayad Square, Saba'a Bahrat roundabout, 
outside the Governorate buidling - in order not to leave them to others.

The opposition tends to move with the presence of the Observers' mission, by 
doing this we block the way for them to get to any of these public spaces â€¦
