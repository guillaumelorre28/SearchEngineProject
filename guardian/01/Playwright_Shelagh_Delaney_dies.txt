The playwright Shelagh Delaney, best known for her 1958 play A Taste of Honey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/a-taste-of-honey>, has died at the age of 71.

Delaney's agent, Jane Villiers, said on Monday that the writer had died of 
cancer at her daughter's home in eastern England on Sunday night.

Delaney was 19 when A Taste of Honey premiered. The story of a pregnant young 
woman's supportive relationship with a gay artist verged on scandalous at the 
time, but the play had successful runs in London and New York.

A Taste of Honey was made into a film in 1961, and Delaney and the film's 
director, Tony Richardson, shared Bafta and Writers' Guild awards for best 
screenplay.
