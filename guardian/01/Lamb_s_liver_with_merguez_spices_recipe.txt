This fabulous north African spice mix, based on coriander, caraway and cumin, 
is traditionally used to flavour merguez sausage. The blend is also wonderful 
in this simple dish, a delicious way to serve lamb's liver. It goes without 
saying that the liver should be extremely fresh.

Serves 2

300g fresh lamb's liver, thinly sliced
½ a medium onion, thinly sliced
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp ground caraway
1 tsp ground cumin
A pinch of smoked paprika
A pinch of cayenne pepper
1 garlic clove, finely sliced
½ tbsp rapeseed or olive oil
Small knob of unsalted butter
Salt and black pepper

To serve
Thick toast and green salad

1. Put the liver and onion in a bowl with all the spices, the garlic and the 
oil. Toss together with your hands then cover and leave for 20 minutes.

2. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat. When it's good and hot, add the 
liver mixture, making sure it's well spread out. Throw in the knob of butter 
too. Let the liver sear for about 1 minute, then give it a good stir or toss 
and cook for a minute or so more.

3. Season, then serve straight away on toast, trickling over any juices from 
the pan. Serve with a salad.
