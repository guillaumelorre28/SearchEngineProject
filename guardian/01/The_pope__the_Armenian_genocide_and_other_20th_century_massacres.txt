The Turkish foreign ministry’s criticism of the pope’s statement describing 
the Armenian genocide as the first genocide of the 20th century is revealing (

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/12/pope-boosts-armenias-efforts-to-have-ottoman-killings-recognised-as-genocide>
, 13 April). It has called the statement discriminatory because it only 
mentions the pain suffered by Armenian Christians and not that of Ottoman 
Muslims and other groups. It suggests that Ottoman Muslims, Armenian 
Christians, Orthodox Greek Christians, Assyrian Christians and Yazidis suffered 
equally during the first world war.

This deliberately clouds the fact that while Ottoman Muslims largely suffered 
due to the privations of war, the latter groups, including Armenians, suffered 
as a consequence of a planned and coordinated campaign to homogenise Anatolia 
by the Young Turk government during the war and by the subsequent Kemalist 
government.

The fact that the Turkish foreign ministry has acknowledged the suffering of 
these other groups perhaps opens the door for the Turkish state to recognise 
that the Armenians were the key victim group of this policy of state 
reorganisation.

• In the hope of reconciling the Orthodox Christian and Catholic churches 
(Christianity’s two largest denominations), it would be very helpful if the 
pope acknowledged and apologised for one of the most savage genocides in human 
history, which occurred during the second world war in the Nazi-puppet 
“independent” state ofCroatia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/croatia>.

Hundreds of thousands of Serbian Orthodox Christians, Jews and Gypsies were 
systematically murdered (estimates range as high as one million). Hundreds of 
thousands more were ethnically cleansed and forcibly converted to Roman
Catholicism <https://www.theguardian.com/world/catholicism> by Croatian 
Catholic priests. There has been abundant evidence uncovered that has 
documented the role of the Vatican in this little-known genocide, including the 
assisted escape of thousands of Croatian Ustashe war criminals via the 
Vatican-established “ratlines”.

In the spirit of seeking to heal these long-festering wounds in the Balkans 
and restoring trust between the Catholic and Othodox Churches, it is high time 
for theVatican <https://www.theguardian.com/world/vatican> to finally 
acknowledge and apologise for its role in fomenting and abetting this horrible 
genocide.

• Regarding “the first genocide of the 20th century”, the pope seems not to 
know about the German army’s attempt to eliminate the Herero nation of South 
WestAfrica <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> (now Namibia) in 1904. 
The Herero were encircled, with only a narrow corridor of escape leading into 
the Kalahari desert. They were driven past the final water hole and left in 
their thousands to die.

• International recognition of the Armenian atrocity is very long overdue, but 
I’d always considered the first genocide of the 20th century was the unrecorded 
masses of Afrikaners who died in the British invention of concentration camps 
during the Boer war, 1899-1902.
