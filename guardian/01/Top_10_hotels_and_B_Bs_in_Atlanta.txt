Urban Oasis Bed and Breakfast

Bright and playful, Urban Oasis recognises that not every traveller wants a 
boudoir furnished for an Agatha Christie novel. Instead of stuffy antiques, the 
decor of this spacious four-bedroom Inman Park loft goes almost overboard with 
contemporary accents: lime green walls, bold blue stripes, geometric patterns 
everywhere – though the palette gets toned down in the comfortable guestrooms. 
The property sits on the newAtlanta BeltLine Eastside Trail 
<http://beltline.org/trails/eastside-trail/>, providing a handy pedestrian path 
that runs all the way toPiedmont Park <http://www.piedmontpark.org/>.

Artmore

This handsome boutique hotel, the reinvention of a historic 1924 apartment 
building with Spanish accents, appears unassuming from the street but the 
interior is a must-see. With 102 guest rooms (including some quirky split-level 
suites, but all with clean modern lines), the Artmore has become a popular 
choice for weddings and other events thanks partly to its courtyard and 
one-of-a-kind fiery fountain. It's within an easy walk to Midtown's many 
museums (hence the name), including the High Museum of Art, the Museum of 
Design Atlanta, and the Center for Puppetry Arts.

The Highland Inn
 Highland Inn, Atlanta 
When a hotel is described as having "lots of character" or "a quirky, vintage 
vibe", it's often code for, "The noisy rooms haven't been updated since the 
last moon landing"(1972, now that you ask). The Highland Inn, established in 
1927, wears its vintage character as a badge of honour: the walls are decorated 
with old metal advertising signs for Dr Pepper, Bette Davis posters etc. Yes, 
it's quirky; yes, the room sizes are irregular; the floors are creaky; the 
street life is loud. The upside? A break from the generic competitors, plus 
incredible value in a prime location between two lively neighbourhoods,
Virginia-Highland <http://www.virginiahighland.com/> and Little Five Points 
<http://littlefivepoints.net/>. Downstairs, the inn's famous Highland Ballroom 
hosts bands, dance parties and literary events.

Shellmont Inn Bed and Breakfast

Although it sits on a busy stretch of Piedmont Avenue only a couple of blocks 
from the commotion of Peachtree Street, the Shellmont Inn gives the impression 
of stepping back to a far less frantic time. The pleasant six-room inn, a 
restored 1891 Victorian home on the National Register of Historic Places, 
includes an irresistible back porch with rocking chairs overlooking a small 
pond. The rooms, while heavy on antiques, are comfortable.

Stonehurst Place

Compared to some of Atlanta's bed and breakfasts, Stonehurst Place can seem 
pricey: the most in-demand rooms go for $429 per night and are booked months in 
advance. Other rooms, such as the The Piedmont – which has a working fireplace 
and its original 1940's bathroom, custom-made draperies and a walk-in closet – 
are more reasonably priced. The gorgeous 1896 estate was the home of a 
prominent Midtown family for more than 100 years. Recent renovations have 
honoured the building's historic pedigree, while room amenities include 
up-to-date technology and modern furnishings.

Glenn Hotel
 Glenn Hotel Atlanta 
If your agenda involves seeing downtown's biggest sites – the Georgia Aquarium 
<http://www.georgiaaquarium.org/>, the World of Coca-Cola 
<http://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/> and CNN Center <http://www.cnn.com/tour/> – 
the Glenn Hotel gets points for proximity. Sitting barely a block away from 
Centennial Olympic Park, the Glenn opened in 2006 after the sweeping conversion 
of a historic 10-storey building. The rooms are smartly furnished but some are 
on the small side. Escape to the SkyLounge rooftop deck, where the panoramic 
view of the downtown skyline is unrivalled.

Ellis Hotel
 Ellis Hotel, Atlanta 
The Ellis Hotel brings something unusual to the Atlanta market: a women's-only 
floor with extra security at the entrance and easy access to the spa. There's 
also a "Fresh Air Floor", where the rooms have been treated to minimise 
allergens and feature always-running air filtering machines. The 127-room hotel 
is definitely geared toward business travellers but it makes for a nice change 
from neighbouring convention hotels.

1890 King-Keith House Bed and Breakfast
 1890 King-Keith House Hotel, Atlanta 
Inman Park is architectural eye candy, a neighbourhood made up of mansions 
dating from the late 19th century and a famous Beaux Arts estate once owned by 
Coca-Cola magnate Asa Candler. But even Callan Castle can scarcely compete with 
the King-Keith House for curb appeal. The flamboyant peach and lavender Queen 
Anne home looks like a storybook creation. Interior furnishings include many 
(very many) period-style antiques among more modern amenities (hot tubs, free 
Wi-Fi). It's certainly not ideal for everyone: those averse to nostalgia, steer 
clear.

Social Goat Bed and Breakfast 
 Social Goat Bed and Breakfast, Atlanta 
Not to be confused with the Goat Farm, a busy Atlanta arts complex, this urban 
farmstead in Grant Park features six lodging options spread out over three 
homes – from a French-themed room in the main house to a one-bedroom 
modern-style apartment built over a three-car garage. Perhaps taking a cue from 
nearbyZoo Atlanta <http://www.zooatlanta.org/#ff_s=rLm6k>, the Social Goat 
doubles as a sort of petting zoo with resident Nigerian goats, chickens, 
rabbits, turkeys and koi – plus three house cats. It's good value and loads of 
fun for the tykes, even if the location requires a 12-15-minute drive to get to 
more dynamic areas of town.

Twelve Hotel Atlantic Station
 Twelve Hotel Atlantic Station, Atlanta 
If you're determined to find a room with a view, Twelve Hotel gets points for 
its personality and choice location. The 26-storey midrise houses residential 
units and hotel rooms, so each of the 101 suites features the amenities of a 
high-end apartment: expansive kitchens, posh baths, ample furniture for 
impromptu parties. Best of all may be the wide balconies – a rarity for local 
hotels. Perched atopAtlantic Station <http://atlanticstation.com/>, a 
transformative city-within-a-city redevelopment that arrived in 2005, Twelve 
delivers easy pedestrian access to a nearby supermarket, cinema, gym and loads 
of shops and restaurants. Its identical sisterTwelve Centennial Park 
<http://www.twelvehotels.com/centennialpark/> sits on the outside edge of the 
downtown tourist district.
