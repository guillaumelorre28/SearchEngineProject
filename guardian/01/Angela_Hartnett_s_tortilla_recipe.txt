I love tortilla – it's such a great way to use up those things languishing at 
the bottom of the fridge. But the Spanish get it so right with the classic 
combination: potatoes, onions and peppers. Experiment to find your own 
favourite, and try adding chilli and spring onions for a bit of spice. I also 
like to mix it up a bit with cheese, leeks and bacon to make more of a 
delicious frittata.

(serves 2)

4 tbsp olive oil
1 potato, diced
1 romano red pepper, sliced
1 onion, sliced
1 clove garlic, sliced
½ tsp green chilli, finely chopped
6 eggs

Splash the oil into a saute pan, add the potatoes and season. Saute for about 
10 minutes, until semi-cooked.

Add the peppers and onion, season and continue to cook for another 10 minutes.

Check the vegetables are cooked, then add the garlic and chilli.

Whisk the eggs, pour over the mix, remove from the stove and cook in the oven 
for five minutes until set but very slightly soft.

Remove from the pan and serve with crisp green salad.
