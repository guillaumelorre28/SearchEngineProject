Final Thoughts

Jonathan Howcroft

A studious, tactical arm-wrestle ended in a draw tonight at Etihad Stadium. It 
delivered a point thatAustralia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>
 would have taken at half-time and one that Japan set out to achieve before 
kick-off.

Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> were excellent in the first 
half, Australia poor. The Socceroos never got to grips with Japan’s concession 
of territory and the Blue Samurai perhaps deserved to be more than a goal up 
after the break. Goalscorer Haraguchi then turned from hero to villain, 
conceding a needless penalty early in the second half to restore Australia’s 
belief and shift the momentum. Thereafter, both sides probed but the clearest 
opportunities fell Japan’s way, though Ryan only had one decent save to make.

Much will be made of Ange Postecoglou’s selections, in particular starting 
with two central strikers and a diamond midfield. The resulting lack of pace 
and width hurt Australia’s chances. The Socceroos looked much more balanced and 
threatening after Robbie Kruse appeared.

Brad Smith stood out all night, marauding down the left hand side and offering 
the best of the home side’s attacking thrust.

Unbeaten after four matches, and still to face whipping boys Thailand, this 
remains a strong start to the final World Cup qualifying phase for Australia. 
Tonight pitted them against a credentialed opponent that came with a defensive 
agenda and showed Australia a massive amount of respect. Russia 2018 is still 
very much on the agenda.

Thanks for joining me, it’s been a hoot, as always. See you next time.

89 min: Set-piece opportunity on the right flank for Australia

86 min: Halilhodzic is furious with a tight offside call against Kagawa. And

Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> relishing opportunities to 
stay down, substitutions, and a few stray passes taking the sting out of the 
game.

Asano the latest substitution, coming on for Honda.

71 min: Australia’s attacking midfield trio seeing more of the ball now with 
Mooy finding space, Luongo energetic and Rogic picking pockets.

Tim Cahill enters the fray with a reception he’s unlikely to receive at this

right, with Juric the lone striker. More space in midfield for Mooy and Rogic.

For all that, Brad Smith remains the most potent outlet and he forces a corner

54 min: That penalty came about through Brad Smith’s lung busting run down the 
left flank afterJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> had enjoyed 
a good spell of possession. He crossed low through the penalty area where Juric 
was running one direction, Haraguchi the other, and the big Socceroo tumbled to 
the turf under contact giving the referee no option but to point to the spot. A 
barely deserved lifeline for the home side in Melbourne and gives the second 
half a different complexion.

50 min: References to Kaiserslautern coming thick and fast now. Japan also had 
a 1-0 half-time lead on that occasion and some bloke named Timothy turned 
things around forAustralia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>. 
He’ll be in action soon I’d expect.

Corner to Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> as the visitors 
enjoy a decent spell of possession and territory. A few near misses for 
Australia’s defence, Spiranovic’s shin sparing some blushes.

So, what does Ange do after the break?

Wade Howland takes a publisher’s approach by email. “Jonathan, Ange’s approach 
made sense on paper, butJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> have 
set up too well and are too determined - never mind the early goal. We need 
Leckie or Kruse on but seems unlikely they’ll both get a run with Cahill and 
Milligan also on the bench. He has to do something though, the man’s got books 
to sell.”

Daniel Barnett with a more innovative approach on the Twitter. 
Daniel Barnett (@danieltbarnett) 
@JPHowcroft <https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft> re Plan B: wonder whether Ange 
has a Back 3 up his sleeve? Could help shore up the back and give the team more 
width?

Half-time - Australia 0-1 Japan

Not the half Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> would 
have wanted. Japan well worth their 1-0 lead, subduing their hosts with a 
diligent defensive display. Big half-time for Ange Postecoglou.

For the note-keepers out there, Massimo Luongo became the second Australian 
booked, for a high boot on Haraguchi.

43 min: It should be added this is a brilliant display by Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan>. Defensively they have shown 
concentration and bite in the tackle, and in possession they’ve been assertive. 
Considering their qualifying campaign so far, this is unexpected.

See 40 min: update below for Australia’s last three minutes in possession.

38 min: Australia’s best moments coming when they’re probing down the flanks. 
The problem is, with no natural wingers in the line-up everything reaches the 
final third and then looks indecisively inboard. That vital trio of Mooy, Rogic 
and Luongo haven’t asserted themselves yet.

Socceroos held by cagey Japan in World Cup qualifying stalemate
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/11/socceroos-held-by-cagey-japan-in-world-cup-qualifying-stalemate> 
A studious, tactical arm-wrestle ended in a draw tonight at Etihad Stadium. It 
delivered a point thatAustralia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>
 would have taken at half-time and one that Japan set out to achieve before 
kick-off.

Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> were excellent in the first 
half, Australia poor. The Socceroos never got to grips with Japan’s concession 
of territory and the Blue Samurai perhaps deserved to be more than a goal up 
after the break. Goalscorer Haraguchi then turned from hero to villain, 
conceding a needless penalty early in the second half to restore Australia’s 
belief and shift the momentum. Thereafter, both sides probed but the clearest 
opportunities fell Japan’s way, though Ryan only had one decent save to make.

Much will be made of Ange Postecoglou’s selections, in particular starting 
with two central strikers and a diamond midfield. The resulting lack of pace 
and width hurt Australia’s chances. The Socceroos looked much more balanced and 
threatening after Robbie Kruse appeared.

Brad Smith stood out all night, marauding down the left hand side and offering 
the best of the home side’s attacking thrust.

Unbeaten after four matches, and still to face whipping boys Thailand, this 
remains a strong start to the final World Cup qualifying phase for Australia. 
Tonight pitted them against a credentialed opponent that came with a defensive 
agenda and showed Australia a massive amount of respect. Russia 2018 is still 
very much on the agenda.

Thanks for joining me, it’s been a hoot, as always. See you next time.

90+4 min: Corner to Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> 
- surely the last action of the match.
 
90+3 min: Nothing much happening here late. A nervous moment at either end 
with dangerous attacking positions wide that neither side can take advantage of.
 
90 min: Just three minutes of added time.

Defender Yuichi Maruyama comes on for his debut in place of the goalscorer 
Genki Haraguchi.
 
89 min: Set-piece opportunity on the right flank for Australia

handball. Luongo with the responsibility in Mooy’s absence and SPIRANOVIC leaps 
like a salmon but heads firmly over the bar. Decent opportunity.
 
88 min: Australia have lost the tempo these last ten minutes and Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> have had the better of the 
goalmouth chances. 1-1 a fair result at this late stage.

86 min: Halilhodzic is furious with a tight offside call against Kagawa. And 
his blood pressure won’t have been helped by a cross fizzing inches in front of 
the sliding Asano with the goal at his mercy.
 
84 min: The game’s just taken a bit of a lull in the last few minutes with 
Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> relishing opportunities to 
stay down, substitutions, and a few stray passes taking the sting out of the

Asano the latest substitution, coming on for Honda.

Kobayashi.

seven yards out and he heads low to the ‘keeper’s right but the Valencia 
stopper leaps and palms the ball around the post.
 
73 min: Good defending from Brad Smith snuffs out a dangerous burst from 
Honda. The Bournemouth fringe player has been excellent tonight.
 
71 min: Australia’s attacking midfield trio seeing more of the ball now with 
Mooy finding space, Luongo energetic and Rogic picking pockets.

Tim Cahill enters the fray with a reception he’s unlikely to receive at this 
ground on Saturday night.
 
68 min: A lull in play with a couple of stoppages favouring Japan. Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> were building a head of steam 
there. From the restart Japan force a corner but can’t force an effort on goal.
 
65 min: Where Japan were retreating in the first half and springing like jacks 
in boxes, they’re now sitting on their heels and allowingAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> time to pick a pass. It’s not 
come together yet with Kruse caught offside and Rogic miscueing a shot, but the 
pendulum has swung the Socceroos’ way.
 
62 min: Kruse is playing to the left of the front three, Luongo now to the 
right, with Juric the lone striker. More space in midfield for Mooy and Rogic. 
Looks a much more dynamic set-up and much harder forJapan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> to congest.

For all that, Brad Smith remains the most potent outlet and he forces a corner 
after neat feet from Rogic. The corner prompts some head tennis resulting in 
one nut on target but it’s an easy catch.Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> pressing.
 
60 min: Questions now for Japan. Do they continue to deny Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>, or open up? Is the collective 
spirit strong enough to resist the Socceroos’ momentum?
 
57 min: Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> a team 
transformed. Energy levels raised, space opening up and chances created. Much 
more promising.

Giannou replaced by Kruse in a move you’d expect will give Australia more 
width and pace, in keeping with the direction of the match.
 
54 min: That penalty came about through Brad Smith’s lung busting run down the 
left flank afterJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> had enjoyed 
a good spell of possession. He crossed low through the penalty area where Juric 
was running one direction, Haraguchi the other, and the big Socceroo tumbled to 
the turf under contact giving the referee no option but to point to the spot. A 
barely deserved lifeline for the home side in Melbourne and gives the second 
half a different complexion.
 
Mile Jedinak keeps a cool head and floats the penalty straight down the middle 
beyond the diving ‘keeper.

Juric fouled by Haraguchi...
 
50 min: References to Kaiserslautern coming thick and fast now. Japan also had 
a 1-0 half-time lead on that occasion and some bloke named Timothy turned 
things around forAustralia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>. 
He’ll be in action soon I’d expect.

Corner to Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> as the visitors 
enjoy a decent spell of possession and territory. A few near misses for 
Australia’s defence, Spiranovic’s shin sparing some blushes.
 
48 min: As you were for the second half with Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> probing from halfway and Japan 
setting up an impenetrable blue wall on front of them. Let the siege continue.

So, what does Ange do after the break?

Wade Howland takes a publisher’s approach by email. “Jonathan, Ange’s approach 
made sense on paper, butJapan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> have 
set up too well and are too determined - never mind the early goal. We need 
Leckie or Kruse on but seems unlikely they’ll both get a run with Cahill and 
Milligan also on the bench. He has to do something though, the man’s got books 
to sell.”

Daniel Barnett with a more innovative approach on the Twitter.

@JPHowcroft <https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft> re Plan B: wonder whether Ange 
has a Back 3 up his sleeve? Could help shore up the back and give the team more 
width?

Not the half Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> would 
have wanted. Japan well worth their 1-0 lead, subduing their hosts with a 
diligent defensive display. Big half-time for Ange Postecoglou.

For the note-keepers out there, Massimo Luongo became the second Australian 
booked, for a high boot on Haraguchi.

45 min: Control C, Control V for Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> with another spell of 
possession with no end product, although the Socceroos were unlucky not to be 
awarded a corner.

43 min: It should be added this is a brilliant display by Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan>. Defensively they have shown 
concentration and bite in the tackle, and in possession they’ve been assertive. 
Considering their qualifying campaign so far, this is unexpected.

See 40 min: update below for Australia’s last three minutes in possession. 
 
40 min: Again Australia look to be improving, but still struggling to get 
through Japan’s massed ranks. The pattern is repetitive, anAustralia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia> midfielder takes possession 
near halfway with 11 Japanese in front of him, he looks left, right, probes 
towards the feet of a tall forward but within seconds there’s a tackle, 
intercept or counterattack.

Ryan McGowan the first yellow card of the night for chopping down Kagawa on 
one of those counterattacks.
 
38 min: Australia’s best moments coming when they’re probing down the flanks. 
The problem is, with no natural wingers in the line-up everything reaches the 
final third and then looks indecisively inboard. That vital trio of Mooy, Rogic 
and Luongo haven’t asserted themselves yet.
 
35 min: Socceroos starting to grow into this game. Luongo trying to go around 
the outside on the left, eventually earning a corner.Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan> have looked solid enough under 
Mooy’s crosses though and clear.

Thomas Ivers has a response to Michael Lynch (26 min tweet) - “In fairness to 
Socceroos fans, we don’t really sing when we’re winning or losing.”
 
32 min: Chance for Australia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/australia>. 
Free-kick, 30-yards out, just to the right of the D. Jedinak shoots in what 
seemed like slow motion, but not as slow as the Japanese ‘keeper who floats to 
his left to punch the ball away. All very Studio Ghibli for a while there.
 Mile Jedinak had little joy during Australia’s first half against Japan.
