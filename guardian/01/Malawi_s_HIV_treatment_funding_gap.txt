"Two years ago we were more reactive," says Humphrey Mdyetseni, from Malawi's 
Office for Nutrition, HIV & Aids. "We would point resources at the fire and 
hope it went out. Now with the change in government, we hope to be more 
proactive … but we are in a transitional phase."

Joyce Banda, president of Malawi since April 2012, is only the second female 
African leader in history. Edith Mkawa, her newly appointed secretary for 
nutrition, HIV & Aids walked into a department with a $200m (£125m) funding gap 
between the costs of providing antiretroviral (ARVs) drugs and her current aid 
funding.

"This margin is only going to get bigger. We predict it will double to $400m 
by 2022," Mkawa says.

ARVs aren't cheap. According to an analysis undertaken by the Malawi National 
Aids Commission, the annual cost for providing ARVs is about $300-$400 per 
person. The UN estimated that in 2009 the GDP per person in Malawi was much the 
same.

Edith Mkawa is reliant on overseas aid, much of which seems to be drying up 
just as they need it most. "The Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria has 
stopped new funding," she says, "we are distressed as to what will happen now."

The HIV prevalence rate in the adult population has fallen for the first time 
– it had been as high as 16%. "Is this evidence that our policies are working?" 
asks Mdyetseni rhetorically, "Yes, yes and yes. But we need financial support 
or all of this hard work will be for nothing."
