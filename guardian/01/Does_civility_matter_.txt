In the aftermath of the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jan/09/usa-arizona>, 
there has been a lot of talk about the poisonous and violent character of 
American political rhetoric, and the way in which this may be corroding 
society. But is it reasonable to expect society to handle profound differences 
without brutality and rudeness?

In particular, religious discussion seems to attract ferocity and dismissal of 
other people's opinions. This raises some deep questions. Is society possible 
without civility? Is politeness itself dishonest and damaging when carried 
beyond a certain point? Should there be different standards of politeness when 
discussing facts and values â€“ is it possible or even desirable to be as rude as 
you like about someone's factual claims while respecting their expressions of 
value?

 Being right is not the same as being better. That should be the starting point 
of civil discourse

 Insult-free arguments are more persuasive ... but then there's the time I 
called creationism 'a bottomless pit of deliberate stupidity'

 Genuine civility equalises power relations and allows those who are quieter to 
be heard too
