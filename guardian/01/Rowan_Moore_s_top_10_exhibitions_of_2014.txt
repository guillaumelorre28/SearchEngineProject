1. Constructing Worlds | Barbican, London

Parking lots in Los Angeles, water towers in Ruhr factories, wooden churches 
in the Depression era: when it comes to architecture,photographers have a taste 
for the overlooked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/27/constructing-worlds-review-barbican-photography-architecture-modern-age>
. They like to seek out places with the aura of an architectural signature, the 
glamour of a famous name.

Such photographers are well represented in Constructing Worlds, which is based 
on the beautifully simple idea of showing images of buildings. It shows the 
work of 18 people who took such pictures, some of whom would call themselves 
artists rather than photographers, fromBerenice Abbott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/27/berenice-abbott-photography-exbition-review>
 in the 1920s and 30s, toHélène Binet 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/apr/15/artsfeatures> in the present 
day.

Apart from the elegance of the concept, the work shown is terrific and 
well-chosen. There is a nice balance of styles, attitudes and subjects. The 
work of well-known architects – such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier and 
Daniel Libeskind – is in fact included, but they are given no special status. 
They are shown as other instances of construction and inhabitation, not 
necessarily better or worse than the parking lots and water towers.

 Walker Evans’s Alabama miner’s house, 1935 ... Constructing Worlds. 
Photograph: The Guardian 
The spread is global, including Mozambique, China, Afghanistan, Europe and 
both Americas, with the United States perhaps more represented than most – in 
the last century, it had both the most fascinating constructions and the most 
active photographers. But, again, everything is shown without prejudice or 
hierarchy. You are left to draw your own conclusions.

Some images are almost pure abstraction. Others are documentary, where 
buildings are used to suggest poverty, war or human struggles not themselves in 
shot.Architecture <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture> is 
shown as evidence of life, which your imagination must then add to each image. 
Simon Norfolk’s view of some trees outside Baghdad looks almost as peaceful as 
a landscape by the Dutch painter Hobbema – until you notice the signs of damage 
caused by fighting.

Constructing Worlds is a great way to understand something about architecture 
unfiltered by the usual categories of good and bad. Each one of the 
photographers is worth attention, but here are some of my favourites: those 
parking lots, shot from above by the artist Ed Ruscha;Iwan Baan’s images of 
modern Caracas 
<http://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-620/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/26/1411753322912/6bfcb4ae-48b5-4a74-b396-e1a1d35147b4-620x372.jpeg>
;Nadav Kander’s vast and melancholy Chinese infrastructure 
<http://i.guim.co.uk/static/w-700/h--/q-95/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/11/1410430820101/5cc23c18-3c31-4b94-a9f7-229a24f72faf-1020x803.jpeg>
