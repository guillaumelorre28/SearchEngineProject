Barbecue summer or washout? Drought or floods? Shivering with cold or 
sweltering in the heat? August can be a fickle month, and over recent years the 
full gamut of weather conditions has been seen in this month.

Some Augusts are baking hot: during the 20th century, those of 1911, 1932, 
1975 and the long hot summer of 1976, all had temperature records broken at 
least somewhere in the UK.

Other Augusts can appear, to us, “unseasonable”: just a year after the 
“perfect summer” of 1911, August 1912 was the coolest and wettest such month on 
record, with the average central England temperature (the records go back to 
1659), below 13C (55.4F) for the first, and so far only, time.

What made this weather all the more surprising was that until then the summer 
of 1912 had been warmer and sunnier than usual.

Some Augusts may not have broken the records for average temperature yet 
nevertheless remain fixed in the memory, perhaps because of the highest peak 
temperatures recorded for the UK. The heatwave of early August 1990 meant the 
temperature in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, smashed the previous record by 
reaching 37.1C degrees, which, at just below 99F, was tantalisingly close to 
the fabled 100-degree mark.

That level was finally surpassed on 10 August 2003, when several places, 
including Kew Gardens, in west London, and, in Kent, Faversham and Gravesend, 
recorded temperatures of more than 38C – between 100 and 101 degrees Fahrenheit.
