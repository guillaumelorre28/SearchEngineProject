Anywhere but Westminster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/anywhere-but-westminster> is 
travelling the country to get a sense of British politics away from the 
Westminster bubble. During this period old fashioned two-party politics has 
been diminished and a palpable sense of unrest with the status quo has emerged.


For their new series, the pair are back on the road, hunting out radical new 
politics in some unlikely place. We would like you to tell us where you think 
they should go?
