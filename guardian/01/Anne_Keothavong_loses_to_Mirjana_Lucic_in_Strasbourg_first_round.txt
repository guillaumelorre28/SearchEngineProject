Anne Keothavong <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/anne-keothavong> failed to 
build on a good start against Mirjana Lucic as she was knocked out in the first 
round of the Strasbourg International.

Keothavong won the first set against Lucic, who is ranked 119 in the world – 
43 places below the British No2 – but the Croatian battled back to win 
2-6, 7-5, 6-4.

Keothavong follows Elena Baltacha in making an early exit from the clay-court 
tournament after Baltacha's 6-4, 6-0 defeat to Stéphanie Foretz Gacon on Monday.
