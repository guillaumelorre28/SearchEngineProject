The Times <https://www.theguardian.com/media/thetimes> has posted its biggest 
year-on-year circulation growth in a decade, with sales rising 4.7% to 407,566 
in November – the paper’s highest figure since the 2012 Olympics.

The only other UK papers to show year-on-year growth were freesheets the 
Evening Standard and Metro, as well as the Daily Star, which recently slahed 
its price by 50%.


Some of the rise in the Times’s circulation appears to be due to an increase 
in bulk sales – copies sold to partners such as hotels, gyms, airlines and rail 
companies for a nominal sum and given away free. However, paid sales have also 
increased significantly year on year.


Editor John Witherow said the circulation growth was partly down to the 
newspaper’s coverage of big events including the Paris attacks.

He said: “The Times was the only newspaper to carry the Paris terror attacks 
in its first edition [see footnote] and our thorough reporting and analysis of 
the chancellor’s spending review are two major news events reflected in the 
November ABC figures.”

The Paris attacks also appear to have had an impact for some other broadsheet 
titles, with the Daily Telegraph increasing circulation by 1.2% to 480,730 and 
the Observer, Independent on Sunday, Sunday Telegraph and Sunday Times posting 
small increases compared with October.

However, the UK’s two main tabloids continued to suffer during November, even 
as some of the nation’s broadsheets managed to claw back small numbers of 
readers.


Print editions of both the Sun and Mirror saw further circulation declines 
during the month, with Sunday editions especially badly hit.

The Sun slipped by 0.9%, or 16,555 copies, to 1.78m a day, with the Sun on 
Sunday falling 2.2%, or 33,934 copies, to 1.48m.

The Mirror suffered a 1.9% drop to 825,829, with the Sunday Mirror slumping 
4.9%, or almost 40,000, to 761,584.

The Sunday People, also owned by Trinity Mirror, fell 3.9% to 289,501.
