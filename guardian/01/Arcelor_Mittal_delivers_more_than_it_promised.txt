Arcelor Mittal <https://www.theguardian.com/business/arcelor-mittal> posted 
record first-half profits of $9.7bn (Â£4.9bn) yesterday, a leap of 42%, and 
indicated there were even higher earnings to come.

The world's largest steel company, forged from the merger of Arcelor and 
Mittal just over a year ago, said it had achieved cost-savings of $973m and 
Lakshmi Mittal, chief executive, said it would exceed the promised $1.6bn of 
synergies by the end of next year. He forecast a "robust" end to 2007. His son, 
Aditya, the chief financial officer, said investments would be close to $5bn 
this year as the group responds to booming demand for steel in emerging 
economies in eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America. Shares in Arcelor Mittal, 
already up 42% this year, bucked the global trend by rising 1%.

Giving its first half-year results since the merger, the group said it had 
shipped 55.7m tonnes of steel, boosted by strong demand in the US and Europe. 
It forecast pre-tax earnings in the current quarter at between $4.7 and $4.9bn 
even though shipments are due to decrease slightly in the summer lull.

Arcelor Mittal, which last week bought out the Warsaw government's residual 
25.2% stake in its Polish business for $157m and bought two tubes businesses, 
is said to be scouting Asia for further acquisitions. Executives have refused 
to comment on reports that it wants to buy the Australian business Bluestone 
but admit it is proving hard to extend its toehold in China. Net debt rose in 
the first half $4.5bn to $23.2bn, raising the gearing from 35% to 42%, while 
sales jumped to $27.2bn.
