Obama’s talks with Hailemariam Desalegn at the national palace in Addis Ababa 
were expected to focus on security and the threat of the Islamist militant 
group al-Shabaab inSomalia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia>. The US

He will also be joined by the leaders of Kenya and Uganda to discuss the 
crisis in South Sudan. Ethiopia is home to theAfrican Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africanunion> (AU). On Tuesday, Obama will 
address the whole continent from the organisation’s Chinese-built headquarters 
in Addis Ababa. The Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, current chair of the 
AU, will not be attending.

Obama was welcomed on Monday morning at the palace by Desalegn, 13 Ethiopian 
delegates, and uniformed soldiers. The palace was built in 1955 to mark emperor 
Haile Selassie’s silver jubilee (he was deposed in 1973), and boasts huge 
rooms, chandeliers, polished parquet floors, marble floors, large tapestries 
and a herd of stuffed animals, including cheetahs and lions.

Ethiopia’s ruling party won every seat in the recent general election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/22/ethiopias-ruling-party-win-clean-sweep-general-election>
, and at least one opposition party has claimed its members were arrested 
before Obama’s visit on suspicion they would make trouble.

Ben Rhodes, the US deputy national security adviser for strategic 
communication, said human rights would be a focal point of discussion.

“The Ethiopian government has made extraordinary progress in bringing greater 
development and opportunity to its citizens,” he said, “but there are very 
significant restrictions that are not consistent with the universal values that 
we stand up for, for instance the need for a free press.

“And we’ve seen too much intimidation, and even imprisonment of journalists, 
and the need for a viable space for civil society and political opposition in 
the country. So the president will be certainly raising issues related to human 
rights inEthiopia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ethiopia>, just as he did 
here in Kenya.”

, his father’s homeland, he urged Kenyans to deepen democracy, tackle 
corruption and end politics of exclusion based on gender or ethnicity. He also 
promised Kenya more security assistance.


“We are strongly committed to partnering with African countries to increase 
their capacity to address the immediate threats posed by terrorist 
organisations,” the White House said in a statement on Monday.

 Ethiopia contributes troops to an AU peacekeeping force battling al-Shabaab 
in Somalia. The group has launched several attacks in Kenya; diplomats say 
Ethiopia’s state security apparatus has spared it similar assaults.

Obama is seeking to expand business links with the continent, where China 
overtook the US as the biggest trade partner in 2009.

“Africa is on the move. Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> is 
one of the fastest growing regions in the world,” Obama told a conference in 
Nairobi on Saturday that sought to encourage African entrepreneurs and match 
them with investors.

 Ethiopia, which endured communist purges in the 1970s and famine in the 
1980s, has won praise for pushing growth into double digits and for its range 
of development initiatives including rural health programmes.

 But it has relied largely on state-led investment to drive growth, which 
economists say is squeezing out private business. It remains one of the world’s 
biggest recipients of aid and is still among Africa’s poorest nations per 
capita.

 The government has often turned to China to help build new roads, railways 
and dams in its efforts to expand the industrial base in the largely agrarian 
economy. The new metro line that snakes through Addis Ababa was built by a 
Chinese firm.
