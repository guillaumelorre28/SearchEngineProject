Back in 2011, the Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker famously 
got into a brief spat with Beyoncé 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2011/oct/11/beyonce-de-keersmaeker-dance-move>
, accusing the singer of plagiarising elements of her choreographyfor the video 
Countdown <http://vimeo.com/31105420>.

De Keersmaeker claimed acidly that she'd seen local schoolkids perform these 
moves with greater skill than Beyoncé. And in June she acted on that claim, 
inviting children all over the world to film themselves dancing this particular 
section of choreography, along with any other interested fans.

The material in question is taken from the 1983 dance Rosas Danst Rosas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/sep/09/rosas-review>, in which four 
seated women perform a sequence of repetitive moves, fiercely exaggerated 
versions of ordinary gestures like fiddling with their hair, adjusting their 
clothes, slouching, slumping and twitching.

Some 1,500 people from all over the world responded to de Keersmaeker's 
invitation <http://www.rosasdanstrosas.be/home/>, sending in over 10 hours of 
footage between them. And what's enchantingly evident from this compilation 
trailer is how many different colours and nuances the choreography has absorbed.

In the original version, the tension between the women's supercharged gestures 
and the tight minimalist grid of the work's structure carried a subtext of 
anger, frustration, effort. Yet here we see a crowd oftiny kids turning it into 
a game <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY7Zs4gaBfM> and a group of 
baton-twirling cheerleaders dancing it surreally on a subway 
<http://www.rosasdanstrosas.be/majoretteketet/>. We see men dancing it, 
pregnant women, and teenage boys.

Filmed in an office, de Keersmaeker's work may look claustrophobic, yet it 
becomes a joyous image of release when danced on a roof, descending an 
escalator or,Bollywood-style, on the beach 
<http://www.rosasdanstrosas.be/follefou-danst-rosas-schommel/>. Most 
transforming of all is the realisation that a work originally viewed as dark, 
difficult and challenging has now taken on an entire new life as a globally 
communal project.
