The Eurovision song contest is like the gay Olympics – and I say this with all 
my love. I’m really looking forward to the show in Vienna. If you get the 
chance to come, there will be loads of comedians doing Eurovision review shows 
with bigEurovision <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eurovision> names 
from the past 60 years.

I’d seen boys kissing in other cities, but when I first went clubbing in 
Vienna there were just so many of them! I was 13 and visiting from Styria - 
where I grew up - with my best friend Florian. We stayed with his uncle who was 
so cool not telling our mums we were going to clubs. Did we get in? Of course, 
I always knew people! I just thought, Oh my God! This is paradise.

Give me Britney Spears and I’m dancing all night long. Britney, Kylie, I’m all 
in. That’s why one of my favourite clubs isthe Ken Club <http://www.kenclub.at/>
. It’s really just pop-pop-pop, and I love that. I’ve had so many nights coming 
out of the club when it’s daylight and doing the walk of shame home.

We’re spoilt for drag and burlesque venues here, we live in a fairytale. We’ve 
got castles here, ballet there and everything is over the top and really 
romantic. Inside the Volkstheater, in the centre of the city, you’ll findthe 
Rote Bar <http://www.rotebar.at/>, which has lots of burlesque shows, where 
artists really go for it.

The Cuban Mojito Bar <http://www.cubanmojitobar.at/> is basically my second 
living room. It’s hosted by Cuban friends of mine and they mix the best mojito 
in the whole city. It’s a nice place to start a night out, totally in the 
centre of town, next to the Stephansdom, so you can have drinks there then go 
wherever you want.

Vienna has been a huge influence on Conchita but I wouldn’t say I’m a symbol 
of the city. Some friends of mine who do drag have this really typical Viennese 
woman character; they love taking a walk on Sundays, visiting the castle – very 
classy. I try to be classy, but I don’t know if I am …

I love to go out as Conchita, but I prefer to go out as Tom. When I’m Conchita 
I might have to be in more selfies than I have drinks.

If you want a very fancy meal go to the Sacher hotel 
<http://www.sacher.com/hotel-sacher-vienna/eat-and-drink-in-style/>. It’s very 
chic and very posh. But if you want a cheap meal, go to the stands where you 
get a sausage. My favourite sausage stand is actually right near the Sacher … 
it’s just beside the Albertina museum. That, I think, is the best sausage place 
in Vienna.

For years I used to host the Salon Kitty Revue with my fairytale husband 
Jacques Patriaque. He’s still doing that burlesque show along with three girls 
and it’s just fabulous. You should also look out for Tamara Mascara. She’s a 
huge artist in Vienna and did my make up on Eurovision.


Wherever you are in the world, you figure out in a second where the gay 
royalty is, and it’s the same in Vienna. I won’t rank them, but our royalty 
would include Miss Kandy – she’s the well-known drag queen who appeared in the 
90s. Then there’s Tamara, and Gery Keszler, he’s the founder of the Life Ball, 
Europe’s biggest charity event supporting people with HIV and Aids.

If you want to go down well with the locals, don’t mix up your German and your 
Austrian. It’s a dialect thing. Sometimes people get really annoyed and they 
will correct you in a very harsh way, which can be funny.
