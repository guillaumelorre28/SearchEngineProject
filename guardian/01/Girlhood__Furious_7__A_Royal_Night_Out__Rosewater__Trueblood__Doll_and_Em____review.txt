Its French title translates as “Band of Girls”, but Girlhood (Studiocanal, 15) 
was an opportunistic choice of English-language title for Céline Sciamma’s 
radiant ode to growing up young, female and black in the stifled suburbs of 
Paris. As a coming-of-age study, it doesn’t resemble Richard Linklater’sBoyhood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/boyhood> in form, focus or film-making 
texture, though there’s something comparably exacting and expansive about 
Sciamma’s brand of humanism – it’s a film that locates universal experience 
even within its highly specific, vividly drawn social context.

 Watch the trailer for Girlhood. 
Yet for 16-year-old Marieme (Karidja Touré in a blazing screen debut), the 
adolescent struggle to fit in is amplified by her less-transient status on the 
fringes – even as she gains self-possession, the everyday discrimination she 
encounters by dint of her race and gender chips away at her opportunities. She 
falls in with a gang of delinquent girls who crucially foster her sense of 
fight even as they pull her away from brighter pathways; it’s for the viewer to 
determine what she has lost and what she has gained from their fierce, bristly 
camaraderie. At their most united, however, these girls – and the film they 
carry – are incandescent, indomitable: in one extraordinary sequence, Sciamma 
stages a group singalong to Rihanna’s shimmery hit Diamonds as both a tender 
bonding ritual and a raging rebel yell.

 Watch the trailer for Furious 7. 
There’s nothing half so thrilling in Furious 7 (Universal, 12), even if the 
latest instalment in the seemingly inexhaustible petrol and pectorals franchise 
fashions itself rather strenuously as a celebration of self-styled family. The 
saddeath of Paul Walker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/paul-walker> has, inevitably, had 
a sentimentalising effect on the usual lunk-headed proceedings: prepare for 
some earnest, homily-strewn bonding amid the vehicular wreckage. It might be 
reasonable for producers to assume that, after 14 years and 11-odd hours of 
this odd cultural institution, we’re actually invested in Vin Diesel’s 
speed-freak troupe at a human level; I’m not sure I am, though themulticultural 
evolution 
<http://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/01/furious-7-and-diversity-why-hollywood-needs-catch-reality>
 of its ensemble has been heartening to witness. As for the on-road action, 
it’s as grandly, crunchily ludicrous as ever, though the series’ creative and 
choreographic peak remainsFast Five

 Watch the trailer for A Royal Night Out. 
Sticking with the theme of peculiar families, the Windsors are given a 
sitcom-style veneer of just-like-us approachability inA Royal Night Out 
(Lionsgate, 12) – a largely fictional romp that plays as a slab of official 
palace history as rewritten by Enid Blyton. That may sound ghastly, yet Julian 
Jarrold’s film has cheerily naff charm in spades. Following the young 
princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they shed their regal cocoon, joining the 
great unwashed for the VE Day celebrations, it’s speculative history jauntily 
dressed as a cut-glass entry in the one-wild-night teen subgenre.

 Watch the trailer for Rosewater. 
Now that his Daily Show run is over 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/18/jon-stewart-why-i-quit-the-daily-show>
, Jon Stewart has a little more time on his hands – so perhapsRosewater (The 
Works, 15), his first venture into film directing, is a taste of things to 
come. On this evidence, that’s not the most exciting prospect, but it’s not a 
dismaying one either. A meat-and-potatoes account of journalist Maziar Bahari’s 
brutalfour-month detention 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/feb/21/maziar-bahari-memoir> 
by Iranian authorities, it amply displays Stewart’s political perspicacity, but 
his swift renegade wit has largely been left in the TV studio. Still, it’s 
solidly nutritious fare; Stewart could loosen up with practice.

The damply premature demise of the English summer has led to the discovery of 
theSky box sets <http://www.sky.com/tv/show/box-sets> library in my household: 
as a frequent late arrival to buzz-heavy series, it’s been a rather convenient 
place to catch up at leisure. Some of the homework has been dutiful: I felt 
trivially obliged to completeTrue Blood’s uneven seven seasons, for example. 
But there have been happy belated discoveries, too. Emily Mortimer and Dolly 
Wells’s self-reflexive sitcomDoll and Em is a total delight, fusing gentle but 
spry showbiz satire with generous, bittersweet commentary on the push-pull 
nature of an adult friendship – one where girlhood is kind of an ongoing 
process.
