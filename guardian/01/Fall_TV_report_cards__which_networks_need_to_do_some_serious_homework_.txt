The third week in September is when all hell breaks loose, at least on your 
television. That’s when all the networks start rolling out their new comedies 
and dramas for the season (there are no new reality shows this year), and of 
course they save a few to debut in mid-season – January – in case some of these 
bets don’t pay off.

With cable and streaming video continuing to erode their audiences the stakes 
are higher than ever for the networks. Here is a snapshot of the five biggest 
networks (yes, we’re counting the CW as a network) and how well they did 
preparing for this upcoming season.

Programming philosophy: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. 

Biggest hits in 2015: NCIS, Big Bang Theory, NCIS: New Orleans.

Number of new shows: Seven (two at midseason).

Most promising new show: Life in Pieces 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU7wHKrSscw>. It’s an edgy comedy with an 
all-star cast that tells four short stories each week. This is the first time 
CBS has shied away from it’s three-camera sitcom formula and it could be a home 
run.

Biggest risk: Supergirl <http://www.cbs.com/shows/supergirl/>. Executive 
producer Greg Berlanti has worked wonders for DC Comics’ superheroes with the 
CW’s Arrow and The Flash, but will his magic touch work on this secondary 
character on a big network? We’ll have to wait for November to find out.

First to get cancelled: Please, CBS <https://www.theguardian.com/media/cbs> 
does not cancel shows.

Obligatory series based on a movie: Limitless 
<http://www.cbs.com/shows/limitless/>, Rush Hour 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lLwH4Qe0EE>. 

Obligatory reboot of an old show: None.

Overall grade: C

Programming philosophy: Let’s see what sticks. 

Biggest hits in 2015: The Voice, Blacklist, America’s Got Talent.

Number of new shows: Eleven (five in midseason).

Most promising new show: Blindspot 
<http://www.nbc.com/blindspot?cid=SEM%7cbdspt%7cfllprmr2015%7cggl%7cna%7cna&hcoref=SEM&WT.srch=ggl&sky=blindspot%20nbc>
. Almost all of NBC’s dramas have rather confusing concepts but this is the one 
getting the biggest push. Created by Martin Gero and Greg Berlanti (there’s 
that name again) this is about a Jane Doe who wakes up naked in Times Square 
covered in tattoos but with no memory. Each tattoo is a clue to a mystery.

Biggest risk: Best Time Ever 
<http://www.nbc.com/best-time-ever-with-neil-patrick-harris?cid=SEM%7cBTENPH%7cfallprmr2015%7cggl%7cna%7cna&hcoref=SEM&WT.srch=ggl&sky=best%20time%20ever>
 with Neil Patrick Harris. Allevidence points to the fact 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/28/sorry-neil-patrick-harris-but-the-variety-show-is-dead>
 that the variety show is over, but if anyone can pull off this weekly live 
show it is song-and-dance man NPH. With guests like Reese Witherspoon and Ricky 
Martin heactually has a chance 
<http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/13/reese-witherspoon-ricky-martin-neil-patrick-harris>
.

First to get cancelled: Heartbreaker <http://www.nbc.com/heartbreaker/video>, 
a show about a heart surgeon’s love life. Yawn.

Obligatory series based on a movie: None.

Obligatory reboot of an old show: Heroes Reborn 
<http://www.nbc.com/heroes-reborn?cid=SEM%7CHRSRBRN%7C2015upfronts%7Cggl%7Cna%7Cna&hcoref=SEM&WT_srch=ggl&sky=heroes%20reborn>

Programming philosophy: Who needs American Idol, we have Empire. 

Biggest hits of 2015: Empire, American Idol, Gotham.

Number of new shows: Ten (five in midseason).

Most promising new show: Scream Queens <http://www.fox.com/scream-queens>. 
Glee and American Horror Story impresario Ryan Murphy returns with this 
camptastic take on the slasher genre where a sorority house is besieged by a 
killer. Emma Roberts, Lea Michele, and Jamie Lee Curtis star which all sounds 
good. The first season of every Ryan Murphy show is amazing, until it goes 
downhill quickly.

Biggest risk: Grandfathered <http://www.fox.com/grandfathered> and The Grinder 
<http://www.fox.com/the-grinder>. Fox is having a hard time with comedy and 
these new shows with old favourites may or may not be the solution. The first 
stars John Stamos as a playboy grandfather who must raise a baby alone and the 
second stars Rob Lowe as an actor who played a lawyer on TV and now thinks he 
can run his brother’s law firm. Oh, and his brother isFred Savage 
<https://twitter.com/thefredsavage?lang=en>. Remember him? 

First to get cancelled: Does it count that American Idol has been cancelled 
already 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/11/fox-cancels-american-idol>

Obligatory series based on a movie: Minority Report

<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2014/may/14/shonda-rhimes-scandal-tv-diversity-showrunner-davis>
, help us.

Biggest hits of 2015: Dancing with the Stars, How to Get Away with Murder, 
Modern Family.

Number of new shows: Ten (five in midseason).

Most promising new show: The Muppets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/08/the-muppets-return-to-tv-documentary-abc>
. Seriously, how do you mess up The Muppets? This should attract viewers young 
and old, even though the show is filmed like a Modern Family-style mockumentary 
about the puppets’ — sorry, Muppets’ — real lives. Maybe this concept is too 
sophisticated for kids, but there is probably enough of the Swedish Chef to 
keep them giggling.

Biggest risk: Of Kings and Prophets 
<http://abc.go.com/shows/of-kings-and-prophets>. ABC yanked this from the fall 
schedule 
<http://deadline.com/2015/06/of-kings-prophets-pulled-quantico-move-sunday-abc-1201436369/>
 in June to recast and retool this retelling of the Bible’s Book of Samuel, 
which spells trouble. However, there is a history of Christian shows doing very 
well on television (just don’t tell that to NBC’s cancelled The Bible 
Continues) so this might be a home run. We’ll have to wait until midseason to 
see.

First to get cancelled: Blood and Oil <http://abc.go.com/shows/blood-and-oil>, 
a soap about a family that got rich from the black stuff. Wasn’t this already 
called Dallas?

Obligatory series based on a movie: Uncle Buck 
<http://abc.go.com/shows/uncle-buck/video/VDKA0_1thuvv8f>.

Obligatory reboot of an old show: The Muppets.

Programming philosophy: #Teens #Superheroes #SuperheroTeens.

Biggest hits of 2015: The Flash, Arrow, Supernatural.

Number of new shows: Three (two in midseason).

Most promising new show: Crazy Ex-Girlfriend 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4094300/reference>. A young woman (Rachel Bloom) 
leaves New York and follows her ex to LA. There are musical numbers. This is 
the most promising show because it is the only new show on The CW’s fall 
lineup. But hey, they know what works for them.

Biggest risk: DC’s Legends of Tomorrow 
<http://screenrant.com/tag/legends-of-tomorrow/>. With Arrow and The Flash, the 
CW has a history of making caped crusaders into big business (even if they 
never wear capes). Will this show about a bunch of superheroes take flight or 
will fans just be too fatigued?

First to get cancelled: I guess it has to be Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, right? 

Obligatory series based on a movie: None.

Obligatory reboot of an old show: None. 

Overall grade: B
