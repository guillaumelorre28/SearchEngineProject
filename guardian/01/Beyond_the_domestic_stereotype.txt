Lenny Quirós, 48, has been a domestic worker for more than 20 years but 
chooses never to work more than two years for the same employer as apuertas a 
dentro, or "behind-doors", as a live-in help is called. 

Quirós is a former president of the domestic workers' association in Guayaquil 
and has seen what can happen when domestic jobs take over women's lives. "Women 
need to understand that just because they are domestic workers it doesn't mean 
they can't do other things," she says.

Quirós has been lucky. When she moved to Guayaquil she started cleaning 
houses, but really she wanted to study and eventually an employer allowed her 
to do this. Despite a biochemistry degree and a qualification as an accountant, 
Quirós has always worked in domestic jobs.

"Domestic work is not bad. For me looking after a house is an art. It's a job 
I can be proud of and enjoy. Women need to learn to value the job in order to 
force others to value it too," she affirms.

Quirós would like to continue working but now that she is aware of her rights 
and demands to be affiliated, employers no longer offer her work.

Instead she volunteers for the association and sells herbal toiletries from a 
stall near her house.

"I have taught my children to value what appears to be menial work," she says. 
"My son washes dishes in a restaurant but wants to be serving tables because it 
pays better. I tell him to value the job he does and his boss will value him 
too: if no one washed the dishes there would be nothing for the customers to 
eat off." For Quirós the fight is all about changing stereotypes.
