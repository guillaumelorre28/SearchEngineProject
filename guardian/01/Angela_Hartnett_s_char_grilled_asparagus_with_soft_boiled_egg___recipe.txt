Finally the asparagus season is upon us. This wonderful vegetable deserves to 
be served on its own in the simplest way possible, so celebrate its arrival at 
least once with just a touch of butter and pepper. Then try the below for a 
lovely light spring supper.

(Serves 4)
75ml olive oil
15ml white wine vinegar
½ tsp Dijon mustard
8 free range eggs
20 spears of green asparagus
100g Cornish yarg, shaved
Extra olive oil, for grilling

Beat the vinegar and oil with the mustard until emulsified, season, and leave 
to one side.

Remove the woody stalks from the asparagus (the spears will snap at the right 
point when pressure is applied).

Add the eggs to a pan of boiling water and cook for eight minutes.

Remove the boiled eggs and place them in cold water for a couple of minutes 
before removing the shells.

Season the asparagus spears with salt and pepper and glaze them with olive oil.

Smear some oil on to a grill pan, add the asparagus, in batches, and lightly 
grill, while turning, for three to four minutes depending on the size of the 
spears.

Halve the boiled eggs, season and place on top of the asparagus.

Add the sliced Cornish yarg and finish off with the vinaigrette.

Serve with a green salad and toasted sourdough.
