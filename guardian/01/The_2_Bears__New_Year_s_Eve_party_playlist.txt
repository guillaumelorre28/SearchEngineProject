New Year's Eve is not a time to play it cool. With that in mind here is my 
playlist for you and yours.

We begin with a golden-era Barry White production. Then some early 80s 
dancehall from Half Pint: a call to live the life you love; greetings and 
praise all ragamuffin soldiers. Next is Aretha, produced by Luther Vandross. 
Then a bit of Digital Underground to put a hump in the back of your 
party-goers. The Love Cats need no introduction. Eddy Grant's Equals thenStevie 
Wonder <https://www.theguardian.com/music/steviewonder>. Some jump-up house 
music from DJ Gregory and a bit of Whitney to sing along to at the end.

Happy new year. Welcome to 2013, the year of the Bear.
