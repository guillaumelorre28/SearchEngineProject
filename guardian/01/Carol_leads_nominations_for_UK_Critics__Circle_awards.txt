nominations, along with The Revenant and Steve Jobs. Mad Max’s success has also 
boosted actor Tom Hardy’s personal nomination count from the Circle: he is up 
for actor of the year for Legend, supporting actor for The Revenant, and 
British actor of the year for his body of work in the last 12 months.

Two documentaries, Amy and The Look of Silence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-look-of-silence>, also broke out of their 
customary category, with both picking up film of the year nods. Amy took a 
British film of the year nomination and Silence appeared in the 
foreign-language film of the year list.
