Perhaps the salient thing about food, from a photographer’s point of view, is 
that it doesn’t last. Even the most gorgeous, curvaceous pepper – those shot by 
Edward Weston in 1930 are among the camera’s greatest still lifes – must either 
be chopped up and eaten, or rot.


Back in 1977, Deborah Barsel, a bored employee at George Eastman House in New 
York, home to the US’s finest photography collection, had the idea of asking 
artists to contribute food-related pictures and recipes to a cookery book. 
Nearly 40 years on, the project has been brought to fruition after a box of 
letters and pictures from the likes of surrealist legend Brassaï andWilliam 
Eggleston <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/william-eggleston>, who 
captured the US south, was discovered in a store room.

It’s a great idea whose time has come. Quality cookbooks in 1977 were more 
likely to be illustrated with sensitive line drawings such as John Minton’s for 
Elizabeth David’s classics on southern European food. Today, photography and 
cookery are inseparable. I recently went to a restaurant whose lavishly 
photographed recipe book I own. It was a chance to order dishes whose pictures 
I have been looking at for years, including ones that are too fussy to cook at 
home. Damn, no cod cheeks in the fridge! So I ordered the cod cheeks and, yes, 
they were as good as their photograph.

Now, when I look at the picture, I’ll remember the taste, the time, the fun. 
Food’s impermanence makes it the stuff of richly associative memories such as 
these. I wish I had been at the New York restaurant whereStephen Shore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/stephen-shore> photographed the 
aftermath of a meal in 1972. It must have been a good one. Black coffee, and a 
cigar. The sharp colours tell of a meeting, a conversation, maybe business, 
maybe love: all the social stuff of city lunches. Or was he eating alone?

Real character in photography comes from a precise, rich engagement with the 
suggestiveness of the physical world. That cigar in Shore’s ashtray, the cherry 
garnish on a Neal Slavin hotdog. Eggleston’s cheese grits casserole, using half 
a pound of Velveeta cheese, sits alongside his 1976 photograph of an empty 
diner, whose bright yellow walls evoke the cheese he likes to melt all over his 
down home food.

As with most of the contributors, Eggleston shares a fondness for ingredients 
that are now practically illegal on health grounds: this is the 1970s, and the 
dishes are steeped in the saturates of the time – graham crackers, frozen 
macaroni cheese. This is a cookbook to look at rather than use, if you value 
your arteries.

Food is not a fetishistic obsession for great photographers, it seems, so much 
as a movable feast, a theatrical moment in the midst of everyday life. Eileen 
Cowin’s vegetable cheese casserole is just lots of veg baked in ricotta: fast 
and easy, to suit the chaotic lifestyle portrayed in her shot of a kid watching 
TV from the same table as a couple trying to have a candlelit dinner (pictured 
overleaf).

Photography <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography> is the art 
of modern life’s flux; the moments that make the best pictures may not be food 
on a plate so much as pots in a sink, people at a counter, coffee on a stove. 
Above all, food is social: in Barbara Crane’s rawly coloured snapshot of people 
passing slices of pizza at a party, the sharing is what it’s all about.

When this lovely project was launched, photography was at a crossroads: 
modernist masters such asAnsel Adams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ansel-adams> were still composing 
pictures of great formal beauty while younger photographers were recording more 
random scenes. Artists such as Ed Ruscha were exploring the camera’s power as a 
conceptual tool. These pictures allow us to savour a great moment, melting in 
the mouth like Velveeta cheese.

Pavlova: Grant Mudford <http://www.grantmudford.com>

There are many things from Australia I remember with great affection, partly 
due to their absence elsewhere in the world. I truly miss: old Holdens (cars), 
gladioli (flowers), galas and kookaburras (birds), Ayers Rock (natural 
monument) and the bush (outback country). Australian cuisine on the whole is 
forgettable, with one notable exception: the pav! It’s named after the Russian 
dancer Anna Pavlova, who in 1926 performed Swan Lake in Australia. Description: 
a soft, marshmallow-centered dessert with crisp, lightly browned meringue 
crust, topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit.


Egg whites – use at least 8
2 rounded tbsp sugar per egg white
1 drop of vinegar per egg white

Heat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Beat the egg whites until stiff. Add 
the sugar gradually while beating; add vinegar. Cover an oven tray with greased 
paper. Spread the mix out in a disc (nine or 10 inches in diameter), put in the 
oven, and turn down the heat to 110C/225F/gas mark ¼. Bake for one and a half 
hours.

Add toppings just before serving: whipped cream, strawberries, pineapple, 
cherries, kiwi and other fresh fruit.

• Based in LA, Mudford is best known for his work with the architect Louis 
Kahn.

 Neal Slavin, Frankfurters In Full Dress, 1978. Photograph: Neal Slavin 
My most delightful and favourite “tidbit gastronomique” is called the “Nylen 
full-dress frank.” It’s named after a colleague, Judy Nylen, who not by chance 
is also its creator. The frankfurter need not be left naked. It can be 
formalised and decked out for a sumptuous midnight snack or fun party fare. 
Condiments, garnishes and accents can take on any theme. Those described below 
are “regional costumes” to be grouped buffet-style for a party, so guests can 
create their own masterpieces.


Basics (for a party of 24)

48 frankfurters
48 buns

Bring six quarts of water to a boil in one or more large pots. Remove from the 
heat and put in the frankfurters. Cover and let stand for seven minutes. Serve 
right from the pot, or keep warm on a hot tray set to low; they’ll also keep 
for several hours in warm water.

Dressings: New Yorker
2 cups (300g) sauerkraut

Heat the sauerkraut through and keep warm on a hot tray; smother the 
frankfurter.

German
1 cup (250ml) apple sauce
1 cup (120g) crab apples, sliced

Spoon the sauce over the frankfurter, and garnish with crab apple slices.

¼ cup (60g) butter 
Mixed spices
1 dash sherry
1 bottle dark malt liquor or strong ale
¼ tsp salt
2 eggs
2 pieces toast
A pinch of paprika

Melt the butter in a microwave, but do not allow to brown. Add a dash of mixed 
spices and sherry. In a bowl, microwave the malt with the salt to boiling 
point. Slide the eggs into the hot liquid, cover with a paper plate or glass 
bowl and cook in the microwave as desired (see below).

While the eggs are cooking, make two pieces of toast. Spread part of the 
butter-spice mix over the toast.

Serve the eggs on the toast, and pour over the rest of the butter-spice mix. 
Add a dash of paprika.

Note on microwave cooking I like my eggs poached soft. I find that one egg in 
the hot ale or malt takes about one minute to cook, two eggs about two minutes, 
etc, all the way up to eight eggs about eight minutes.

(1899-1986)/Estate of Ralph Steiner 
I am more a basse cuisine than haute cuisine chef. I got my Cordon Bleu not in 
Paris but in Erie, Pennsylvania. There I learned: a) how to take a box of 
cornflakes down from the shelf; b) how to boil two four-minute eggs. Eggs are 
important! You recall Samuel Butler’s solution of the ancient question, “Which 
came first, the chicken or the egg?” He said: “The egg came first: a chicken is 
only an egg’s way of making another egg.” Now for my favourite/only recipe.


One puts water an egg’s diameter deep into a pan. Turns heat on. When boiling 
briskly, drops two eggs in from low altitude. Turns heat off. One watches one’s 
watch watchfully for 240 seconds. At the stroke of 240, one removes eggs. On 
opening eggs, I always get bits of shell – or is it “will”? – in my eggs. I 
never know when to use “shell” and when to use “will”. Never mind; a bit of 
shell ingested gives a man shell power.

I love to eat, as long as someone else cooks it. I especially love cheesecake.


1 graham cracker (digestive) crust
12 ounces (340g) cream cheese
1 cup (240g) cottage cheese
¾ cup (175g) sugar 
1 tsp vanilla
⅛ tsp ground nutmeg
2 eggs
¼ tsp ground cinnamon
1 21oz can (595g) cherry pie filling

Combine three packs of cream cheese with a cup of cottage cheese, and mix with 
electric mixer until smooth; beat in the sugar, vanilla, and nutmeg. Add the 
eggs one at a time, beating well after each; measure out a cup of the mixture 
and set aside. Pour the remaining cheese mixture into the crust.

Bake for 30 minutes at 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Meanwhile, take the rest of the 
cheese mixture and the fourth pack of cream cheese, mix in a bowl and beat 
until smooth. Take a pastry bag with a round tip and fill with the mixture: you 
will use this to decorate the cake. Add the cinnamon to the cherry pie filling.

Remove the cheesecake from the oven at the end of 30 minutes. Raise the oven 
temperature to 230C/450F/gas mark 8. Spread the cherry filling over the 
cheesecake. Take the pastry bag and decorate the top. Bake the decorated 
cheesecake in the hot oven for 10 minutes, or until the top is browned. Cool on 
a wire rack and serve at room temperature.

There is a scene in Even Cowgirls Get The Blues 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/370486/>, by Tom 
Robbins, where someone sprays a special substance on different foods to make 
them taste like chocolate chip cookies. That would be my favorite recipe, if I 
could find it. Since I haven’t…


Saute in very little oil: onions, mushrooms, broccoli, tomatoes (you can 
substitute any combination of vegetables in any amounts.) Add spices/herbs: 
garlic, salt, pepper, basil. (Again, changing or adding different combinations 
makes the dish taste different every time you make it.) Saute the vegetables 
until they are a little tender, remove from the stove, and put in a casserole.

Mix ricotta – one cup (250g) of ricotta to every three cups (750g) vegetables, 
or to taste – with salt, pepper, parsley, and egg (one egg per 250g of cheese). 
Add the ricotta mixture to the vegetables and bake at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 
25 minutes. For the last five minutes, put thinly sliced mozzarella over the 
top of the casserole.

I hope this isn’t too loose, but the best part of this is making up your own 
variations. If you want, you can find that special substance and make the whole 
thing taste like a chocolate chip cookie.
