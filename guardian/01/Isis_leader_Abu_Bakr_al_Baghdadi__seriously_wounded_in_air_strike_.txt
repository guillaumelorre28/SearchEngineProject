The leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi>, has been seriously 
wounded in an air strike in western Iraq, sources have told the Guardian.

A source in Iraq <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> with connections to 
the terror group revealed that Baghdadi suffered serious injuries during an 
attack by the US-led coalition in March. The source said Baghdadi’s wounds were 
at first life-threatening, but he has since made a slow recovery. He has not, 
however, resumed day-to-day control of the organisation.

Baghdadi’s wounding led to urgent meetings of Isis leaders, who initially 
believed he would die and made plans to name a new leader.

Two separate officials – a western diplomat and an Iraqi adviser – confirmed 
the strike took place on 18 March in the al-Baaj a district of Nineveh, close 
to the Syrian border. There had been two previous reportsin November

 and December of Baghdadi being wounded, though neither was accurate.

The diplomat confirmed an air strike on a three-car convoy had taken place on 
that date between the village of Umm al-Rous and al-Qaraan. The attack targeted 
local Isis leaders and is believed to have killed three men. Officials did not 
know at the time that Baghdadi was in one of the cars.

Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi official who advises Baghdad on Isis, told the 
Guardian: “Yes, he was wounded in al-Baaj near the village of Umm al-Rous on 18 
March with a group that was with him.”

US officials were unable to confirm the report. “We have nothing to confirm 
this report,” said a Pentagon spokesman.

Baghdadi is understood to have been spending much of his time in al-Baaj, 
about 200 miles west of the Isis stronghold of Mosul. “He chose this area 
because he knew from the war that the Americans did not have much cover there,” 
said a source privy to some of Baghdadi’s movements. “From 2003 (the US 
military) barely had a presence there. It was the one part of Iraq that they 
hadn’t mapped out.”


Al-Baaj, a Sunni tribal area, has long remained outside of state control even 
under ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein’s regime, and was considered a safe 
haven for jihadists from 2004 onwards.

Residents have long used smuggling networks as well as small valleys and 
tracks to import goods from nearby Syria and to other parts of Sunni areas of 
Iraq in Nineveh and Anbar. Al-Qaida in Iraq and all its subsequent 
incarnations, including Isis, had largely unfettered access to the routes until 
al-Baaj became a focus of US surveillance earlier this year.

Baghdadi had at least one earlier brush with death when US jets attacked a 
two-car convoy on the outskirts of Mosul on 14 December. His close aide Auf 
Abdul Rahman al-Efery was killed when a rocket fired from a war plane hit one 
of the cars. Baghdadi was believed to be in the second car, which was not hit.

In recent months, air strikes have been increasingly effective in targeting 
the Isis leadership.Baghdadi’s deputy, Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, and the head of 
the group’s military operations in Iraq were both killed in early December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/19/isis-demoralised-us-air-strikes>.

After seizing control of a large chunk of Iraq and Syria last June, and 
threatening Baghdad and Irbil, Isis has recently lost substantial ground in 
both countries. An offensive led by Shia militias and the Iraqi militarytook 
back Iraq’s fourth city, Tikrit, last month

, as well as close to 7,000 sq km in the centre of the country.

 Where do Isis get their money? 
A Kurdish push from the north in January reclaimed close to 20,000 sq km. Both 
offensives appear to be paving the way for an assault in Mosul, which is not 
expected before the autumn. Isis remains in full control of Mosul, as well as 
Anbar province and much of eastern Syria.

The border between the two countries is largely redundant and, despite air 
strikes, the group remains in control of six crossing points that allow a ready 
flow of funds, fighters and weapons. Baghdadi had declared the swath of land 
from eastern Aleppo to central Iraq to be part of a caliphate that he leads.

While Baghdadi invokes authority as a religious leader, the constant threat 
from the skies has led to some of its command and strategic decisions being 
made by other members of the leadership. Since Baghdadi’s wounding, Isis’s 
military and Shura councils have become increasingly prominent in 
decision-making, the source close to the organisation revealed.
