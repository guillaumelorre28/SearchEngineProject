The Spectator’s combined print and digital circulation rose by more than 5,000 
to a record high of 76,750, driven by an almost 25% rise in digital sales over 
the six months leading up to the EU referendum.


Print sales also hit a record high, up more than 2% to 57,604, according to 
the latest Audit Bureau of Circulation figures published on Thursday.

Spectator editor Fraser Nelson attributed the rise to the “Brexit effect” as 
more people become interested in politics; the magazine backed leaving the EU.

“Brexit, with all of its stunning drama, has meant a whole new bunch of people 
who were never really interested in politics now is,”Nelson told Politico 
earlier this week

. “It’s a seismic event that means people want to learn more.”

Meanwhile, Private Eye inched up its circulation by 0.1% to pass the 230,000 
mark and hit a 30-year high.

However, the Economist saw its total international print and digital 
circulation dip back below 1.5m as it removed about 100,000 unprofitable bulk 
copies – those distributed for free or reduced rate - though some of that fall 
was offset by a rise in subscriptions. Circulation was down 25% in its 
continental Europe edition, but held relatively steady in the UK, down just 1% 
to 160,241.

Deputy editor Tom Standage said: “Our focus at the moment is on increasing the 
profitability of our subscriber base, as part of a plan to double the profits 
from circulation over five years. It’s going very well. Circulation profits 
grew by 31% year on year.

“Given the choice between higher circulation numbers boosted by bulks and 
higher profits, we’ll take the profits – and continue to recruit paying 
subscribers to make up for the decline caused by removing the bulks.”
