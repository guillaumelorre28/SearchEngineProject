Like the swallows to Capistrano <http://www.infoplease.com/spot/swallows1.html>
, cinema returned to Park City, Utah for the annual Sundance film festival. 
Beneath high-end outerwear the hearts of industry types from Los Angeles, New 
York and perhaps other cities beat rapidly, and not just because of the 
treacherous altitude. Sundance is the starting gun for the year in serious 
movie-going, and while it may not top Cannes for worldly quality or Toronto for 
Oscar buzz, the indie spirit is still alive and well atop this icy mountain.

Last year was major, with both Whiplash and Boyhood making their debut, still 
picking up awards a full year later, with the latteron course for best picture 
glory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/21/sundance-2015-better-than-last-year>
. There were no such striking stand-outs this year, but still many lessons to 
be learned.

Three of the big titles were films about teenagers. Sony Pictures Classics 
shelled out $2m forDiary of a Teenage Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/25/sundance-2015-review-the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl>
, a 1970s-set coming-of-age tale based on a graphic novel starring Bel Powley, 
in which she sleeps with her mother’s boyfriend (Kristen Wiig and Alexander 
Skarsgard, respectively.)Dope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/29/sundance-2015-dope-review-subversive-crisp-teen-comedy>
, a lighthearted high school crime story set in a black Los Angeles 
neighbourhood, was purchased by Open Road Films (US) and Sony (International) 
for a combined $7m. Then there wasMe and Earl and the Dying Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/29/sundance-me-earl-dying-girl-review>
 and its record-breaking $12m sale to Fox Searchlight. Based on a young adult 
novel, this teen weepie about misfit movie buffs and cancer patients won over 
both mainstream crowds and the snobs. Ittook home both the jury prize and the 
audience award

Want to get your movie into Sundance? Get creative in the sack. A number of 
entrants all boasted unusual scenes in flagrante delicto. Lame comedyThe Bronze 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/23/sundance-2015-review-the-bronze-no-medals-for-opening-night-gymnast-flop>

Overnight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/25/sundance-2015-review-the-overnight-jason-schwartzman-adam-scott>
, another film that ultimately came up short, has a startling amount of male 
nudity. Indeed, the elephantine nature of Jason Schwartzman’s lower regions is 
a major plot point. (Alas, prosthetics are involved.) Also there’sThe D Train 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/sundance-2015-review-the-d-train-jack-black>
, in which snivelling loser Jack Black and libertine James Marsden allow a 
night of carousing to lead to a played-for-laughs amorous end.

 The Experimenter’s Winona Ryder and Peter Sarsgaard Photograph: Jeff 
Vespa/WireImage 
Two of the most famous (and controversial) social psychology experiments got 
their close-up at this year’s fest. The Stanford Prison Experiment is a tense 
and fascinating look at Philip Zimbardo’s 1971 investigation into power and 
institutions.The Experimenter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/sundance-2015-review-the-experimenter-milgram-experiment-obedience>
 stars Peter Sarsgaard as Stanley Milgram, whose investigation into obedience 
to malevolent authority sought to answer troubling questions about Nazism. The 
former is a straightforward thriller, the latter (from director Michael 
Almereyda) is, perhaps fittingly, more experimental.

Fantastic Fest has been holding successful secret screenings for years. 
Recently the New York film festival got in the act. It didn’t translate to the 
mountains, though. For reasons that still confound, Warner Bros decided to 
bring their giant space operaJupiter Ascending 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jupiter-ascending> to this celebration of 
independent cinema. Moreover, they made it impossible to get in. Reports were 
the theatre had loads of empty rows, and those that did attend said the movie 
was awful.

$7000. This year director Sean Baker’sTangerine

the urgency and exuberance are well captured.

They’ve gone all-in on using their clout to support independent films. Three 
titles had their names in the credits, plus a short. Additionally, they were 
spotted staying in the same scummy condos as the film critics. That’s 
dedication.

People flock to the arthouse of horrors 

Last year Sundance debuted The Babadook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-babadook>, one of the sharpest horror 
films in some time. Continuing the tradition of unusual horror was the well 
received The Witch, a richly worded, gorgeously shot supernatural drama set in 
1600s New England. Other creepers came from documentaries. Rodney Ascher (Room 
237) returned to the festival withThe Nightmare 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/28/sundance-2015-review-the-nightmare-documentary-shows-truth-more-frightening-than-fiction>
, an unnerving look at the very real phenomenon of sleep paralysis. Lastly, the 
much-discussedThe Wolfpack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/sundance-2015-review-the-wolfpack-documentary-brothers>
. If this fascinating look at a family of maladjusted New Yorkers who almost 
never leave their tiny apartment isn’t a horror film of some kind I don’t know 
what it is.
