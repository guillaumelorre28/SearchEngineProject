As Brian Wilson <https://www.theguardian.com/music/brianwilson> later 
recalled, the Beatles' sixth album was the first release he'd ever heard where 
every song "went together like no album ever made before". It proved a huge 
influence on the set of songs that then became the Beach Boys' next album, Pet 
Sounds, released in May 1966. Paul McCartney later called Pet Sounds his 
favourite album of all time; it also marked the end of an era – because no set 
of songs thereafter could ever summon such a sense of innocence.

Pet Sounds spurred the Fabs to ever greater heights on Revolver. This arms 
race between the two titans of pop on either side of the Atlantic was not one 
that the Beach Boys leader was equipped to handle, however. He set to work on 
new material, but just as the pressure mounted to pull the project together in 
February 1967, he heard Strawberry Fields Forever on the radio. Wilson felt he 
couldn't compete, his mental state not helped by the marijuana that he had been 
smoking, and he abandoned the new record, provisionally titled Smile.The Beatles
 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles> were in a new head space, and 
the carefree era of songs such as Surfin' USA was gone.
