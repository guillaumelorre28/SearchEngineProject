Rovio Animation spearheaded the production of The Angry Birds Movie, which 
cost around $73m and opened stronglyinternationally last weekend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/17/captain-america-tops-uk-box-office-angry-birds-movie>
. The film has already earned $150m worldwide, according to estimates from Sony.

The Angry Birds Movie features the voices of Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad and 
Danny McBride and, as an attempt to create a compelling story out of a fairly 
simplistic app-based game, has receivedmixed reviews from critics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/09/the-angry-birds-movie-review-game-spin-off-that-doesnt-quite-reach-lego-movie-levels>
. Audiences under 25, however, gave the film an A CinemaScore, which should 
help the film continue to perform well over Memorial Day weekend.

“It’s very difficult turning a video game property into a successful movie,” 
said Josh Greenstein, Sony’s president of worldwide marketing and distribution. 
“To use a bad pun, we are flying high.”

ComScore’s senior media analyst, Paul Dergarabedian, said the success of Angry 
Birds <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/angry-birds> likely had more to 
do with family appeal and ingrained brand recognition.

“Families are always looking for out-of-the-home content,” Dergarabedian said, 
noting also that the film was the latest in a string of very successful 
PG-rated films including The Jungle Book and Zootopia.

“PG is the hot new rating now. There used to be a stigma that younger teens 
wouldn’t be interested. The numbers prove that when you go after the broadest 
base possible, you can be highly successful.”

The PG-13 rated Captain America: Civil War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/captain-america-civil-war> was not too far 
behind, earning an additional $33.1m for a second-place spot, which brings its 
domestic total to $347.4m. Even in his third weekend in theaters, the superhero 
proved mightier than R-rated comedies Neighbors 2 and The Nice Guys, both of 
which underwhelmed.

Neighbors 2 brought in only $21.8m – less than half of the first film’s $49m 
opening in 2014. But the film from the director Nick Stoller also cost only 
$35m to make.

“We’re really proud of Neighbors 2,” said Nick Carpou, Universal’s president 
of domestic distribution. “We’re not just out there trying to go to the bank on 
something. It really is a different take.”

Stars Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron all returned for the sequel which 
puts a new spin on the “frat next door” idea by having the young family’s new 
neighbors be a sorority comprised of girls upset about the unequal rules for 
fraternities and sororities.

The R-rated 70s-set buddy comedy The Nice Guys grossed $11.3m for a 
fourth-place spot. Warner Bros handled the domestic distribution for the Shane 
Black-directed film, which stars Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe and has been 
very well received by critics.

While the comedy openings might be less than hoped for, both could still 
provide decent counterprogramming to the spectacle-driven films opening on 
Memorial Day weekend, when mega productions X-Men: Apocalypse and Alice Through 
the Looking Glass take over.
