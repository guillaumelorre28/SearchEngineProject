Reid was playing the first singles final of his career but the 24-year-old 
showed no signs of nerves as he beat Gerard 7-6 (9-7), 6-4 to be crowned 
champion in Melbourne.

After completing victory in an hour and 37 minutes, Reid flung his racket into 
the sky before punching the air in celebration.

The Scot was unable, however, to make it two Australian Open triumphs when he 
played in the wheelchair doubles final alongside Japan’s Shingo Kunieda later 
on Saturday. They lost in three sets, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, against French pair 
Stephane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer.

Reid enjoyed the support of a vocal group of friends throughout the opening 
contest and he thanked all them individually on the side of the court before 
making his victory speech.

“I think I’ll be buying them drinks all night to say thank you,” Reid said. 
“Congratulations to Jo on getting to his first final, you played great and I’m 
sure it won’t be your last final as well.

“Thanks to everyone who came today to support wheelchair tennis. It’s always 
amazing to be able to showcase our sport and I want to thank everyone.”

Reid had earlier knocked out his doubles partner Kunieda, who had won the 
Australian Open in eight out of the last nine years.

Gerard said: “Congratulations Gordon, you played amazing this week you deserve 
it. “I wish I could hold the trophy but next time. We were not far and we can 
do better next time.”
