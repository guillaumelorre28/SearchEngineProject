Spicy coriander, pomegranate seeds and coconut milk – the best way to upgrade 
an ordinary fruit salad into something daring and unusual. For a slightly 
different twist, throw in some basil as well.

Serves 4

2 blood oranges, pith removed, and sliced into segments
1 pineapple, diced
1 pomegranate, deseeded
Juice of 1 lime
1 tbsp honey
4 tbsp reduced-fat coconut milk
1 tbsp coriander, chopped

1. Lop the bottoms off the oranges and use a sharp knife to remove the skin. 
Run the knife between the white pith on both sides and remove the orange 
segments.

2. Put the segments in a large bowl with the pineapple and pomegranate. Add 
the lime juice, honey and coconut milk.

3. Stir well, then put it in the fridge to chill. When it's dishing-up time, 
finish with the chopped coriander and serve.
