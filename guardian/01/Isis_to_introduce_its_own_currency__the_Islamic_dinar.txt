Islamic State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis> says its leader has 
ordered that the organisation start minting gold, silver and copper coins for 
its own currency, the Islamic dinar.

A website affiliated with the militant group said late on Thursday that its 
leader,Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi>, had instructed his 
followers to start minting the coins to “change the tyrannical monetary system” 
modelled on western economies that had “enslaved Muslims”.

The posting says the order was approved by the group’s shura council, an 
advisory board.

After seizing large swaths of Iraqi and Syrian territory this year, Isis 
proclaimed a caliphate, or Islamic empire, on lands under its control.

The group has also sought to implement its harsh interpretation of sharia law, 
and Baghdadi has proclaimed himself the caliph.
