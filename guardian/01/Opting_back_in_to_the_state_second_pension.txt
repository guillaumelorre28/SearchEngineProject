Q  My 59-year-old husband opened a private pension and opted out of the state 
scheme. He froze it during a period of unemployment and did not restart it when 
he found a job. He has now been told to think about opting back in. What should 
we do?

A It would make sense to consider contracting back into the state second 
pension (S2P), formerly known as Serps. The rebates on National Insurance 
contributions payable for opted-out personal pension schemes have been lowered 
still further recently. It is therefore almost certain that the state pension 
will be much deal better than any amount paid by a personal pension, especially 
if it has been frozen.

Your husband would have to wait until he is 65 before being eligible to take 
the state pension and many people believe that the government will renege on 
pension payments in the future.

Nevertheless, the perceived wisdom is that the S2P should provide a far 
superior return, with much less risk. The best way to contract back into S2P is 
to notify the company dealing with your pension and they will deal with the 
paperwork.
