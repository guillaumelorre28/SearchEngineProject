Prostíbulo Poético

How do you like your prostitutes? Speaking Catalan? English? Romanian? 
Prostíbulo Poético (Poetry Brothel) has plenty of whores for hire to give you … 
a private poetry reading in a candle-lit corner. This literary whoring takes 
place once a month in different bars. Though it's never quite the same, it 
usually begins with some kind of music, then Madame Eva introduces theputas, 
who each read some of their original work, permitting the customers to size 'em 
up, after which all barriers come down and you are free to pick your favourite, 
pay €1 for their services and retire to a corner.
• Various venues. Next event: 9pm, 16 June at Horiginal (cafè+poesia), Carrer 
Ferlandina 29,prostibulopoetico.com <http://www.prostibulopoetico.com>.

Esther Arias Galería de Arte y Taller
 Esther Arias Galería de Arte y Taller 
Everyone exits Metro Jaume and heads directly to the Picasso Museum via Carrer 
Princesa. But there is a much more attractive short cut that will take you past 
Esther Arias's gallery in a warm and inviting 18th-century building. Although 
Arias often devotes a wall to a guest artist, this is hertaller (workshop) and 
the paintings on display are her own: enchanting, colourful abstracts with a 
dreamlike quality. Along with the large canvases, there are some exquisite 
framed acrylics on paper at a good price. This is the perfect place to begin a 
walk through the Born with its many art and artisan shops.

Museu Frederic Marès
 Museu Frederic Marès 
Housed in a lovely medieval palace next to the cathedral in the Barri Gòtic, 
this museum is often overlooked – people don't tend to flock to see walls 
filled with crucifixes. But many of these sculptures, painted or in plain wood, 
come from the 12th and 13th centuries, retaining the Romanesque separation of 
the nailed feet. They're quite bizarre and utterly mesmerising; one has Joseph 
of Arimathea clinging to Christ with a most curiously placed right hand. The 
wooden Madonnas are coarse rather than sweet, and the Christ child often looks 
old enough to be at university. The upper rooms house an astounding collection 
of objects, from hatpins to garters, gathered by sculptor/traveller/hoarder 
Frederic Marès.

Galería Artevistas
 Galería Artevistas 
The posh uptown galleries, mainly along Consell de Cent, showcase known 
artists with several zeros attached to the price. To enter, you must buzz, wait 
to be let in and it's a rather stuffy exchange, though you will find some 
superb art. For an altogether different experience, head to the Artevistas, 
which features young artists, some of whom have definitely arrived. It's very 
near the Ramblas but secluded from all the tourist bustle, as it sits in a 
covered passageway. Here the doors are wide open and you step into a burst of 
colour. It's a happy place, and you might well find a budding talent.

Cosmo
 Cosmo 
Carrer Enric Granados is a tree-lined pedestrian street in the Eixample, 
beginning just behind the University of Barcelona and sloping gently upward to 
Avinguda Diagonal. Filled with cool outdoor cafés, restaurants and 
well-established art galleries, such asN2 Galería <http://www.n2galeria.com>, 
ADN Galería <http://www.adngaleria.com>and Ego Gallery 
<http://www.egogallery.es/>, this is the place to stroll for art and maybe 
catch an opening on a Thursday night. Cosmo café & galería de arte sits at the 
bottom of the slope and is a super place to begin or end your walk. It's a fun 
and lively bar/café with good music, and there is a large exhibition space in 
the back where Catalan designer/multimedia programmer Jaume Osman Granda is 
showing (until 12 June).

Taller Creativo Bencini
 Taller Creativo Bencini 
This gallery/workshop is located behind Santa Caterina Market, which is worthy 
of a look for its postmodern architectural design and its vividly 
multicoloured, wavy roof. From here, head to Federico Bencini's, where you'll 
find a bright space full of his magnificent monotype prints created on wood and 
metal. He will be glad to explain the process to you if you are unfamiliar with 
it. Sharing thetaller is Raúl Pernia, a sculptor who creates amazing organic 
set pieces. Together they can transform an interior into a cutting-edge wonder. 
Turn left upon leaving and have the pleasure of getting lost in the art haven 
of El Born.

Eat Meat 
 Eat Meat 
Located in the Gràcia, an area chock-full of boho shops, trendy cafes, and few 
tourists, is Eat Meat, a non-profit cultural organisation dedicated to the 
principle of "art for laying bare contemporary obsessions [which include] 
mutations of form and essence, hybridisations, new visual engineering, the 
sickness of the soul, other rituals, the monstrous, the transgeneric and 
alterities".Camping Cannibal was the most recent exhibition by sculptor Nico 
Nubiola 
<http://riot-uber-alles.blogspot.com/2011/04/expo-de-nico-nubiola-en-eat-meat.html>
, whose stunning wood relief pieces, without being macabre (trust me), depict 
mutilated human bodies "like chickens in a supermarket". Take a walk on the 
dark side and confront the depths of the human psyche.
• Carrer Alzina 20, +34 93 284 2894, eatmeat.cat <http://www.eatmeat.cat>. 
Open Thur–Fri 6pm–9pm, Sat noon–2pm, 5pm–8pm, during exhibitions

Ulls Blaus and NIU
 Ulls Blaus 
How deep into the culture are you willing to go? It will help if you speak 
Spanish or Catalan but the young people who hang out at Ulls Blaus welcome 
everyone, not that you will be greeted at the door, simply accepted. This hidden
taller obert sits at the end of an uninviting, rundown passageway in Poblenou. 
Most everything here is made of recycled material and begs a closer look – 
don't miss the WC. On Friday evenings at 8pm, emerging visual artists and/or 
musicians offer entertainment in the small sala. Not far from here is NIU, 
another alternative multi-art space for upcoming artists where electronic music 
is the norm but anything is possible. Bars at both locations.

Palau Dalmases
 Palau Dalmases 
There is no sign at the entrance, in the heart of La Ribera, only a doorman. 
You peek into a gorgeous 17th-century courtyard with a richly carved staircase 
behind. Is this a bar, and can I enter, you wonder. Yes, it is, and yes, you 
can. Stepping through the heavy wooden doors into Espai Barroc, you feel as 
though you have wandered into a baroque film set, with candelabras, fat 
cherubs, reproduction paintings, kitschy tableaux and the odd surrealist touch. 
The palace itself is rich in history, and worth a look around. Stick to wine or 
beer at €6, and feel transported to an era of sumptuous extravagance.
