Antonio & Priscilla Carluccio’s dressed polenta with sausage

One of the most warming dishes you can get high up in the mountains, 
especially of the Aosta Valley, is polenta concia, which sustains even the 
strongest worker. It is usually accompanied by a stew of chicken or venison. 
With pork sausages, however, it blends to a perfect marriage.

I like to use traditional polenta but if you use quick-cook polenta the 
cooking time is only 5 minutes. The Bramata polenta is by far the tastiest.

For 6-8 (or even more)
dried porcini mushrooms 25g
luganiga sausage 400g, cut into 10cm chunks, or alternatively chipolatas
olive oil 4 tbsp
garlic cloves 2, coarsely chopped
onion 1 small, thinly sliced
rosemary a sprig
chilli 1 small, finely chopped
dry red wine 3 tbsp
tomato passata 600g
salt

For the polenta concia
water 2 litres
salt 25g
coarse polenta 500g
unsalted butter 100g
parmesan 100g, grated
fontina cheese 150g, preferably from the Aosta Valley, cut into small cubes

Soak the porcini mushrooms in lukewarm water for about 30 minutes. Put the 
luganiga in a large pan with the oil and fry until brown on all sides. Now add 
the garlic, onion, rosemary and chilli and fry for 5 minutes. Drain the porcini 
and squeeze out the excess water, then cut them up roughly and add to the pan. 
Pour in the wine and bubble to evaporate, then add the passata and some salt 
and simmer for 20 minutes. Keep warm while you prepare the polenta.


To make the polenta, bring the water to the boil with the salt. Gradually add 
the polenta, stirring constantly with a long wooden spoon until all the flour 
has been incorporated into the water and is lump-free. At this stage you must 
be careful that you do not splash hot polenta on to your hands. Stir the 
polenta constantly over not too fierce a heat for about 30 minutes, by which 
time it should be pulling away from the side of the pan. Add the butter, 
Parmesan and fontina cheese and stir well until everything has amalgamated.

There are two ways of serving this: either by the spoonful on a plate or, as 
they traditionally do, by pouring the polenta on to large wooden board and 
leaving it to cool a little, then slicing it with a steel wire and putting it 
on a plate with the sausage stew.

Serves 6-8
¼lb (115g) of dried haricot beans, 2 carrots, 2 small potatoes, a small turnip
, 2onions, a piece of celery, 4 tomatoes, half a small cabbage, 2 rashers of 
bacon, garlic, herbs and seasoning, olive oil, a small glassful of red wine, 
2oz (55g) of broken-upmacaroni or spaghetti, or pastine, or any of the pasta 
made in small shapes, such as little stars, little shells, etc

Put the haricot beans to soak overnight. Next day prepare all the vegetables, 
and melt the sliced onions in the oil, adding 2 cloves of garlic, the bacon cut 
into pieces, and plenty of herbs, marjoram, thyme, basil, or whatever may be 
available; add the chopped tomatoes, or a tablespoonful of concentrated tomato 
purée; pour in the red wine, let it bubble a minute or two, then add the 
drained haricot beans; cover them with 3 pints of hot water and let them boil 
steadily for two hours. Now put in the carrots and about 15 minutes later the 
turnip and potatoes. Ten minutes before serving, add the celery, the cabbage 
cut into strips, and the pasta. See that the soup is properly seasoned, stir in 
2 tablespoonfuls of grated parmesan, and serve more parmesan separately.

According to the season almost any vegetable can be added to a minestrone: 
peas, beans, spinach, leeks, small marrows; rice can be substituted for the 
pasta.

Serves 4 as a first course or 3 as a main
chicken or vegetable stock 1¼ litres
unsalted butter 60g
olive oil 1 tbsp
shallots 2, very finely chopped
celery stick 1, very finely chopped
Italian rice 300g, preferably Arborio
organic lemon ½
fresh sage leaves 5 or 6
fresh rosemary leaves a small sprig
egg yolk 1
parmesan 4 tbsp, freshly grated
double cream 4 tbsp
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Bring the stock to a gentle simmer (keep it simmering all through the cooking 
of the rice).

Heat half the butter, the oil, shallots and celery in a heavy-bottomed 
saucepan and sauté until the soffritto – frying mixture – of shallot and celery 
is softened (about 7 minutes). Mix in the rice and continue to sauté, stirring, 
until the rice is well coated with the fats and is partly translucent.

Pour over about 150ml of the simmering stock. Stir very thoroughly and cook 
until the rice has absorbed nearly all of the stock, still stirring.

Add another ladleful of simmering stock, and continue in this manner until the 
rice is ready. You may not need all the stock. Good-quality Italian rice for 
risotto takes 15-20 minutes to cook.

Meanwhile, thinly pare the zest from the lemon half and chop it with the 
herbs. Mix into the rice halfway through the cooking.

Squeeze the half lemon into a small bowl and combine it with the egg yolk, 
parmesan, cream, a little salt and a very generous grinding of black pepper. 
Mix well with a fork.

When the rice is al dente, draw the pan off the heat and stir in the egg and 
cream mixture and the remaining butter. Cover the pan and leave to rest for 2 
minutes or so. Then give the risotto an energetic stir, transfer to a heated 
dish or bowl and serve at once, with more grated parmesan in a little bowl if 
you wish.

Serves 4-6
pumpkin or squash flesh 800g, cut into pieces
egg 1 large
sugar 1-2 tsp
salt and freshly ground pepper
plain flour about 150-175g
unsalted butter 75g, melted
grana padano or parmesan grated

Put the pumpkin in a large pan with 500ml water. Cook over high heat with the 
lid on for about 15 minutes until soft. Take the lid off and let all the liquid 
evaporate. Then mash to a paste with a potato masher and return to the hob, 
stirring over a high heat to dry it as much as possible. Add the egg, sugar 
(Italian pumpkins are sweet), salt (it needs a good amount) and pepper, and 
work in the flour beating vigorously.


Make dumplings by dropping the paste by the tablespoon into boiling salted 
water – grease the spoon with oil and use another spoon to push it off. When 
the dumplings rise to the top, let them cook a few minutes longer, then lift 
them out with a slotted spoon, drain and serve with melted butter and grated 
cheese.

Panzanella is a very old Tuscan tradition – a salad made with leftover bread, 
which would be unsalted, in the local style. It is a summer dish, which you 
would make when tomatoes and basil were good and plentiful.


If you want to make it the day before you eat it, the flavours will have 
longer to infuse and it will taste even better.

When you cook the sardines, it is very important to get your griddle pan 
really hot, otherwise the sardines will stick and you won’t be able to turn 
them without them breaking up.

Serves 4
sardines 12 large
extra-virgin olive oil 5 tbsp

For the panzanella
stale Tuscan bread or ciabatta 200g, without crusts, torn up
white wine vinegar 4 tbsp
tomatoes on the vine 3
red onion 1 large, cut into 2cm dice
basil a big bunch
extra-virgin olive oil 5 tbsp
salt and pepper

First, get a griddle pan smoking-hot, otherwise the sardines won’t release 
their fat and will stick to the pan.


To make the panzanella: soak the bread in the vinegar. Take the tomatoes from 
the vine, dice and add to the bread, together with the chopped onion. Tear the 
basil and add that too. Add the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Stir 
together and set aside.

Under running water, scale the sardines and then open them out, leaving the 
heads attached. To do this, insert a sharp filleting knife at the tail end, 
next to the backbone, and cut upwards, until you reach the belly of the fish. 
Turn the sardine over, then cut in the same way to the same point on the other 
side of the bone. Starting at the tail end, take the backbone between your 
forefinger and thumb and run them along the length of the bone up to the head. 
Cut across the bone at the tail end and head end and the bone should lift out, 
leaving the fillets still attached at the opposite side, so you can open them 
out like a book. At the outside of each fillet, you will see a black area with 
some fine bones. Just take your knife under these parts, and remove them. Then, 
with a pair of tweezers, take out any pin bones that may have remained in the 
fillets.

When all the sardines are prepared, season, brush with a little of the olive 
oil and put on the hot grill, 6 at a time. Let them get crusty on one side 
(about 3 minutes), then turn over and do the same on the other side (about 2 
minutes).

While the sardines are cooking, spoon some of the panzanella on each serving 
plate, then put the sardines on top, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and 
serve.
