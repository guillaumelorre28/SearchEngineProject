Prince of Wales's Stakes Day round-up

 Tipped in this morning’s Guardian when it was available at over 20-1, My 
Dream Boat was the surprise winner of the Prince of Wales’s Stakes, the day’s 
only Group One contest. Adam Kirby’s mount swooped late to beat Found in a 
photo finish as odds-on Japanese hot-pot A Shin Hikari was found 
uncharacteristically wanting and finished in last place.

 Earlier in the day, the Richard Fahey-trained Ribchester won the Jersey 
Stakes under William Buick to score the first leg of a Godolphin hat-trick that 
was notched up by three different trainers from three different countries. The 
Maktoum family operation secured their second victory of the day in the Duke of 
Cambridge Stakes, when Mikael Barzalona scythed through the field to win on 9-4 
favourite Usherette for French trainer Andre Fabre and made it three winners 
for the day in the Royal Hunt Cup, with James Doyle getting the leg-up to win 
on Portage from Michael Halford.

Easily the most impressive performance of the day came in the Queen Mary 
Stakes, when Frankie Dettori and Lady Aurelia left jaws on the floor as they 
blitzed the field in spectacular fashion to win by seven lengths for American 
trainer Wesley Ward. In the day’s closing race, Dettori made it a double with a 
win on favourite Persuasive. Tune in tomorrow for more top Flat racing action

Sandringham Handicap (5.35) 1m

They’re off and running in the final race of the day, with Planchart left 
behind after playing up in the stalls and being backed out by the handlers. 
Quality Time leads from Gypsy Eyes ... while Alamode ploughs a lkone furrow on 
the near side. Inside the final furlong, Persuasive takes up the lead, hitting 
the front with Frankie Dettori rousting her along. Persuasive wins the 
Sandringham to give Frankie his second winner of the afternoon and his third of 
the week.

Godolphin score hat-trick in Royal Hunt Cup

Godolphin claimed their third winner on the second day of Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> when Irish raider Portage 
struck in the Royal Hunt Cup.

Mick Halford’s four-year-old was never too far off a generous pace set by 
Early Morning on the far side of the track. But once the nine-runner breakaway 
group converged into one, Portage really got going in the hands of James Doyle.

The 10-1 chance took the lead inside the final furlong and kept on powerfully 
on the far rail to deny Librisa Breeze by a length and a quarter. Onrushing duo 
Mitchum Swagger and Azraff were third and fourth respectively.

Sandringham Handicap (5.35) preview

Chris Cook

Like the Hunt Cup but restricted to three-year-old fillies. The unbeaten 
Persuasive (John Gosden, Frankie Dettori) is a quite understandable favourite, 
as she can surely do a fair bit better than she has so far shown, though this 
ground is a question for her to answer, as is this big field.

Ireland’s Anamba has been keeping good company and won a Listed race last 
time, though her rating is not obviously lenient for this handicap debut. 
Diploma (Stoute, Moore) has been raised 10lb for beating a handful of rivals 
last time, albeit in good style.

This looks to me like a race that could throw up a shock, perhaps in the form 
of Sharaakah, from the resurgent Ed Dunlop yard, whose form at the end of last 
year had a nicely progressive look. She needs to be sharp for this reappearance 
but it is possible the trainer has saved her for this in the belief she is

Portage wins the Royal Hunt Cup

It’s a win for Irish trainer Michael Halford, who gave jockey James Doyle the 
leg-up. It’s Godolphin’s third winner of the day, with three different trainers 
from three different countries doing the honours.

Royal Hunt Cup (5.00) 1m

They’re away and running in the Royal Hunt Cup, with Sir Michael Stoute’s colt 
Convey the firm 13-2 favourite in the hands of Ryan Moore. Donncha was slow out 
of the gates as the 28 runners split into two groups on the near and far side. 
The far side group lead, with Early Morning up in front .... Early Morning the 
grey continues to lead as the two groups merge ... Labrisia Breeze makes 
headway into the furlong ... Portage and Librisia Breeze are the first two home 
... I think Portage won it. Portage wins the Royal Hunt Cup under a strong 
challenge from Librisia Breeze.

Royal Hunt Cup (5.00) preview

Chris Cook

A cavalry charge as 28 horses come up the straight mile in this tricky 
handicap. The draw may play a part and there have been indications this week 
that the far side (low-drawn runners) might be the right place to be, although 
the evidence has not been so strong that I’d put you off a horse drawn 
elsewhere.

Convey, representing Sir Michael Stoute and Ryan Moore, is understandably 
popular and looks well treated in light of his Group Three second last time, 
though one could worry about the fact that he hasn’t actually poked his head in 
front since winning his maiden in 2014.

GM Hopkins is 9lb higher than when winning this last year under Moore but does 
not look harshly treated in view of his subsequent efforts, though he could do 
with a drying day. Portage appeals to me as a previous winner here who bagged a 
Listed prize on his return. Early Morning went well for a long way in the 
Cambridgeshire and might be stronger this year. Captain Cat and Basem are among 
those who probably won’t like this ground.

My Dream Boat sets sail in Prince of Wales's Stakes

My Dream Boat was a surprising winner to give Clive Cox and Adam Kirby a 
second Group One success of the week in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes atRoyal 
Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>.

Beaten a long way by Japanese superstar A Shin Hikari in France last time out, 
he was sent off the outsider of the seven-runner field at 16-1. Following on 
from the King’s Stand victory of Profitable, after which Kirby was reduced to 
tears on announcing that his wife had given birth just hours before, the jockey 
will never forget this week.

Odds-on favourite A Shin Hikari - the highest-rated Flat horse in the world - 
set out to make all the running but failed to get away from the field turning 
into the straight and Yutaka Take was soon sending out distress signals.

Ryan Moore then produced Found and looked sure to give Aidan O’Brien his 50th 
RoyalAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> winner, but Kirby was just 
starting his run on My Dream Boat.
Cox’s four-year-old even defied a drift into the centre of the track to beat 
Found by a neck.

“I was pretty confident he’d be in the first three,” said Kirby. “The race 
went perfect. He gave me a real good feel when he won two starts ago but he was 
bit free last time and didn’t get home. Full credit to the horse, he stayed at 
it. It was a very gutsy performance.”

My Dream Boat sports of the colours of owners Paul and Clare Rooney, more 
familiar in jumping circles and owners of Grand National runner-up The Last 
Samuri.

Usherette shows the way home in Duke of Cambridge

Class rose to the top in the Duke of Cambridge Stakes at Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> as Andre Fabre’s Usherette 
justified favouritism with ease.

A winner at Newmarket earlier this season, Fabre had compared her with some of 
the best fillies he has trained in his long and illustrious career and the next 
step is surely a Group One.

Sent off the 9-4 favourite, Mikael Barzalona was happy to drop her in off just 
a steady pace set by Spangled.
A furlong and a half out the race began to develop with Barzalona hitting the 
front and taking two lengths out of the opposition.

John Gosden’s Furia Cruzada, an import from Chile, outran her 20-1 starting 
price to finish second, two and a quarter lengths away, just holding off 
the-fast finishing Always Smile, to give Godolphin a one-three.

It was Fabre’s eighth Royal winner, but a first for Barzalona, who said: “I 
think she’s really good and she travelled well. The ground didn’t suit her and 
I think she’s much, much better on good ground. She’s a lovely filly and she 
has a good character - she’s very tough.”PA Sport

Prince of Wales's Stakes (4.20) preview

Chris Cook

A Shin Hikari is odds-on to become the first Japanese-trained winner at the 
Royal meeting and deservedly so after hacking up at Chantilly last time in a 
race that also proved his ability to cope with soft ground.

The main question is whether he can be quite so impressive on his second start 
after travelling around the world, that race having possibly taken something 
out of him. Found is classy and would be the obvious one to take advantage if 
the Japanese horse flops for any reason, though the Irish filly would probably 
like a drier surface.

My Dream Boat appeals to me at a big price, as he had looked very progressive 
before trailing A Shin Hikari in France and has excuses for that run. Western 
Hymn will doubtless put up his usual solid effort but The Grey Gatsby and 
Tryster really would have preferred less rain.

Lady Aurelia demolishes Queen Mary Stakes field

Lady Aurelia provided American trainer Wesley Ward with his seventh Royal Ascot
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> winner in scintillating style 
when blitzing her rivals in the Queen Mary Stakes.

Ward, who broke new ground by bringing his speedier juveniles to the meeting 
in 2009, had told everyone who would listen the filly was the best he had run 
at the showpiece fixture to date.

Mark Johnston’s Camargue matched strides coming out of the stalls, but after 
half a furlong Frankie Dettori was in front on the US raider and the race never 
looked in doubt. By halfway her rivals were in trouble and when Dettori pressed 
the button the Scat Daddy filly took off again.

She passed the line seven lengths ahead of the French-trained Al Johrah with 
Clem Fandango third. Ward won the race 12 months ago with Acapulco, who went on 
to finish second in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York.

“It was breathtaking form the top,” said Dettori. “To win a sprint by seven 
lengths at RoyalAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot>, I’ve never 
seen anything like that - especially from a two-year-old. I was throwing some 
very good splits and when I got to the furlong-and-a-half [pole] I asked her to 
go and she found another gear. I was completely shocked. Unbelievable, she’s a 
lovely filly. Well done to Wesley, he’s a master of the sprinters.”PA Sport

Duke Of Cambridge Stakes (3.05) preview

Chris Cook

Here’s a mile race for females who are either just below top class or are not 
quite there yet. Usherette looks like getting there in the near future, judged 
by her comfortable success at this level at Newmarket last month, when the 
placed horses were both Group One winners. She hasn’t yet faced ground like 
this but has a sister who won on heavy, for what it’s worth.

Always Smile is a big runner, having gone down by just a nose in a handicap 
over this course and distance at the last Royal meeting. Godolphin’s runner 
showed a good level of form in landing a York handicap on her return. The 
ground has probably gone against Lucida but Jazzi Top might be all right on it 
and she has already won at this level, though she needs an excuse for her 
nine-length defeat by Usherette last time.

Queen Mary Stakes (3.05)

That was an astonishing win by Lady Aurelia, to give American trainer Wesley 
Ward his seventhRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> 
winner. She absolutely smithereened the rest of the field to win by an official 
distance of seven lengths - it looked like a lot more to me. “It was 
breathtaking from the top,” says Frankie Dettori. “When I got to a furlong to 
go and asked her for more she found another gear.”

Queen Mary Stakes (3.05) 5f

A brisk five furlongs is the short trip as the 17 fillies set off in the Queen 
Mary Stakes. Lady Aurelia was first out of the gates and makes her way towards 
the centre. Lady Aurelia blazes a trail in an attempt to make all as she 
gallops down the centre of the track. Lady Aurtelia pulls clear to win by six 
... seven ... eight ... nine ... ten ... eleven lengths under Frankie Dettori.

They're down at the start ...

There’ll be a delay, as Simmie has spread a plate, so the farrier has been 
called down to make her a new shoe. Her connections have the option to let her 
run without a shoe, with a new one, or to withdraw their horse. They’re opting 
for her to go fully shoed-up. Lady Aurelia remains the warm favourite at 5-2.

 Tipped in this morning’s Guardian when it was available at over 20-1, My 
Dream Boat was the surprise winner of the Prince of Wales’s Stakes, the day’s 
only Group One contest. Adam Kirby’s mount swooped late to beat Found in a 
photo finish as odds-on Japanese hot-pot A Shin Hikari was found 
uncharacteristically wanting and finished in last place.

 Earlier in the day, the Richard Fahey-trained Ribchester won the Jersey 
Stakes under William Buick to score the first leg of a Godolphin hat-trick that 
was notched up by three different trainers from three different countries. The 
Maktoum family operation secured their second victory of the day in the Duke of 
Cambridge Stakes, when Mikael Barzalona scythed through the field to win on 9-4 
favourite Usherette for French trainer Andre Fabre and made it three winners 
for the day in the Royal Hunt Cup, with James Doyle getting the leg-up to win 
on Portage from Michael Halford.

Easily the most impressive performance of the day came in the Queen Mary 
Stakes, when Frankie Dettori and Lady Aurelia left jaws on the floor as they 
blitzed the field in spectacular fashion to win by seven lengths for American 
trainer Wesley Ward. In the day’s closing race, Dettori made it a double with a 
win on favourite Persuasive. Tune in tomorrow for more top Flat racing action 
fromRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>.

They’re off and running in the final race of the day, with Planchart left 
behind after playing up in the stalls and being backed out by the handlers. 
Quality Time leads from Gypsy Eyes ... while Alamode ploughs a lkone furrow on 
the near side. Inside the final furlong, Persuasive takes up the lead, hitting 
the front with Frankie Dettori rousting her along. Persuasive wins the 
Sandringham to give Frankie his second winner of the afternoon and his third of 
the week.
 
Godolphin claimed their third winner on the second day of Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> when Irish raider Portage 
struck in the Royal Hunt Cup.

Mick Halford’s four-year-old was never too far off a generous pace set by 
Early Morning on the far side of the track. But once the nine-runner breakaway 
group converged into one, Portage really got going in the hands of James Doyle.

The 10-1 chance took the lead inside the final furlong and kept on powerfully 
on the far rail to deny Librisa Breeze by a length and a quarter. Onrushing duo 
Mitchum Swagger and Azraff were third and fourth respectively.

Like the Hunt Cup but restricted to three-year-old fillies. The unbeaten 
Persuasive (John Gosden, Frankie Dettori) is a quite understandable favourite, 
as she can surely do a fair bit better than she has so far shown, though this 
ground is a question for her to answer, as is this big field.

Ireland’s Anamba has been keeping good company and won a Listed race last 
time, though her rating is not obviously lenient for this handicap debut. 
Diploma (Stoute, Moore) has been raised 10lb for beating a handful of rivals 
last time, albeit in good style.

This looks to me like a race that could throw up a shock, perhaps in the form 
of Sharaakah, from the resurgent Ed Dunlop yard, whose form at the end of last 
year had a nicely progressive look. She needs to be sharp for this reappearance 
but it is possible the trainer has saved her for this in the belief she is 
ahead of her mark.

It’s a win for Irish trainer Michael Halford, who gave jockey James Doyle the 
leg-up. It’s Godolphin’s third winner of the day, with three different trainers 
from three different countries doing the honours.
 
They’re away and running in the Royal Hunt Cup, with Sir Michael Stoute’s colt 
Convey the firm 13-2 favourite in the hands of Ryan Moore. Donncha was slow out 
of the gates as the 28 runners split into two groups on the near and far side. 
The far side group lead, with Early Morning up in front .... Early Morning the 
grey continues to lead as the two groups merge ... Labrisia Breeze makes

that the far side (low-drawn runners) might be the right place to be, although 
the evidence has not been so strong that I’d put you off a horse drawn 
elsewhere.

Convey, representing Sir Michael Stoute and Ryan Moore, is understandably 
popular and looks well treated in light of his Group Three second last time, 
though one could worry about the fact that he hasn’t actually poked his head in 
front since winning his maiden in 2014.

GM Hopkins is 9lb higher than when winning this last year under Moore but does 
not look harshly treated in view of his subsequent efforts, though he could do 
with a drying day. Portage appeals to me as a previous winner here who bagged a 
Listed prize on his return. Early Morning went well for a long way in the 
Cambridgeshire and might be stronger this year. Captain Cat and Basem are among 
those who probably won’t like this ground.

 
My Dream Boat was a surprising winner to give Clive Cox and Adam Kirby a 
second Group One success of the week in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes atRoyal 
Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>.

Beaten a long way by Japanese superstar A Shin Hikari in France last time out, 
he was sent off the outsider of the seven-runner field at 16-1. Following on 
from the King’s Stand victory of Profitable, after which Kirby was reduced to 
tears on announcing that his wife had given birth just hours before, the jockey 
will never forget this week.

Odds-on favourite A Shin Hikari - the highest-rated Flat horse in the world - 
set out to make all the running but failed to get away from the field turning 
into the straight and Yutaka Take was soon sending out distress signals.

Ryan Moore then produced Found and looked sure to give Aidan O’Brien his 50th 
RoyalAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> winner, but Kirby was just 
starting his run on My Dream Boat.
Cox’s four-year-old even defied a drift into the centre of the track to beat 
Found by a neck.

“I was pretty confident he’d be in the first three,” said Kirby. “The race 
went perfect. He gave me a real good feel when he won two starts ago but he was 
bit free last time and didn’t get home. Full credit to the horse, he stayed at 
it. It was a very gutsy performance.”

The 16-1 outsider of the whole field of six wins the big race of the day under 
a fine ride from Adam Kirby. Fans of this website will be aware that Chris Cook 
tipped this one, so I hope you were on!
 
... A Shin Hikari continues to make the running from Western Hymn with two 
furlongs to go ... Found swoops by with My Dreamboat on the wide outside. My 
Dreamboat and Found ... My Dream Boat looks to have won on the near side from 
Found. It’s a photo, but A Shin Hikari has been well beaten.
 
They’re off and running in the only Group One race of the day, with £425,325 
first prize on offer. A Shin Hikari makes the early running, easy to pick out 
with the red and black visor, as Yutaka Take takes a firm hold ...

Class rose to the top in the Duke of Cambridge Stakes at Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> as Andre Fabre’s Usherette 
justified favouritism with ease.

A winner at Newmarket earlier this season, Fabre had compared her with some of 
the best fillies he has trained in his long and illustrious career and the next 
step is surely a Group One.

Sent off the 9-4 favourite, Mikael Barzalona was happy to drop her in off just 
a steady pace set by Spangled.
A furlong and a half out the race began to develop with Barzalona hitting the 
front and taking two lengths out of the opposition.

John Gosden’s Furia Cruzada, an import from Chile, outran her 20-1 starting 
price to finish second, two and a quarter lengths away, just holding off 
the-fast finishing Always Smile, to give Godolphin a one-three.

It was Fabre’s eighth Royal winner, but a first for Barzalona, who said: “I 
think she’s really good and she travelled well. The ground didn’t suit her and 
I think she’s much, much better on good ground. She’s a lovely filly and she 
has a good character - she’s very tough.”PA Sport

A Shin Hikari is odds-on to become the first Japanese-trained winner at the 
Royal meeting and deservedly so after hacking up at Chantilly last time in a 
race that also proved his ability to cope with soft ground.

The main question is whether he can be quite so impressive on his second start 
after travelling around the world, that race having possibly taken something 
out of him. Found is classy and would be the obvious one to take advantage if 
the Japanese horse flops for any reason, though the Irish filly would probably 
like a drier surface.

My Dream Boat appeals to me at a big price, as he had looked very progressive 
before trailing A Shin Hikari in France and has excuses for that run. Western 
Hymn will doubtless put up his usual solid effort but The Grey Gatsby and 
Tryster really would have preferred less rain.

... with two furlongs to go, Usherette takes up the lead, followed by Always 
Smile and Furia Cruzada. Usherette leads them home in the Duke of Cambridge 
Stakes.
 
A mile is the trip with £99,243 first prize to the winner in this fillies 
race. Usherette is the favourite, aiming to give French trainer Andre Fabre his 
seventhRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> win and his 
first in six years. He trains for Godolphin, who have four in this race. They 
break from the traps and Spangled takes up the lead, , followed by Maimara as 
the bunched field gambol along at a fairly steady pace ...

Lady Aurelia provided American trainer Wesley Ward with his seventh Royal Ascot
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> winner in scintillating style 
when blitzing her rivals in the Queen Mary Stakes.

Ward, who broke new ground by bringing his speedier juveniles to the meeting 
in 2009, had told everyone who would listen the filly was the best he had run 
at the showpiece fixture to date.

Mark Johnston’s Camargue matched strides coming out of the stalls, but after 
half a furlong Frankie Dettori was in front on the US raider and the race never 
looked in doubt. By halfway her rivals were in trouble and when Dettori pressed 
the button the Scat Daddy filly took off again.

She passed the line seven lengths ahead of the French-trained Al Johrah with 
Clem Fandango third. Ward won the race 12 months ago with Acapulco, who went on 
to finish second in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York.

“It was breathtaking form the top,” said Dettori. “To win a sprint by seven 
lengths at RoyalAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot>, I’ve never 
seen anything like that - especially from a two-year-old. I was throwing some 
very good splits and when I got to the furlong-and-a-half [pole] I asked her to 
go and she found another gear. I was completely shocked. Unbelievable, she’s a 
lovely filly. Well done to Wesley, he’s a master of the sprinters.”PA Sport

Here’s a mile race for females who are either just below top class or are not 
quite there yet. Usherette looks like getting there in the near future, judged 
by her comfortable success at this level at Newmarket last month, when the 
placed horses were both Group One winners. She hasn’t yet faced ground like 
this but has a sister who won on heavy, for what it’s worth.

Always Smile is a big runner, having gone down by just a nose in a handicap 
over this course and distance at the last Royal meeting. Godolphin’s runner 
showed a good level of form in landing a York handicap on her return. The 
ground has probably gone against Lucida but Jazzi Top might be all right on it 
and she has already won at this level, though she needs an excuse for her 
nine-length defeat by Usherette last time.
 
Well, it seems to be that Lady Aurelia’s win was one of the omst extraordinary 
performances by a two-year-old filly ever seen atRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. She absolutely blitzed the 
field.

That was an astonishing win by Lady Aurelia, to give American trainer Wesley 
Ward his seventhRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> 
winner. She absolutely smithereened the rest of the field to win by an official 
distance of seven lengths - it looked like a lot more to me. “It was 
breathtaking from the top,” says Frankie Dettori. “When I got to a furlong to 
go and asked her for more she found another gear.”

There’ll be a delay, as Simmie has spread a plate, so the farrier has been 
called down to make her a new shoe. Her connections have the option to let her 
run without a shoe, with a new one, or to withdraw their horse. They’re opting 
for her to go fully shoed-up. Lady Aurelia remains the warm favourite at 5-2.
