I'm fed up with the same old vinaigrette, and wonder if you have any special 
recipes for salad dressings up your sleeve?

Alison Swan, Nottinghamshire

The basic vinaigrette recipe – one part vinegar to three parts oil – can be 
varied in so many ways. There are multitudes of flavoured vinegars, from 
tarragon and lavender to chilli and basil. A L'Olivier's range of vinegars made 
with fruit pulp, including mango, tomato, pimiento, cassis and fig, are rich 
and substantial without being dominant, and make some of the best dressings I 
have tasted.

Choose your oil carefully: some leaves can handle a robust oily coating while 
others fare better with a lighter, nut oil flavour. Try using a little argan 
oil mixed with a more everyday oil.

If you prefer a creamier dressing try this: take one egg yolk and whisk it 
with 2 tbsp of tarragon vinegar and 1 tsp of grain mustard until light and 
creamy. Slowly whisk in 140ml of light oil (sunflower will do), season and add 
a dessertspoon of chopped tarragon. Dilute with a little water if necessary. 
Drizzle over finely julienned raw veg: red cabbage, carrots, celery, cucumber 
and orange segments. Toss together and finish with wafer-thin slices of smoked 
goosebreast.

An old favourite of mine is a vanilla, chervil and tomato dressing. Scrape out 
the inside of a vanilla pod and add to a mixture of 1.5 tbsp white wine with 
half a tbsp lemon juice. Mix with 5 tbsp light olive oil and 1 tbsp truffle 
oil. Season and add 2 finely diced, peeled tomatoes and 0.5 tbsp freshly 
chopped chervil. Serve over a piece of plain, steamed or grilled white fish or 
a hot chicken salad. A winner.
