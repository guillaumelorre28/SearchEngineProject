Lawyers and advocates leading the legal fight against same-sex marriage issued 
some of their last gasps around a Montgomery,Alabama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama> courthouse on Wednesday.

Inside, the lawyer for the Alabama supreme court chief justice, Roy Moore, 
argued that the judge did not really force anyone to do anything when he 
ordered county-level judges not to perform same-sex marriages even after the US 
supreme court had ruled the unions legal.

Fighting gay marriage law is 'rude': polite Alabama drag queen is voice for 
equality

Outside, Ambrosia Starling, a drag queen who has been dubbed Moore’s nemesis, 
stood opposite a row of opponents and prepared to celebrate Moore’s ousting 
from the court should he be sanctioned with the ethics charges he is facing.

The court of judiciary will probably render a verdict in the next few days in 
Moore’s trial to decide whether his fight against gay marriage was an abuse of 
power and should cost him is seat on the court. After the US supreme court 
ruled same-sex marriage legal, Moore sent an administrative order to the 
county-level judges throughout Alabama, telling them not to go against the 
state of Alabama’s own rulings prohibiting such marriages. Moore was part of a 
last-ditch effort in some states to block the legalization of same-sex 
marriages around the country. And for him, it ended with ethics charges that 
could cost him his job, though it might actually help him in a martyred run for 
governor.

To issue a command against issuing same-sex marriage licenses would be a plain 
breach of the US constitution’ssupremacy clause 
<https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause>, which establishes the 
pre-eminence of federal courts. That left Moore’s lawyers in contortions to 
explain what exactly his administrative order was.

“It’s called an order, but – it can’t force anyone to do anything,” attorney 
Mat Staver said.

 “He has convicted himself with his own words,” said Richard Cohen, president 
of the Southern Poverty Law Center, outside the courthouse. “so his defense was 
just word games.”

The two camps of protesters outside the courthouse grew throughout the day, 
both in size and volume, and eventually a cluster of Alabama state troopers 
came and positioned themselves in the center. On each side de facto leaders 
took up bullhorns and blasted the space with overlapping passions.

On the rainbow side, Starling led followers in a chant: “Sinners hate. God 
doesn’t.”

On the placard side, self-described evangelist Alan Hoyle broadcast a stream 
of graphic anatomical descriptions: “The vagina is moist and warm and fits the 
man’s penis. The anus gives no pleasure. These men bleed. They bleed.”

Starling has emerged over the past two years as a gay rights leader in 
Alabama, and has become Moore’s leading opponent. He has called her a 
“professed transvestite”, and once said: “In 2013, if this would’ve happened 
then, this person and the people around her, or some of the people around her – 
him – would have been said to have a mental disorder.”

Wednesday on the courthouse steps, Starling said she knew Moore might parlay a 
loss in his trial into a run for governor. But she didn’t care. “He must go. 
Alabama deserves better than this. The rule of law deserves better than this.”

 Self-described evangelist Alan Hoyle: ‘Their lifestyle is a perversion.’

Starling, for all her flamboyance, feels awkward in her role as the voice of a 
movement, but said she continues because her striking hair, makeup and figure 
catch people’s attention.

On the opposing side, Hoyle seemed to have mastered a similar approach. He 
wore the beard of a prophet and a dazzling collection of electronic devices, 
and he carried a full-size aluminum flagpole and flag, which was so tall he 
appeared to be hugging an official installation on the courthouse steps.

“I feel sorry for these people,” he said. “Their lifestyle is a perversion and 
the state should stay out of marriage law.”

So would he agree to a separation of church marriages and state-sanctioned 
unions so that everyone has equal legal rights?

He thought a long time. “They could enter a contract …” he said. “It’s a 
perversion.”

He took up his bullhorn again and re-entered the verbal battle: “There is no 
peace, says the Lord, for the wicked.”
