Alanis Morissette <https://www.theguardian.com/music/alanis-morissette> has 
signed up as Guardian Weekend magazine’s new advice columnist.

The Canadian singer, who rose to fame in the 1990s on the back of Jagged 
Little Pill’s global hit Ironic, will write her first column for the 16 January 
edition.

Once labelled “an angry young woman”, Morissette feels she is a born agony 
aunt.

She has recently started recording podcasts about relationships and wellbeing 
on her own website, and says she was always the “family therapist” when she was 
growing up in Ottawa.

“Parents, brothers, even extended family members, that was the role I took on, 
because I suppose I had this combination of intuition and empathy. I cut my 
teeth, basically, listening for a living,” she said.


Morissette, who takes over the column from Molly Ringwald, channelled her own 
issues into music, which made her a global superstar at the age of 21.

“I’m definitely a therapy girl. I think that’s quite obvious,” she said. “I 
don’t want to say everyone should [have therapy], but do I think everyone might 
benefit from it? Yes. But I’m aware that a lot of people have great resistance 
to it.”

Ahead of her first column, Morissette gave an exclusive interview which will 
appear in this Saturday’s Weekend magazine, covering everything from her early 
life to her phenomenal rise to stardom and working with the likes of Justin 
Bieber, Taylor Swift and Demi Lovato.

Despite her success, Morissette talks about an epiphany 10 years ago when she 
realised she did not want to be “that woman who, at 70, has all these awards 
and is dying alone”.

Opening up about her marriage to rapper and DJ Mario “Souleye” Treadway, she 
describes how “anyone who meets us often marvels at how different we are”.
