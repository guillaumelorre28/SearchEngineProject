In the rush of excellent new Bruckner recordings - Mariss Jansons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/mariss-jansons> conducting Nos 3 and 4, 
Paavo JÃ¤rvi the seventh - one stands out: Fabio Luisi and the Dresden 
Staatskapelle's account of the ninth, the composer's final and incomplete 
symphonic outpouring. Luisi musters an assurance, incisiveness and rawness from 
his players in a fiery performance which is majestic yet sensual. Form and 
structure are laid bare with blazing clarity. The warm string melody of the 
opening movement, the fury of the scherzo and the yearning uncertainties of the 
adagio are pushed to their imaginative and tonal limits. Essential listening.
