The actor, who has hosted the show a record 16 times, will play the Republican 
candidate in the lead-up to the election alongside cast member Kate McKinnon as 
Hillary Clinton.

Baldwin will debut his impression on the season opener on 1 October, teased by 
an advert that promises a skit based on this week’s presidential debate. The 
role was previously played by Darrell Hammond, who will remain on the show 
periodically in other guises.

According to the Hollywood Reporter 
<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alec-baldwin-snl-new-donald-trump-933435>
, executive producer Lorne Michaels made the decision earlier this summer and 
Baldwin officially signed on this week. The pair have also worked together on 
the award-winning comedy 30 Rock.

Baldwin initially expressed support for Trump, claiming he was a “huge 
campaign finance reform person” in 2015, but earlier this year he toldthe 
Telegraph
