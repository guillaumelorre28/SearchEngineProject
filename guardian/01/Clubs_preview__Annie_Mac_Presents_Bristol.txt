Seriously on the case, but mercifully without Zane Lowe's slightly cloying 
over-enthusiasm,Annie Mac <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/annie-mac> 
is the perfect DJ for Radio 1's brave new post-Smashie and Nicey world. Her 
autumn tour has comprised a majorly successful, genre-spanning mix of live 
shows and DJs, and tonight's show in Bristol sounds pretty promising. The main 
room sees a live set from futuristic electro-funkers Machines Don't Care and, 
besides a slot from Annie herself, there are also DJ sets from MDC members 
Sinden, Surkin, Hervé and Detboi, Annie's producer and Lovebox resident Rachel 
Barton and The Blast DJs: The Bandit, Smokey and Dubious. Soul:r DJs Lynx and 
Kemo visit Bristol for the first time to host room two, which also sees DJ 
slots from Nu:Tone, Kapacity and In:Sight. To complete the lineup, Bristol's 
drum'n'bass legends Ruffneck Diskotek take care of business in room three.
