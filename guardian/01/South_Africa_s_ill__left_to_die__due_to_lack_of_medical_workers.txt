The putrid air clouds the dingy room where Hilary Motsiri lies groaning at the 
slightest touch. The two homecare workers attempt to soothe her wound, but only 
half of her breast remains as a festering tumour has eroded the flesh.

"We can't even offer her painkillers. She needs to go to the clinic to get 
them, but she can't move from the bed," explains carer Anna Diale. The carers 
do all they can with their limited supplies, but warm salt water and an 
adhesive dressing do nothing to assuage her suffering.

"I am scared because I have had the pain since January and it is getting 
worse. My granddaughter is young, she has HIV and I don't want to leave her," 
says Hilary.

Early medical intervention could have prevented Motsiri's condition becoming 
so severe. However, since the implementation of free public healthcare in 1994, 
South Africa has lost many of its healthcare professionals due to the abysmal 
wages within the sector. Those who wish to earn a good wage are drawn to 
private care or seek employment abroad.

Motsiri depends on her daily visits, but as Diale says: "How can people be 
left to die in this way? Our healthcare may be free, but if people can't access 
it, what's the point?"
