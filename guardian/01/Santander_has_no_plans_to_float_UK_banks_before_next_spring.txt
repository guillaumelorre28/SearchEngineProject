Santander is not planning to float off its UK banking arm – which includes 
Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley – until the spring, 
disappointing the legions of investment bankers who have been lobbying it for 
the mandate to manage the share sale.

The Spanish bank is understood to be taking advice from Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch about the size and structure of the sale of part of its UK arm, 
which has expanded rapidly since it bought Abbey National in 2004 then snapped 
up A&L and B&B in the banking crisis.

Santander is likely to sell 20% of the UK business, which could be valued at 
around £3bn, in a move that would mimic its mode of operations in other 
countries. It floated its Brazilian unit last year.

The bank has already begun the process of stamping its red-flamed logo across 
high streets

 and replacing the brand names of each of the banks it has acquired in the past 
six years.

Speculation about a flotation mounted after Santander secured an agreement 
with Royal Bank of Scotland to buy the 318 branches that RBS was forced to sell 
in return for up to £54bn of taxpayers' money. However, that deal will not 
complete until the end of next year.
