Akram Khan was born in Wimbledon, south-west London. His family comes from 
Dhaka, Bangladesh. At the age of seven he trained in Kathak, one of the eight 
forms of classical Indian dance, before making his professional debut at the 
age of 13 in Peter Brook’s legendary production of theMahabharata. His style is 
an authoritative hybrid of ancient and modern and theMahabharata, with which he 
toured the world for two years, has proved a lasting influence. His latest show,
Until the Lions <http://www.akramkhancompany.net/productions/until-the-lions/>, 
is based on the epic Hindu poem and will be at theBrighton Festival 26-27 May 
<http://www.akramkhancompany.net/whats-on/until-the-lions-brighton/>, and at 
the Curve in Leicester 3-5 November.

 ‘There is something universal about her’: Kate Tempest. Photograph: Karen 
Robinson for the Observer 
I heard her voice first and then saw her on YouTube 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLWlB3ib7ZM>. I was looking for a poet. I had 
been working with a wonderful poet called Polarbear and Kate Tempest is a 
friend of his. He said: “Why don’t you have a look at her?” There is something 
powerful and – a rare thing – universal about her. There are two kinds of 
knowledge: information, which is what most of us have, from technology and 
books, and then there is lived knowledge – real knowledge. When Kate Tempest 
speaks her poetry, there is deep, inhabited knowledge. It took no more than 
that little YouTube advert to make me see she was special. I became a fan.

 ‘Emotionally challenging’: Talvar ( Guilty) 
This 2015 Bollywood drama is an emotionally challenging film and a true story. 
If you have children – I have two – it is especially poignant. I was in India 
touring. I joked to my producer: “We are in Bombay, Bollywood Town.” I’d been 
working intensely, India is never easy with a technical tour, though it is 
rewarding. “We should see a Bollywood film.” He said: “Brace yourself.” The 
film he took me to was about a murdered daughter, and how the court incorrectly 
convicted the girl’s parents of the crime. The real killer is still out there, 
the lovely parents in prison for a crime they did not commit. It is horrific 
and it is happening right now. It hit me in a way other films have not.

 ‘Ingenious’: Simon McBurney in The Encounter Photograph: Tristram Kenton for 
the Guardian 
Simon McBurney is a friend and we have been wanting to do something together 
for so long. Whenever we meet, we say: “When will we do this duet?” I am not 
the only one with an impossibly busy schedule. I am looking forward to seeing 
his new show in Amsterdam at a festival in which we are both performing. He has 
createda sound world within an Amazon forest 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW01mBruivo>. He ingeniously takes away 
familiar theatrical vocabulary and rephrases it. McBurney and his work can be 
summed up in this line from Sri Sri Ravi Shankar: “Sound when stretched is 
music, movement when stretched is dance, mind when stretched is meditation and 
life when stretched is celebration.”

 ‘I come back to this whenever I get frustrated’: The Giving Tree by Shel 
Silverstein. Photograph: Particular Books 
I keep going back to this book because I have to remind myself of humanity, 
humility and giving without expecting. You have a different respect for your 
parents when you have children yourself. It has nothing to do with how good or 
bad your children are. They are just children. Children expect without giving 
back. I believe we borrow energy from the world when we come into it. When we 
die, we have to give that energy to someone else to take on. We are on borrowed 
time. I come back to this book whenever I get frustrated or stuck. Not that I 
am claiming that I am able to give as it says.

 ‘A spiritual experience’: The Kalakshetra institute. Photograph: Alamy 
I was in India again last year, in Chennai, and invited to give a masterclass 
at Kalakshetra. It is one of the oldest Indian classical institutes and it was 
a spiritual experience. They were taking class under the banyan tree. In the 
middle of this sacred place, nature and art come together. There is an ancient 
theatre of wood and straw and clay with a few lights and such atmosphere – the 
sounds of insects and musical instruments. It was inspiring. Place changes 
everything. For me, life and art are fused. I felt I would like to spend more 
time in this place, knowing it would influence my work.

 ‘Something ancient about her voice’: Amy Winehouse. Photograph: Jeff 
Kravitz/FilmMagic 
This is a film that reflects on fame and the unreality that can become your 
reality, which can be very dangerous if you don’t have the right support. Asif 
Kapadia is a wonderful film director. He is able to capture the essence of 
people (think of his terrific film,Senna). He was able to guide the audience 
through Amy’s journey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/05/amy-winehouse-documentary-asif-kapadia-review>
 and see it from her perspective, so you can empathise – Asif is great at that. 
I wish I had seen Amy perform live, there was something ancient about her 
voice. As soon as she opened her mouth, you felt there was a history to it.

 ‘Thinking aloud when he plays’: Brad Mehldau Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty 
Images 
Brad Mehldau <https://www.theguardian.com/music/brad-mehldau> is a phenomenal 
jazz pianist. He takes well-known songs and transforms them seamlessly, as if 
they were originally written as jazz. His mind, his creativity, as he is 
improvising is amazing: you feel he is thinking aloud as he plays. This was a 
long, intense, ingenious evening in which your mind floated away. He translated 
Bach (Fugue No 16 in G minor, Prelude in C major from The Well-Tempered 
Clavier, and Book 1’s D Minor Prelude No 6). I am eclectic in my musical 
tastes. I admire artistry.
