Just as it seemed that spring had arrived early, a cruel Siberian freeze has 
blown in and left wildlife in a state of confusion. Balmy temperatures in 
January were a wake-up call for many creatures, with reports of frogspawn in 
the West Country and West Wales, and sightings of ladybirds over southern 
England, even though ladybirds are supposed to spend the winter dormant in 
dense vegetation or bark crevices. A few butterflies have also been flitting 
around, particularly red admirals and peacocks, and even red-tailed bumblebees 
have buzzed around, identified by the red tail poking out from their big hairy 
bodies.

Some hibernating mammals also broke cover and started foraging. Small 
hedgehogs were seen wandering around, although their larger, older fellows have 
stayed hibernating. A few bats also took wing in brief forays before they 
returned to their roosts and sank back into hibernation. But there are serious 
risks to breaking hibernation this early, because it uses up valuable energy 
reserves before there is much food to find. And now the weather has turned 
cold, these early risers face being seriously weakened by the time the proper 
spring arrives.

Not all our mammals hibernate, though. Bloodcurdling noises are increasingly 
heard in towns and cities at night. They are the mating calls of foxes â€“ the 
male fox makes short, sharp barks and are answered by the eerie scream of the 
vixen when she is ready to mate.
