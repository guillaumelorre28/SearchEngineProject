The clown elected to congress in Brazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/11/clown-brazil-congress-read-write>
 has presented his first bill, which encourages illiterate adults to learn how 
to read and write.

Francisco Silva, who had to prove to a judge he met literacy requirements for 
congress members before taking his seat, called for a one off payment of 345 
Brazilian real (Â£211) to be made to any illiterate adult who learns how to read 
and write.

Silva's spokeswoman Edit Silva said payment would be made at the end of a 
six-month literacy course.

Silva is known as Tiririca, which means "grumpy" in Portuguese. He won more 
votes than any other candidate in Brazil's elections last October.
