Derided as a Dylan copyist for his early hits Catch the Wind and Colours, 
Donovan made an extraordinary leap when he embraced flower power and bought 
into psychedelia on Sunshine Superman, laced with drug references. The single 
gave him a huge hit in both Britain and the US and the eclectic LP of the same 
name that followed, incorporating jazz, Celtic, eastern and medieval music, is 
now an inspiration for modern crossover bands.
