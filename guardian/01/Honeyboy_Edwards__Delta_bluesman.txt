Library of Congress in 1942 and he's still doing it seven decades later. The

hugely significant, and for that reason, someone once said that he might be 
more important as a raconteur than as a musician.

teenager.

"The Delta blues still exerts the same raw power as it always did, and those 
stories are part of what makes Honeyboy a legend."
