Connie takes on America

Connie Hedegaard, Danish environment minister who will be the official host of 
the Copenhagen talks, took the diplomatic gloves off within minutes of the 
Barcelona talks opening by challenging the US to set an emissions target:
 I feel it [is] very hard to imagine how the US president can receive the 
Nobel peace prize on December 10 in Oslo only a few hundreds kilometres [from 
Copenhagen] if he has sent an American delegation to Copenhagen with no offer. 
I remind the US that it is not the only country in the world that has to have 
discussions with its domestic parliament. The expectation out there worldwide 
among populations and the young [is for] the US to deliver on one of the key 
challenges of our century. The Americans will have to come up [with an offer] 
one way or another. 
Russia's trump card

Word on the grapevine here is that Russia, the dark horse among the Annex 1 
[rich] countries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/22/climate-change-glossary-jargon>
, will this week formally side with the US, Europe, Australia and Canada and 
demand that the Kyoto protocol is ditched in favour of a brand new agreement. 
That would be rich, if only because it was Russia that actually saved Kyoto 
back in 2002 when after three years years of hesitation,it ratified it and 
thereby brought it into force 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/23/society.russia>. A case of what 
Russia gives, Russia may take away.

A right clock-up

The main hall here in Barcelona is vast and anonymous. But in a nice 
theatrical touch the organisers have installed a countdown to Copenhagen clock 
right in front of the podium (rather likeour online one 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/copenhagen>). As Yvo de Boer stood up 
to welcome the 3,000 delagates who could squeze into the room, it was reading 
34 days, 23 hours, 31 minutes and 30 seconds. "The clock has almost ticked down 
to zero. Time will fly. I sense a huge desire to succeed," he said. The trouble 
is, the way it has been positioned, most of the delegations could not see it.

Law and politics

How long can it really take to put together a legally binding — as opposed to 
a political — deal?Rich countries say it's not possible in the time left 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/01/climate-change-world-leaders-accused>
 but 30 lawyers and other people from WWF, Greenpeace, the David Suzuki 
foundation in Canada and elsewhere, sat down to see if it was possible in the 
remaining time. They managed it it in under seven days. They will present their 
plan to country delegations tomorrow.
What exactly is the UK doing?

The head of the G77, Sudanese ambassador Lumumba Stanislaus-Kaw Di-Aping, is 
spotted entering the halls lugging a great bag of papers. "Please tell me what 
is Great Britain doing? Where is its moral authority. We need it now," he says. 
Over to the UK delegation, squeezed between the UAE and the Tanzania for the 
opening ceremony. Jan Thompson, the UK chief negotiator, squashes rumours that 
climate change secretary Ed Miliband will be dropping in to Barcelona at the 
end of the week to galvanise the talks. "His press people are coming, but I 
don't believe he is," she says.
Greenpeace and Gaudí

NGOs have been begun to sound exactly like Denmark's Hedegaard. Here is a 
Greenpeace spokesman, as its climbers scaled one of Gaudí's iconic Sagrada 
Familia towers to drop a banner: "A good deal for the climate is still 
possible. All that is missing is political will from the US, which under 
President Obama has fallen far behind the rest of the world and is threatening 
to undermine a planet-saving agreement in Copenhagen."
