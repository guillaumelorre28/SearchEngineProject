Star Wars <https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars> fans around the world 
are daring to hope that new film The Force Awakens will be as good as its promo 
clip makes it look – or at least better than The Phantom Menace. Early ticket 
sales suggest optimism on that point.

But with two months to go until the new movie premieres, how can you fill the 
time? Unsurprisingly, there are apps for that. In fact, Star Wars has generated 
a whole mini-industry of mobile games and apps in its own right.

Here are 10 of the best to fuel your Force fetish in the runup to Christmas. 
Where you see “IAP”, that means in-app purchases.

Star Wars (Free)
Android 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.starwarshub_goo> / iOS
 <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-wars/id960108075?mt=8>
There are plenty of ways to keep tabs on Star Wars news and clips: Facebook, 
Twitter and YouTube for starters. Yet the official Star Wars app may be worth a 
slot on your homescreen, in the short term at least. It pulls in social updates 
and news, while adding historical trivia, videos and the obligatory themed 
selfie filters.

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (£7.99)
Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aspyr.swkotor> / iOS
 <https://appsto.re/gb/uyCCK.i>
With decades of Star Wars games to draw on, this is still regularly hailed by 
hardcore fans as the best of the lot. Originally a PC and console game in 2003, 
it has since returned in a faithful mobile port. Best enjoyed on a tablet, it’s 
a deep, rewarding RPG set in the Star Wars universe, with freedom to plot your 
own party and path.

Star Wars: Uprising (Free + IAP)
Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kabam.swat> / iOS 
<https://appsto.re/gb/R1x82.i>
This is the most recent Star Wars game for mobile devices, made by movie 
specialist Kabam – which previously turned The Hobbit, The Lord of The Rings 
and Fast & Furious into popular games. It’s another RPG that plugs the gap 
between episodes VI and VII of Star Wars, as you create a character and set out 
to make your fortune with a mix of solo and online co-operative play.

Star Wars Scene Maker (Free + IAP)
iOS <https://appsto.re/gb/1_a3Y.i>
This is a marvellous creative app for young Star Wars fans, helping them to 
create scenes from the film franchise with their favourite characters and music 
– and to supply the voice dialogue themselves. Yes, the famous credits are 
included too. It’s like a virtual puppet theatre, with a range of themed 
scenery packs available to buy as in-app purchases.

Star Wars: Commander - Worlds in Conflict (Free + IAP)
Android 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lucasarts.starts_goo> / iOS 
<https://appsto.re/gb/qYZIY.i> / Windows Phone 
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/games/star-wars-commander/9wzdncrdcvdw>
The game that generated a thousand Clash of Clones jokes when it was released, 
based on its similarity to mobile hit Clash of Clans. It’s true that its blend 
of base-building and raiding is very reminiscent of that game, but with plenty 
of iconic characters and vehicles to root this firmly in Star Wars territory.

Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Free + IAP)
Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.lego.tcs> / iOS 
<https://appsto.re/gb/Q14wR.i>
The Lego Star Wars games are as polished as the television series, and offer 
another playable way in to the franchise for children. This brings together all 
the mobile Lego Star Wars games, with the constituent parts bought using in-app 
purchases. It’s a sprawling game with masses of characters and missions to 
explore.

Angry Birds Star Wars II (Free + IAP)
Android 
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.angrybirdsstarwarsii.ads>
 /iOS <https://appsto.re/gb/INWFM.i> / Windows Phone 
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/angry-birds/9wzdncrfj50w>
Angry Birds’ star may have waned a little over the last two years, but it’s 
worth remembering the excellent job that developer Rovio did with both of its 
official Star Wars tie-ins. Start with the second, which applies the familiar 
bird-slinging formula to the Star Wars universe, with lots of little touches 
that fans will love.
 Angry Birds Star Wars II. 
Star Wars Journeys: Beginnings (Free + IAP)
iOS <https://appsto.re/gb/ul0x0.i>
Another app that’s intended for children, even if adults will want to sneak 
the odd go too. It’s a mixture of gameplay and storytelling, taking kids 
through the prequel trilogy of Star Wars with pod racing, arena battles and – 
something that parents will appreciate – a fair amount of reading.

BB-8 App Enabled Droid Powered by Sphero (Free)
Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Sphero> / iOS 
<https://appsto.re/gb/nI_J9.i>
The massive caveat here is that you’ll need to spend £135 on Sphero’s BB-8 
drone toy to use this app, so it’s one for fans with deep pockets only. Even 
so, the robot toy has been winning rave reviews, based on the new droid 
character in The Force Awakens. The app controls the toy’s movements, as well 
as turning your video clips into virtual holograms.

Star Wars: Card Trader (Free + IAP)
Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topps.force> / iOS 
<https://appsto.re/gb/u0QB4.i>
Finally, the idea of an app to collect digital (ie not real) trading cards may 
seem bizarre. But Topps’ Card Trader app has been warmly welcomed by app store 
reviewers for its collection of Star Wars cards right back to the original sets 
in the early 1980s. It’s part trading game and part historical rabbit hole.
 Star Wars: Card Trader. 
That’s my selection of 10, although several apps were unlucky to miss out. If 
you’re a fan of the card-battler game genre, check out Konami’sStar Wars: Force 
Collection <http://www.starwars.com/games-apps/star-wars-force-collection>, 
while tower defence fans (if not sticklers for English spelling) will prefer 
DeNA’sStar Wars: Galactic Defense 
<http://www.starwars.com/games-apps/star-wars-galactic-defense>.

Children may enjoy the puzzle-focused Star Wars: Heroes Path 
<http://www.starwars.com/games-apps/star-wars-heroes-path> or slick action game 
Star Wars Rebels: Recon Missions 
<http://www.starwars.com/games-apps/star-wars-rebels-recon-missions>, based on 
the Rebels TV show. And, for a curveball, tryStar Wars Pinball: Balance of the 
Force 
<http://www.starwars.com/games-apps/star-wars-pinball-balance-of-the-force>, 
which is very playable.
