Spare a thought this morning for Lakshmi Mittal, down to his last £10.8bn and 
the biggest loser in this year's annual survey of the richest people in the 
country, compiled by a Sunday newspaper.

Mittal may draw consolation that, although his fortune has diminished by an 
estimated £16.9bn - 61% from last year's £27bn - the steel tycoon still ranks 
as Britain's wealthiest resident.

He may not even notice the drop, based as it is on the falling value of his 
family company on the stockmarket due to the projected fall in demand for steel.

The Rich List, compiled for the last 21 years for the Sunday Times, estimates 
that the wealth of the 1,000 richest people in the country has fallen from more 
than £400bn last year to "a mere" £258bn.

Many of those at the top of the list have apparently registered double-digit 
percentage declines in their wealth, with Chelsea's Russian boss, Roman 
Abramovich, number two after Mittal, mislaying £4.7bn. The wealthiest Briton on 
the list, the Duke of Westminster at three, whose £6.5bn wealth is largely 
based in property, has lost less than others: a mere £500m.

Not everyone has seen their fortune slide: those catering for niche markets 
for the wealthy, such as Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed, and for the most 
cost-conscious, such as Sir Ken Morrison of the supermarket chain, have both 
seen their fortunes rise, as have Peter and Denise Coates, who own an online 
sports betting website, Bet365, whose estimated wealth has increased by a third 
to £400m.

Philip Beresford, the freelance journalist who compiles the list each year, 
said: "Losing a few zeros off your theoretical fortune is nothing to being 
turfed out of your home or your job."
