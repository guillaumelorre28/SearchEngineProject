Politics this afternoon

 * Today, with the Coalition back in government, senior frontbencher 
Christopher Pyne had a message for chest-beating recalcitrants on his side of 
the house. He described the complaints of unnamed sources as ‚Äúcowardly‚Äù. Put up 
or shut up.

 * Malcolm Turnbull wrote to the governor general to inform him that he could 
indeed form a government. I‚Äôll get back to you with the details of the swearing 
in, Pete. Cosgrove, meanwhile, jetted out to France to celebrate Bastille Day 
with the French.

 * The National party is meeting on the morrow for a party room debate before 
negotiations between Barnaby Joyce and Malcolm Turnbull to nut out the 
Coalition agreement. The Nats are maintaining the deal should be secret. This 
would be strange indeed, given it would be hard for the Nats to argue any 
achievements to their voters.

 * But the Nats do seem confident of getting another spot in Cabinet, with the 
maintenance of or slight rise in their numbers ‚Äì compared with the decimation 
in the Liberal ranks.

 * Bill Shorten thinks the Liberal National Coalition agreement should be made 
public. But I‚Äôm not sure they will listen to him.

 * Shorten also wants an independent review into the government‚Äôs 
superannuation changes, particularly retrospectivity. This would aid the 
parliament to decide what to do about the changes. He says Labor will support 
budget measures which are fair.

That is it on this Monday and barring any large developments, that is it for 
the blog until parliament sits again. Thanks for your company.

Gareth Parker at the West Australian is reporting 
<https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/32030505/fresh-cowan-count-finds-misplaced-greens-votes/>
:

About 200 votes cast in Cowan for the Greens were found in a pile counted as 
being cast for Liberal candidateLuke Simpkins, scrutineer sources have told 
thewest.com.au.

The votes were cast at the Tapping booth, which had reported an abnormally low 
Greens vote of 1.4% compared to 8% at the last election.

The error was discovered as part of a fresh count of votes this morning.

The AEC has Labor candidate Anne Aly 
<http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionPage-20499-237.htm> ahead as of 3pm (AEST) 
by 786 votes.

As noted around the traps here 
<http://www.afr.com/news/politics/election-2016-both-sides-planning-frontbench-reshuffles-20160710-gq2h14>
,here 
<http://www.news.com.au/national/federal-election/malcolm-turnbull-back-to-work-as-prime-minister-with-tumultuous-term-ahead/news-story/bb110da28cabdd65599586e82ed89b85>
 andhere 
<https://theconversation.com/turnbull-should-not-be-spooked-by-liberal-conservatives-62275>
,Malcolm Turnbull‚Äôs narrow election victory has increased the mouths to feed 
when it comes to ministry positions. There are conservatives to soothe, 
Nationals to muster and the competing interests of state and territory 
representation.

All of this is speculation of course, so it is difficult to work out who is 
pushing whose barrow.

But one of the more regular unsourced stories doing the rounds is the 
potential replacement of health ministerSussan Ley. It has been included in 
just about every ‚Äúcabinet reshuffle‚Äù story since the election. It started with 
the prime minister‚Äôs Medicare mea culpa which suggested theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> had ‚Äúfertile ground‚Äù 
in which to plant seeds of doubt regarding the Coalition‚Äôs commitment to 
Medicare.

It would appear this has been taken by some in the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> to mean Ley has been 
doing a bad job. The argument goes that she has not had enough influence to get 
the government on a strong health footing, or, that she has failed to sell the 
policy.

Just a short stroll down memory lane would tell us otherwise. Things went 
downhill for the Coalition on health from the eve of the 2013 election withTony 
Abbott‚Äôs promise of no cuts to health. Cutting across that promise, the 
Commission of Audit recommended a co-payment, Abbott‚Äôs first health minister
Peter Dutton prosecuted the case 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/peter-dutton-crossbenchers-doctors-come-round-7-fee>
 and then it was dropped like a stink bomb in the 2014 budget. After a lot of 
table slamming by Dutton and the Australian Medical Association among others, 
Ley was brought in to calm the waters. Once the co-payment was dumped, she got 
stakeholders together, implemented aMedicare benefit schedule review 
<http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/mbsreviewtaskforce>
 and instituted things such as trials for health care homes.

But it was the extension of the rebate freeze again, first implemented by 
Labor and extended by the Coalition, that really got doctors offside.Ley 
recently said 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/election-2016-health-minister-sussan-ley-not-allowed-to-lift-medicare-freeze-20160523-gp1goh.html>
 while she wanted to lift the freeze, the departments of finance and treasury 
would not allow it. Then came the devastating election ads from the Royal 
College of General Practitioners. Ultimately the rebate freeze, combined with 
the earlier co-payment provided the ‚Äúfertile ground‚Äù for Labor‚Äôs Medicare 
campaign. Ley reportedly wanted to prosecute the government case on health but 
was restrained by Liberal strategists. A day talking health was not considered 
a good day for the Liberals.

If her colleagues are now blaming Ley, it is both confusing and unfair IMO. If 
her crime is that she has not sold the policy well, the election result would 
suggest the policy itself is not trusted. If her crime is that she is not 
aggressive enough to win an arm wrestle with finance and treasury, then that 
must fall on the expenditure review committee and government‚Äôs overall budget 
strategy.

Malcolm Turnbull informs governor-general he can form a government

The office of the governor-general informs me that the GG will be back on 
Saturday from the visit to France and is available any time after that for a 
swearing-in ceremony for the newCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> ministry. The office has 
also just posted the correspondence betweenMalcolm Turnbull and Sir Peter 
Cosgrove on the matter. It includes the first letters on the Sunday after the 
election, advising Cosgrove that the result was unclear.

Turnbull wrote today to tell the governor-general that he was in a position to 
form a government. He told the GG that the Coalition had won at least 74 seats, 
and was ahead in two others with three more very close. Turnbull told Cosgrove 
that bothBob Katter and Cathy McGowan have given the Coalition their support on 
confidence and supply. Furthermore thatAndrew Wilkie had committed not to block 
confidence and supply unless ‚Äúclearly warranted‚Äù.

You can read the full letters here

Peter Cosgrove is off to France

A statement from the PM: 

The governor general, his excellency general the honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove 
AK MC (Retd), at my request will depart today to represent Australia in France 
on Bastille Day, 14 July.

Australia and France have a strong and enduring relationship which is anchored 
in history, common interests and shared values.

A hundred years ago Australian and French soldiers were fighting side by side 
to defend the liberty of France.

Today we have unprecedented opportunities to expand and deepen our 
relationship.

Australia and New Zealand will be nations of honour this year in France‚Äôs 
annual National Day celebrations.

We are honoured to join with our New Zealand friends and celebrate with France 
on this important day.

I have yet to receive a call from the governor-general‚Äôs office regarding the 
timing as it was my memory that the GG had already left. This was the reason 
for the GG not being able to complete the swearing in ceremony.

What is truth in political advertising? I don't want to sound like a 
postmodernist but...

So back to Graeme Orr, professor of electoral law at the University of 
Queensland.

At issue here is political advertising. Not only has the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> cried foul, the 
independents and minor parties, includingCathy McGowan and Nick Xenophon, have 
made mention of the campaigns against them.

This is the commonwealth electoral act - section 329 
<http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cea1918233/s329.html>:

(1) A person shall not, during the relevant period in relation to an election 
under this Act, print, publish or distribute, or cause, permit or authorise to 
be printed, published or distributed, any matter or thing that is likely to 
mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote.

Orr said the courts have generally interpreted this section to mean more 
direct deceptions such as wrong how-to-vote cards.

But independents have been wondering aloud how it is that corporations law 
stops you making dodgy claims to consumers over products or services, while not 
protecting voters from dodgy political claims.

Orr said it did make sense to think about how similar rules could cover 
political speech.

What is truth in politics? I don‚Äôt want to sound like a post modernist... 
which doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt scope for assessing political content.

Orr said politicians must also think about who would review potential laws and 
who would police them. He said the Australian Electoral Commission has not been 
keen to venture into this territory in the past.

Lastly, Bill Shorten may make changes to his shadow cabinet. 

I‚Äôll consult with my colleagues in coming weeks. I am pleased with the shadow 
ministry. We‚Äôve got lots of new talented people. I have a good problem, a happy 
problem. I‚Äôve got a lot of talent, we‚Äôre going to put in the best possible 
line-up.

Labor calls for an independent expert review of superannuation changes

Drilled further on budget measures, Bill Shorten again says the superannuation 
changes must not be retrospective 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-26/fact-check--government-super-changes/7422540>
.

And he calls for an independent review into the changes:

I think it‚Äôs probably appropriate to get an independent expert review to 
examine whether or not the changes are retrospective because clearly if this 
review says some of the changes are retrospective, Mr Turnbull says he doesn‚Äôt 
support retrospective changes. We can allay concerns of hundreds of thousands 
of superannuants and we‚Äôre not seeing capricious changes undermining the 
integrity of the system.

There‚Äôs been scandalous behaviour in NSW and the welfare of those animals is

Asked if he is committed to bipartisan budget reform, Bill Shorten says:

Labor‚Äôs very committed to doing budget repair that‚Äôs fair and I want to make 
the 45th parliament work. We‚Äôre heartened by the support we got but also 
recognise that Mr Turnbull‚Äôs got the ability and privilege of forming a

Which sounds like a bob each way.

Bill Shorten: Australians can smell insincerity a mile away

Bill Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> says 
Labor will attempt to bring on a conscience vote on marriage equality as Labor 
does not support a plebiscite. (Labor has yet to reveal whether it will vote 
plebiscite legislation down in the Senate.)

I think Mr Turnbull needs to pick up one of the lessons from this election. It 
is a lesson for all of us in politics, the more you stick to your own 
conscience and what you believe, the better this country will run. Australians 
can smell inauthenticity, insincerity and political games a mile away.I think 
Mr Turnbull would do himself a big favour if he stuck to his own views before 
he became Liberal leader.

Shorten mentions to previous Coalition deal, which included the plebiscite, no 
change on climate change policy (away from the emissions reduction fund) and 
the $1.2bn baby bonus scheme which were both at the behest of theNational party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party>.

 The Australian people have the right to know what‚Äôs going on. The prime 
minister and deputy prime minister are not getting off to the best first step 
if their first action is to have a secret deal. How can Australians be expected 
to trust the Turnbull government if the Turnbull government‚Äôs first action is 
to strike a secret arrangement?

Shorten: Coalition deal must be made public

Bill Shorten is speaking at a press conference. Shorten does not want to see 
any ‚Äúsecret deals‚Äù - he is speaking about the deal between theNational party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party> and the Liberal 
party.

It is a precondition for Mr Turnbull forming a government that he concludes a 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> agreement with 
the National party, that the National party ticks off on Mr Turnbull‚Äôs 
government, but it is important these arrangements are not secret.

Australians are entitled to know what deals are being done to constitute the 
government of Australia. Not only should there not be a secret agreement, there 
shouldn‚Äôt be secret deals full stop. Australians are being asked to cooperate 
with this government buthow can you get the cooperation of the parliament and 
Australian people if they‚Äôre not even told what the deals are all about.

Apologies for my absence. I was just talking to Graeme Orr, professor of 
electoral law at the University of Queensland. Given Michael Kroger‚Äôs claim 
over the Labor Medicare campaign, I was interested in finding out what the 
situation is at present. While corporations law says companies cannot mislead 
or deceive consumers buying widgets even unintentionally, the courts have 
previously ruled this does not apply to political speech.

Our election analyst Ben Raue has written a defence of paper voting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/11/why-the-rush-in-defence-of-australias-slow-election-count>
. He has argued the old-fashioned system is much more transparent and worth the 
wait.

There may come a time where electronic voting becomes viable. We should start 
with a small trial, focusing on a small number of big-city pre-poll booths 
where voters could have a choice of voting by paper or on a computer. We would 
need to be very confident in the security, convenience, practicality and 
transparency before expanding this trial to a significant part of the 
Australian electorate.


In the meantime, Australians should be confident that our elections are 
conducted professionally, and that the time is taken to be sure that the result 
is right. If that means that we sometimes don‚Äôt know who has won a close 
election for a few days, it‚Äôs well worth the wait.

 * Today, with the Coalition back in government, senior frontbencher 
Christopher Pyne had a message for chest-beating recalcitrants on his side of 
the house. He described the complaints of unnamed sources as ‚Äúcowardly‚Äù. Put up 
or shut up.

 * Malcolm Turnbull wrote to the governor general to inform him that he could 
indeed form a government. I‚Äôll get back to you with the details of the swearing 
in, Pete. Cosgrove, meanwhile, jetted out to France to celebrate Bastille Day 
with the French.

 * The National party is meeting on the morrow for a party room debate before 
negotiations between Barnaby Joyce and Malcolm Turnbull to nut out the 
Coalition agreement. The Nats are maintaining the deal should be secret. This 
would be strange indeed, given it would be hard for the Nats to argue any 
achievements to their voters.

 * But the Nats do seem confident of getting another spot in Cabinet, with the 
maintenance of or slight rise in their numbers ‚Äì compared with the decimation 
in the Liberal ranks.

 * Bill Shorten thinks the Liberal National Coalition agreement should be made 
public. But I‚Äôm not sure they will listen to him.

 * Shorten also wants an independent review into the government‚Äôs 
superannuation changes, particularly retrospectivity. This would aid the 
parliament to decide what to do about the changes. He says Labor will support 
budget measures which are fair.

That is it on this Monday and barring any large developments, that is it for 
the blog until parliament sits again. Thanks for your company.

Good arvo to you.
 
Gareth Parker at the West Australian is reporting 
<https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/32030505/fresh-cowan-count-finds-misplaced-greens-votes/>
:

About 200 votes cast in Cowan for the Greens were found in a pile counted as 
being cast for Liberal candidateLuke Simpkins, scrutineer sources have told 
thewest.com.au.

The votes were cast at the Tapping booth, which had reported an abnormally low 
Greens vote of 1.4% compared to 8% at the last election.

The error was discovered as part of a fresh count of votes this morning.

The AEC has Labor candidate Anne Aly 
<http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionPage-20499-237.htm> ahead as of 3pm (AEST) 
by 786 votes.
 
As noted around the traps here 
<http://www.afr.com/news/politics/election-2016-both-sides-planning-frontbench-reshuffles-20160710-gq2h14>
,here 
<http://www.news.com.au/national/federal-election/malcolm-turnbull-back-to-work-as-prime-minister-with-tumultuous-term-ahead/news-story/bb110da28cabdd65599586e82ed89b85>
 andhere 
<https://theconversation.com/turnbull-should-not-be-spooked-by-liberal-conservatives-62275>
,Malcolm Turnbull‚Äôs narrow election victory has increased the mouths to feed 
when it comes to ministry positions. There are conservatives to soothe, 
Nationals to muster and the competing interests of state and territory 
representation.

All of this is speculation of course, so it is difficult to work out who is 
pushing whose barrow.

But one of the more regular unsourced stories doing the rounds is the 
potential replacement of health ministerSussan Ley. It has been included in 
just about every ‚Äúcabinet reshuffle‚Äù story since the election. It started with 
the prime minister‚Äôs Medicare mea culpa which suggested theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> had ‚Äúfertile ground‚Äù 
in which to plant seeds of doubt regarding the Coalition‚Äôs commitment to 
Medicare.

It would appear this has been taken by some in the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> to mean Ley has been 
doing a bad job. The argument goes that she has not had enough influence to get 
the government on a strong health footing, or, that she has failed to sell the 
policy.

Just a short stroll down memory lane would tell us otherwise. Things went 
downhill for the Coalition on health from the eve of the 2013 election withTony 
Abbott‚Äôs promise of no cuts to health. Cutting across that promise, the 
Commission of Audit recommended a co-payment, Abbott‚Äôs first health minister
Peter Dutton prosecuted the case 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/peter-dutton-crossbenchers-doctors-come-round-7-fee>
 and then it was dropped like a stink bomb in the 2014 budget. After a lot of 
table slamming by Dutton and the Australian Medical Association among others, 
Ley was brought in to calm the waters. Once the co-payment was dumped, she got 
stakeholders together, implemented aMedicare benefit schedule review 
<http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/mbsreviewtaskforce>
 and instituted things such as trials for health care homes.

But it was the extension of the rebate freeze again, first implemented by 
Labor and extended by the Coalition, that really got doctors offside.Ley 
recently said 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/election-2016-health-minister-sussan-ley-not-allowed-to-lift-medicare-freeze-20160523-gp1goh.html>
 while she wanted to lift the freeze, the departments of finance and treasury 
would not allow it. Then came the devastating election ads from the Royal 
College of General Practitioners. Ultimately the rebate freeze, combined with 
the earlier co-payment provided the ‚Äúfertile ground‚Äù for Labor‚Äôs Medicare 
campaign. Ley reportedly wanted to prosecute the government case on health but 
was restrained by Liberal strategists. A day talking health was not considered 
a good day for the Liberals.

If her colleagues are now blaming Ley, it is both confusing and unfair IMO. If 
her crime is that she has not sold the policy well, the election result would 
suggest the policy itself is not trusted. If her crime is that she is not 
aggressive enough to win an arm wrestle with finance and treasury, then that 
must fall on the expenditure review committee and government‚Äôs overall budget 
strategy.
 
The office of the governor-general informs me that the GG will be back on 
Saturday from the visit to France and is available any time after that for a 
swearing-in ceremony for the newCoalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> ministry. The office has 
also just posted the correspondence betweenMalcolm Turnbull and Sir Peter 
Cosgrove on the matter. It includes the first letters on the Sunday after the 
election, advising Cosgrove that the result was unclear.

Turnbull wrote today to tell the governor-general that he was in a position to 
form a government. He told the GG that the Coalition had won at least 74 seats, 
and was ahead in two others with three more very close. Turnbull told Cosgrove 
that bothBob Katter and Cathy McGowan have given the Coalition their support on 
confidence and supply. Furthermore thatAndrew Wilkie had committed not to block 
confidence and supply unless ‚Äúclearly warranted‚Äù.

You can read the full letters here 
<https://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/gg/2016/Election%20Letters%20PM%20GG.pdf>
.
 
A statement from the PM: 

The governor general, his excellency general the honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove 
AK MC (Retd), at my request will depart today to represent Australia in France 
on Bastille Day, 14 July.

Australia and France have a strong and enduring relationship which is anchored 
in history, common interests and shared values.

A hundred years ago Australian and French soldiers were fighting side by side 
to defend the liberty of France.

Today we have unprecedented opportunities to expand and deepen our 
relationship.

Australia and New Zealand will be nations of honour this year in France‚Äôs 
annual National Day celebrations.

We are honoured to join with our New Zealand friends and celebrate with France 
on this important day.

I have yet to receive a call from the governor-general‚Äôs office regarding the 
timing as it was my memory that the GG had already left. This was the reason 
for the GG not being able to complete the swearing in ceremony.
 
Is David Feeney going to retain his position in the shadow cabinet?

He is not in the shadow cabinet now. Final question.
 
So back to Graeme Orr, professor of electoral law at the University of 
Queensland.

At issue here is political advertising. Not only has the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> cried foul, the 
independents and minor parties, includingCathy McGowan and Nick Xenophon, have 
made mention of the campaigns against them.

This is the commonwealth electoral act - section 329 
<http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cea1918233/s329.html>:

(1) A person shall not, during the relevant period in relation to an election 
under this Act, print, publish or distribute, or cause, permit or authorise to 
be printed, published or distributed, any matter or thing that is likely to 
mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote.

Orr said the courts have generally interpreted this section to mean more 
direct deceptions such as wrong how-to-vote cards.

But independents have been wondering aloud how it is that corporations law 
stops you making dodgy claims to consumers over products or services, while not 
protecting voters from dodgy political claims.

Orr said it did make sense to think about how similar rules could cover 
political speech.

What is truth in politics? I don‚Äôt want to sound like a post modernist... 
which doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt scope for assessing political content.

Orr said politicians must also think about who would review potential laws and 
who would police them. He said the Australian Electoral Commission has not been 
keen to venture into this territory in the past.
 
Lastly, Bill Shorten may make changes to his shadow cabinet. 

I‚Äôll consult with my colleagues in coming weeks. I am pleased with the shadow 
ministry. We‚Äôve got lots of new talented people. I have a good problem, a happy 
problem. I‚Äôve got a lot of talent, we‚Äôre going to put in the best possible 
line-up.
 
Drilled further on budget measures, Bill Shorten again says the superannuation 
changes must not be retrospective 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-26/fact-check--government-super-changes/7422540>
.

And he calls for an independent review into the changes:

I think it‚Äôs probably appropriate to get an independent expert review to 
examine whether or not the changes are retrospective because clearly if this 
review says some of the changes are retrospective, Mr Turnbull says he doesn‚Äôt 
support retrospective changes. We can allay concerns of hundreds of thousands 
of superannuants and we‚Äôre not seeing capricious changes undermining the 
integrity of the system.
 
Bill Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> briefly 
strays into the NSW government‚Äôs turf on the greyhound racing ban. He says ‚Äúwe 
want to make sure the animals‚Äô welfare is upper most but don‚Äôt destroy people‚Äôs 
livelihoods along the way‚Äù.

There‚Äôs been scandalous behaviour in NSW and the welfare of those animals is 
most important but whether or not it‚Äôs taking a sledgeshammer to this issue, I 
don‚Äôt know. There‚Äôs people who have done the right thing and they‚Äôre being 
unfairly tarred with the same brush as the scallywags, scoundrels and criminals.
 
Asked if he is committed to bipartisan budget reform, Bill Shorten says:

Labor‚Äôs very committed to doing budget repair that‚Äôs fair and I want to make 
the 45th parliament work. We‚Äôre heartened by the support we got but also 
recognise that Mr Turnbull‚Äôs got the ability and privilege of forming a 
government.

Which sounds like a bob each way. 
 
Bill Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> says 
Labor will attempt to bring on a conscience vote on marriage equality as Labor 
does not support a plebiscite. (Labor has yet to reveal whether it will vote 
plebiscite legislation down in the Senate.)

I think Mr Turnbull needs to pick up one of the lessons from this election. It 
is a lesson for all of us in politics, the more you stick to your own 
conscience and what you believe, the better this country will run. Australians 
can smell inauthenticity, insincerity and political games a mile away.I think 
Mr Turnbull would do himself a big favour if he stuck to his own views before 
he became Liberal leader.
 
Shorten mentions to previous Coalition deal, which included the plebiscite, no 
change on climate change policy (away from the emissions reduction fund) and 
the $1.2bn baby bonus scheme which were both at the behest of theNational party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party>.

 The Australian people have the right to know what‚Äôs going on. The prime 
minister and deputy prime minister are not getting off to the best first step 
if their first action is to have a secret deal. How can Australians be expected 
to trust the Turnbull government if the Turnbull government‚Äôs first action is 
to strike a secret arrangement?
 
Bill Shorten is speaking at a press conference. Shorten does not want to see 
any ‚Äúsecret deals‚Äù - he is speaking about the deal between theNational party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party> and the Liberal 
party.

It is a precondition for Mr Turnbull forming a government that he concludes a 
Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> agreement with 
the National party, that the National party ticks off on Mr Turnbull‚Äôs 
government, but it is important these arrangements are not secret.

Australians are entitled to know what deals are being done to constitute the 
government of Australia. Not only should there not be a secret agreement, there 
shouldn‚Äôt be secret deals full stop. Australians are being asked to cooperate 
with this government buthow can you get the cooperation of the parliament and 
Australian people if they‚Äôre not even told what the deals are all about.
 
Apologies for my absence. I was just talking to Graeme Orr, professor of 
electoral law at the University of Queensland. Given Michael Kroger‚Äôs claim 
over the Labor Medicare campaign, I was interested in finding out what the 
situation is at present. While corporations law says companies cannot mislead 
or deceive consumers buying widgets even unintentionally, the courts have 
previously ruled this does not apply to political speech.
 
Our election analyst Ben Raue has written a defence of paper voting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/11/why-the-rush-in-defence-of-australias-slow-election-count>
. He has argued the old-fashioned system is much more transparent and worth the 
wait.

There may come a time where electronic voting becomes viable. We should start 
with a small trial, focusing on a small number of big-city pre-poll booths 
where voters could have a choice of voting by paper or on a computer. We would 
need to be very confident in the security, convenience, practicality and 
transparency before expanding this trial to a significant part of the 
Australian electorate.


In the meantime, Australians should be confident that our elections are 
conducted professionally, and that the time is taken to be sure that the result 
is right. If that means that we sometimes don‚Äôt know who has won a close 
election for a few days, it‚Äôs well worth the wait.
 
Infrastructure and transport minister Darren Chester has recommended senator 
Bridget McKenzie for a promotion, given the Nats are likely to get an extra 
frontbench position.

Both are Victorians. 

Meanwhile, as noted earlier, Malcolm Turnbull has been meeting with the head 
of the department of prime minister and cabinet,Martin Parkinson.
