The advert asked for "four insane guys aged 17-21". The Monkees' music was 
supposed to be besides the point – Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork, Mike Nesmith and 
Davy Jones were hired for their acting ability rather than their musicianship 
and didn't play on their early releases. Not that this mattered: at first 
because their producers hired great songwriters, later because the band turned 
out to be more talented than anyone expected.

They certainly weren't the first manufactured pop act, but they inadvertently 
wrote the manufactured pop act script and played it out in public – the initial 
rush of fame, the accusations of flimsiness, the struggle for creative control 
and credibility in their own right. And the coda: that ultimately if the 
records are good, no one will really care who did or didn't create them.
