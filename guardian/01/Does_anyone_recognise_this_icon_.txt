This icon recently appeared in the taskbar of my laptop running Windows 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows> XP. It does not respond to 
either a left or right mouse click. What is it for and is it a problem? Can I 
get rid of it? Brian Gay

I've blown the icon up a bit. Does anyone recognise it?
