Across the UK, (extra)ordinary gardeners are working away in gardens and 
greenhouses, balconies and allotments, meadows and schoolyards.


We want to hear from all of you: what does gardening mean to you? Tell us the 
story of your growing space, describe your passion for gardening and reveal 
your favourite spot.


You can submit by clicking on the blue 'Contribute' button or if you're on the 
new Guardian app, then just search for GuardianWitness assignments.


We'll select some of the contributions to be published in the gardens pages of 
Weekend magazine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-does-your-garden-grow>; 
others we'll feature in a gallery online.

 * GuardianWitness <https://witness.theguardian.com/> is the home of 
user-generated content on the Guardian. Contribute your video, pictures and 
stories, and browse news, reviews and creations submitted by others. Posts will 
be reviewed prior to publication on GuardianWitness, and the best pieces will 
feature on the Guardian site.
