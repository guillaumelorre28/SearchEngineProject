Debrah Matei Mwololo was not at home when armed policemen accompanied a fleet 
of bulldozers at 2am in October 2011 and flattened the house she had come to 
love.


Her father, Joseph, had heard reports that the authorities planned to evict 
the 80,000 residents 
<https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/24000/afr320072011en.pdf> (pdf) who 
they said had encroached on airport land in the Kyang’ombe settlement, a 
20-minute drive away from Nairobi city centre.

Unlike many residents who were caught up in the raid, Joseph decided to move 
his family to his ancestral village in a neighbouring county beforethe 
bulldozers arrived 
<https://muunganosupporttrust.wordpress.com/2011/10/24/thousands-left-homeless-after-kyang%E2%80%99ombe-demolition/>
.

Debrah is not unused to change. In 2008, the family relocated to Kyang’ombe 
after Kibera, the area where they had lived up until then, became the setting 
for some of the worst violence seen inKenya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya>.

The unrest occurred following a disputed presidential election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2008/jan/02/kenya> that spawned 
weeks of killings. Although their house was not attacked, Debrah’s parents 
decided they needed to bring her up in a safer environment.

Moving to the village of Mitaaboni in Machakos County meant Debrah would see 
her grandmother more often.

But the public school she was enrolled in was not to her liking. Teachers were 
perennially absent, a phenomenon the bright-eyed, confident 10-year-old 
accounts for, with fetching innocence, by saying “they would stay in [their] 
meetings for too long”.

Teacher absenteeism is a recurring issue in Kenyan schools. In 2014, a study 
<http://smartkenya.co.uk/teacher-absenteeism-undermining-learning-survey/> in 
two counties found that teachers skipped up to a quarter of their classes.

In a country with few natural resources, education is seen as the most 
important ticket to a better future for many families. Even parents earning 
modest amounts of money make huge sacrifices to send their children to private 
schools, which are often better managed than public schools. So the issue of 
teachers failing to report for work is a major one.

Debrah’s mum, Christine, said they noticed their daughter’s spoken English was 
no longer as good as it was and decided to bring her back to Nairobi.

The new home she shares with her sister, Dorcas, six, and young brother Caleb, 
two, is in the Mukuru Kwa Njenga settlement, not far from their old home in 
Kyang’ombe.

The main road to the house is unpaved and ringed by rows of stores that serve 
the slum economy, with pedlars selling pan-fried groundnuts and women cooking 
sun-dried sardines, a popular dish among local construction workers.

Conditions are basic. Although Kenya is the wealthiest country by GDP terms in 
east Africa, and isnow rated by the World Bank as a lower-middle income economy 
<http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/World-Bank-confirms-Kenya-lower-middle-income-status/-/539546/2773210/-/u39btjz/-/index.html>
, inequality levels are strikingly high.

Kenya’s low-income urban settlements are among the world’s roughest. A 
UN-Habitat report 
<http://cn.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=668&catid=206&typeid=13&subMenuId=0> 
noted that these settlements, which are home to half of the Kenyan capital’s 
population but occupy only about 5% of the city’s land mass, are “some of the 
most dense, unsanitary and insecure slums in the world”.

A river of black, raw sewage flows outside the two-floor row of iron sheet 
houses in which the Mwololo family lives.


But Debrah likes their tidy, one-room house. The electricity connection means 
that she can do her homework at night.

All the children sleep under a mosquito net . Each of them has suffered from 
malaria in the past two years and recovered after receiving medication at home.

An aggressive mosquito net distribution programme has helped Kenya to reduce 
infant mortality 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/kenya-bednets-malaria-prevention-climate-change>
 at a rate among the fastest in the world.

Apart from the malaria bout, Debrah has not had a serious health problem in 
recent years. What truly excites her about her new home, though, is the school 
she now attends, St James junior academy.

She loves it because the teachers never miss class. She has one particular 
favourite.

“I love teacher Cecilia because she teaches me maths and if there’s a part 
where I do not understand or remember, she reminds me and shows me what to do 
until I get it.”

She particularly enjoys the Christian religious education class and has made 
plenty of new friends. “My closest friend is Rena Kerubo, and I love her 
because she passes by my place every day and we go to school together, read and 
do everything that our teachers tell us,” she says.

When she is not at school, Debrah likes to play hide and seek or read her 
favourite story book, Grandmother Visits.

Debrah’s father, Joseph, continues to be a baker but he has found a new job at 
a company called Bake‘n’Bite, which is only a 15-minute walk from where he 
lives. Conditions are better than at the previous station, where he earned 
9,000 Kenyan shillings (£59) a month. He now makes about 17,000 shillings and 
works eight-hour shifts. His wife, Christine, would love to start a small 
business such as a hair salon, but doesn’t have the capital.

Debrah hopes one day to travel to see her aunt in Tanzania. And she is 
determined to achieve her dream of becoming a doctor, an ambition that might 
rest on how long her parents can afford to keep her in private schools.

“I want to be a doctor because I will be able to treat many sick people, and 
so that those who are very sick can get well,” she says.
