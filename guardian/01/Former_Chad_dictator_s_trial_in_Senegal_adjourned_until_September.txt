The trial in Senegal <https://www.theguardian.com/world/senegal> of Chad’s 
former dictator Hissène Habré has been adjourned until September so that 
court-appointed lawyers can prepare his defence against charges of crimes 
against humanity, war crimes and torture.

The Extraordinary African Chambers, a special international criminal tribunal 
set up in Senegal by the African Union,is trying the former leader of Chad 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/20/former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre-war-crimes-trial>
, in an unprecedented case of one African country holding the ruler of another 
responsible for crimes.

The presiding judge of the court, Gberdao Gustave Kam of Burkina Faso, said on 
Tuesday that there were no lawyers present for Habré, so the court appointed 
three Senegalese lawyers.

He adjourned proceedings until 7 September so they can draw up a defence, and 
noted they would have a duty to defend him even against his will.

The trial opened on Monday, a quarter of a century after Habré’s reign came to 
an end.

Habré had refused legal representation, saying he did not recognise the 
court’s jurisdiction, and vowed not to cooperate with the trial.

Following the adjournment, Habré rose and gave a clenched-fist salute and V 
for victory sign to his supporters, who shouted “Allahu Akbar”.

Habré – who was backed during his presidency by France and the US as a bulwark 
against Libya’sMuammar Gaddafi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/muammar-gaddafi> – is on trial over actions 
under his regime from 1982 until he was ousted in 1990.

Human rights <https://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights> groups say 40,000 
Chadians were killed under the regime.

The former president, 72, has been in custody in Dakar since his arrest in 
June 2013 at the home he shared in an affluent suburb of the Senegalese capital 
with his wife and children.
