Madonna's Prince tribute
 Prince Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP 
Madonna <https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna> starts with an intro of 
Let’s Go Crazy before she segues into Nothing Compares 2 U while sat on a 
purple throne (of course). She’s doing well, and the words HOPE and BROTHER 
splash up on the big screen and a full orchestra play in the background.

Pictures of Prince now roll through in a slide show. Now Stevie Wonder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/steviewonder> is here to perform a duet of 
Purple Rain, Rihanna does a dap in the front row as they rock back and forth. 
It feels like the Billboard Awards just went to church. Madonna ends by 
thanking Prince.

And … that’s a wrap. There were some questionable moments but the live 
performances from Celine Dion,Ariana Grande 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande>, Britney Spears, Justin 
Bieber and Madonna all delivered. Perhaps understandably, it was the lower 
order – dare I say, filler – performances which really fell flat.

"His departure was an earthquake"
 Prince Photograph: Chris O'Meara/AP 
Questlove from the Roots is paying tribute to Prince before Madonna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna> comes on. This is really moving and 
his voice is cracking: “Everytime we hear a really good guitar solo, we’re 
going to remember,” he says. Prince is in everything, he argues.

She’s done it again. It’s surprising they didn’t go for The Weeknd considering

Ariana Grande performs Dangerous Woman
 Ariana Grande Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images 
Cue pink smoke, a talkbox vocal effect and Ariana Grande 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande> not playing a synth. She 
moves away from the props and gets lined up for a dance routine. It’s a pretty 
staggering difference in sound compared to our opener Britney, who not so long 
ago was occupying a similar place to Grande. This is fairly sophisticated 
dance-pop with a subtle dance routine with Grande’s vocals placed front and 
centre. Best performance of the night so far, I reckon.

Celine Dion performs
 Celine Dion performs The Show Must Go On Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters 
She doing The Show Must Go on and the Bieber crowd don’t know what the hell is 
happening. Seal says it was “exquisite” and that there’s a surprise … Dion’s 
son is going to give her the award. Great for her, a bit boring for the rest of 
us. It’s all a bit too much for Dion, who looks genuinely overwhelmed. Her 
husband and managerRené Angélil died in January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/14/celine-dions-husband-and-manager-rene-angelil-dies-aged-72>
 and she specially thanks him in an emotional acceptance speech which gets a 
standing ovation.

He’s here to give the icon award to Celine Dion, which is less exciting than 
him actually performing. The voiceover for the montage section is like one of 
those senior cruise adverts. END THIS

Rihanna performs Love On The Brain
 Rihanna Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images 
She’s in a glass box, with cobwebs all over it. The whole stage is stripped 
back. There are no backing dancers or daft screens with emeralds on it, or a 
clock that she swings off, she’s just, you know, singing a song very well.

The performance easily gets one of the biggest reactions of the night from the 
crowd.

 The Weeknd Photograph: Rob Latour/REX/Shutterstock 
Zendaya and Wiz Khalifa come out to give The Weeknd his second gong of the 
night, which isn’t surprising considering he had three of the five songs in the 
category!

Kesha covers Bob Dylan
 Ben Folds and Kesha perform Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/BBMA2016/FilmMagic 
After a week of will she won’t she, Kesha 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/kesha> is here. Performing It Aint Me, Babe 
with Ben Folds. It’s a pretty unlikely combo and they’ve created an Adele-esque 
rendition, turning the track into a very sultry number.

It’s captivating stuff and the arena is respectfully silent as Kesha slowly 
ratchets up the volume. Very nice indeed.

The video is pretty staid, multiple shots of Adele singing and dismissively 
waving her hands as she sings Send My Love (To Your New Lover). Not really 
memorable in the age of Lemonade or even Hotline Bling.

Kate Beckinsale arrives to give the award. 

Adele’s video for Send My Love (To Your New Lover) is about to be beamed in 
and she accepts the award with a short video message which is chirpy and longer 
than all the other acceptance speeches combined

Soon there will an awards show every week and they never get boring, at all.

With a name like that it’s hard to know if this is ironic or not …

This is easily the worst section of the show so far. Maroon 5 impersonators 
DNCE are here to bore everyone with their balloon-laden performance. It was 
written by Joe Jonas and Nick Jonas is singing along gamely in the front row

Madonna <https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna> starts with an intro of 
Let’s Go Crazy before she segues into Nothing Compares 2 U while sat on a 
purple throne (of course). She’s doing well, and the words HOPE and BROTHER 
splash up on the big screen and a full orchestra play in the background.

Pictures of Prince now roll through in a slide show. Now Stevie Wonder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/steviewonder> is here to perform a duet of 
Purple Rain, Rihanna does a dap in the front row as they rock back and forth. 
It feels like the Billboard Awards just went to church. Madonna ends by 
thanking Prince.

And … that’s a wrap. There were some questionable moments but the live 
performances from Celine Dion,Ariana Grande 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande>, Britney Spears, Justin 
Bieber and Madonna all delivered. Perhaps understandably, it was the lower 
order – dare I say, filler – performances which really fell flat.

Questlove from the Roots is paying tribute to Prince before Madonna 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna> comes on. This is really moving and 
his voice is cracking: “Everytime we hear a really good guitar solo, we’re 
going to remember,” he says. Prince is in everything, he argues.

She’s done it again. It’s surprising they didn’t go for The Weeknd considering 
he actually turned up.

come to Las Vegas

Nah, I worked there as a croupier for 3 months and I think it may have 
permanently injured my soul. It's the most horrible place on earth.

Cue pink smoke, a talkbox vocal effect and Ariana Grande 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande> not playing a synth. She 
moves away from the props and gets lined up for a dance routine. It’s a pretty 
staggering difference in sound compared to our opener Britney, who not so long 
ago was occupying a similar place to Grande. This is fairly sophisticated 
dance-pop with a subtle dance routine with Grande’s vocals placed front and 
centre. Best performance of the night so far, I reckon.

Rihanna picks up this seemingly meaningless award, which has been doled out so 
that she doesn’t go home empty handed.

The Go-Gos are getting the Trainor treatment here as Grande steals their 
thunder. Kelly Rowland knows all the words as they sing The Beat.
 
The Australian starlet is doing his thing as part of a section sponsored by a 
car company. Here’s a profile of the South African born star:

She doing The Show Must Go on and the Bieber crowd don’t know what the hell is 
happening. Seal says it was “exquisite” and that there’s a surprise … Dion’s 
son is going to give her the award. Great for her, a bit boring for the rest of 
us. It’s all a bit too much for Dion, who looks genuinely overwhelmed. Her 
husband and managerRené Angélil died in January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/14/celine-dions-husband-and-manager-rene-angelil-dies-aged-72>
 and she specially thanks him in an emotional acceptance speech which gets a 
standing ovation.
 
He’s here to give the icon award to Celine Dion, which is less exciting than 
him actually performing. The voiceover for the montage section is like one of 
those senior cruise adverts. END THIS
 
Hang on, Seal is here …
  Rihanna Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images 
She’s in a glass box, with cobwebs all over it. The whole stage is stripped 
back. There are no backing dancers or daft screens with emeralds on it, or a 
clock that she swings off, she’s just, you know, singing a song very well.

The performance easily gets one of the biggest reactions of the night from the 
crowd.
 
Ok, Rihanna is here. Let’s see if she can save things.

Zendaya and Wiz Khalifa come out to give The Weeknd his second gong of the 
night, which isn’t surprising considering he had three of the five songs in the 
category!
  Ben Folds and Kesha perform Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/BBMA2016/FilmMagic 
After a week of will she won’t she, Kesha 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/kesha> is here. Performing It Aint Me, Babe 
with Ben Folds. It’s a pretty unlikely combo and they’ve created an Adele-esque 
rendition, turning the track into a very sultry number.

It’s captivating stuff and the arena is respectfully silent as Kesha slowly 
ratchets up the volume. Very nice indeed.
 
The video is pretty staid, multiple shots of Adele singing and dismissively 
waving her hands as she sings Send My Love (To Your New Lover). Not really 
memorable in the age of Lemonade or even Hotline Bling.

Kate Beckinsale arrives to give the award. 

Adele’s video for Send My Love (To Your New Lover) is about to be beamed in 
and she accepts the award with a short video message which is chirpy and longer 
than all the other acceptance speeches combined

Soon there will an awards show every week and they never get boring, at all.

With a name like that it’s hard to know if this is ironic or not …
  DNCE: missing more than a vowel Photograph: Shutterstuck/REX/Shutterstock 
This is easily the worst section of the show so far. Maroon 5 impersonators 
DNCE are here to bore everyone with their balloon-laden performance. It was 
written by Joe Jonas and Nick Jonas is singing along gamely in the front row 
#loyal.
