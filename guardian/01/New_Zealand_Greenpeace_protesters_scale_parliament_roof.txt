Four environmental protesters have breached security at New Zealand’s 
parliament by scaling the roof and perching themselves on a ledge above the 
main entrance.

The Greenpeace <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace> protesters 
on Thursday hauled up eight solar panels and unfurled a banner to protest what 
they say is the government’s lack of action in promoting renewal energy and 
dealing with climate change.

The protest began at dawn and continued throughout the morning. Police issued 
the four with trespass notices, but authorities say they plan to allow the 
protesters to come down on their own.

The breach will come as an embarrassment to the parliament’s security services.

David Stevenson, the general manager of Parliamentary Service, said in a 
statement he had ordered a full review of security procedures as a result of 
the breach.

“Trespassing in or on the buildings is totally inappropriate, regardless of 
the motivations of those involved,” he said. “We are therefore taking this 
incident very seriously and will be looking for any lessons we can draw from 
it.”

The forecourt in front of the main entrance is frequently used for sanctioned 
protests.

Speaking from a cellphone, protester Johno Smith told the Associated Press 
that the four were experienced climbers and that they planned to come down on 
Thursday afternoon “before it gets too cold.”

He said he hoped the protest would inspire people to act. “We need to take 
clean-energy action,” he said. “Our society is based around fossil fuels.”

About 77% of New Zealand’s electricity generation comes from renewable 
sources, including hydroelectric, geothermal and wind. The country’s vehicle 
fleet, on the other hand, primarily uses gasoline and diesel.

Bunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace New Zealand’s executive director, tweeted 
<https://twitter.com/bunmcd/status/613814014104113152>: “Security breach at 
parliament security breach of the planet? You choose.”

The climbers continued to publicise their protest from the roof, tweeting 
pictures of themselves and engaging in an “ask me anything” question-and-answer

.

One of the protesters, named only as Jeff, told Reddit users that police 
officers on the ground were a “friendly bunch”, adding: “No signs of them comin 
[sic] up which is good, much safer for us. Best if we come down ourselves.”
