 Alder Hey children's hospital, which became synonymous with the organ 
retention scandal, could be closed and moved to a new site, it emerged 
yesterday.
The move is part of a Â£1bn plan to transform healthcare in north Merseyside. 
Proposals include the demolition and replacement of Alder Hey and the Royal 
Liverpool hospital. Two other hospitals - Broadgreen and Aintree - will be 
refurbished.

Details of the proposals will be outlined by the North Merseyside Future 
Healthcare Project this week. Kate Abendstern, its acting director, said: 
"These proposals represent a very significant reinvestment in the development 
and delivery of more effective, patient-centred healthcare services for our 
communities in north Merseyside.

"We cannot afford to ignore the major health inequalities in the area."
