Adam Giles has accused Four Corners of deliberately delaying its report on the 
Don Dale abuses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/royal-commission-into-northern-territory-juvenile-detention>
 to cause maximum damage to his election campaign and give a “leg up” to the 
Labor opposition.

The Northern Territory chief minister made the comments to Sky News 
<http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2016/08/11/abc-deliberately-out-to-damage-govt--giles.html>
 on Thursday, claiming the story, which revealed graphic CCTV footage of the 
alleged abuse of young boys inside juvenile detention, gave the Labor 
opposition a “clear advantage”.

He said the ABC report 
<http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2016/07/25/4504895.htm> was 
“outrageous” and had “stirred up racism” in the NT, and he accused Labor of 
subsequently using race in the campaign.

“I think Four Corners should be ashamed of what they’ve done,” he said.

“For me to be talking about child protection policies in the lead-up to the 
territory election is just food for Labor to drive racism at the heart of 
territory politics, rather than put the interest of the child at the forefront.”

Giles said Four Corners had “certainly” attempted to “give Labor a leg up” 
with its program.

“And I think that’s unfortunate for a public broadcaster to do that, 
particularly one that’s taxpayer-funded,” he said.

 Recent polling conducted by the NT News 
<http://www.ntnews.com.au/news/northern-territory/labor-on-track-for-landslide-win-in-nt-election/news-story/2f05cc0cfb5a5b000b21dca80f64b3dc>
 found a 20 percentage point swing away from the CLP, giving Labor 64% in 
two-party-preferred terms, with the election barely two weeks away. Just 33% of 
respondents said the CLP deserved to be reelected on 27 August, the report said.

The executive producer of Four Corners, Sally Neighbour, said on Twitter the 
allegations were “false, outrageous and desperate”.

Opposition leader, Michael Gunner, said Giles was becoming “increasingly 
erratic and arrogant”.

“There is no conspiracy. You have to accept responsibility if you want to be 
part of the solution. The chief minister refuses to accept responsibility.”

He said voters had the choice of “the chaos of an incompetent and arrogant CLP 
or a stable Labor Party with positive plans”.

Asked why he had called for a royal commission within hours of the Four 
Corners program, Giles said he was responding to public reaction.

“Well certainly Four Corners sought to display images to try and portray 
images of acts of terror within the system in theNorthern Territory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory>, and strike 
fear into many different communities around Australia,” he said.

On the night of the broadcast Giles released a statement calling for a royal 
commission into the incidents, saying he was “shocked and disgusted” by what he 
had seen.

“A community is judged by the way it treats its children and serious questions 
were raised by ABC tonight,” he said.

He hoped the royal commission would examine the whole of the juvenile justice 
system, as well as the child protection system.

More than 96% of juvenile detainees in the NT are Indigenous, and Indigenous 
children are overrepresented in out-of-home placements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2016/feb/13/eight-years-after-the-apology-indigenous-kids-are-still-being-removed-from-their-families>
 nationally. Giles said Aboriginal children should stay with Aboriginal 
families if they had to be removed.

“We don’t want anybody being removed and we don’t want to create another 
stolen generation, but I am a person who puts the child at the forefront and I 
think those policies need to be looked at,” he said.

Giles told Sky News he “had to be careful” when discussing the issue because 
Labor would “get out on the ground and tell people that Adam’s trying to steal 
kids”.

The comments are the latest in a series of changing responses from Giles to 
the juvenile detention scandal.

Indigenous injustice: it beggars belief that so much evidence was ignored |

After the report aired Giles said he had not seen any of the footage, then he 
said he had seen the teargassing footage, and then he retracted that statement.

He announced the use of spithoods and restraint chairs would be banned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/28/northern-territory-halts-use-of-restraint-chairs-and-spithoods-in-youth-detention>
, despite his government having legislated just four months ago to widen the 
scope of their use. The following week,in an interview with Guardian Australia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/03/an-operational-matter-dylan-voller-could-be-restrained-in-chair-again-says-adam-gilesw>
, he said the ban did not extend to adult prisons, including the one where 
Dylan Voller – the boy seen in the chair on Four Corners – is now held. He said 
if Voller were again to be strapped into the chair, that would be in line with 
“adult policies”.

In an interview on Mix 104.9 Giles questioned how many of the lawyers who 
appeared in the Four Corners show were members of theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party>.


He later denied that he was questioning if the show was politically motivated, 
saying he was inquiring only out of personal interest, andit would “probably 
make a good trivia question”.

In several public appearances Giles had committed to releasing the latest 
review of the juvenile justice system, because the Four Corners report featured 
incidents that occurred before many of the improvements his government had made.

But last week he said the report would not be made public because its findings 
contradicted those of other reports, and all would be given to the royal 
commission.
