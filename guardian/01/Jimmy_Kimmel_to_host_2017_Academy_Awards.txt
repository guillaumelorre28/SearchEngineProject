 for the job last month when it was announced that the duo of Michael De Luca

But Kimmel was given the nod after ABC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/abc>

his hosting of the Emmys.

“We thought Jimmy elevated the Emmys. We thought Jimmy has earned it and we’re 
very hopeful that Jimmy will get it,”Sherwood said

event, whichwas hosted by Chris Rock
