The 2010 Turner prize nominations have been announced: Dexter Dalwood, Angela 
de la Cruz <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/angela-de-la-cruz>, 
the Otolith Group and Susan Philipsz. But how far did the judges, who include 
the novelist Philip Hensher and the gallery director Polly Staple, take into 
account the public nominations, which are supposed to have at least some 
bearing on the result? According to one judge, three of the four shortlisted 
artists were also suggested by members of the public. But the vast majority of 
publicly nominated artists were "ghastly Sunday painters, 600 of whose friends 
had clubbed together for them". Bookies William Hill, by the way, have 
exercised their well-known critical faculties to come up with odds. Dalwood is 
the favourite, as "his work is well known and easy on the eye," according to a 
spokesman. Leaving aside the hilarity of this description, Dalwood is indeed a 
strong contender, but a word to the wise: the 16/5 odds placed on Philipsz seem 
a little long to me.
