My daughter has just read The Cow Who Fell in the Canal 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Krasilovsky> which she loved, are there 
any other books about animals doing fun or unlikely things in an everyday 
setting?

Phyllis Krasilovsky and Peter Spier’s classic title The Cow Who Fell in the 
Canal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Krasilovsky> is a “building” story 
that is funny, charming and also a touch ridiculous. All things that young 
readers adore, so it is no surprise that it has been loved for over half a 
century! Peter Spier’s illustrations vividly create the simple life in the 
countryside, capturing the small changes as it becomes increasingly bustling 
and then as Hendrika the cow gaily floats in a dignified way along the canal 
towards the hectic life in the city.

Although very different in tone, Elfrida Vipont and Raymond Briggs’s The 
Elephant and the Bad Baby 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/elephant-and-the-bad-baby.html> has the same 
characteristic of contrasting reality with something absolutely entirely 
unlikely. When an elephant meets the bad baby he offers it a ride on his back 
and so, “rumpeta rumpeta rumpeta”, begins an unlikely and anarchic adventure 
set in a familiar urban landscape. The repetitive, building text tells how the 
elephant, with the bad baby perched high on its back, sets of a shop lifting 
spree. An ice cream, a lollipop, a bun - whatever the baby wants, the elephant 
stretches out his long trunk and takes for him. Soon the pair are pursued by a 
gaggle of irate shopkeepers who only catch up with them when the elephant stops 
abruptly to berate the bad baby for never once saying please!

Judith Kerr: I wasn’t scared enough. That’s how I nearly gave us away

Judith Kerr’s The Tiger Who Came to Tea 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tiger-who-came-to-tea-10.html> also 
juxtaposes real and imaginary and human and animal. Sophie and her mother are 
just about to have tea when the doorbell rings. The tiger on the doorstep steps 
smartly inside and proceeds to drink all the tea followed by all the beer and 
even all the water in the system! He also eats all the food. Once done, he gets 
up to leave. Although the tiger does nothing that makes him seem threatening, 
and Sophie strokes him lovingly, his very presence is scary – in a delightful 
way.

In Anthony Browne’s Gorilla <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/gorilla-3.html>, 
unhappy Hannah’s disappointment is turned to joy when the toy gorilla she has 
been given appears as areal gorilla in her dreams. Together the pair have 
wonderful adventures in the zoo, as the gorilla gives Hannah all the excitement 
she has been craving.

In Polly Dunbar’s Where’s Tumpty? 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/where-s-tumpty.html>, one the titles in her 
highly successful Tilly and her friends’ series, Tumpty the elephant tries to 
hide – without much success. But then Tumpty really goes missing… how can Tilly 
and her friends find him? Polly Dunbar makes the idea of a little girl having a 
group of animal friends seem completely plausible, as they play inside the 
house acting mostly as humans but never losing their animal characteristics. 
She does the same inDoodle Bites 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/doodle-bites-2.html>, where Doodle the 
crocodile wakes up one morning feeling very “bitey”. And the thing he wants to 
bite is Tumpty’s bottom? Tilly needs her wits about her to control her animal 
friends.

Mo Willems’s Pigeon in Don’t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus  
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/don-t-let-the-pigeon-drive-the-bus.html>has 
been longing for his opportunity to seize the wheel, but is sure his moment 
will never come. When the bus driver has to leave the cab for a break he says 
“Listen, I’ve got to leave for a little while so can you watch things for me 
until I get back? Thanks. Oh, and remember: Don’t let the pigeon drive the 
bus!” but the cab driver is no match for the cunning pigeon and soon the 
unlikely, the absurd and the hilarious is happening as the pigeon, muttering “I 
thought he’d never leave” takes control – of a sort! Mo Willems’s Pigeon is a 
character to be reckoned with!

I really recommend Beastie and the Boys by Matt Harvey and illustrated by 
Chloe Uden. My grandchildren all love this book, and it is also great for 
adults who have to read it over and over again. The story is enchanting and the 
pictures provide endless chances to engage the children with questions about 
the story, and to encourage their own imaginations. Brilliant!

I want to recommend Yuck! Said the Yak by Alex English about a rude Yak who 
comes to stay at Alfie’s house. He says yuck! to all the food Alfie offers him 
until he explains to a rather fed up Alfie that Yaks eat grass not chocolate 
cake! It’s a great book about picky eaters and how everyone is different when 
it comes to tastes.

Beastie and the Boys is a much thumbed adventure of two boys and their cat, by 
the very funny Matt Harvey. It’s imaginatively and intriguingly illustrated by 
Chloe Uden... There’s always more detail and wonderment for the children to 
find in each and every reading, and we’ve had lots!
