Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and Mark Thomas have written to "express our 
opposition" to cuts at the BBC, including the proposed closure of 6 Music and 
theAsian Network <https://www.theguardian.com/media/asian-network>.

They have put their names to a letter of protest signed by 47 others 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/may/25/bbc-wrong-on-digital-radio>, 
including Bianca Jagger, the actor Meera Syal and Green party leader Caroline 
Lucas MP, and published in today's Guardian.

The letter comes on the closing day of the BBC Trust's public consultation on 
the cuts planned as part of theBBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> 
director general Mark Thompson's strategy review.

Thompson's review proposes closing two digital radio stations, 6 Music 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/6music> and the Asian Network, and cutting 
back other areas of BBC activity, including its online operation.

"Losing services like 6 Music and the Asian Network, which have brought 
thousands of new listeners to the BBC, would be a huge mistake," the letter 
states.

"The BBC helps to keep our standards high and we shouldn't be prepared to 
jeopardise them with cuts. The BBC has many enemies. Media moguls who made 
billions from undercutting public service broadcasting would love to see it 
crumble. But it's vital that we don't let that happen."

Campaigners are planning a series of "flashmob" demonstrations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/may/25/bbc-6-music-asian-network> 
outside the corporation's offices in seven cities today, including the BBC 
Trust's offices on Portland Street, central London.

There have been suggestions that the BBC Trust may reverse the closures after 
the public outcry.
