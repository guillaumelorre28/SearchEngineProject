Shorts, or singles – those pamphlet-style ebooks of between 5,000 and 30,000 
words – are for me the most exciting feature of our evolving literary 
landscape. Their brevity (and accessible prices) make a refreshing change from 
traditional print nonfiction, with writers struggling to pad out ever more 
esoteric subjects and readers struggling to find the time (and money) to read 
about them.

The speed at which they can be published is also a boon, reflected in three 
new shorts on foreign affairs: James Harkin's excellent eye-witness account,War 
Against All: The Struggle for Northern Syria 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/War-Against-All-Struggle-ebook/dp/B00A0XJUSA/> (Kindle 
Singles £1.32),The Rise and Fall of the House of Bo: How a Murder Exposed the 
Cracks in China's Leadership
