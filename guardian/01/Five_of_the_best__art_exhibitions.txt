1 Anselm Kiefer

The art of Anselm Kiefer is thick with history – and thick with paint, which 
he heaps up on his vast canvases along with ash, sunflowers and words. The 
connection of art and life is, for this self-consciously German artist, not 
some vague optimistic ideal but a tragically unavoidable fact. The Wagnerian 
grandiosity of north-European myth, tainted as it is by the Nazi era, returns 
in Kiefer’s art as a mirror of history, identity and feeling. In his new 
paintings he revives the image of Walhalla, the hall of the gods in Germanic 
and norse legend, in paintings about death, time and the end of the world.

The first artists were hunters whose cave art portrayed the ice age animals 
they speared. Yet cave paintings of bison and mammoths can be loving in their 
perceptiveness, even anthropomorphic at times. The uneasy affair continues in 
this survey of contemporary beastliness, featuring Marcel Broodthaers, Maurizio 
Cattelan and that hot young conceptualist Charles Darwin.

Art became political in Oxford last year, when students called for the 
university’s statue of Cecil Rhodes to be pulled down. This exhibition takes 
politics into the gallery itself. Hans Haacke is a veteran conceptualist whose 
installations expose the webs of sponsorship and patronage that connect art 
with some nasty corporations and regimes. His seminal art of critique is shown 
alongside work by Maria Loboda, Darcy Lange, Kerry James Marshall and others. 
Fight the power, or at least unmask it in a deconstructive installation.

“Wot u :-) about?” is the question that Glasgow artist Maclean poses in this 
exhibition in Tate Britain’s Art Now space. Maclean, who will represent 
Scotland at next year’s Venice Biennale, creates kitsch phantasmagoric 
multimedia worlds featuring herself in various guises and stuffed with 
pop-cultural quotations and lurid colour.

Bright Mediterranean colours and Matisse-like spatial freedom give joyous 
levity to this young British painter’s playful works. I remember when young 
artists wanted to shock. Drury is more interested in giving delight. What’s 
wrong with elephant dung, lad? You’ve all gone soft, you kids today, with your 
posh paintboxes and cadmium yellow.
