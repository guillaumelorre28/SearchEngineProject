Fresh investigations have been sanctioned by the court of appeal into the case 
ofAli Dizaei <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ali-dizaei>, the former Scotland 
Yard commander jailed for corruption earlier this year.

A request for leave to appeal against the conviction has been adjourned until 
after 21 January, allowing Dizaei's barrister, Michael Mansfield QC, to amend 
the grounds for appeal following the emergence of fresh evidence.

The inquiries relate to the identity and nationality of the chief prosecution 
witness, Waad al-Baghdadi, who told the court he was an Iraqi.

Prosecutors are checking documents with the UK Border Agency.
