Get the tissues out … What is one of the most romantic ways to let your 
partner know that you love them? How abouta phone call from Stevie Wonder 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqrvm2XDvpQ>, singing his hit I Just Called to 
Say I Love You. James Corden seized the opportunity to surprise his wife when 
the singer guest starred in his Carpool Karaoke feature – and was moved at the 
result. The pair drove through Los Angeles singing some of Wonder’s classic 
hits and Stevie suggested he and James form a group called the Wondercats.

If you need a laugh after that, look no further than an ace mash-up 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT22q_BbsaM> from José Mourinho and Arsène 
Wenger as the Chelsea and Arsenal managers declare their love for each other. 
And there are more chuckles as Ariana Grande plays the Wheel of Musical 
Impressions <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss9ygQqqL2Q>with Jimmy Fallon. It 
includes Christina Aguilera singing The Wheels on the Bus and a Britney Spears 
version of Mary Had a Little Lamb. Staying with the music, watch what happens 
when aGo-pro falls off a drone <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldE2k-KXWow> 
and on to the dancefloor during the Burning Man festival.

If you’re getting a bit fed up of all the political news coverage around the 
UK this week, turn to Cassetteboy’s David Cameronmash-up 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV0DpN3oJlk> or the Hitler film spoof of 
Jeremy Corbynchoosing his new shadow cabinet 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyNI7wmjS6s> for a refreshing break. It’s 
quite Hilary-ious.

Finally, if you are into weird behaviour by animals, you might have seen a 
puppy’s response to being caught eating paper <https://vine.co/v/eFEM1DwZhmz>. 
You’ll also love ahedgehog’s blissful reaction to a tummy tickle 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeQI9qNaMVM> and a humpback whale  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u-MW7vF0-Y>who decided to beach itself on top 
of a kayak. Have a whale of a week!
