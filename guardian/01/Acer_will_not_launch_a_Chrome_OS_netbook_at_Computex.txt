Despite approximately 3,519 press reports to the contrary, Acer says "Acer 
will not launch aChrome <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chrome> OS 
netbook at Computex" (an important trade show in Taiwan) and it "has no 
short-term plans for such a product". The statement adds:


Acer believes that Google Chrome OS is without doubt an exciting product 
announcement and deserves it's [sic] full attention as well as an in-depth 
study of its potential from a consumers perspective.
Acer is naturally interested in any product or service that enhances the 
overall experience of its products and will of course be following the 
development and progress ofGoogle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> Chrome and the evolution of 
Google's overall product strategy very closely.

Me too! I'm keen to find out whether a Chrome OS netbook will reliably load 
Google's home page in less than a minute or two, or whether it will suffer from 
Chrome's long-standing cross-platform "Resolving host

" hang-up.

Currently, of course, Chrome's recurring inability to actually, you know, load 
web pages is a bit of a drawback for a browser, but it's not a big problem on 
Windows because you can load them in Internet Explorer instead. What do you do 
if your Chrome OS notebook can't load web pages? Any ideas?
