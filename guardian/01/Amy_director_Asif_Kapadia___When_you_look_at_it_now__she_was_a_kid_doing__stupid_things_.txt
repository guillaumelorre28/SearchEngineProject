How does it feel to have Amy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/16/amy-review-asif-kapadias-amy-winehouse-film-is-a-tragic-masterpiece>
 in our “best of 2015” list?

It’s great. Her friends have said the film puts Amy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/amy> back where she belongs: as an amazing 
talent, but also a funny, beautiful human being. That’s not always the way she 
came across in the media.

The film gives everyone a chance to atone for how she was treated …

Yes. It wasn’t just about her, it was about us – how we treat people. We build 
them up and rip them down. So it was about getting the audience to think about 
our complicity. When you look at it now, she was a kid doing stupid things. You 
needed a grownup to come in there and stop it.

Are there too few grownups in the music industry?

There must be some responsibility. These people are growing up in public. When 
it’s going well there are a lot of people around them – when it’s not they’re 
not around. My agent in America saw the film and said it’s the first time he’s 
felt guilty about what he does for living. I was like: “Good!”.

Do you think you and Amy would have got on?

No. I’m 10 years older. But I got along with a lot of her friends, so maybe we 
could have. She might not have thought much of “that film director bloke”.

Are you sick of her music?

I’m not. I love the live music we’ve got in the movie. I sometimes play it 
while I’m working. I’m more in love with her as an artist than I was before. 
The meaning of the music is deeper now. It’s not just pop music, which is what 
we all thought. It’s heavy listening.

Does success like this give you a taste of what she experienced?

I’ve had films that everyone hates. If you’ve had ups and downs, maybe you’re 
toughened. She made two records: the first one did OK, the second one was a 
mega hit. What she needed was a failure. One of those difficult third albums 
that are banged out and nobody bought. Then she’d have had a bit of freedom.
