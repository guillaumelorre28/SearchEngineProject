Food in fiction isn’t designed to give you meal plans. Rare is the novel with 
exact measurements. It’s all about appetite and good taste and personal 
preference. As long as the writer has done the job well, the reader will 
experience the character through the meal (think Henry Perowne’s fish stew in
Ian McEwan <https://www.theguardian.com/books/ianmcewan>’s Saturday, or Bridget 
Jones’s blue soup <https://youtu.be/MOnJ3IettAQ>). If it’s done really well the 
poor reader can also be left hungry: they want to taste the risotto our hero 
made to distract the thug holding him hostage; they want to try those delicate 
pastries our girl just comforted herself with in a Viennese cafe as a love 
affair turned to ashes.

How to soothe these frustrations? What about a set of recipes born from the 
texts in which the food was first mentioned? Most cookbooks offer lists of 
ingredients and things to do with them. You then use that information to create 
a dish to put at the heart of your own personal drama. This works the other way 
round – starting with the drama, and inviting you to extract from it the dish 
that got the action moving. Here is an example.

He knew that after he left, someone would discard his soup. But this was his 
special gizzard soup that she had always loved. There were twenty cloves of 
garlic in it. Mrs Scarlatti used to claim it settled her stomach, soothed her 
nerves – changed her whole perception of the day, she said. (However, it wasn’t 
on the restaurant’s menu because it was a bit “hearty” – her word – and 
Scarlatti’s Restaurant was very fine and formal. This hurt Ezra’s feelings a 
little.) When she was well enough to be home, he had often brewed single 
portions in the restaurant kitchen and carried them upstairs to her apartment. 
Even in the hospital, those first few times, she could manage a small-sized 
bowl of it. But now she was beyond that. He only brought the soup out of 
helplessness, he would have preferred to kneel by her bed and rest his head on 
her sheets, to take her hands in his and tell her, “Mrs Scarlatti, come back.” 
But she was such a no-nonsense woman; she would have looked shocked. All he 
could do was offer this soup.

Recipe

Cook’s note:
You’ll notice that the recipe does not contain 20 garlic cloves, despite 
Ezra’s recommendation. But he is cooking enough to serve an entire restaurant.

Serves 4

450g chicken gizzards
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons butter
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tablespoons flour

Put the chicken gizzards, salt and pepper in a large pan and add enough cold 
water to cover. Place over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat 
and simmer for 1 hour.

Remove the gizzards with a slotted spoon and chop coarsely. (You can also 
pulse these briefly in a food processor.) Do not discard the broth. Melt the 
butter in a small frying pan over a medium heat and add the garlic and flour. 
Cook, stirring, for a minute or two to form a paste.

Bring the gizzard broth to the boil, stir a little of the broth into the 
garlic paste, then stir the paste back into the broth. Add the chopped gizzards 
and simmer for 15 minutes.

Season well with salt and pepper, and serve.
