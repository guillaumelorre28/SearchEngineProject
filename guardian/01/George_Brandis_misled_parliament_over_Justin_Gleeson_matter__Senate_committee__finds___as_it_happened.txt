Night-time politics

 * An opposition-dominated Senate committee has recommended attorney general 
George Brandis be censured for misleading the parliament when he said he 
consulted former solicitor general Justin Gleeson over a legal direction. 
Government senators have issued a dissenting report which writes off the 
committee findings as partisan and a taxpayer-funded indulgence.

 * Labor has signalled it will vote against the government’s proposed lifetime 
travel ban on refugees who have arrived in Australia by boat. Immigration 
minister Peter Dutton claimed to have the numbers on the Senate crossbenchers 
anyway. But Nick Xenophon warned he does not have his party at this stage.

 * Labor has finally settled on a 10.5% backpacker tax policy and will try to 
amend the government’s 19% proposal in the senate. But the government has 
signalled it would not accept the amendments in the lower house. Growers will 
face their second harvests without certainty on the tax rate.

 * Trade minister Steve Ciobo continued the attack on Human Rights Commission 
president Gillian Triggs as the government set up a parliamentary committee 
inquiry into section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Triggs says she 
welcomes the inquiry.

 * Coalition MPs Russell Broadbent and George Christensen, representing either 
end of the Coalition, set to over the direction of said party. Don’t take the 
low road on fear and division re Muslims, said Russell. Eww, politically 
correct said George.

That’s it. It is goodnight from me and goodnight from him Mike Bowers. Thanks 
to the brains trust. You know who you are. And thanks for your company.

Love youse all.

Goodnight.

The LNP senator Barry O’Sullivan is speaking on the Gleeson report.

He rejects McKim’s point about the production of documents, suggesting he has 
tried to get documents in the past from other departments.

We not going to take a lecture off you guys on the standards of senior 
officers who are paid pretty significant money.

O’Sullivan goes through the revelation from Justin Gleeson that he had a 
conversation with Labor’sMark Dreyfus during the campaign. 

Then somehow former Family First senator Bob Day is raised.

O’Sullivan says tersely to the Labor benches that Senator Day would “buy and 
sell any one of you” and is a “much better man than you”.

Then it is all over.

Greens flag desire for Senate select committee into Justin Gleeson issue

The Greens senator Nick McKim, a member of the committee, has outlined his 
concerns with the Gleeson matter.


McKim is particularly concerned at the lack of access to the attorney 
general’s documents. He says arguably, the government is wilfully obstructing 
the senate.

McKim goes to this point, contained within the report, over access to 
documents.

The committee has sought access to any documents and correspondence which 
would clarify the nature of any consultation that occurred with the 
Solicitor-General. It has made requests for information from the 
Attorney-General’s Department (the Department) that are relevant to the terms 
of reference. This includes an order for the Department to produce documents, 
sent on 18 October 2016. The Department has advised the committee that it has 
provided relevant documents to the Attorney-General, and that these are still 
being considered with a view to the Attorney-General making a claim ofpublic 
interest immunity. 

The committee is concerned that the Attorney-General has only been prepared to 
provide documents that could in some way be construed to substantiate the 
assertion that the Direction was substantively discussed at the meeting on 30 
November 2016, despite other participants contradicting this claim.The 
committee has not been provided with any of the documents it has asked for 
pertaining to the Direction. 

In his submission, the Attorney-General refers to handwritten meeting notes 
taken by his staff, which merely refer to the process of obtaining advice, as 
defined by the Direction and Guidance Note.No documents (which the committee 
understands exist) have been produced to substantiate the actual consultation 
process and drafting of the Direction

McKim wants a senate select committee created to assess whether they are 
reasonable claims.


It is time for the Senate to stand up and be counted because we are being 
treated by contempt by the government.

McKim says he is talking to Labor and other senators about the issue.

He gives no indication whether he has the numbers for the committee.

Government senators accuse Labor of destroying Justin Gleeson's career

The Opposition and Greens dominated the Senate committee so there is always a 
dissenting report from government members.

Government senators say the inquiry set up by Labor destroyed the career of 
the solicitor general.

This is from the dissenting report:

During the course of the Inquiry, Government members came to the conclusion 
that the position of the Solicitor-General had become untenable.

The Solicitor-General’s subsequent decision to resign was, in the view of 
government members of the committee, commendable and perhaps an unavoidable 
consequence of the public Inquiry.

Government members regret that this Inquiry, set up by the Labor Party to 
attack Senator the HonGeorge Brandis, Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of 
Australia (the Attorney-General),has in the end destroyed the career of the 
Solicitor General who was himself appointed by the previous Labor 
administration.

Government members of the Committee are concerned that the majority on the 
Committee have used the Senate committee process, and thereby the taxpayers’ 
indulgence, to pursue a partisan political agenda.

The LNP senator Ian Macdonald, a member of the legal and constitutional 
affairs committee, beats down on the Brandis/Gleeson report.

This committee is renowned for the inappropriateness of its inquiries … 
because they are always political inquiries.

George Brandis is unfit to hold office, says Senate committee chair Louise 
Pratt

The opposition-dominated Senate committee chair Louise Pratt, has told the 
Senate that the attorney general is unfit to hold office as she tabled the 
report into the Justin Gleeson matter.

The Senate committee report calls for senate to censure Brandis after his 
failure to consult with the former solicitor generalJustin Gleeson on a 
direction that the SG must gain consent before providing advice to other 
government departments.

(This post has been amended.)

The Nationals leader and deputy PM, Barnaby Joyce, is blaming Labor’s for the 
backpackers tax, which is highly confusing because as I have said previously, 
this was a proposal that emanated from the 2015 Abbott budget.


[Labor] revel in the problems, they revel in the intrigue, they revel in 
creating chaos. They know full well what their objective is.
Barnaby Joyce (@Barnaby_Joyce) 
Aussie fruit pickers will pay more tax than any backpacker from overseas under 
the Shorten-Lambie-One Nation pact.#auspol

Joyce’s tweet is even more confusing when you consider the numbers.

 * Original backpacker tax 13% but with tax free threshold with differences 
for resident (for tax purposes) and non residents.

 * Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey’s original proposed tax in 2015 = 32.5%

 * Scott Morrison’s revised package in September = 19% 

 * Revised Labor announcement today = 10.5%.

The Greens have announced they will move their own amendments to the 
backpacker tax bill which seeks to tax backpackers at the same rate as 
Australians.

The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has been consistent on not wanting 
change on the tax – as opposed to Labor, which opposed but without stating its 
alternative position. But without the numbers, the Greens amendment will not 
pass.

So the Greens will support the crossbench/Labor amendment for a 10.5% 
backpacker tax.

The treasurer, Scott Morrison, has said if the bill is amended, the government 
will knock it off in the lower house.

Which means it will be status quo. Or will it?

Morrison says in the absence of the changes, the default tax will be 32.5% – 
which was what the Abbott government originally proposed in 2015 (where it all 
started).

Whish-Wilson was claiming the win, no matter what happens.

The Greens have led on this issue. We were the first party to oppose the 
backpacker tax. We were the only one to take a costed policy to the election. 
We were the ones who discovered legislation was required and that the automatic 
default is not 32.5%.

Now the default position of the tax is complicated. The key thing to remember 
is that though the Abbott government originally proposed the tax in 2015, this 
has been argued about ever since. No backpacker legislation has passed the 
house since then.

That means there is no change to the existing position. 

Which means some backpackers will continue to qualify as residents for tax 
purposes, getting a lesser rate. And some will continue to qualify as 
non-residents, getting a higher rate.

Whish-Wilson:

Barnaby Joyce is talking bulldust that a default rate of 32.5% will start on 
January 1 2017. The only thing due to come in on January 1 was the government’s 
law if their legislation passed both houses of parliament. If the legislation 
fails to pass then the status quo remains unchanged, that is some backpackers 
are treated as residents, and some are not.

Tasmanian farmers, at an individual level, have told me they want this bill 
dead. They will never trust the government again.Barnaby Joyce

Tasmania during this debate. He has done nothing to fix the mess his government 
created.

Just to keep you going ... the Senate committee report into the attorney 
generalGeorge Brandis’s legal direction to the solicitor general Justin Gleeson 
will be tabled tonight about 5pm.

That was the committee that saw fiery exchanges between Gleeson and the LNP 
senatorIan Macdonald and in which Gleeson admitted he considered the Brandis 
direction invalid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/gleeson-says-he-ignored-invalid-direction-from-brandis-to-seek-consent>
. Gleeson also revealed he spoke to the shadow attorney general,Mark Dreyfus, 
during the election campaign – the person who appointed him solicitor general 
in 2013.

You can find the committee website here 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/SolicitorGeneralOpinion>
. The inquiry examines the nature and scope of the consultations prior to the 
making of the legal services amendment (solicitor general opinions) direction 
2016.

This is the direction that led to the stoush that led to Gleeson resigning. 
His resignation became effective yesterday.

 * An opposition-dominated Senate committee has recommended attorney general 
George Brandis be censured for misleading the parliament when he said he 
consulted former solicitor general Justin Gleeson over a legal direction. 
Government senators have issued a dissenting report which writes off the 
committee findings as partisan and a taxpayer-funded indulgence.

 * Labor has signalled it will vote against the government’s proposed lifetime 
travel ban on refugees who have arrived in Australia by boat. Immigration 
minister Peter Dutton claimed to have the numbers on the Senate crossbenchers 
anyway. But Nick Xenophon warned he does not have his party at this stage.

 * Labor has finally settled on a 10.5% backpacker tax policy and will try to 
amend the government’s 19% proposal in the senate. But the government has 
signalled it would not accept the amendments in the lower house. Growers will 
face their second harvests without certainty on the tax rate.

 * Trade minister Steve Ciobo continued the attack on Human Rights Commission 
president Gillian Triggs as the government set up a parliamentary committee 
inquiry into section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Triggs says she 
welcomes the inquiry.

 * Coalition MPs Russell Broadbent and George Christensen, representing either 
end of the Coalition, set to over the direction of said party. Don’t take the 
low road on fear and division re Muslims, said Russell. Eww, politically 
correct said George.

That’s it. It is goodnight from me and goodnight from him Mike Bowers. Thanks

Love youse all.

Goodnight.
 
The LNP senator Barry O’Sullivan is speaking on the Gleeson report.

He rejects McKim’s point about the production of documents, suggesting he has 
tried to get documents in the past from other departments.

We not going to take a lecture off you guys on the standards of senior 
officers who are paid pretty significant money.

O’Sullivan goes through the revelation from Justin Gleeson that he had a 
conversation with Labor’sMark Dreyfus during the campaign. 

Then somehow former Family First senator Bob Day is raised.

O’Sullivan says tersely to the Labor benches that Senator Day would “buy and 
sell any one of you” and is a “much better man than you”.

Then it is all over. 
 
The Greens senator Nick McKim, a member of the committee, has outlined his 
concerns with the Gleeson matter.


McKim is particularly concerned at the lack of access to the attorney 
general’s documents. He says arguably, the government is wilfully obstructing 
the senate.

McKim goes to this point, contained within the report, over access to 
documents.

The committee has sought access to any documents and correspondence which 
would clarify the nature of any consultation that occurred with the 
Solicitor-General. It has made requests for information from the 
Attorney-General’s Department (the Department) that are relevant to the terms 
of reference. This includes an order for the Department to produce documents, 
sent on 18 October 2016. The Department has advised the committee that it has 
provided relevant documents to the Attorney-General, and that these are still 
being considered with a view to the Attorney-General making a claim ofpublic 
interest immunity. 

The committee is concerned that the Attorney-General has only been prepared to 
provide documents that could in some way be construed to substantiate the 
assertion that the Direction was substantively discussed at the meeting on 30 
November 2016, despite other participants contradicting this claim.The 
committee has not been provided with any of the documents it has asked for 
pertaining to the Direction. 

In his submission, the Attorney-General refers to handwritten meeting notes 
taken by his staff, which merely refer to the process of obtaining advice, as 
defined by the Direction and Guidance Note.No documents (which the committee 
understands exist) have been produced to substantiate the actual consultation 
process and drafting of the Direction

McKim wants a senate select committee created to assess whether they are 
reasonable claims.


It is time for the Senate to stand up and be counted because we are being 
treated by contempt by the government.

McKim says he is talking to Labor and other senators about the issue.

He gives no indication whether he has the numbers for the committee.
 
The Opposition and Greens dominated the Senate committee so there is always a 
dissenting report from government members.

Government senators say the inquiry set up by Labor destroyed the career of 
the solicitor general.

This is from the dissenting report:

During the course of the Inquiry, Government members came to the conclusion 
that the position of the Solicitor-General had become untenable.

The Solicitor-General’s subsequent decision to resign was, in the view of 
government members of the committee, commendable and perhaps an unavoidable 
consequence of the public Inquiry.

Government members regret that this Inquiry, set up by the Labor Party to 
attack Senator the HonGeorge Brandis, Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of 
Australia (the Attorney-General),has in the end destroyed the career of the 
Solicitor General who was himself appointed by the previous Labor 
administration.

Government members of the Committee are concerned that the majority on the 
Committee have used the Senate committee process, and thereby the taxpayers’ 
indulgence, to pursue a partisan political agenda.
 
Recommendation 1

That the Senate disallow the amendment to the Direction or the Attorney 
General withdraw it immediately, and that the Guidance Note be revised 
accordingly.

Recommendation 2 

That the Attorney-General provide, within three sitting days, an explanation 
to the Senate responding to the matters raised in this report.

Recommendation 3 

That the Senate censure the Attorney-General for misleading the parliament and 
failing to discharge his duties as Attorney-General appropriately.
 
Senator Ian Macdonald is criticising Gleeson for telling the committee hearing 
details about advice he has given without the permission of his clients, ie the 
AG.

He says the SG is a senior public servant and should abide by the rules of his 
job.

The LNP senator Ian Macdonald, a member of the legal and constitutional 
affairs committee, beats down on the Brandis/Gleeson report.

This committee is renowned for the inappropriateness of its inquiries … 
because they are always political inquiries.
 
The opposition-dominated Senate committee chair Louise Pratt, has told the 
Senate that the attorney general is unfit to hold office as she tabled the 
report into the Justin Gleeson matter.

The Senate committee report calls for senate to censure Brandis after his 
failure to consult with the former solicitor generalJustin Gleeson on a 
direction that the SG must gain consent before providing advice to other 
government departments.

The Nationals leader and deputy PM, Barnaby Joyce, is blaming Labor’s for the 
backpackers tax, which is highly confusing because as I have said previously, 
this was a proposal that emanated from the 2015 Abbott budget.


[Labor] revel in the problems, they revel in the intrigue, they revel in 
creating chaos. They know full well what their objective is.

Joyce’s tweet is even more confusing when you consider the numbers.

 * Original backpacker tax 13% but with tax free threshold with differences 
for resident (for tax purposes) and non residents.

 * Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey’s original proposed tax in 2015 = 32.5%

 * Scott Morrison’s revised package in September = 19% 

 * Revised Labor announcement today = 10.5%.  
The Greens have announced they will move their own amendments to the 
backpacker tax bill which seeks to tax backpackers at the same rate as 
Australians.

The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has been consistent on not wanting 
change on the tax – as opposed to Labor, which opposed but without stating its 
alternative position. But without the numbers, the Greens amendment will not 
pass.

So the Greens will support the crossbench/Labor amendment for a 10.5% 
backpacker tax.

The treasurer, Scott Morrison, has said if the bill is amended, the government 
will knock it off in the lower house.

Which means it will be status quo. Or will it?

Morrison says in the absence of the changes, the default tax will be 32.5% – 
which was what the Abbott government originally proposed in 2015 (where it all 
started).

Whish-Wilson was claiming the win, no matter what happens.

The Greens have led on this issue. We were the first party to oppose the 
backpacker tax. We were the only one to take a costed policy to the election. 
We were the ones who discovered legislation was required and that the automatic 
default is not 32.5%.

Now the default position of the tax is complicated. The key thing to remember 
is that though the Abbott government originally proposed the tax in 2015, this 
has been argued about ever since. No backpacker legislation has passed the 
house since then.

That means there is no change to the existing position. 

Which means some backpackers will continue to qualify as residents for tax 
purposes, getting a lesser rate. And some will continue to qualify as 
non-residents, getting a higher rate.

Whish-Wilson:

Barnaby Joyce is talking bulldust that a default rate of 32.5% will start on 
January 1 2017. The only thing due to come in on January 1 was the government’s 
law if their legislation passed both houses of parliament. If the legislation 
fails to pass then the status quo remains unchanged, that is some backpackers 
are treated as residents, and some are not.

Tasmanian farmers, at an individual level, have told me they want this bill 
dead. They will never trust the government again.Barnaby Joyce

Just to keep you going ... the Senate committee report into the attorney 
generalGeorge Brandis’s legal direction to the solicitor general Justin Gleeson 
will be tabled tonight about 5pm.

That was the committee that saw fiery exchanges between Gleeson and the LNP 
senatorIan Macdonald and in which Gleeson admitted he considered the Brandis 
direction invalid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/gleeson-says-he-ignored-invalid-direction-from-brandis-to-seek-consent>
. Gleeson also revealed he spoke to the shadow attorney general,Mark Dreyfus, 
during the election campaign – the person who appointed him solicitor general 
in 2013.

You can find the committee website here 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/SolicitorGeneralOpinion>
. The inquiry examines the nature and scope of the consultations prior to the 
making of the legal services amendment (solicitor general opinions) direction 
2016.

This is the direction that led to the stoush that led to Gleeson resigning. 
His resignation became effective yesterday.
