Johnny Cash recorded live albums at San Quentin and Folsom prisons in the US. 
Are there any incidences of singers visiting British prisons – eg Cliff Richard 
at Strangeways?

In 1997, Derby's brilliant Cable 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_(British_band)> played a set at Brixton 
prison, later released as an EP, which fittingly included two Johnny Cash 
covers. These may have been included in case the audience wasn't into 
Fugazi/Sonic Youth inspired alternative rock.

Hank Wangford (born Sam Hutt) 
<http://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/06/arts/london-singing-doctor-works-land-between-ridicule-reverence-for-nashville.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm>
 made a TV series of performancesfilmed in Strangeways prison in 1985 
<http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b7234e230>. His often maudlin country style was 
perfect for performing to inmates, with whom he was able to share emotions from 
the "Wangford Hall of Pain".

Billy Bragg formed the Jail Guitar Doors initiative (which took its name from 
a B-side by the Clash) in 2007 with the aim of getting musical instruments into 
prisons to help with rehabilitation. He has played in prisons (such as Wormwood 
Scrubs) with various musicians, including Mick Jones of the Clash.

The band Hard-Fi also played in a prison, on condition that they didn't play 
covers of The Clash songs Bank Robber or I Fought the Law.

The Angelic Upstarts once played HMP Acklington. I read later that they 
encored with The Animals' We Gotta Get Out of this Place. Cue a riot.

A lot of musicians visit prisons – Leonard Cohen gigged in Dublin's former 
prison Kilmainham 
<http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/the-ballads-of-kilmainham-gaol-26893738.html>
 last year. The Libertines used to do it, and Dirty Pretty Things, Mick Jones 
and Billy Bragg hold regular concerts in prisons.

Pete Doherty?

I don't know about Britain, but here in Austria a folk-pop music group was 
once hired to play a gig to entertain the inmates in Innsbruck prison. It 
started off badly when the lead singer greeted the audience by saying: "Thanks 
for coming here today."

Is there sexism in heaven 

Are Christian souls in the afterlife as segregated by gender as we are on 
earth?

Scripture (the only authoritative source of information we have on the 
subject, if you believe it to be such) seems very quiet on this matter. 
Literature, on the other hand, suggests that in the afterlife we do remain who 
we are on earth:Dante <http://www.worldofdante.org/>, for instance, shows men 
and women retaining their genders in hell, in purgatory, and in heaven.

Whether this applies to other religions that believe in an afterlife I do not 
know. It would, of course, be an odd paradise (or hell) where Christians 
retained their gender, while Muslims or those of other religions did not.

For those contemplating the "after-death", if particle physicists are to be 
believed, the atoms of matter than make up our mortal remains are more or less 
indestructible and will be redistributed by Mother Nature throughout the 
universe to some useful purpose of her own for eternity.

There is no segregation in heaven. Only white males are allowed in.

Many classic novels were first published in serial form in magazines. Does 
this ever happen now, and if not, why?

Stephen King initially published The Green Mile in serialised form 
<http://www.goodreads.com/series/69946-the-green-mile> – as short, stand-alone 
books rather than in a larger publication.

Alexander McCall Smith's 44 Scotland Street 
<http://www.mccallsmith.com/scotland1.htm> series started as a serialisation in 
The Scotsman. The instalments were much shorter than a 19th-century novel 
instalment, making the story more bitty than the works of Charles Dickens and 
his contemporaries.

There are also fictional blogs that have made the transition to novel format 
(eg theBabyBarista <http://www.babybarista.com/tag/the-babybarista-blog/> 
series).

Given the general decline in print journalism, I suspect if there is a future 
for written, serialised fiction, it is on the internet.
