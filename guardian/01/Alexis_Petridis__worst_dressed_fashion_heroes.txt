American GQ recently ran a piece called The 15 Worst-Dressed Men Of Silicon 
Valley 
<http://www.gq.com/style/profiles/201108/worst-dressed-men-silicon-valley-mark-zuckerberg#slide=1>
. It was a catalogue of sartorial horror that made Jeremy Clarkson look like
Bryan Ferry in the Avalon video <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeKYwgCrLSw>. 
All 15 seemed to have a thing about jeans that are a bit too big for them: not 
in the oversized hip-hop sense, but in the don't-quite-fit sense. A guy who 
owns theapp SCVNGR <http://www.scvngr.com/> always wears ski goggles and 
sandals, whileCraigslist <http://london.craigslist.co.uk/>'s Craig has "a 
signature beret". AndMark Zuckerberg <http://www.facebook.com/markzuckerberg> 
is so legendarily badly dressed, he's inspired a mock fashion line,Mark by Mark 
Zuckerberg <http://www.markbymarkzuckerberg.com/>: "Sometimes fashion is 
counterintuitive," says its website, "so grab… a tie and finally show the world 
how wrong for you ties really are."

The GQ article suggests these men are figures of pity who "could use a style 
IQ boost". I think they're heroic. The ski-goggles-and-sandals guy clearly 
isn't thick – he's making a bold and subversive style statement, offering 
a heartfelt screw-you to the world of fashion. Here is a man who not only 
thinks appearances don't matter, but is on a mission to prove it. What's more, 
he's flaunting his wealth every bit as much as a bling-dripping rapper: it's a 
look that says I am so successful, you have to take me seriously no matter what 
I'm wearing. Designers always claim to love individuals and iconoclasts: I give 
it a few years before someone claims the Silicon Valley millionaires as the 
inspiration behind their new collection.
