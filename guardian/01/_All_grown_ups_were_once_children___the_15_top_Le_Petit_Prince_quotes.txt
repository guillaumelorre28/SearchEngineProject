The Little Prince (or in French Le Petit Prince 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/333714/>) is in many 
ways not one but two books. As with a gobstopper, the first layer depicts a 
dreamlike children’s story. A second and closer look uncovers the various 
philosophical and open-ended charades concocted by its author, the French 
aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The English translation is by Katherine Woods.

The narrative of the book is inextricable from its creator, who also devised 
the watercolour illustrations that are key to the story’s popularity. Because 
of world politics, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry became exiled in the 1940s, and his 
wealth enabled him to roam the world, inspiring much of his wartime writing.

The Little Prince explores the boundless themes of love, loneliness and 
purpose through captivating and loveable characters who mirror Antoine de 
Saint-Exupéry’s own position of outcast. The protagonist of the book is a pilot 
who crashes in the Sahara and finds both meaning and friendship through the 
eerie little prince and those he loves. Here are our favourite quotations:

All grown-ups were once children… but only few of them remember it.

But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique 
in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world.

One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed.

Grown-ups love figures… When you tell them you’ve made a new friend they never 
ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you “What does 
his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect 
butterflies? “ Instead they demand ‘How old is he? How much does he weigh? How 
much money does his father make?’ Only from these figures do they think they 
have learned anything about him.


“My life is very monotonous,” the fox said. “I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All 
the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in 
consequence, I am a little bored.”

“Where are the people?” resumed the little prince at last. “It’s a little 
lonely in the desert…” “It is lonely when you’re among people, too,” said the 
snake.”


I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close 
at hand. And that hasn’t much improved my opinion of them.

“‘What makes the desert beautiful,’ said the little prince, ‘is that somewhere 
it hides a well…’”

But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything 
but praise.


It is only with the heart that one can see clearly. What is essential is 
invisible to the eye.


A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it, 
bearing within him the image of a cathedral.

No one is ever satisfied where he is.


It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you 
succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom.

For millions of years flowers have been producing thorns. For millions of 
years sheep have been eating them all the same. And it’s not serious, trying to 
understand why flowers go to such trouble to produce thorns that are good for 
nothing? It’s not important, the war between the sheep and the flowers?

Sometimes, there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day.
