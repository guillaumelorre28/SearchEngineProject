 The pilot of the Cessna plane in which the pop-star Aaliyah died had a recent 
criminal conviction for drugs, the authorities said yesterday.
All nine passengers died in the accident just after the plane took off from 
Abaco Island in the Bahamas on Saturday.Aaliyah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aaliyah>, 22, had been making a music video 
on the island.

Prosecutors in Broward County, Florida, said that 12 days before the accident 
the pilot, Luis Antonio Morales Blanes, 30, had been put on probation for three 
years for possession of crack-cocaine and other offences.

Excess weight is being considered by the Bahamas civil aviation department as 
a possible factor in the crash.

The plane was estimated by aviation experts to have exceeded its maximum 
take-off weight by 315 to 675kg.

The investigators have also found that the two companies which owned and 
operated the plane, Blackhawk International Airways and Skystream, did not have 
a permit to operate in the Bahamas.

In the United States, where the company was cleared for charter flights, 
Morales was not authorised to fly the twin-engine Cessna.

Blackhawk has cited by the US aviation authorities at least four times for 
breaches of regulations, including failing to follow drug-testing rules for 
employees.
