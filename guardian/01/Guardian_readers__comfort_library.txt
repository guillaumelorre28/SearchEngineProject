A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a 
bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be 
one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, 
I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain 
nearly close, I was shrined in a double retirement.”

Thus the young Jane Eyre escapes the double trial of her aunt’s scolding and 
“the drear November day”. Her escapism isn’t straightforward though, as her 
book of choice is Bewick’s History of British Birds which, between the bucolic 
engravings of robins and sea-fowl, features ghoulish scenes of hellfire and 
hangings.

The fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it 
was an object of terror. <http://genius.com/3938472>

Jane presumably gets an illicit thrill from those terrifying images, making 
her the ancestor of those who find nothing more consoling in the cold, dark 
months of winter than an evening home alone with one of Stephen King’s grislier 
novels.

Jane Eyre is one of the books I return to when times are tough, so it came to 
mind when reading through the comfort library assembled by contributors to our
Tips, Links and Suggestions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/10/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week>
 forum. Earlier this week, a member of our children’s books site inspired a 
twitter-fest by recommendingher own list of comfort books 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/nov/17/favourite-comfort-read-harry-potter-northern-lights>
: children’s books are regularly cited as literature’s version of cocoa and a 
hotwater bottle for troubled grown-ups too, for obvious reasons, with Harry 
Potter leading the way for the generation whose childhoods will always be 
associated with the boy wizard.


Here, though, is the library assembled by contributor conedison 
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10021252> from the recommendations of 
our adult reading community. Feel free to add your own in the comments below.
