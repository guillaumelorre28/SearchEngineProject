"Vic-torious!" was the headline. Underneath was a photograph of Vic in an 
evening dress, holding her award aloft like aprize fighter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing>. She looked surprised, delighted, 
slightly flustered. Her little face tipped to the side, her eyes gazing in 
disbelief at the statuette, she made a perfect compositional triangle.

I couldn't get hold of her that night. When I called, people whose voices I 
didn't recognise told me I'd have to leave a message. She was out at parties of 
course, and then some television interviews, and some press interviews, and 
then she was simply exhausted.

It was three days before she returned my calls. Her voice was so dry and thin 
I almost didn't recognise it.
"Been partying hard?" I said
She exhaled, a long low sigh.
"Too much, too much." A pause. "I just want to rest, but I've got to do this 
TV thing, and then we start the tour."
"Can't you … reschedule? Get a week's break at least?"
She sighed again. I wanted, at that moment, to drive over to her hotel and 
gather her up in my arms and take her home with me. But our relationship was 
not of that sort.
"No," she said, after a few moments, "No I can't. But … will you tell me 
something?"
Yes, I thought, anything.
"What's that?"
"No, I mean, tell me something about something. Something about art. Tell me 
something I've never heard before."

So I did. For 20 minutes I told her about Botticelli and his Venus, about the 
way that her body doesn't quite fit together, how her left arm is clearly 
attached to her side and not her shoulder, and her neck is far too long. But 
nonetheless, I said, she is beautiful.

"Oh, beauty," said Vic, "that's what it all boils down to, isn't it?"
This was not quite what I'd hoped to convey.
