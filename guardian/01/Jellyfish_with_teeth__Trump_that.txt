the ponies succeed in ring-barking them?” In Stratford Park, Stroud, there is a 
beech tree, probably nearing its 100th birthday, that was thoroughly 
ring-barked more than 25 years ago by a tree surgeon with a regional 
reputation. Today it remains as well as ever. Could ponies have been more 
destructive than a chainsaw?

• Simpsons writer Dan Greaney did paint a “horrifying and fantastical vision 
of the future” in caricaturing Donald Trump in a 2000 episode (Simpsons prophecy
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/17/simpsons-president-trump-prediction-was-meant-as-warning-to-us>
, 18 March), but he was beaten to the draw by Bob Gale who, in the 1989 film 
Back to the Future Part II, created the casino-financed Biff Tannen whom he 
later said had been inspired by Trump.

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/18/go-north-for-easter-hols-cameron-tells-britons-but-hes-off-to-lanzarote>
, 19 March) that on a previous break in Lanzarote the prime minister was 
“bitten by a jellyfish”. Let’s hope that on his return from his latest trip he 
is not stung by a dog.

• I searched in vain for your Paul Daniels 12 page pull-out tribute (Obituary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/17/paul-daniels-obituary>, 18 
March), then realised that you’d produced an invisible one. He’d have liked 
that.
