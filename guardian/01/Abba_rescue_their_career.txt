In April 1974, Abba <https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba> won the 
Eurovision song contest with Waterloo and the world fell for the Swedish band's 
charms, the song turning into a global hit. But their future success was far 
from certain: to the public, they looked like classic Euro one-hit-wonders.

But Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus had a trump card. Holed up in Stockholm 
in August 74, they'd written SOS – its title the work of manager Stig Anderson. 
It wasn't their next single; instead they chose to release So Long, which 
crawled to No 91 in the UK. Next they put out I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do – to 
which Radio 1 said: No, you don't, giving it little airplay, and it limped to 
No 38. But in September 1975, SOS was released and Abba were back with a bang, 
reaching No 6 in the UK, with Mamma Mia next, topping the charts. The band hit 
their stride and went on to become the fourth bestselling pop act in the 
history of recorded music.

Not only was SOS a rarity because the title and the band's name were both 
palindromes, its influence was far-reaching. John Lennon and Pete Townshend 
declared themselves fans – and a short while later, a band called the Sex 
Pistols seemed to borrow its riff for the introduction to a snappy track of 
theirs called Pretty Vacant.
