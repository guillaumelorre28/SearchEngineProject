Russian prosecutors have called for the Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to be 
jailed for 10 years in an appeal against the suspended sentence he was given in 
a theft case last year

The RIA news agency reports that Navalny, who led Moscow street protests 
againstVladimir Putin <https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin> 
between 2011 and 2012, and his brother Oleg were accused last year of stealing 
30m roubles – more than £300,000 at the current rate – from two companies, 
including an affiliate of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher, between 
2008 and 2012.

 Oleg was given a three-and-a-half-year jail sentence, while Navalny was given 
a suspended sentence that prosecutors promised to appeal against. “We demand 
that Navalny be sentenced to 10 years in jail,” a prosecutor told the appeal on 
Tuesday at Moscow city court.

 Kremlin critics and Washington have called the case an attempt to stifle 
political dissent.

 Since being sentenced, Navalny has taken an increasingly confrontational 
stance

, cutting off his house arrest tag and attending a rally of his supporters, who 
gathered on the day of his sentencing last year in violation of his detention. 
He has promised to lead 100,000 people on 1 March in protest against Kremlin 
policies, which he says are leading the country deeper into economic crisis.
