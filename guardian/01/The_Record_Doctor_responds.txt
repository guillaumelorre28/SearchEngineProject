I am a retired raver who has started to get cravings for some repetitive beats 
in my life again. As I'll never see 30 again, I'm quite taken with this
balearic/cosmic craze that I keep hearing about, but don't want to make a fool 
of myself in my local record emporium. Who should I be buying
and, more importantly, dancing to?

Well, Wroteforluck, as anyone who has heard their remixes of Grace Jones's 
William's Blood and Friendly Fires' Paris will attest, the Belgium-based
Aeroplane <http://www.dustedmagazine.com/features/804> (Stephen Fasano and Vito 
Deluca) are the darlings of the psychedelic disco scene. Their own productions 
are released onEskimo <http://www.eskimorecordings.com/index2.html> which, 
quite frankly, can do little wrong: witness Lindstrom and Prins Thomas's II, a 
mish-mash of prog rock, disco and Krautrock, and Daniele Baldelli's Cosmic 
Disco?! Cosmic Rock!, which explores space-age house music's 80s roots. Look 
out, finally, for Smith & Mudd, whose new album, Le Suivant, is suitably 
sun-kissed.

My dad keeps buying insipid blues CDs and playing them at full volume on long 
car journeys. I bought him a Seasick Steve album for Christmas, which he loved. 
Can you point me in the direction of some authentic bluesmen?

Bluesmen don't come any more authentic than Robert Johnson and Blind Willie 
Johnson. The former's King of the Delta Blues Singers, first released in 1961, 
includes such tracks as Hell Hound on My Trail, on which he alludes to being 
hounded by the devil in an otherworldly howl. Insipid it is not. As for Blind 
Willie, beg, borrow or steal hisDark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/nov/30/popandrock3>, a wordless cry that 
reverberates down the years and which Ry Cooder once described as "the most 
soulful, transcendental piece in all American music". Overblown? Possibly – but 
you can see his point.

I need some more power pop in my life. I love the usual suspects – Big Star, 
Badfinger, the Raspberries and Cheap Trick. But I'd like some more 
recommendations. I'd also like to know more about boozy rock artists from the 
70s and 80s, such as Graham Parker and Green on Red.

No one can have too much power pop in their life, particularly when it's as 
potent as the Posies' 1990 albumDear 23 
<http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/p/posies-dear23.shtml> – which is 
pitched somewhere between Big Star and the Hollies – and Matthew Sweet's
Girlfriend 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/102129/review/5944166/girlfriend> 
from 1991. Booze rock-wise, track down the Long Ryders – who recently reunited 
after a two-decade-long break – Joe Strummer's former band the 101'ers, Nick 
Lowe's Brinsley Schwarz and the Green on Red-like Richmond Fontaine, whose new 
album, We Used to Think the Freeway Sounded Like a River, is the aural 
equivalent of a Raymond Carver book.

I recently watched the excellent documentary Heartworn Highways featuring 
Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark. I'd like to explore these two artists further. 
Where should I start and which other artists should I also investigate. No 
modern stuff please. Anything after 1984 is rubbish.

The 1968-73 period is generally regarded as Van Zandt's most productive, and 
Our Mother the Mountain, from 1969, is probably the best introduction to the 
man once described by an acolyte, Steve Earle, as "the best songwriter in the 
world". Fellow outlaw country pioneer Guy Clark peaked, arguably, with Old No 
1, his 1975 debut for Sugar Hill, on which he referenced drifters, drunks and 
the infirm. Check out, too, John Stewart'sCalifornia Bloodlines 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johnstewart/albums/album/246397/review/6209819/california_bloodlineswillard_minus_2>
, a touchstone of Americana.
