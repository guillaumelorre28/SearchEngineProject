Night time politics

What happened today?

 * The government trumpeted its reworked superannuation package 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/superannuation-backflip-on-500000-cap-wins-over-coalition-conservatives>
, that passed cabinet last night and was given the big tick of approval by 
former critics, George Christensen among others. It drops the $500,000 lifetime 
cap and makes a number of other changes while still reining in some of the more 
generous tax concessions. Financial services minister Kelly O’Dwyer did a lot 
of the backbench negotiating while Scott Morrison did the shoulder charging. 
Both ministers challenged Labor to support the changes in question time but 
Chris Bowen was not ready to approve it. Labor of course have their own package 
which does broadly similar things. But given the Coalition tried to sneak a few 
other measures into the budget omnibus bill, he wants to see the fine print 
first.

 * The super compromise was a win for government but it still has to pass the 
parliament and that needs Labor’s support. But the win did increase Coalition 
confidence in question time, as evidenced by Mike Bowers photos. Turnbull 
rejected the characterisation as a backflip, saying policies needed to change 
and respond to circumstances. He said the government would consider ideas from 
any quarter, even Labor. Leader of government business, Christopher Pyne 
followed up, saying the Labor’s divisive rhetoric was so last parliament. 
Remember that one under Tony Abbott?

 * The budget omnibus bill went to the Senate today and after the motion by 
Labor and the Coalition to extend the hours for the day, senators will be 
forced to sit until the bill passes. The Greens are objecting mightily, having 
wanted to get the bill to a Senate inquiry.

 * Attorney general George Brandis will have to submit to a Senate inquiry 
into the circumstances around his direction that any requests for legal advice 
from the solicitor general must come through his office. This will be a very 
interesting fishing exercise.

 * Bill Shorten is still in Canada with Justin. Trudeau, not Beiber. 

That’s it from me. Thanks to the brains trust, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp, 
Gareth Hutchensand Mike Bowers. Thanks for your company this week.


We are not sitting until October 10, so I will be back here, driving the bus 
on that very day.

Goodnight.

7.09am BST 07:09  <> 

The Greens’ treasury spokesman, Peter Whish-Wilson, says Scott Morrison caved 
in on the superannuation package.

Today the government caved in on the substantial reforms needed to address the 
perversities in the superannuation system that allow the wealthy to use their 
superannuation as a tax haven.

The Greens estimate superannuation concessions cost Australian tax payers 
nearly $30bn per annum. The government is only proposing to cut these by 10%.

Whilst some concessions are necessary to incentivise savings, many are simply 
used by the wealthy to minimise tax, which means less money for our schools and 
healthcare.

This explains the last post. My football consultant, Mike Bowers, tells me the 
Western Bulldogs are playing the Hawks.

 They are revving up Bill Shorten. While he is away in Canada. Demotion looms.

Gareth Hutchens

Now that the flurry of question time is over, I can post Gareth Hutchen’s 
analysis of the unemployment figures:

The latest unemployment figure is out today, and the headline number looks 
good.

The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.6%, seasonally adjusted, from 5.7%. 
It hasn’t been this low since September 2013.


Not bad, eh?


The government hasn’t been trumpeting the news today because the story is 
complicated.


Firstly, the seasonally adjusted number can be unreliable. It can jump around 
a lot. The trend figure provides the best measure of the underlying behaviour 
of the labour market and it has been stuck at 5.7% since May.

Secondly, underemployment keeps increasing. Since December last year, there 
are about 105,300 more people working part-time, but the number of people 
working full time has decreased by 21,500.

In fact, the trend underemployment rate – a quarterly measure of employed 
people who would like to work more hours – hit 8.6% last month, the highest it 
has ever been.

There is a question to the industry minister, Greg Hunt, on the current state 
of negotiations as to the sale of Arrium’s assets and what could we possibly do 
to ensure its survival.

Hunt says the first shipment from this steel plant for the Adelaide to 
Tarcoola railway line was delivered.

That is a tremendous step forward. That should deliver $80m of cash flow for 
the plant and for the future of the Whyalla steel plant.

What happened today?

 * The government trumpeted its reworked superannuation package 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/superannuation-backflip-on-500000-cap-wins-over-coalition-conservatives>
, that passed cabinet last night and was given the big tick of approval by 
former critics, George Christensen among others. It drops the $500,000 lifetime 
cap and makes a number of other changes while still reining in some of the more 
generous tax concessions. Financial services minister Kelly O’Dwyer did a lot 
of the backbench negotiating while Scott Morrison did the shoulder charging. 
Both ministers challenged Labor to support the changes in question time but 
Chris Bowen was not ready to approve it. Labor of course have their own package 
which does broadly similar things. But given the Coalition tried to sneak a few 
other measures into the budget omnibus bill, he wants to see the fine print 
first.

 * The super compromise was a win for government but it still has to pass the 
parliament and that needs Labor’s support. But the win did increase Coalition 
confidence in question time, as evidenced by Mike Bowers photos. Turnbull 
rejected the characterisation as a backflip, saying policies needed to change 
and respond to circumstances. He said the government would consider ideas from 
any quarter, even Labor. Leader of government business, Christopher Pyne 
followed up, saying the Labor’s divisive rhetoric was so last parliament. 
Remember that one under Tony Abbott?

 * The budget omnibus bill went to the Senate today and after the motion by 
Labor and the Coalition to extend the hours for the day, senators will be 
forced to sit until the bill passes. The Greens are objecting mightily, having 
wanted to get the bill to a Senate inquiry.

 * Attorney general George Brandis will have to submit to a Senate inquiry 
into the circumstances around his direction that any requests for legal advice 
from the solicitor general must come through his office. This will be a very 
interesting fishing exercise.

 * Bill Shorten is still in Canada with Justin. Trudeau, not Beiber. 

That’s it from me. Thanks to the brains trust, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp, 
Gareth Hutchensand Mike Bowers. Thanks for your company this week.


We are not sitting until October 10, so I will be back here, driving the bus 
on that very day.

Goodnight.

The Greens’ treasury spokesman, Peter Whish-Wilson, says Scott Morrison caved 
in on the superannuation package.

Today the government caved in on the substantial reforms needed to address the 
perversities in the superannuation system that allow the wealthy to use their 
superannuation as a tax haven.

The Greens estimate superannuation concessions cost Australian tax payers 
nearly $30bn per annum. The government is only proposing to cut these by 10%.

Whilst some concessions are necessary to incentivise savings, many are simply 
used by the wealthy to minimise tax, which means less money for our schools and 
healthcare.
 
Meanwhile, in the Northern Territory, the Country Liberals have released their 
shadow cabinet positions. Playing it for the lols.

This explains the last post. My football consultant, Mike Bowers, tells me the 
Western Bulldogs are playing the Hawks.

 They are revving up Bill Shorten. While he is away in Canada. Demotion looms.

Now that the flurry of question time is over, I can post Gareth Hutchen’s 
analysis of the unemployment figures:

The latest unemployment figure is out today, and the headline number looks 
good.

The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.6%, seasonally adjusted, from 5.7%. 
It hasn’t been this low since September 2013.


Not bad, eh?


The government hasn’t been trumpeting the news today because the story is 
complicated.


Firstly, the seasonally adjusted number can be unreliable. It can jump around 
a lot. The trend figure provides the best measure of the underlying behaviour 
of the labour market and it has been stuck at 5.7% since May.

Secondly, underemployment keeps increasing. Since December last year, there 
are about 105,300 more people working part-time, but the number of people 
working full time has decreased by 21,500.

In fact, the trend underemployment rate – a quarterly measure of employed 
people who would like to work more hours – hit 8.6% last month, the highest it 
has ever been.
 
There is a question to the industry minister, Greg Hunt, on the current state 
of negotiations as to the sale of Arrium’s assets and what could we possibly do 
to ensure its survival.

Hunt says the first shipment from this steel plant for the Adelaide to 
Tarcoola railway line was delivered.

That is a tremendous step forward. That should deliver $80m of cash flow for 
the plant and for the future of the Whyalla steel plant.
