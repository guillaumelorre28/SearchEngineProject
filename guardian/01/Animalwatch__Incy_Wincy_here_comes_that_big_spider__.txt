This is a nightmare time of year for arachnophobes, when spiders seem to be 
growing big, beefy and scurrying around inside homes. The males are racing 
around looking for females to mate with, and for the large house spider this 
can make quite a hair-raising scene.

Spiders look so big now because the females are full of eggs, which they lay 
in autumn. Most types of spiders only come indoors by accident, but the 
torrential rains this year flushed out so many of them that more than usual 
crawled indoors for sanctuary.

Worse news is that biting spiders are spreading farther north in Britain as 
the climate grows warmer. Steatoda nobilis is a cousin of the black widow 
spider and, although far less venomous, can still give a painful bite, rather 
like a wasp sting. Originally from the Canaries, it arrived in Devon in the 
late 1800s before spreading gradually along the south coast, but in the past 20 
years has fanned out across southern England.

Another black widow relative over here is the green-fanged Mediterranean tube 
web spider. Until the 1990s this large spider was holed up in southern ports, 
but in recent years has moved north and has now arrived in Manchester. This 
spider sometimes comes indoors and if threatened raises its legs, bares its 
fangs and can lunge forward in a single jump and bite.

One thing for wasp phobics to be grateful for, though: the wet weather made 
this a very poor year for wasps.
