I first realised something was wrong when my girlfriend noticed that one of my 
testes was a lot harder than the other one. I really became concerned over the 
next couple of weeks, when it began to increase in size.

This was two months ago, while I was away in Belfast during Easter break, and 
I was unable to get a hospital appointment. It was four weeks before I was 
diagnosed with testicular cancer.

The most difficult part was not only the waiting, but also the realisation 
that life wouldn’t continue as normal any time soon. You can’t make any plans; 
you can only hope for the best.

It sucks being 21 and having to have serious conversations about going to 
sperm banks, about losing all my hair, and having to leave my university two 
months earlier than planned. It scares me that the next three months of my life 
– my holidays, my trips with my girlfriend that we had planned when we graduate 
this summer – have all come into question.

One of the weird things about the cancer is that I can still basically 
function as a human being; I can still go outside and talk to people – but they 
now find it hard to interact with me. They try their best to be nice, diverting 
the conversation away from cancer. Unfortunately, as I begin my treatment, I 
don’t have much else to talk about nowadays.

Coping with cancer at university showed me who my friends are

This day-to-day struggle to stay casual is not exclusive to me. My girlfriend 
and my parents have each had to deal with the constant bombardment of polite 
enquiries about me.

But while it can get annoying, I can completely appreciate that it’s hard for 
people to know how to react: it’s not like you can take a class on this stuff. 
I am certainly grateful that people care and show an interest.

I’m getting all this at a time when a future lack of independence due to my 
disease could really affect my quality of life. As a Europhile and 
international politics student, what’s keeping me positive is campaigning for 
the UK to remain in Europe. I’m more determined than ever to try to shape the 
world I live in.

Now I’m at the end of my student days I regret that the cancer has taken away 
my ability to reflect on my time at university. Ideally, when you come to an 
important juncture in your life, you’d look back and talk to your peers about 
what you had. I had a week to leave university, so I only got the opportunity 
to see all my friends together for the final time in a rushed few days - often 
at formals, when we were slightly inebriated and unfit for the deeper 
conversation I had hoped for.

At the time of writing, the severity of my treatment is unclear and will be 
for another two weeks. This isn’t what I wanted my final year at university to 
be about, but it’s put whatever student worries I had into perspective.
