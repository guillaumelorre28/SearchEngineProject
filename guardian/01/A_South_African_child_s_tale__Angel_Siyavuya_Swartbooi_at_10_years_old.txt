 every morning. They adorn the walls of Isiphiwo public primary school in 
Khayelitsha, where the 10-year-old – Siya, for short – is a pupil.

Maths is his favourite subject – “I love counting,” he says – but his real 
passion is football. “I’m a defender. I like it because it keeps me fit and I 
love running around. When I finish school, I want to play for Barcelona.”

It is a common pipe dream in a township where people have no better than a 
50:50 chance of finding work. The odds are stacked against Siya compared with 
children attending schools in the middle-class suburbs of nearby Cape Town. 
South Africa’sailing education system 
<http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Education-crisis-a-threat-to-democracy-Jansen-20121122>
 has failed to close the gap between rich and poor.

Isiphiwo primary school opened in 1995, a year after the country’s 
post-apartheid democracy was born. Siya leaves home at 6.30am, has a long walk 
to school and takes his place in classes of at least 40 pupils. He speaks Xhosa 
and has not yet learned English, the dominant language of business and politics 
inSouth Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica>.
His mother Nonzuzo, 28, says: “He’s doing fine. I think it dropped this year 
because of a new teacher. His main interest is football. He goes to practise 
every day.”

There has been a major addition to his life in the past five years. His sister 
Akhanyile was born in September 2010 at the same hospital as Siya, weighing 
3.49kg compared with his 2.9kg. Both are healthy, and she is at nursery school. 
Siya grumbles: “We fight a lot. She always picks on me.”

Nonzuzo sighs and says: “Siya was so happy when she was born. Now they fight 
all the time. They don’t get on. Even if I give them pocket money for school, I 
have to pretend I’m giving her five rand and him two rand to keep her happy!”

I don’t want to stay here for the rest of my life. I want to move to a better 
place. Gauteng. It’s cool

The family still lives amid a jumble of self-built shacks and fences accessed 
via a waterlogged dirt track off a main road in Khayelitsha. But with time, 
they have become incrementally better off. Siya’s father, Benson Ntsimango, now 
has a full-time job as a bar and restaurant chef, earning 1,200 rand ($95) a 
week. Last year, their modest home – erected by Benson on land allocated by a 
local street committee – expanded from one room of 12 sq metres to two: a 
lounge of 18 sq metres and, separated by a blue curtain, a bedroom of 9 sq 
metres.

Inside, a naked lightbulb hangs from the corrugated roof. In the lounge are 
big loudspeakers, a newish sofa (on which Siya sleeps), and a glass coffee 
table. The kitchen area has a microwave, kettle and wooden cabinets holding 
glasses. The bedroom has a large TV, a satellite decoder (costing 299 rand a 
month) and a DVD player, along with baskets of clothes on an old lino floor. 
Above a double bed is an electricity meter (power costs 150 rand a month).

But it is still bitterly cold in winter and sweltering in summer. The family 
have to use a pit toilet outside, enclosed by corrugated walls. Discarded crisp 
packets, eggshells and orange peel are littered on the surrounding grass. In 
the yard, the ground is partly covered with grimy carpets and a mattress with 
rusty springs. Clothes are pegged on a washing line and a satellite dish clings 
to a pole. A dog, called Killer, keeps a wary eye on visitors.

Burglars broke into the house in 2011 and again last year, stealing small 
items. “They do robberies during the day because everyone is at work and it’s 
so quiet,” says Nonzuzo. “Muggings happen at night near to us. It’s not a nice 
neighbourhood because of the crime … and the conditions.

“I want to move away. We can’t stay here for a long time. It’s now more than 
10 years, and I’m very worried about the children. My aim is for them to not 
grow up in that mess. I want a better home for them.”

Nonzuzo’s four sisters and brother failed the matriculation exam at school and 
are all unemployed. But she passed, and is determined not to become another 
statistic beaten down by South Africa’s structural flaws. In 2013, she quit her 
job as a casino waitress, secured a bursary and began a three-year teaching 
diploma atFalse Bay College <http://www.falsebaycollege.co.za/> in Cape Town. 
Next year she hopes to go to the University of Western Cape to study for a 
bachelor of education degree, which she intends to partly fund by waitressing.

“I want to go and study, instead of earning small money,” she says. “If I had 
continued as a waitress, I wouldn’t earn much. If you want a proper job you 
have to get educated, so I decided to get back to studying.”

Nonzuzo also dreams that Benson will put a ring on her finger some day. But 
first, as custom demands, he must raise about 20,000 rand ($1,540) to pay the
lobola, or bride price, to her 63-year-old mother (her father died last year). 
Nonzuzo is not envious ofSouth Africa’s wealthy elite 
<http://www.timeslive.co.za/businesstimes/2014/12/06/sa-s-top-10-richest-people-worth-r205-billion>
, however. “If I can do better for myself, I can be more like them. I believe 
they work hard for where they are.”

For his part, Siya would be happy to relocate to Gauteng province 
<http://www.gautengonline.gov.za/Pages/default.aspx>, the country’s economic 
engine, which includes Johannesburg. “I don’t want to stay here for the rest of 
my life,” he says. “I want to move to a better place. Gauteng. It’s cool.”
