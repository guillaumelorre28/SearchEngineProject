The Sun saw a more than 5% fall in its audience in December, despite dropping 
its paywall fully for the first time on 30 November.

 A spokesperson attributed the decline to “certain apps being turned off to 
unify the Sun online presence and the expected seasonal lull in Dream Team”. 
Much of the site’s content was also already free before the paywall was 
officially dropped, as the site began relaxing its approach to charging for 
online content last summer.

However, the Sun outperformed the rest of the UK’s national newspapers, which 
saw bigger falls during the month, according to figures from the Audit Bureau 
of Circulations. Their Christmas traffic declines followed gains made in 
November, which were partly driven by public interest in stories such as the 
Paris attacks.

theguardian.com fell from an average of more than 9 million daily unique 
browsers in November to just under 8 million, a drop of 15%, while the 
Telegraph slid to 4.1 million after losing almost 1 million unique browsers, 
equivalent to almost 20% of its audience.

All the other national newspapers saw double-digit declines, except Mail 
Online, which lost just under 10% of its audience to drop back to just over 13 
million unique browsers, and dailystar.co.uk, which lost 8.8% of its unique 
browsers to come in at just under 600,000 a day.
