Carl Perkins was already scheduled to be recording in Sun Studios in Memphis 
on Tuesday 4 December 1956, withJerry Lee Lewis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/jerry-lee-lewis>. But it was chance that 
brought Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash along. When the four started playing 
together, studio engineer "Cowboy" Jack Clement set the tapes rolling and the 
next day a photo of the four, described as the Million Dollar Quartet, was in 
the local paper. The music they recorded was of little worth; the myth they 
spawned was rather more.
