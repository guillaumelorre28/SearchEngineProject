Unfortunately the bonfires being stacked up this weekend make cosy nesting 
sites for hedgehogs, so it is worth checking for them before the fires are lit. 
Numbers of British hedgehogs are estimated to have decreased by 25% over 10 
years.

Many British rivers are now seeing a frenzy of activity. Atlantic salmon are 
returning from the ocean and swimming up their ancestral rivers to spawn in a 
truly remarkable natural phenomenon. As the salmon enter the rivers they go 
through profound body changes, changing from silver to a multicoloured livery 
of reds and greens, known in Scotland as "taking on the tartan". They even stop 
feeding as they battle their way upstream against the water, hurling themselves 
over waterfalls and other obstacles in spectacular leaps â€“ the record for a UK 
salmon leap is thought to be 12ft. A sudden wet spell after a dry period can 
bring some great salmon aerobatics; the best times to see them is early morning 
or evening, and the best salmon rivers are in Wales, Scotland, northern and 
south-west Scotland.

When the fish eventually reach their shallow spawning waters, the females dig 
out a large area of gravel to lay eggs in. The males fight each other for the 
right to fertilise the eggs before the females cover the eggs with gravel. And 
the bad news is that after weeks of starvation and huge exertion, most of the 
adult salmon die exhausted on the journey back to sea.
