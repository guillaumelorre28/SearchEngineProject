Philip Roth: Portnoy’s Complaint (1969) 
The man who is the repository of every socially unacceptable thought.

Improvisational chars.

Without quite knowing it, I had stumbled upon my theme – impurity. The 
impurity of the human compound.

Psychoanalysis provided its vessel for everything. Hatred, pettiness, 
aggression, nonsense, exaggeration, farce – everything allowed in, except 
decorum.

Let the repellent in!

Philip Roth: Portnoy’s Complaint (1969) 
Mark Twain: “The Jews are members of the human race. Worse than that I cannot 
say about them.”

‘To write a repellent book not so as to shock but so as to represent what is 
repellent (albeit at the local level.)

The Heshie scene. The crucial scene in the book. Because it reveals the secret 
which is not masturbation but brutality. The raw brutality of family relations. 
The raw intensity. The raw emotionality

Philip Roth: Portnoy’s Complaint (1969) 
On my rereading “Portnoy’s Complaint” at 80, I am shocked & pleased – shocked 
that I could have been so reckless,pleased that I should have been reckless.

Gillian Flynn Gone Girl (2012) 
My favorite play is, unsurprisingly, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? The town 
in Gone Girl is named Carthage in honor of the play & there are a few other 
insider nods. I wanted this scene between Nick & Amy to feel reminiscent of 
George & Martha: not the same, of course, but an echo of their marital 
gamesmanship. My toxic inspiration!

James Salter’s The Hunters (1957) 
I never liked the title. The title while I was writing the book was A Patron 
of Tokoshi’s, (being the brothel in Tokyo). That was what I saw as being his 
trace in the world.

… up with and the only thing I cherish about it is that it led to a life long 
friendship with Tony Roberts + a life long love of Diane Keaton.

Richard Ford’s The Sportswriter (1986) 
Began this book Easter Day, 1982, in Princeton, 4½ months after Mother died; 
some relentless grief needing ‘channeling’ – hence Ralph B. death & what to say 
about that. Grief being grief, whatever the source. It said ‘Write a book about 
somebody in 70s happy.’ Overcoming grief became that: happiness of a kind.

Novel took 5 years to write – autumn 1991 to autumn 1996. Title applies to a 
number of events and themes ranging from J Edgar Hoover’s presence in the 
Prologue to an underground nuclear explosion in the Epilogue, from subway 
graffiti to a (fictional) movie directed by Sergei Eisenstein (etc).

Patricia Cornwell’s Postmortem (1990) 
Things didn’t start well at first…Once upon a time I felt I’d ruined my life. 
Slammed by Richmond Times Dispatch 12-10-1989. Scarpetta described as “an often 
annoying man hater” … Banned by prominent Richmond bookstore: “Censorship 
opponent WON’T SELL Postmortem” 11-11-1989. I was uninvited from several talks 
scheduled - and I had one booksigning and NO one showed up.

David Simon’s Homicide (1991) 
*I actually thought for a NY minute that I solved this case. I had remembered 
reading about a homeless man brutally being raped in the same alley by a second 
homeless man months earlier. The second man had been arrested. Wondered aloud 
if there was a connection and if the murder victim had been pantsless, 
resisting a sexual assault. Requer got on the B.C.I. computer intrigued – but 
no. Suspect still in jail. “Nice try, Simon.”

Peter Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang (2000) 
I first saw Sidney Nolan’s “Kelly Series” in June 1963. I was 20 years old and 
this was probably the first exhibition I had ever been to. I was with two older 
men, both writers – Barry Oakley and Morris Lurie. Lurie walked around the show 
and announced “I’m afraid not, Mr Nolan.” I felt otherwise. Seeing these same 
paintings in New York (at the Met in 1994) I was impressed all over again. I 
brought American friends uptown to see the show. Talking with them about the 
paintings I was reminded of what a wonderful story it was and how – Nolan to 
one side – how little the Australians had bothered to imagine our great hero. 
From the start I knew how it should be written, in the sparsely punctuated 
voice in the Jerilderie letter.

I chose the name Ruth because it means compassion, gentleness. It was a 
statement to myself about the method of the narrative.

The cool thing about using PPT is that is it forces you to identify – and

more willing to invent my own structures and representations.

Less Than Zero Ultimately went with the title from the great Jimmy Reed song.
