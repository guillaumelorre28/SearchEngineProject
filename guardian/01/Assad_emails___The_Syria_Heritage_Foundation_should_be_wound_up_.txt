My dear Fares

I hope that you and your family are in the best of health.

I am writing to you about the situation of the Syria Heritage Foundation given 
the sustained crisis inSyria <https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>. This 
matter is of profound concern to me and to other trustees. Indeed, Lord Powell 
has written to me expressing his concern. He is of the view that there is 
nothing that the Foundation can do to pursue its aims for the foreseeable 
future. I share this assessment and have regrettably come to the conclusion 
that the Foundation cannot carry out its work so long as the current situation 
persists and for some considerable period afterwards.

Moreover, I find that, in my capacity as Chairman of the Syria Heritage 
Foundation, the media seeks comment from me, which I do not wish to give, on 
the situation in Syria and even on the whereabouts of HE the First Lady.

I have reached the conclusion that, in the circumstances, the Syria Heritage 
Foundation should be wound up, its aims and objectives being unachievable in 
the near future. I am seeking legal advice from the Foundation's lawyers on how 
best to achieve this. I am deeply upset that we have reached this point.

I will of course keep you informed of developments.

With best wishes

Wafic
