Budweiser owner AB InBev is considering selling the leading SABMiller brands 
as a pre-emptive move to satisfy EU competition regulators. The Peroni and 
Grolsch brands were expected to raise billions of pounds, according tothe 
Sunday Times 
<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/Companies/article1638763.ece>, 
which first reported the planned sale.

The mega-deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/sep/16/the-lager-market-is-about-to-get-smaller-and-blander>
 to combine the two largest players in the industry, agreed earlier this month, 
will be theeighth-largest takeover of all time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/16/ab-inbev-deal-could-unite-peroni-budweiser-under-one-roof>
 and means thatone company will supply nearly a third of the world’s beer from 
next year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/anheuser-busch-inbev-reaches-final-agreement-sab-miller-takeover>
.

The deal is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, pending 
clearance from regulators and shareholders. The takeover will allow Belgium’sAB 
InBev <https://www.theguardian.com/business/anheuser-busch>, which also makes 
Stella Artois, to tap into SABMiller’s strength in fast-growing African and 
Asian markets. But it must first satisfy competition watchdogs that it will not 
be overly dominant in the global drinks markets.

The expected sale of Grolsch and Italian lager brand Peroni follows news that 
SABMiller <https://www.theguardian.com/business/sabmiller> will sell its 58% 
stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors for £8bn, to allay competition concerns in 
the US.

London-listed SABMiller could also be forced to offload its market-leading 
Snow brand in China, where the country’s drinkers account for a quarter of 
global beer consumption.

Both SABMiller and AB InBev declined to comment on the Peroni and Grolsch 
reports.
