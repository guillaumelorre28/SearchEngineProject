Western Sydney Wanderers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/western-sydney-wanderers> coach Tony 
Popovic has been suspended for two Asian Champions League matches and fined for 
his role in an on-field altercation.

Popovic was reprimanded following the confrontation between Chinese side 
Guangzhou Evergrande and the Wanderers during their ACL quarter-final first leg 
at Pirtek Stadium in August.

The AFC has announced on Saturday he was punished for violating the 
tournament’s code of conduct and also fined $US2000 ($A2,160).

The altercation erupted after Guangzhou coach Marcello Lippi charged onto the 
pitch to protest two of his players, Zhang Linpeng and Goa Lin, being sent off 
in the closing stages.

It came as the AFC also confirmed Al Hilal forward Nasser Al Shamrani has been 
banned for eight ACL matches for spitting at Western Sydney’s Matthew 
Spiranovic after November’s final.


Al Shamrani was named the Asian player of the year despite the incident in the 
spiteful aftermath of the Wanderers’ ACL title win in Riyadh.

Lippi, who coached Italy to the 2006 World Cup, was also suspended for four 
ACL matches for confronting referee Mohammed Abdulla Hassan Mohamed, however he 
retired after coaching the team to their fourth successive Chinese Super League 
title.

After the match Lippi expressed remorse at running onto the field but said he 
was upset at the red-carding of two of his players. “I’m not upset about the 
match that we lost,” Lippi said at the time.

“I know I wasn’t supposed to go on the field but you also watched the match 
and the two red cards. The first one I didn’t see very clearly but the second 
one was very close to me so I saw that it was not on purpose.

“I’ve been to all the biggest competitions like World Cups, Champions League 
and I know it was wrong to go in the field.”
