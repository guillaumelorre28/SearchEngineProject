I get more questions than I can answer, and very often I don't know the answer 
-- and it would take too long to find out, compared with the number of people 
the answer is likely to help. Often these are questions about very specific 
Windows problems, likethis one from Mary Pebble 
<http://blogs.theguardian.com/askjack/2006/05/disappearing_page_breaks_in_mi.html>
. In general, I think it's better to take these to the company's user forums or 
even to Usenet (eg via Google Groups). However, I have opened a new section 
called Any Answers, where other readers can answer them, or at least suggest a 
better place to ask. Any help you can offer will be much appreciated.

PS: My apologies for the late start: I was away from Wednesday and failed in 
my good intention to set this up before I left....
