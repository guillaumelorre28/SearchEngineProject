Alexander Payne might not have started making his next film just yet but he’s 
already lining up the one that’ll come after that, according toThe Wrap 
<http://www.thewrap.com/oddlot-wins-heated-auction-for-septillion-to-one-alexander-payne-circling-to-direct-exclusive/>
.

The writer/director of Sideways <https://www.theguardian.com/film/sideways> and
Nebraska <https://www.theguardian.com/film/nebraska>is interested in directing 
a romantic comedy called Septillion to One, based on the life of Joan Ginther, 
who won the lottery four times. Her $20m (£13.4m) haul was arguably down to her 
PhD in statistics from Stanford.

The script has been described as a cross between Silver Linings Playbook and 
Ocean’s Eleven as it follows an FBI agent who is tasked with investigating 
whether Ginther’s wins were fraudulent, since the odds are one in a billion. As 
you might be able to guess, the pair fall for each other.

Payne is reportedly circling the project and hoping to put it in his schedule 
after the sci-fi comedy Downsizing which will star Matt Damon and Reese 
Witherspoon. The film is about a man who shrinks himself in order to have a 
better life. It’s yet to start production.

His last film Nebraska was nominated for six Oscars and Payne has previously 
won before for co-writing the scripts for Sideways andThe Descendants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-descendants>. 

The script for Septillion to One comes from Adam R Perlman and Graham Sack. 
Perlman has also worked on HBO’s drama The Newsroom.
