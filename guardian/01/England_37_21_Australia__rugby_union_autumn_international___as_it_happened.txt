Michael Cheika speaks: “When we bring consistency to 80 minutes we’ll be right 
up there,” says Australia’s coach. “You can’t win rugby matches playing well 
for just 40 minutes. We’re feeling pretty disappointed. We played some pretty 
good rugby in the first half, but we needed to show more mettle in the second. 
The pleasing things go to the back of your mind at a time like this.”

Asked if he thought Australia got the rub of the green from the referee, he 
says: “At times, no, but we made a lot of mistakes as well. We’ve got to clean 
up those errors.” He finishes up by congratulating his opposite number, Eddie 
Jones.

England’s players looking pretty chuffed with life: They’re currently 
assembling for a team photo in the dressing room and their captain, Dylan 
Hartley, has said they’lll go out tonight and have a good night enjoying each 
other’s company after five weeks of hard graft. I’m guessing it won’t be a 
quiet one in front of the TV.

An email from Thomas Callaghan: “I’ve jut been monitoring the Australian 
sports siteThe Roar <http://www.theroar.com.au/>,” he says. “Crumbs! The 
whinging is breathtaking! From the comments on the site it seems that the only 
reason the Wallabies have lost this game is because of the referee! They are 
also complaining about players playing for England who were not born in 
England. Australia employs more foreign born players than any nation in all 
sports including players who have played for other countries!”

As an Irishman who has nothing but the highest of regard for the good people 
of England and Australia, I’m staying well out of this one Thomas. Suffice to 
say, our 100% record against them only came on the back of one win over them, 
so we probably only had to put up with 25% as much whinging.

Eddie Jones speaks: “We were terrible for the first 20 minutes,” he says. “I 
don’t the guys could have played any worse if they tried. I got the sense maybe 
the players were a little bit quiet and maybe nervous in the warm-up, but in 
the first 20 minutes of the second half we were excellent.”

He adds that the most satisfying thing about England’s run of success is that 
they keep getting better. He also suggests that Ben Youngs “put his hand up for 
a Lions jersey today”. He goes on to say that no player in the England team is 
irreplacable and it’s important that they remember that.

Ben Youngs speaks ...

With England’s players having collected their medals, Ben Youngs speaks to 
Sky. He says England spoke about getting a foothold in the game at half-time 
and once they’d done that, everything clicked for them. He says Eddie Jones 
didn’t lose the rag with them over a dreadful performance in the first 20 
minutes, but did point out that they couldn’t play any worse.

“What a difference a coach makes,” he writes. “England have always had the 
players but now we have a coach who knows how to win international rugby

panic; tactically astute last 20. Another step forward England

In the post match interviews: Tom Wood and Jonathan Joseph agree they started 
inexplicably poorly, but express their delight at the eventual outcome. 
Australia captain Stephen Moore looks pretty gutted and says England are a good 
team and says you don’t win as many consecutive games as they have without 
being a good team. He adds that Australia’s players will take a holiday again, 
recharge their batteries and go again next year. Asked if fatigue was a factor 
in Australia’s defeat today, his answer is short and to the point: “No.”

Full time at Twickenham: England 37-21 Australia

It’s all over: England win their 14th consecutive match and will end 2016 
unbeaten. They’ve had a fantastic time this year, winning the Six Nations Grand 
Slam, whitewashing the Aussies on Tour in the summer and adding another victory 
over them here at the end of a series of successfulAutumn internationals

England 37-21 Australia

79 min: Australia remain pinned back on their own line as England continue to 
turn the screw in the closing stages. They’re ending this match a lot more 
impressively than they started it!!! Ben Youngs has been named Old Mutual’s man 
of the match. Courtney Lawes, Jonathan Joseph and Marland Yarde also caught the 
eye.

England 37-21 Australia

78 min: A long pass out to the touchline from Ford to Johnny May and it looks 
as if the Englishman is going to add another try to England’s tally. Henry 
Speight takes him out with an excellent covering tackle in the corner.

England 35-21 Australia

74 min: Try, England! Australia win a scrum penalty and make a bit of ground, 
but remain inside their own half. But what’s this! Jonathan Joseph pounces to 
intercept a loose pass from David Pocock pass and sprints 40 metres to go over 
the line for England. It’s a second try for the England centre.
 Jonathan Joseph sprints clear after intercepting a pass from David Pocock.  
Joseph goes over for his second try of the game.  Then celebrates with fellow 
try scorer Marland Yarde.  Whilst David Pocock and his Aussie team-mates look 
dejected. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian

England 30-21 Australia

Yellow card: Dane Haylett-Petty Australia’s No14 walks for dropping his 
shoulder into Mike Brown after the ball had been released. It’s a soft yellow, 
but the World Rugby directives say he has to go. England opt not to go for the 
points, but trap the Aussies a few yards from their own line.

England 30-21 Australia

Try, Australia (Sekope Kepu)Jonathan Joseph misses a tackle Israel Folau 40 
metres from the England line and seconds later, Sekope Kepu sprints for the 
line on Australia’s 16th phase of possession. Good speed for a big front rower, 
there. Owen Farrell tried to bring him down with a tap tackle, but the prop had 
too much speed for him.
 Australia’s prop Sekope Kepu puts the burners on as he evades a tackle from 
England’s centre Owen Farrell on his way to sprinting over the line.

England today. The replacement immediately tries his luck with a drop goal 
attempt, but it’s well short.

England 30-16 Australia

61 min: It’s all England at the moment, with Australia struggling badly to 
stay in the game. The last 20 minutes is when Eddie Jones predicted his side 
would win it, but the entire second half has been a procession for them thus 
far. Australia scrum, halfway inside their own half.

58 min: More pressure on Australia’s defence as the increasingly influential

their lines, but only just.

England 27-16 Australia

54 min: England advance into Australia territory with Jonny May making ground 
after skipping through a couple of tackles. The ball goes out wide one side and 
then the other, as England inch towards the Australian line. England win a 
penalty after Kane Douglas is penalised for tackling a man without the ball, 
fail to take advantage with a drop goal attempt and Farrell has the opportunity 
to add another three points to their tally.

England 27-16 Australia

Try, England! Excellent play from Ben Youngs, who takes a quick tap penalty, 
spots a gap and darts through it, sells his opposite number Nick Phipps a dummy 
before crossing the line and touching down. Owen Farrell makes no mistake.

England 20-16 Australia

49 min: There’s a delay in play as the scrum is reset , with Australia captain 
and hooker and captain Stephen Moore getting in a heated debate with the 
referee, who appears to have a problem with the way the Wallabies are packing 
down.

England 20-16 Australia

Try, England (Yarde) A brilliant try for Marland Yarde, who darts up the right 
wing in hot pursuit of a beautifully weighted Jonathan Joseph grubber nip in 
just ahead of Israel Folau and touch the ball down. There was a hint of a 
knock-on from the England winger, but the TMO tells the referee he can award 
the try. Farrell converts from the touchline.

England 13-16 Australia

44 min: Ordered to “use it” by referee Jaco Peypar, Ben Youngs retrieves the 
ball from a ruck, darts left and sets up another rolling maul. England are 
getting closer and closer - they’re awarded a penalty but advantage is played 
to see what develops as they remain in possession.

At half-time: Sky pundit James Haskell says England are giving Australia way 
too much room out wide and conceding the gain line to them. They need to fix it 
quickly. “The ruck is everything,” adds Sir Clive Woodward, saying England need 
to be quicker and more disruptive.

Half-time: England 13-16 Australia

After a truly dreadful start, England got their act together when a rout 
looked on the cards and only trail by three points at the break. Australia have 
made plenty of mistakes of their own in a very entertaining contest that is 
finely poised and could go either way.

England 13-10 Australia

TRY, England (Joseph) Slow, ponderous play from Australia scrum-half Nick 
Phipps, who sells Sekope Kepu short with a ridiculously indecisive pass in 
midfield. The prop fumbles, the ball breaks, Owen Farrell boots it long on the 
fly and Jonathan Joseph chases in behind the Aussie defence, gathers from a 
kind bounce and touches down under the posts. Farrell converts.

England backs cut loose against Australia to complete their perfect year

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/03/england-australia-autumn-internationals-match-report> 
Michael Cheika speaks: “When we bring consistency to 80 minutes we’ll be right 
up there,” says Australia’s coach. “You can’t win rugby matches playing well 
for just 40 minutes. We’re feeling pretty disappointed. We played some pretty 
good rugby in the first half, but we needed to show more mettle in the second. 
The pleasing things go to the back of your mind at a time like this.”

Asked if he thought Australia got the rub of the green from the referee, he 
says: “At times, no, but we made a lot of mistakes as well. We’ve got to clean 
up those errors.” He finishes up by congratulating his opposite number, Eddie 
Jones.
 
England’s players looking pretty chuffed with life: They’re currently 
assembling for a team photo in the dressing room and their captain, Dylan 
Hartley, has said they’lll go out tonight and have a good night enjoying each 
other’s company after five weeks of hard graft. I’m guessing it won’t be a 
quiet one in front of the TV.
 
An email from Thomas Callaghan: “I’ve jut been monitoring the Australian 
sports siteThe Roar <http://www.theroar.com.au/>,” he says. “Crumbs! The 
whinging is breathtaking! From the comments on the site it seems that the only 
reason the Wallabies have lost this game is because of the referee! They are 
also complaining about players playing for England who were not born in 
England. Australia employs more foreign born players than any nation in all 
sports including players who have played for other countries!”

As an Irishman who has nothing but the highest of regard for the good people 
of England and Australia, I’m staying well out of this one Thomas. Suffice to 
say, our 100% record against them only came on the back of one win over them, 
so we probably only had to put up with 25% as much whinging.
 
Eddie Jones speaks: “We were terrible for the first 20 minutes,” he says. “I 
don’t the guys could have played any worse if they tried. I got the sense maybe 
the players were a little bit quiet and maybe nervous in the warm-up, but in 
the first 20 minutes of the second half we were excellent.”

He adds that the most satisfying thing about England’s run of success is that 
they keep getting better. He also suggests that Ben Youngs “put his hand up for 
a Lions jersey today”. He goes on to say that no player in the England team is 
irreplacable and it’s important that they remember that.
 
With England’s players having collected their medals, Ben Youngs speaks to 
Sky. He says England spoke about getting a foothold in the game at half-time 
and once they’d done that, everything clicked for them. He says Eddie Jones 
didn’t lose the rag with them over a dreadful performance in the first 20 
minutes, but did point out that they couldn’t play any worse.

“What a difference a coach makes,” he writes. “England have always had the 
players but now we have a coach who knows how to win international rugby 
matches.”

In the post match interviews: Tom Wood and Jonathan Joseph agree they started 
inexplicably poorly, but express their delight at the eventual outcome. 
Australia captain Stephen Moore looks pretty gutted and says England are a good 
team and says you don’t win as many consecutive games as they have without 
being a good team. He adds that Australia’s players will take a holiday again, 
recharge their batteries and go again next year. Asked if fatigue was a factor 
in Australia’s defeat today, his answer is short and to the point: “No.”
 
It’s all over: England win their 14th consecutive match and will end 2016 
unbeaten. They’ve had a fantastic time this year, winning the Six Nations Grand 
Slam, whitewashing the Aussies on Tour in the summer and adding another victory 
over them here at the end of a series of successfulAutumn internationals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/autumn-internationals>.
 
80 min: The clock ticks into the red as England scrum down five metres from 
Australia’s line.
 
79 min: Australia remain pinned back on their own line as England continue to 
turn the screw in the closing stages. They’re ending this match a lot more 
impressively than they started it!!! Ben Youngs has been named Old Mutual’s man 
of the match. Courtney Lawes, Jonathan Joseph and Marland Yarde also caught the 
eye.
 
78 min: A long pass out to the touchline from Ford to Johnny May and it looks 
as if the Englishman is going to add another try to England’s tally. Henry 
Speight takes him out with an excellent covering tackle in the corner.
 
75 min: George Ford kicks the conversion. 
 
74 min: Try, England! Australia win a scrum penalty and make a bit of ground, 
but remain inside their own half. But what’s this! Jonathan Joseph pounces to 
intercept a loose pass from David Pocock pass and sprints 40 metres to go over 
the line for England. It’s a second try for the England centre.

Yellow card: Dane Haylett-Petty Australia’s No14 walks for dropping his 
shoulder into Mike Brown after the ball had been released. It’s a soft yellow, 
but the World Rugby directives say he has to go. England opt not to go for the 
points, but trap the Aussies a few yards from their own line.
 
71 min: There’s a delay as the TMO tries to decide if Haylett-Petty’s tackle 
was late. He’s going to go in the bin for that.
 
70 min: England win another penalty but advantage is played after excellent 
work by the substitute Ben Te’o. He makes ground through the middle and isn’t 
released Dane Haylett-Petty.
 
69 min: George Ford misses with a penalty after Owen Farrell goes off. Dan 
Cole joins him on the bench and the duo are replaced by Kyle Sinkler and Ben 
Te’o. Australia ring more changes as well: Quade Cooper, Henry Speight and Nick 
Frisby all come on.
 
68 min: Bernard Foley misses the conversion after that try. 
 
Try, Australia (Sekope Kepu)Jonathan Joseph misses a tackle Israel Folau 40 
metres from the England line and seconds later, Sekope Kepu sprints for the 
line on Australia’s 16th phase of possession. Good speed for a big front rower, 
there. Owen Farrell tried to bring him down with a tap tackle, but the prop had 
too much speed for him.

64 min: Danny Care comes on for Ben Youngs, who has been outstanding for 
England today. The replacement immediately tries his luck with a drop goal 
attempt, but it’s well short.
 
62 min: Dean Mumm comes on for Australia, replacing Kane Douglas in the second 
row. George Ford makes more ground England, kicking long to force Australia 
back into their own half.
 
61 min: It’s all England at the moment, with Australia struggling badly to 
stay in the game. The last 20 minutes is when Eddie Jones predicted his side 
would win it, but the entire second half has been a procession for them thus 
far. Australia scrum, halfway inside their own half.
 
60 min: England front-rowers Mako Vunipola and Dylan Hartley make way for Joe 
Marner and Jamie George.
 
58 min: More pressure on Australia’s defence as the increasingly influential 
Ben Youngs kicks long for Marland Yarde to chase to the corner. Australia clear 
their lines, but only just.
 
Penalty, England. Owen Farrell makes it 30 points for England, who now lead by 
14 points. Australia make a change, replacing prop Scott Sio with Tom Robertson.

54 min: England advance into Australia territory with Jonny May making ground 
after skipping through a couple of tackles. The ball goes out wide one side and 
then the other, as England inch towards the Australian line. England win a 
penalty after Kane Douglas is penalised for tackling a man without the ball, 
fail to take advantage with a drop goal attempt and Farrell has the opportunity 
to add another three points to their tally.
 
52 min: Reece Hodge knocks on while Australia try to make yards into England 
territory. Scrum for England just inside their own half.
 
Try, England! Excellent play from Ben Youngs, who takes a quick tap penalty, 
spots a gap and darts through it, sells his opposite number Nick Phipps a dummy 
before crossing the line and touching down. Owen Farrell makes no mistake.

49 min: There’s a delay in play as the scrum is reset , with Australia captain 
and hooker and captain Stephen Moore getting in a heated debate with the 
referee, who appears to have a problem with the way the Wallabies are packing 
down.
 
47 min: Scrum England just inside the Australia 22 after the referee misses a 
forward pass from Ben Youngs. On the sideline, England are warming up their 
bench.
 
Try, England (Yarde) A brilliant try for Marland Yarde, who darts up the right 
wing in hot pursuit of a beautifully weighted Jonathan Joseph grubber nip in 
just ahead of Israel Folau and touch the ball down. There was a hint of a 
knock-on from the England winger, but the TMO tells the referee he can award 
the try. Farrell converts from the touchline.

44 min: Ordered to “use it” by referee Jaco Peypar, Ben Youngs retrieves the 
ball from a ruck, darts left and sets up another rolling maul. England are 
getting closer and closer - they’re awarded a penalty but advantage is played 
to see what develops as they remain in possession.
 
42 min: England scrum on the halfway line. Scott Sio is penalised for 
collapsing and Owen Farrell kicks for touch to take England to the Australian 
22.
 
41 min: England get the second half of their final game of the year started. 
Ford takes the kick-off and Australian second row Rob Simmons takes the catch. 
Australia win the lineout and get a maul going. England turn it over.
 
At half-time: Sky pundit James Haskell says England are giving Australia way 
too much room out wide and conceding the gain line to them. They need to fix it 
quickly. “The ruck is everything,” adds Sir Clive Woodward, saying England need 
to be quicker and more disruptive.
 
After a truly dreadful start, England got their act together when a rout 
looked on the cards and only trail by three points at the break. Australia have 
made plenty of mistakes of their own in a very entertaining contest that is 
finely poised and could go either way.
 
Penalty, Australia (Foley) Australia win a penalty in front of the posts as an 
Englishman fails to roll away in the tackle. Foley steps up to give his team a 
half-time lead.
 
37 min: Australia attack with Dane Haylett-Petty breaking through two tackles 
before kicking over the top to chase himself. Australia get a lineout deep in 
the England half. England are missing too many first tackles when Australia are 
in possession.
 
Penalty, Australia (Foley): It’s all square at Twickenham. Australia regroup 
and launch another onslaught on the England line. There’s several missed 
tackles by vassorted England players, before Tom Wood is penalised for a high 
tackle. Bernard Foley does the honours.
 
TRY, England (Joseph) Slow, ponderous play from Australia scrum-half Nick 
Phipps, who sells Sekope Kepu short with a ridiculously indecisive pass in 
midfield. The prop fumbles, the ball breaks, Owen Farrell boots it long on the 
fly and Jonathan Joseph chases in behind the Aussie defence, gathers from a 
kind bounce and touches down under the posts. Farrell converts.
