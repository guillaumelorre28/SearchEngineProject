Mike Pearce's success in winning a refund of his mother's Â£50,000 care fees 
should provide welcome relief for carers struggling to meet the costs of 
looking after relatives with advanced dementia. But to qualify, their condition 
must be severe. Hundreds of thousands who need day-to-day help, but not actual 
nursing, will still have to meet much, if not all, of their costs themselves.

The rising number of elderly people and the fact that many spend the last 10 
years of their life in poor health means that unless we pay substantially more 
in taxes to cover the care needed, the situation can only get worse. The 
elderly will have to draw more on the equity in their homes to pay for this 
care. Families may resent that they will not benefit from such large 
inheritances as a result, but ultimately this is what savings built up during a 
lifetime should be used for.

I laughed when TalkTalk said it had 'changed broadband in Britain forever', 
but in a way it's right. Before, you paid for service and actually got it. Now 
you don't pay and don't get it, not without a long struggle anyway. I've used 
Eclipse for a couple of years - the technical backup is excellent, speed is 
good, and when the company suggested upgrading me to a faster service for the 
same cost, the switch was seamless. When it comes to broadband, the adage 'You 
get what you pay for' is true.
