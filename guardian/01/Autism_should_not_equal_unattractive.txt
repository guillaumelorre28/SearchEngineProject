Clive James tells us that “any male hetero viewer [would] think twice about 
angling for a lift” from Saga Norén (the character in The Bridge) because she 
has what he terms “a case of near autistic something-or-other” (Weekend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/06/clive-james-adventures-box-sets-west-wing-weeds>
, 6 August). On the next page Carrie Mathison, the character in Homeland, is 
described as bipolar and beautiful. So there we have it: one condition 
(autistic spectrum disorder) makes a character unattractive, the other (bipolar 
disorder) does not.

As someone diagnosed with Asperger syndrome I am only too aware that autism is 
still treated with mockery and contempt. This is the last acceptable form of 
prejudice. I am disappointed, however, thatClive James 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/clive-james>, an author I have admired for 
most of my life, should display this form of prejudice so casually.
