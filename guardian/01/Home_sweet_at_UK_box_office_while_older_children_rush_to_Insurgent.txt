The winner


Most kids don’t break up for the Easter holiday until this Friday, yet 
DreamWorks Animation and distribution partner Fox have already grossed a tidy 
sum fromHome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/19/home-review-rihanna-kids-animation>
, a road-trip comedy featuring a teenage girl (voiced by Rihanna) and a cute 
alien (Jim Parsons). It took £3.41m at the weekend; previews from the previous 
Saturday and Sunday bring takings to a robust £6.26m.

This is the biggest opening for an animated film since The Lego Movie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/the-lego-movie-review> kicked off 
with £8.05m, including previews of £2.16m, in February 2014. DreamWorks 
Animation’sPenguins of Madagascar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/04/penguins-of-madagascar-review>, 
began with £1.58m in December. A suitable comparison for Home isThe Croods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/21/the-croods-review>, which debuted 
with £5.37m including previews of £1.85m in March 2013. The Croods went on to 
rake in £26.9m.

 The Divergent Series: Insurgent - video review 
In the US, Insurgent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/divergent-series-insurgent> is very slightly 
down on the opening of its predecessorDivergent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/03/divergent-review-young-adult>. In 
the UK, and in many international territories, it’s a different story. 
Divergent debuted in April 2014 with £1.76m; Insurgent is 44% ahead of that, 
with an opening of £2.55m, plus previews of £385,000. Divergent maxed out at 
£6.7m in the UK. With £2.94m already achieved, and the holiday to come, 
Insurgent looks likely to sail past that figure.


The results are not surprising. The second films in the Hunger Games 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hunger-games> and Twilight 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/twilight> series saw big increases on their 
predecessors in the UK, as more people caught on to the books in the 
intervening periods. It probably helped that many of Insurgent’s young cast 
members – notably Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort inThe Fault in Our Stars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/19/fault-in-our-stars-review-john-green>
 and Miles Teller inWhiplash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/whiplash-review> – saw their 
profiles rise after Divergent.

A pair of action flops

 Ray Winstone and Mark Rylance on The Gunman - video interview 
If Sean Penn has been looking with envy at the late-flourishing action career 
ofLiam Neeson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/feb/26/liam-neeson-taken-3-sean-penn-the-gunman>
, then his attempt to emulate it has fallen at the first hurdle.The Gunman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-gunman>, from Taken 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/taken> director Pierre Morel, debuted with 
£406,000 from 400 cinemas, yielding a weak average of £1,015. In comparison, 
Taken kicked off with nearly triple that amount – £1.17m – despite average 
tickets prices being 23% lower in 2008.


But The Gunman’s performance looks positively kickass compared with that of 
Jason Statham’s latest actioner,Wild Card 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/wild-card>, which began with a dismal 
£152,000 from 229 cinemas, and a £664 average. It’s fair to say that 
distributor Lionsgate didn’t push Wild Card as aggressively as might have been 
the case. Increasingly, Statham is looking less than a safe bet, except when 
he’s in franchises bolstered by significant co-star talent (The Expendables 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-expendables>, Fast & Furious). Statham’s 
previous film outside these hit series wasHomefront 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/05/homefront-review> (co-starring 
James Franco), which debuted with a weak £440,000 from 295 cinemas in December 
2013. Before that, he hadHummingbird 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/27/hummingbird-review>, which limped 
out of the gate with £207,000 from 262 venues.

 Xavier Dolan on Mommy: ‘I know very few good parents’ - video interview 
Since the beginning of the year, when the awards season began in earnest, 
significant foreign language films have been in short supply. Who would release 
a promising foreign language title, only to see it crushed by The Theory of 
Everything, Birdman and Whiplash? Now, as the awards titles release their hold 
on independent cinemas, welcome alternatives are beginning to emerge. The 
excellent Argentine pictureWild Tales 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/17/cannes-2014-wild-tales-review-argentinian-portmanteau-movie-is-a-box-of-delights>
, which arrives this week, has already clocked up decent numbers in previews; 
andMommy <https://www.theguardian.com/film/mommy>, the fifth feature from 
prolific French-Canadian enfant terrible Xavier Dolan, debuted last weekend 
with a decent £36,000 from 24 sites. Preview takings pushed the overall tally 
to just below £60,000.

For context, Dolan’s previous biggest UK hit, Heartbeats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/26/heartbeats-review>, managed 
£30,500 over the course of its lifetime. Mommy has nearly doubled that number 
already. Mommy premiered at Cannes last year, sharing the jury prize with 
Jean-Luc Godard’sGoodbye to Language 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/21/jean-luc-godard-goodbye-to-language-cannes-review>
. Mommy enjoys a very high IMDb user rating of 8.3/10. ButStill Alice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/still-alice> remains the top attraction for 
independent cinema fans, and has now reached a robust £1.70m after 17 days.

The Voices <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-voices>, from Persepolis 
director Marjane Satrapi, and starring Ryan Reynolds, Gemma Arterton and Anna 
Kendrick, enjoys a rather uncertain positioning between mainstream and 
arthouse. Box-office is a lukewarm £118,000 from 117 cinemas, yielding a £1,011 
average.

The official box-office chart shows takings a healthy 89% up on the previous 
weekend, and 78% up on last year, when a weak field of new releases sawThe 
Grand Budapest Hotel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/06/the-grand-budapest-hotel-wes-anderson-review>
 rise to the top of the chart in its third week. These percentages are skewed 
by the addition of Home’s previews in the current session’s figures, but, even 
so, the market is healthily up on a year ago.

The news for cinemas continues to improve with the arrival on 27 March of 
Cinderella <https://www.theguardian.com/film/cinderella> – already a 
significant hit in other territories. It’s joined byThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge 
Out of Water 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-spongebob-movie-sponge-out-of-water>, 
which played previews at the weekend (not mentioned in the official chart 
below). Also in the mix: comedyGet Hard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/17/get-hard-review-will-ferrell-adds-to-slew-of-gay-panic-comedies>
, starring Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart; long-delayed fantasy actionerThe 
Seventh Son <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156213/seventh-son>; indie 
sci-fiThe Signal <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2910814/>; and British sci-fi 
family filmRobot Overlords <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohOWfjYcafw>. Among
