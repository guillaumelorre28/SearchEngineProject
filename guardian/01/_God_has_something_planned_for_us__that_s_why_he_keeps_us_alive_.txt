Yesaya looks frail as he descends the few stairs from his house. One of the 
fundamental messages in HIV education is to eat nutritious foods: not easy for 
the many exceptionally poor people in Malawi.

Yesaya's stature within his community couldn't be more different from his 
physical appearance. He is chair of the village committee and a counsellor too. 
"I am building a counselling shelter at my house," he says, "so that people 
have somewhere to come to speak to me."

He makes no secret of the fact that he is HIV positive, yet he remains the 
figurehead of this community. The stigma and discrimination that existed 10 
years ago have disappeared.

In a clearing at the far end of the village, stands a church that is almost 
complete. A little further on, are the foundations of a small structure. Its 
unfinished walls are deep red, made by hand from the clay soil that dominates 
the rural landscape.

Yesaya was given the land by the pastor of the church as a place for his 
community support group to meet. "We borrow chairs from the church to meet here 
every Friday," Yesaya says. "Our faith is an indispensable part of living with 
HIV. It is what gives us hope.

"God has something planned for us," he muses, looking up into the blazing sun, 
"that's why he keeps us alive."
