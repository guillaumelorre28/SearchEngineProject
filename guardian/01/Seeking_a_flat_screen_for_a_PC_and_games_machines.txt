I am looking to buy a new flat screen monitor and with a screen size of 
ideally 20 inches. I primarily use my PC for work (data analysis and report 
writing) however I also watch movies off it. Inaddition, I would like a monitor 
that has an input for a games machine such as an Xbox 360 or PS3. Any 
suggestions? Jack Gowan
