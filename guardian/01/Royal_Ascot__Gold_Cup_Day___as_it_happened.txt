That's your lot for today ...

 Order of St George won the day’s feature, finding plenty to triumph over 
hitherto uncharted waters in a rollocking Gold Cup under Ryan Moore, who 
overcame traffic problems to give trainer Aidan O’Brien his seventh win in the 
race.

Less than an hour previously, Moore and O’Brien had teamed up to win the 
Ribblesdale Stakes with Even Song, notching up a half-centurty ofRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> winners for the Master of 
Ballydoyle. It is a remarkable feat the 46-year-old has achieved in less than 
20 years as a trainer.

 Prince Of Lir, trained by Robert Cowell and ridden by Luke Morris, got the 
afternoon’s proceedings under way with victory in the Norfolk Stakes, before 
Godolphin secured their fourth winner of the meeting when William Buick and 
Hawkbill won the Tercentenary Stakes for trainer Charlie Appleby.

 Jamie Spencer got off the mark for this Royal meeting when he won the 
Britannia Stakes for trainer Jamie Osbourne after getting the leg-up on 
favourite Defrocked, while the final race of the day, the King George V Stakes, 
went to Primitivo and William Twiston-Davies, riding for Alan King.

King George V (5.35)

Primitivo wins, but there’s bad news for the royal connections of Guy Fawkes, 
the Queen’s horse which suffered a bad fall in the early stages of the race. It 
looks like he’s suffered a fatal injury.

King George V (5.35) 1m 4f

They’re away and running in the final race of the day and royal runner Guy 
Fawkes has fallen. Jockey Pat Smullen is back on his feet, but it doesn’t look 
great for the horse ... Navajo War Dance leads them into the home turn, with 
Juste Pour Nous upsides him ... Primitivo leads them into the final furlong ... 
he wins it for trainer Alan King and jockey William Twiston-Davies. Primitivo 
wins the King George V Stakes.

King George V (5.35) preview

A mile and a half handicap for three-year-olds, this race features one of the 
oddities of this Royal meeting, a horse owned by The Queen who has been named 
after a terrorist plotter. Guy Fawkes (a son of Big Bad Bob) ran a really 
pleasing trial at Redcar but might not want any further rainfall today.

Godolphin, Charlie Appleby and William Buick were the team that bagged this 
prize last year and they have the favourite this time, Lovell, who got going 
too late on his reappearance and could only get second but has scope to do 
better over this extra distance and looks well handicapped.

Shraaoh (Sir Michael Stoute) has a bit to prove after winning just a maiden, a 
point that also applies to Point Of View. Primitivo, the winner of his last 
three, is much more experienced, getting better each time and versatile as to 
ground.

Defrocked wins the Britannia under Jamie Spencer for trainer Jamie Osbourne! 
Abe Lincoln was second. Defrocked was lucky there; he hung very badly in the

Britannia Stakes (5.00) 1m

The field sets off without Perkunas, who spread a plate down at the start and 
was withdrawn by connections. There are 28 left and Carrington was slowest away 
... the field splits into two groups as Arcanada leads the near side group, 
while Out And About and Folkswood ... Defrocked hangs badly as Abe Lincoln 
comes through the centre ... it’s Abe Lincoln and Defrocked in a photo ...

Order Of St George hoses up in Gold Cup

Order Of St George ran out an easy winner of the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. The youngster sprang to 
prominence when winning the Irish St Leger by 11 lengths last season but had 
only been seen once since then against inferior opponents.

Punters who had backed him into 10-11 favourite would have been panicking with 
half a mile to run, as Ryan Moore had nowhere to go when stuck in the pack. 
French raider Mille Et Mille was allowed to set his own pace in front and at 
one stage was nearly 10 lengths clear before slowing down and kicking clear 
again.

Moore had to bide his time until finding a gap in the straight and as soon as 
the four-year-old was in the clear he stamped his authority on the contest. 
Luca Cumani’s Mizzou gave chase in vain up the rail to finish second, while 
Sheikhzayedroad eventually got in the clear to claim third.

In winning a seventh Gold Cup, Aidan O’Brien once again proved he has no peers 
in training the stayers. “He’s a class horse and class horses win races,” said 
Aidan O’Brien. “He picked up very well and after two and a half miles, he was 
pouring it on at the end.PA Sport

Britannia Handicap (5.00) preview

Chris Cook

Like yesterday’s Hunt Cup cavalry charge over a mile, but restricted to 
three-year-olds. Garcia has, for me, the strongest form after his powerful 
finish at Haydock but it looks as though he may be drawn on the wrong side.

Out And About, another Haydock winner, has a better berth towards the far side 
and should improve for the extra distance. Oh This Is Us, also drawn in single 
figures, is proven at a mile, though not on soft ground. Manson is also 
vulnerable on soft, though his power-packed finish at Sandown last time makes 
him easy to like.

Chris Cook has been in touch ...

Chris Cook

He has this to say about Olivier Peslier’s ride in the Ribblesdale: “I 
appreciate I’m a bit one-eyed on this, having tipped Queen’s Trust, but what a 
poor ride that was from Olivier Peslier,” he says. “OK, she didn’t break well, 
but he stuck her out the back of a big field and widest of all to boot and then 
stayed there long after it should have been clear that the pace was not strong. 
He didn’t make a move until the turn for home, at which point it was far too 
late. Of course, in a special act of cruelty, she then scythed through the 
field when it was just too late to reach a place. Ugh.”

Mille Et Mille is really putting the hammer down with a punishing gallop, but 
comes back to the field as Max Dymnamite makes ground as they approach the 
final half-mile. The field is well bunched, with Mille Et Mille still in front 
... Mille Et Mille from Flying Officer ... here comes Order Of St George ... 
Order Of St George win by three lengths from Mizzou. Order Of St George wins a 
punishing Gold Cup for Ryan Moore and Aidan O’Brien.

The Gold Cup (4.20) 2m 4f

Pallasator, a notoriously leery bugger when it comes to travelling down to the 
start and entering the stalls, has got down to the start, with Oisin Murphy 
giving him a tender ride with his feet out of the irons. In the parade ring, 
his trainer Sir Mark Prescott gives the horse’s stable lass all the credit, 
saying she’s found a way to get into her charge’s head. They’re loading the

Even Song calls the tune in Ribblesdale

Even Song justified heavy market support to give Aidan O’Brien his first ever 
winner of the Ribblesdale Stakes and in the process provide the master of 
Ballydoyle with his 50thRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> success.

Sent off the 15-8 favourite, Even Song was not too far behind a steady gallop 
set by Ted Durcan on Shall We. Oaks runner-up Architecture ran keen from a wide 
draw under Frankie Dettori and gave herself little chance of going one better.

Roger Varian’s maiden Ajman Princess had the perfect trip through on the rail 
and showed a determined attitude, keeping on gamely but she had no answer to 
Even Song’s turn of foot.
Everything opened up in front of Ryan Moore and she soon put the race to bed 
when asked a question.

Even Song powered a length and a half clear of Ajman Princess, with The Black 
Princess holding off the fast-finishing Queen’s Trust for third. Moore said: 
“She had a good turn of foot. We did go slow, but she relaxed well and was in 
tight quarters before we got a gap.
“She’s a very good filly. Architecture had a rough trip backing up from the 
Oaks,” said Moore. “This filly, we thought it was a good spot for her and Aidan 
has trained her with this mind. Let’s hope he gets to 100 - that would be more 
special.”

Gold Cup (4.20) preview

Order Of St George is the big, young talent here and comes from the Aidan 
O’Brien stable that has won this race six times in the past 10 years with three 
different horses. But things could go wrong for him if, as expected, he is held 
up towards the rear for this first attempt at two and a half miles. Ryan Moore, 
who left his challenge too late on The Gurkha on Tuesday, could find himself 
trying to thread amongst a dozen rivals when it’s time to make his challenge 
here.

A case can be made for a few of the others, especially as their odds are 
inflated by the market love for the favourite. Max Dynamite only needs to be 
forgiven his reappearance flop, when he surely needed the run. On his form from 
the second half of last year, he’s got a great shot. Mizzou has won two good 
races here and might have matured enough to improve on last year’s seventh. 
Flying Officer looks a very solid option, though this could be a bit far for 
him if they go a good gallop. Clever Cookie will have his chance, though the 
suspicion remains that he’s not quite good enough.

he gets 100 up.” No51 could come within the hour, as the pair team up on the

Hawkbill flies home in Tercentenary

Hawkbill had too much pace for Prize Money to give Godolphin a one-two in the 
Tercentenary Stakes atRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. Having enjoyed a a treble on 
Wednesday Sheikh Mohammed left Ascot a happy man but none of those winners were 
trained by his main Newmarket men.

This time the race was dominated by Charlie Appleby and Saeed bin Suroor, with 
Appleby’s more experienced Hawkbill coming out on top under William Buick. Race 
Day, another Godolphin runner, set off at a tremendous gallop, with Prize Money 
keen in second and Hawkbill in third.

Nothing else got into it as with two furlongs left to run the pacemaker 
dropped away and Hawkbill (11-2) quickened past Prize Money to win his fifth 
race in a row. Aidan O’Brien’s Long Island Sound stayed on from the rear to 
claim third but there were only ever two horses in it.

“We always knew he was a nice horse, and it was a great ride by William 
Buick,” said Appleby. “Both myself and Saeed needed pace and Marin Lane did a 
fantastic job on the pacemaker. William was confident and he is a horse we feel 
will get a mile and a half. I said the best way to ride him was to ride him 
like the best horse in the race.

“Turning for home, I know they were travelling well in behind, but he was 
travelling supremely well and he galloped all the way to the line, which he 
showed he can do at Newmarket.”PA Sport

Guardian fashion correspondent Imogen Fox writes

Can we talk about Sophie Wessex’s hat for a minute between races? Yesterday 
the royals atAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> tried hard to out 
do each other with the hats which all seemed to be referencing some food theme 
-Kate (Middleton/Cambridge/Whatever) wore a pringle crisp in hat form. But 
today Wessex has opted for a Georgia O’ Keeffe flower reference. (I mean I took 
the higher cultural ground there and it could have gone either way).

Her skirt is a nod to Christian Dior’s New Look which suggests she’s read some 
sort of A-Z of fashion, but it is her shoes which are really interesting. 
Hidden platform buttermilk court shoes are practically standard issue for the 
royal family these days thanks to Princess Kate. So I reckon that the 
subliminal messaging with this outfit is that yesterday’s Cambridge appearance 
was merely a blip and that it is Wessex whoactually owns royal enclosure chic.

Meanwhile we have an unexpected sartorial move from the Queen. But then she’s 
come over all brave new wardrobe (the neon) since her 90th. She’s usually all 
over the mono-toning but today she’s experimented with this complicated dual 
blue/orange thing. The fashion desk’s best guess if that she is, in the absence 
of actual summer time at Ascot, channeling a summer sky. Which is kind of noble 
and in the-service-of-one’s-country-ish of her, but also completely futile.
 Sophie Countess of Wessex (right) has eschewed the Pringle crisp hat of 
yesterday in favour of a Georgia O’Keefe flower reference for Ladies’ Day.

Ribblesdale Stakes (3.40) preview

Chris Cook

Architecture is the obvious one, having run second in the Oaks a fortnight 
ago, when only the astonishing Minding was good enough to catch her. But that 
was a tough race on a taxing surface and we saw with A Shin Hikari yesterday 
that horses are not always able to run two good races on soft in quick 
succession.

Aidan O’Brien fields Even Song, who was a bit unlucky in running when third in 
a Listed race last month but still has a bit to prove at this level. Newmarket 
appears to be bursting with promising young fillies, since John Gosden fields a 
couple, of which Sovereign Parade is the most interesting, while Sir Michael 
Stoute sends Queen’s Trust, who promises to relish this step up in distance.

Prince among men (and one filly) in Norfolk Stakes

Prince Of Lir gave Luke Morris a first Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> victory in the Norfolk Stakes. 
Winner of his only start at Beverley prior to this race, trainer Robert Cowell 
had voiced concerns about his ability to handle the soft ground.

In beating Mark Johnston’s The Last Lion, the Brocklesby winner from 
Doncaster, he confirmed the form from their previous meeting 19 days ago in the 
Brian Yeardley Trophy in winning by half a length.

The favourite Global Applause appeared to have everything covered at halfway, 
but Frankie Dettori chose to go to the previously-favoured far side whereas the 
race unfolded in the centre of the track.

The Last Lion briefly went clear but Silver Line and Peace Envoy came with a 
chance, only to be put in their place by the 8-1 winner. It was a third Royal
Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> win for Cowell, who had won two 
runnings of the King’s Stand through Prohibit and Goldream.

“It’s a great buzz,” said Morris. “It’s what you work hard for. He’s only had 
one run and he’s just a bit inexperienced but he’s a very talented horse. He 
put the race to bed nicely.”
Cowell added: “He’s a pocket rocket. He’s not very big but he’s very well 
formed and mature. He’s shown a lovely attitude. I’m delighted for the Swanns 
and family because they paid a lot of money for him and he’s repaid their 
faith.”PA Sport.

Tercentenary Stakes (3.05) preview

Chris Cook

Kieren Fallon has a live chance of Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> glory at the age of 51, having 
got the leg-up on Blue De Vega. This Irish raider was a fair third in the Irish 
Guineas, four lengths behind Galileo Gold who won a Group One here on Tuesday, 
and the extra quarter-mile here should help.

Abdon comes from the Sir Michael Stoute yard and may be able to improve on his 
reappearance second, just the second start of his career, when he would have 
preferred a stronger pace. Godolphin’s Prize Money was also outpaced at the end 
of a slow-run race last time and can do better. He’s bred to be better on this 
wetter surface. In the same ownership, Hawkbill is on a winning run of four and 
beat Abdon last time but could do with drying conditions.

 Order of St George won the day’s feature, finding plenty to triumph over 
hitherto uncharted waters in a rollocking Gold Cup under Ryan Moore, who 
overcame traffic problems to give trainer Aidan O’Brien his seventh win in the 
race.

Less than an hour previously, Moore and O’Brien had teamed up to win the 
Ribblesdale Stakes with Even Song, notching up a half-centurty ofRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> winners for the Master of 
Ballydoyle. It is a remarkable feat the 46-year-old has achieved in less than 
20 years as a trainer.

 Prince Of Lir, trained by Robert Cowell and ridden by Luke Morris, got the 
afternoon’s proceedings under way with victory in the Norfolk Stakes, before 
Godolphin secured their fourth winner of the meeting when William Buick and 
Hawkbill won the Tercentenary Stakes for trainer Charlie Appleby.

 Jamie Spencer got off the mark for this Royal meeting when he won the 
Britannia Stakes for trainer Jamie Osbourne after getting the leg-up on 
favourite Defrocked, while the final race of the day, the King George V Stakes, 
went to Primitivo and William Twiston-Davies, riding for Alan King.

A mile and a half handicap for three-year-olds, this race features one of the 
oddities of this Royal meeting, a horse owned by The Queen who has been named 
after a terrorist plotter. Guy Fawkes (a son of Big Bad Bob) ran a really 
pleasing trial at Redcar but might not want any further rainfall today.

Godolphin, Charlie Appleby and William Buick were the team that bagged this 
prize last year and they have the favourite this time, Lovell, who got going 
too late on his reappearance and could only get second but has scope to do 
better over this extra distance and looks well handicapped.

Shraaoh (Sir Michael Stoute) has a bit to prove after winning just a maiden, a 
point that also applies to Point Of View. Primitivo, the winner of his last 
three, is much more experienced, getting better each time and versatile as to 
ground.

Order Of St George ran out an easy winner of the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. The youngster sprang to 
prominence when winning the Irish St Leger by 11 lengths last season but had 
only been seen once since then against inferior opponents.

Punters who had backed him into 10-11 favourite would have been panicking with 
half a mile to run, as Ryan Moore had nowhere to go when stuck in the pack. 
French raider Mille Et Mille was allowed to set his own pace in front and at 
one stage was nearly 10 lengths clear before slowing down and kicking clear 
again.

Moore had to bide his time until finding a gap in the straight and as soon as 
the four-year-old was in the clear he stamped his authority on the contest. 
Luca Cumani’s Mizzou gave chase in vain up the rail to finish second, while 
Sheikhzayedroad eventually got in the clear to claim third.

In winning a seventh Gold Cup, Aidan O’Brien once again proved he has no peers 
in training the stayers. “He’s a class horse and class horses win races,” said 
Aidan O’Brien. “He picked up very well and after two and a half miles, he was 
pouring it on at the end.PA Sport

Like yesterday’s Hunt Cup cavalry charge over a mile, but restricted to 
three-year-olds. Garcia has, for me, the strongest form after his powerful 
finish at Haydock but it looks as though he may be drawn on the wrong side.

Out And About, another Haydock winner, has a better berth towards the far side 
and should improve for the extra distance. Oh This Is Us, also drawn in single 
figures, is proven at a mile, though not on soft ground. Manson is also 
vulnerable on soft, though his power-packed finish at Sandown last time makes 
him easy to like.

He has this to say about Olivier Peslier’s ride in the Ribblesdale: “I 
appreciate I’m a bit one-eyed on this, having tipped Queen’s Trust, but what a 
poor ride that was from Olivier Peslier,” he says. “OK, she didn’t break well, 
but he stuck her out the back of a big field and widest of all to boot and then 
stayed there long after it should have been clear that the pace was not strong. 
He didn’t make a move until the turn for home, at which point it was far too 
late. Of course, in a special act of cruelty, she then scythed through the 
field when it was just too late to reach a place. Ugh.”

Mille Et Mille is really putting the hammer down with a punishing gallop, but

There’s £226,840 in the winner’s purse as this massive Gold Cup field is sent 
on its way, with Order Of St George the 10-11 favourite. Mizzou, Wasir and The 
Twisler are all prominent. Mille Et Mille takes up the running from The Twisler 
as they pass the grandstand ... Mille Et Mille leads from six or seven lengths 
from The Twisler, who has two or three lengths on Fun Mac in third. Flying 
Officer is next and then Gririaz ... Order Of St George is well down the field 
...
 
Pallasator, a notoriously leery bugger when it comes to travelling down to the 
start and entering the stalls, has got down to the start, with Oisin Murphy 
giving him a tender ride with his feet out of the irons. In the parade ring, 
his trainer Sir Mark Prescott gives the horse’s stable lass all the credit, 
saying she’s found a way to get into her charge’s head. They’re loading the 
stalls, not long now ...
 
Even Song justified heavy market support to give Aidan O’Brien his first ever 
winner of the Ribblesdale Stakes and in the process provide the master of 
Ballydoyle with his 50thRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> success.

Sent off the 15-8 favourite, Even Song was not too far behind a steady gallop 
set by Ted Durcan on Shall We. Oaks runner-up Architecture ran keen from a wide 
draw under Frankie Dettori and gave herself little chance of going one better.

Roger Varian’s maiden Ajman Princess had the perfect trip through on the rail 
and showed a determined attitude, keeping on gamely but she had no answer to 
Even Song’s turn of foot.
Everything opened up in front of Ryan Moore and she soon put the race to bed 
when asked a question.

Even Song powered a length and a half clear of Ajman Princess, with The Black 
Princess holding off the fast-finishing Queen’s Trust for third. Moore said: 
“She had a good turn of foot. We did go slow, but she relaxed well and was in 
tight quarters before we got a gap.
“She’s a very good filly. Architecture had a rough trip backing up from the 
Oaks,” said Moore. “This filly, we thought it was a good spot for her and Aidan 
has trained her with this mind. Let’s hope he gets to 100 - that would be more 
special.”

Order Of St George is the big, young talent here and comes from the Aidan 
O’Brien stable that has won this race six times in the past 10 years with three 
different horses. But things could go wrong for him if, as expected, he is held 
up towards the rear for this first attempt at two and a half miles. Ryan Moore, 
who left his challenge too late on The Gurkha on Tuesday, could find himself 
trying to thread amongst a dozen rivals when it’s time to make his challenge 
here.

A case can be made for a few of the others, especially as their odds are 
inflated by the market love for the favourite. Max Dynamite only needs to be 
forgiven his reappearance flop, when he surely needed the run. On his form from 
the second half of last year, he’s got a great shot. Mizzou has won two good 
races here and might have matured enough to improve on last year’s seventh. 
Flying Officer looks a very solid option, though this could be a bit far for 
him if they go a good gallop. Clever Cookie will have his chance, though the 
suspicion remains that he’s not quite good enough.

Hawkbill had too much pace for Prize Money to give Godolphin a one-two in the 
Tercentenary Stakes atRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. Having enjoyed a a treble on 
Wednesday Sheikh Mohammed left Ascot a happy man but none of those winners were 
trained by his main Newmarket men.

This time the race was dominated by Charlie Appleby and Saeed bin Suroor, with 
Appleby’s more experienced Hawkbill coming out on top under William Buick. Race 
Day, another Godolphin runner, set off at a tremendous gallop, with Prize Money 
keen in second and Hawkbill in third.

Nothing else got into it as with two furlongs left to run the pacemaker 
dropped away and Hawkbill (11-2) quickened past Prize Money to win his fifth 
race in a row. Aidan O’Brien’s Long Island Sound stayed on from the rear to 
claim third but there were only ever two horses in it.

“We always knew he was a nice horse, and it was a great ride by William 
Buick,” said Appleby. “Both myself and Saeed needed pace and Marin Lane did a 
fantastic job on the pacemaker. William was confident and he is a horse we feel 
will get a mile and a half. I said the best way to ride him was to ride him 
like the best horse in the race.

“Turning for home, I know they were travelling well in behind, but he was 
travelling supremely well and he galloped all the way to the line, which he 
showed he can do at Newmarket.”PA Sport

Can we talk about Sophie Wessex’s hat for a minute between races? Yesterday 
the royals atAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> tried hard to out 
do each other with the hats which all seemed to be referencing some food theme 
-Kate (Middleton/Cambridge/Whatever) wore a pringle crisp in hat form. But 
today Wessex has opted for a Georgia O’ Keeffe flower reference. (I mean I took 
the higher cultural ground there and it could have gone either way).

Her skirt is a nod to Christian Dior’s New Look which suggests she’s read some 
sort of A-Z of fashion, but it is her shoes which are really interesting. 
Hidden platform buttermilk court shoes are practically standard issue for the 
royal family these days thanks to Princess Kate. So I reckon that the 
subliminal messaging with this outfit is that yesterday’s Cambridge appearance 
was merely a blip and that it is Wessex whoactually owns royal enclosure chic.

Meanwhile we have an unexpected sartorial move from the Queen. But then she’s 
come over all brave new wardrobe (the neon) since her 90th. She’s usually all 
over the mono-toning but today she’s experimented with this complicated dual 
blue/orange thing. The fashion desk’s best guess if that she is, in the absence 
of actual summer time at Ascot, channeling a summer sky. Which is kind of noble 
and in the-service-of-one’s-country-ish of her, but also completely futile.
 Sophie Countess of Wessex (right) has eschewed the Pringle crisp hat of 
yesterday in favour of a Georgia O’Keefe flower reference for Ladies’ Day.

Architecture is the obvious one, having run second in the Oaks a fortnight 
ago, when only the astonishing Minding was good enough to catch her. But that 
was a tough race on a taxing surface and we saw with A Shin Hikari yesterday 
that horses are not always able to run two good races on soft in quick 
succession.

Aidan O’Brien fields Even Song, who was a bit unlucky in running when third in 
a Listed race last month but still has a bit to prove at this level. Newmarket 
appears to be bursting with promising young fillies, since John Gosden fields a 
couple, of which Sovereign Parade is the most interesting, while Sir Michael 
Stoute sends Queen’s Trust, who promises to relish this step up in distance.

Prince Of Lir gave Luke Morris a first Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> victory in the Norfolk Stakes. 
Winner of his only start at Beverley prior to this race, trainer Robert Cowell 
had voiced concerns about his ability to handle the soft ground.

In beating Mark Johnston’s The Last Lion, the Brocklesby winner from 
Doncaster, he confirmed the form from their previous meeting 19 days ago in the 
Brian Yeardley Trophy in winning by half a length.

The favourite Global Applause appeared to have everything covered at halfway, 
but Frankie Dettori chose to go to the previously-favoured far side whereas the 
race unfolded in the centre of the track.

The Last Lion briefly went clear but Silver Line and Peace Envoy came with a 
chance, only to be put in their place by the 8-1 winner. It was a third Royal
Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> win for Cowell, who had won two 
runnings of the King’s Stand through Prohibit and Goldream.

“It’s a great buzz,” said Morris. “It’s what you work hard for. He’s only had 
one run and he’s just a bit inexperienced but he’s a very talented horse. He 
put the race to bed nicely.”
Cowell added: “He’s a pocket rocket. He’s not very big but he’s very well 
formed and mature. He’s shown a lovely attitude. I’m delighted for the Swanns 
and family because they paid a lot of money for him and he’s repaid their 
faith.”PA Sport.

Kieren Fallon has a live chance of Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> glory at the age of 51, having 
got the leg-up on Blue De Vega. This Irish raider was a fair third in the Irish 
Guineas, four lengths behind Galileo Gold who won a Group One here on Tuesday, 
and the extra quarter-mile here should help.

Abdon comes from the Sir Michael Stoute yard and may be able to improve on his 
reappearance second, just the second start of his career, when he would have 
preferred a stronger pace. Godolphin’s Prize Money was also outpaced at the end 
of a slow-run race last time and can do better. He’s bred to be better on this 
wetter surface. In the same ownership, Hawkbill is on a winning run of four and 
beat Abdon last time but could do with drying conditions.
