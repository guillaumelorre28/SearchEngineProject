In Blackburn’s only year in the Champions League after their title-winning 
season in 1994-95, Mike Newell took advantage when among the Europe’s elite, 
scoring the then fastest hat-trick in the history of the revamped competition. 
Newell bagged three goals in nine minutes asBlackburn demolished the Norwegians 
4-1 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6UqG6icSZM> at Ewood Park, in what was 
their only win of the tournament. They finished bottom of their group on four 
points.

In a match marred by clashes between rival fans before the match, Andy Cole 
hit his first hat-trick in Europe in a 3-1 win over Feyenoord in Rotterdam, to 
continue United’s 100% record in that year of the competition. Finishing top of 
the group with 15 points, having lost only one game to the eventual runners-up 
Juventus, United ended up going out to Monaco on away goals in the 
quarter-final. Cole became the first Englishman in history to score two 
hat-tricks in Europe, as he struck another in a rampant 5-1 over Anderlecht in 
September 2000 as United went out at the quarter-final stage once again – this 
time to the subsequent winners Bayern Munich.

In a campaign that ultimately ended in disappointment for Liverpool, Michael 
Owen <https://www.theguardian.com/football/michael-owen> grabbed an impressive 
hat-trick away to Spartak Moscow in typically predatory fashion. Despite a 5-0 
thrashing of Spartak at home earlier in the tournament, Liverpool could not 
overcome Valencia and Basel to advance from their group, as a 3-3 draw with the 
Swiss side in the final round of group games meant they finished one point 
behind in third. Owen would go on to score another treble for Manchester United 
in 2009, in a 3-1 win over Wolfsburg.

In the old-style format in which a second group stage was played after the 
first, Alan Shearer scored his firstChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> goal in 14 games to 
spark a sweet hat-trick against the German side, as he kept the Magpies’ hopes 
of qualifying for the knockout stage alive. A diving header was the highlight 
of Shearer’s treble, as they compounded the woes of Leverkusen, who failed to 
score a point in the group. Newcastle went out at this stage in the end, 
however, behind Barcelona and Internazionale.

In arguably one of the most memorable debuts an Englishman has ever made, 
Rooney celebrated his £27m move from Everton with a stunning hat-trick against 
the Turkish side Fenerbahce, instantly endearing himself to the United fans. 
His first game since limping out of Euro 2004, the then 18-year-old kicked off 
his United career as he meant to carry on as the Red Devils scraped through the 
group before being knocked out by the eventual runners-up Milan.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/thierry-henry> scored three memorable 
goals for Arsenal at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with the sort of display that 
made his time in north London so memorable. With Pascal Cygan remembered at the 
other end for putting in a rare good performance for the Gunners, Henry helped 
Arsenal to kick off the second group stage with an emphatic win against the 
Italian side, sealing it with a dipping free-kick. Their time in Europe 
eventually ended with Arsenal once again failing to get past the group stages.

In a game that was ultimately remembered for a beautiful, weaving goal scored 
by Samir Nasri, Nicklas Bendter unexpectedly entered the Champions League 
hat-trick record books, as his Arsenal side reached the quarter-finals. Two 
first-half goals and a second-half penalty allowed the Dane to complete his 
hat-trick, with Emmanuel Eboué also on target, as the tie finished 6-2 on 
aggregate. Barcelona were the team that knocked them out that year, in the 
quarter-finals.
