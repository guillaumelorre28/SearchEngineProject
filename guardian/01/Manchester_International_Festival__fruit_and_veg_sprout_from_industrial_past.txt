In the world's first industrialised city, Vincent Walsh is hoping that
Manchester will now become "the first biospheric city", in his
flagship project transforming a disused printworks in a deprived area
of Salford <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/salford> into a state-of-the-art 
urban farm and research centre.

Walsh, founder and director of the Biospheric Foundation 
<http://www.biosphericfoundation.com/>, has teamed up with Manchester 
International Festival <http://www.mif.co.uk/> as part of its 2013 programme of 
events, to create a project that educates communities about sustainable food 
production.

Schools and families will be able to visit this old three-storey mill turned 
agricultural space once it opens on 5 July. By then, Walsh hopes the former 
industrial monument will be teeming with sustainable food production - an 
outdoor forest of fruit trees, plants growing on the roof, and an aquaponics 
technology system that cultivates fish and plant-life in a semibiotic 
environment.

At a time when people are growing increasingly distrustful of their food 
suppliers, the not-for-profit initiative is attempting to reconnect inner-city 
dwellers with agricultural methods, by providing them with the skills to grow 
their own food in their back yards.
 Screw up your eyes and imagine a lush green scene. That's the plan for July 
In a separate role as a laboratory, The Biospheric Project also seeks to 
answer some questions as to how cities can feed their citizens as they
become more densely populated.

Walsh says:

This work will help to challenge contemporary thinking about urban food 
production and ecologies within the inner-city,
exploring how cities can develop greener infrastructure and more resilient 
communities for the future.

In his final year of PhD research, Walsh has focused on the implementation of 
research centres in urban areas. This project, he says
takes research out of the university and directs it - geographically - exactly 
where it is needed.

Jennifer Cleary, MIF Creative Learning Director, says: 

The project is looking at how you can make a disused space, somewhere that's 
completely unproductive, and breathe new life into it. We're looking to 
reconnect communities with ways of growing their own foods.
 A greenhouse? A red house? The urban setting for the Manchester International 
Festival project 

Unlike the vast majority of events at Manchester 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester> International Festival, the 
Biospheric Project is a legacy commission that will continue its
work for at least ten years. It is being marketed as a hub for social 
enterprise, with a wholefoods shop being launched, and a 'veg-box' scheme 
currently being run by local residents. The site will also provide training 
courses and welcome schools in an attempt to inspire "young urban farmers." 
Cleary says:

One of the aims of the project is how the site can be used to engage the local 
communities, to train and teach them new skills and actually start
employing people.


The Biospheric Foundation has received a Â£300,000 sponsorship deal from 
Salford City Council <http://www.salford.gov.uk/>, whose new elected city mayor,
Ian Stewart <http://www.salford.gov.uk/citymayor.htm> says:

This is a flagship project for Salford - transforming a disused, former 
printing works into a world-first eco-centre which will have huge grass roots 
involvement and leave a lasting legacy for the local community.

People often say they can't afford to eat healthily because of the cost of 
fruit and vegetables. Salford has some of the poorest health in the country and 
diet and exercise play a key role in improving people's well-being.

Encouraging people to grow and eat their own produce while showcasing Salford 
as supporting innovative, cutting-edge research as part of this major 
international festival is money well spent.

Irwell House in Salford is just one of the many disused spaces that are being 
transformed into cultural showgrounds for the festival in July.
One of the other venues is Mayfield Depot, an old steam railway station and 
later, parcels depot, which has stood derelict since 1986. It will now play 
host to Massive Attack's collaboration with filmmaker Adam Curtis, as well as 
theatre directorRomeo Castellucci 
<http://www.peakperfs.org/artists/Romeo_Castellucci> choreographing falling 
animal bone powder to a 100-piece orchestra, in his performanceThe Rite of 
Spring.

Seven projects running during Manchester International Festival will also take 
place in Albert Hall, a former music hall and Methodist chapel that has stood 
empty for over 50 years. It is currently being transformed into a new music 
venue space byManchester's Trof franchise <http://www.trofnq.co.uk/>, as part 
of their (not unwelcome) conquest of the city.

For Alex Poots, founding CEO and artistic director of the festival, these 
unconventional spaces are, in part, offering

people something you can't get anywhere else. We're welcoming audiences into a 
more three-dimensional environment where they are almost in the show.
