• Forest Xplorer
Whether you're attempting to locate your nearest Forestry Commission woodland 
or identify the giant tree in front of you on a walk, the Forest Xplorer mobile 
app should help you make the most of your forest forays. For details, see

• Forest Live
For more than a decade now, the birdsong of the English forest has (from time 
to time) been accompanied by music of a human kind, courtesy of the annual 
series of Forest Live concerts. Since 2001, when Jools Holland and the 
Levellers played four Forestry Commission sites, a glittering array of pop 
talent – from Pulp to Plan B – has taken to the trees each summer.

The number of forest venues is now up to seven, with the National Arboretum at 
Westonbirt, Delamere Forest and Cannock Chase added to the original four 
venues: Sherwood Pines, Dalby Forest, Bedgebury Pinetum and High Lodge at 
Thetford Forest.

This year's sell-out series, headlined by Blondie, Paul Weller and Paloma 
Faith, underlined the Forestry Commission's role as a major promoter of summer 
concerts in unique, natural settings.
