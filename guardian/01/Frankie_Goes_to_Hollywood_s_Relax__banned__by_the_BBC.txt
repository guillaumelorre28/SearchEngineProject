Prohibition is good for business. When it was first released, in October 1983, 
Frankie Goes to Hollywood's debut single just about troubled the top 40. Enter 
irate Radio 1 DJ Mike Read who, objecting to its saucy artwork and lyrics, 
refused to play the track during the chart rundown. TheBBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> then banned the song from radio and TV 
(the original video was all decadent nightclub scenes and allusions to "water 
sports"). Relax duly climbed to No 1, staying there for five weeks.
