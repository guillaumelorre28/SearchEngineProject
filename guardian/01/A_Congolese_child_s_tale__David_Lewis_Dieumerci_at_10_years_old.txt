It is holiday time in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, and the gritty commune 
of Makala hums to a distinctly high-pitched tune as young children chase after 
small red footballs in the rubbish-ridden streets.

David Lewis likes football, too. Today, however, school weighs on his mind. 
The good news is that the 10-year-old has started attending a Catholic school a 
short walk from the small but sturdy-looking shack where he lives with his 
parents and three siblings. Maths classes are his favourite.


The bad news is that he rarely gets to go to them. His father, Jean Mtoko, has 
been out of work for as long as anyone can remember.His mother, Ngosia Nzinga 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/21/hearafrica05.development8>, 
recently had surgery to try to recover vision in her right eye – a $600 (£389) 
operation for which the family scraped together $150 as a downpayment.


That leaves little money for school fees, which cost $50 a term. And the rules 
are strict: no payment, no class.

“I feel good on the way to school but when I arrive, I am immediately sent 
away,” he says, tears streaming down a face that has shed the last of its baby 
fat. “I am always sent away. I have never been like the other children who sit 
on the bench from the beginning to the end.”


Other anxieties weigh on him, too. Like the landlord’s daughter who lives in 
the apartment with his family and takes a perverse pleasure in insulting his 
family. Or the local street gangs, known askulunas, who are active in Makala 
and once broke down the family’s front door.


In theory, some school is better than none for David, who wasn’t attending at 
all until recently. But to judge by his pained accounts of being turned away, 
the taste of an education has only made its absence sting more.


A similar disillusionment echoes more widely in Makala. The Democratic 
Republic of the Congo’s last major war ended with apeace accord in 2002 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/dec/17/congo>, paving the way for 
national elections in 2006 and 2011. The president, Joseph Kabila, campaigned 
on a platform of rebuilding the country’s dilapidated infrastructure, promising 
a “revolution of modernity”.


There has been progress. The rate of economic growth in the country is among 
the fastest in the world, driven by a booming mining sector. There are new 
roads, airport terminals and locomotives after more than 30 years of Mobutu 
Sese Seko’s kleptocratic rule and two decades more ofinstability in the 
war-shattered east 
<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/06/eastern-drc-oxfam-report-armed-groups-corrupt-officials-congo>
. Some key development indicators have improved: the under-five mortality rate 
has dropped from 156 deaths among every 1,000 live births in 2005 to 119 in 
2013. Despite a few brushes with malaria, David has been in good health, his 
parents say.


But in Makala, promises are routinely betrayed by reality. There are no good 
jobs to be had. The lone light bulb in David’s house flickers on, 
unpredictably, in spurts of an hour or two at a time. The government dreams of 
buildingthe largest hydroelectric dam in the world 
<http://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/grand-inga-hydroelectric-project-an-overview-3356>
 near the end of the Congo river’s 4,700km journey to the Atlantic, yet only 
about 10% of the country’s roughly 70 million peoplecurrently has access to 
electricity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/21/dr-congo-funding-world-largest-hydropower-dam>
. The rubbish hasn’t been collected in years, piling up in the dried-out ravine 
behind the house. Often, the family goes to sleep hungry. A total of 43% of 
children in Congosuffer from chronic malnutrition

Makala is only a dozen kilometres from the upmarket town centre, with its 
elegant high-rise apartment buildings and recently renovated eight-lane 
boulevard. But between the choking traffic and the perilous state of most of 
the city’s roads – where blue-and-yellow minibus taxis, dubbedesprits de mort 
(spirits of death), jockey for space with wooden pushcarts – the drive can take 
more than an hour.


“When you see the revolution of modernity, it’s only on the boulevard,” says 
David’s uncle, Paul Lutumba.


Like many in Kinshasa, Lutumba is looking forward to Kabila’s departure next 
year. The president, who took office in 2001 after theassassination of his 
father <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/20/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum>, 
is required by the constitution to step aside at the end of his second elected 
term.


But few expect it to be as simple as that. Allies of Kabila have called for a 
constitutional change that would eliminate term limits. In January, a proposed 
revision of the country’s election code, which critics said was a ploy to keep 
Kabila in power beyond 2016,triggered violent protests in Kinshasa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/21/dr-congo-archbishop-peace-call-anti-kabila-protests>
 and other major cities. Kabila has refused to publicly announce his intentions.

Disappointed as he is in the president’s leadership, Lutumba isn’t keen on a 
repeat of January. “It was only thekulunas who profited,” he says, alluding to 
widespread looting in the city.


For his part, David has his eyes on the presidency, though not just yet. He 
knows that it’s a long path to the top.


“I always wanted to be a soldier 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/19/africas-children-david-lewis-congo>
 because, to be president, you have to be a soldier,” he says. “Kabila is there 
today. He was a simple soldier but today he is leading the people.”
