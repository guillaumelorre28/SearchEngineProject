This is from my found postcard collection. It's over 100 years old and German. 
I overpainted the Prosit Neujahr (Happy New Year) at the bottom, and painted on 
the red Santa hat. I like it because it doesn't really work. She looks rather 
uncomfortable at that angle, holding her arm up like that.

I overpaint postcards from my collection a lot. I'm not sure this sums up 
Christmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas>, but a lot of 
trouble went into constructing this photograph all those years ago: the 
backdrop, the snow – which I think must have been hand-painted black flecks on 
the original negative. I enjoy the artifice and invention of the pre-digital 
world.
