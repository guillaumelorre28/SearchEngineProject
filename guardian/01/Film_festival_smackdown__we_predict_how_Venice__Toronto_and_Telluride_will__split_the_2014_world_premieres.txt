Now that Cannes has rolled up its red carpet for another year, the film 
festival circuit takes a breather over the summer (the studenty charms of 
Edinburgh notwithstanding). Kicking off what is now known as the "fall movie 
season", the next major rush of festival premieres comes as autumn arrives, 
with the double whammy of the Venice and Toronto film festivals (the former 
opening on 27 August, and the latter on 4 September).

Each has their own distinctive character – Venice its old-Europe sheen, 
Toronto its crack-the-US-market buzz – and a number of films play both, though 
they only give the all-important world premiere to the one they like the best. 
The picture is also muddied a little by the boutiqueTelluride film festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/telluridefilmfestival> in Colorado, which 
tends to nick one or two high-profile films from Toronto for unofficial world 
premieres (12 Years a Slave and Labor Day got the sneak preview treatment last 
year).

However, Toronto has decided that, as of this year, it won't put up with being 
mucked about by Telluride's premiere-snaffling, andhas told film-makers that if 
they want one of its prestigious opening-weekend slots, it's them or us 
<http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/00000143-da14-dc86-a9c7-db57cbe20000>
. The film world is now being asked to look into its collective heart and plunk 
down its loyalty oaths. As the festivals firm up their line-ups, we predict how 
the cards are going to fall.

SET FOR VENICE …

Inherent Vice
 Vice boy ... Joaquin Phoenix. Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP 
Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of Thomas Pynchon didn't make Cannes, so 
it's a virtual certainty for the autumn festivals – and since PTA's last film, 
The Master, premiered at Venice, we're betting on more of the same, with 
possibly the gala-opening slot for good measure.Inherent Vice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/inherent-vice> sees Anderson reunite with 
Joaquin Phoenix; the latter plays a PI looking for an old girlfriend and her 
new lover.

Big Eyes
 The eyes have it ... Tim Burton. Photograph: Patrick Rideaux / Rex Features 
Since he became such a Hollywood big-shot, Tim Burton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/timburton> doesn't seem to go in for the film 
festival circuit these days. His last film to get a major-festival premiere was 
Corpse Bride, which came to Venice in 2005 (and three days later went to 
Toronto). Big Eyes, his Oscar-tipped biopic of round-eyed-waif painter Margaret 
Keane and her huckster husband Walter (as played by Amy Adams and Christoph 
Waltz) has a release date just before Christmas, so it looks set for another 
European platform preview.

Suite Française
 On the run ... Suite Française 
Little could be more old-Europe, cinematically speaking, than Saul Dibb's 
upcoming adaptation of Irène Némirovsky's celebrated novel of the Nazi 
occupation of France, with Michelle Williams, Matthias Schoenaerts and Kristin 
Scott Thomas. Written during the war, but not discovered until the late 90s, it 
looks to be a potent cocktail of despair, displacement and period hats.

Far from the Madding Crowd

We were fairly confident Thomas Vinterberg's version of the Thomas Hardy 
classic – previously filmed, of course, with Julie Christie and Terence Stamp 
in the lead roles – would fetch up at Cannes. But it didn't. A Venice slot, 
giving it a gilding of Euro art film, would appear to be indicated, and with
Michelle Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/11/michelle-williams-suite-francaise-film>
,Carey Mulligan, Juno Temple and Schoenaerts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/19/tom-sturridge-carey-mulligan-thomas-hardy>
 available for duty, a red-carpet number is a strong possibility.

Magic in the Moonlight
 Period piece ... Magic in the Moonlight. Photograph: Sony Pictures Classics 
Again, the feeling was that Woody Allen's latest would fetch up in Cannes, 
especially with its south-of-France setting. But perhaps Allen's backers are 
playing it a little cleverer, what with his renewed box-office clout. Magic, a 
Rivera crime romp with Colin Firth and Emma Stone, is set for a mid-September 
release, so an adjacent film festival premiere looks likely; given Allen's 
predisposition for Europe, Venice seems probable. Even more so in the wake of 
theDylan Farrow controversy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/02/dylan-farrow-child-sex-abuse-allegations-woody-allen>
, as Allen would no doubt seek some shelter from the US press.

Knight of Cups
 Rare sighting ... Terrence Malick. Photograph: John Simon/Associated Press 
Terrence Malick's last film, To the Wonder, had a split Venice-to-Toronto 
premiere, and his new one, starring Christian Bale anddescribed by its producer 
as being "about the LA movie business" 
<http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/terrence-malicks-next-two-films-will-be-completed-simultaneously-voyage-of-time-still-a-ways-off-20120904>
 is on course to go the same way. Of course, Malick is legendary for slipping 
deadlines, so Knight could easily turn up at Cannes 2015.
• Is Knight of Cups the least appealing film title ever? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/02/terrence-malick-knight-of-cups>

A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence
 Strictly for the birds ... A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on its 
Existence 
The film with arguably the greatest title ever was another one that looked a 
decent possibility for Cannes, being the latest from eccentric Swedish auteur 
Roy Andersson. Apparently the third in a trilogy (formed by his two previous 
features, 2000'sSongs From the Second Floor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/86336/songs.from.the.second.floor> and 
2007'sYou, the Living 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/120974/you.the.living>), we are primed 
to expect the unexpected. At Venice, rather than Toronto though.

The Cut
 Word free zone ... Fatih Akin. Photograph: Graeme Robertson 
Turkish-German auteur Fatih Akin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/15/worldcinema> has been a little 
quiet of late, with only the ramshackle restaurant comedy Soul Kitchen 
appearing since his last major film, 2007'sEdge of Heaven 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/122981/edge-of-heaven>. But he looks to 
be back in his ambitious mode with The Cut, withA Prophet's Tahar Rahim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/09/tahar-rahim-not-everybody-is-crazy>
 in the lead. However, Akin has let little slip since he pulled the film out of 
contention for a Cannes slot, other than that Rahim's characterremains silent 
throughout the film 
<http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/fatih-akin-says-tahar-rahim-goes-charlie-chaplin-sergio-leone-style-silent-in-his-upcoming-the-cut-20140102>
. Akin will be looking at the chin-stroking admiration of Venice attendees, no 
doubt, rather than the hucksterish efficiency of Toronto.

TELLURIDE, WE TELL YA, TELLURIDE …

Unbroken
 Presiding genius ... Angelina Jolie directing Unbroken. Photograph: Universal 
Pictures 
It's bit of a crap-shoot attempting to second-guess Telluride, as a) they've 
tended to keep their big reveals under wraps until the very last minute and b) 
Toronto's broadside could make a big difference. But we think Angelina Jolie's 
second directorial effort fits the bill. Jolie doesn't exactly find it 
difficult to drum up publicity, and her studious personality would appear to 
prefer a less hysterical, more contemplative environment. Then again, the 
Italian background of Unbroken's protagonist, prisoner of war Louis Zamperini, 
might mean Venice go after it; but the rousing Americana of the subject matter 
would likely play best on the other side of the Atlantic.

While We're Young
 Brooklyn bound ... Noah Baumbach. Photograph: Graeme Robertson 
Twenty-four carat indie Noah Baumbach is a favoured son of Telluride – Frances 
Ha <https://www.theguardian.com/film/frances-ha> and Margot at the Wedding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/122830/margot-at-the-wedding> both 
premiered there – so his new one, While We're Young, is a good call for this 
year's edition. Apparently following "a Brooklynite twentysomething couple who 
cross paths with an older, fortysomething couple", it stars indie royalty Ben 
Stiller and Adam Driver, alongside slightly tarnished ex-indie royalty Naomi 
Watts.

Carol
 Perfect for Christmas … Cate Blanchett in Carol. Photograph: ian 
Todd Haynes directs this adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel The Price 
of Salt, spotlighting the romance between two women in 1950s New York. Rooney 
Mara stars as a lonesome department store clerk, ushered under the wing of Cate 
Blanchett's moneyed, middle-aged customer. Haynes' last project - theHBO 
mini-series Mildred Pierce 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/23/todd-haynes-mildred-pierce-kate-winslet>
 - screened at Venice, which suggests that it remains a toss-up where this one 
will go.

The End of the Tour
 One for the road ... Jason Segel. Photograph: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images 
Given Telluride's history as a welcoming shelter for hard-to-sell indie 
products, space might be found for this study of Infinite Jest author David 
Foster Wallace, who killed himself in 2008. Taken from a series of on-the-road 
articles by Rolling Stone reporter David Lipsky, itstars Jason Segel as Wallace 
and Jesse Eisenberg as Lipsky 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/12/david-foster-wallace-jason-segel-the-end-of-the-tour>
– cult status beckons, if nothing else. Telluride will be interested, if it 
cuts the mustard.

TO TORONTO …

Gone Girl
 Looking for trouble ... Ben Affleck in Gone Girl 
Fresh from his adventures on The Social Network, The Girl With the Dragon 
Tattoo and House of Cards, director David Fincher looks the ideal choice to 
tackle Gillian Flynn's bestselling novel of American unease; just as Toronto 
appears the perfect launchpad for the film itself. Ben Affleck headlines as the 
downsized husband, becalmed back in his Missouri hometown and suspected of 
murdering his missing wife (Rosamund Pike).

Trash
 Can't be rubbish ... Stephen Daldry. Photograph: Rex Features 
Those on the lookout for next year's Slumdog Millionaire may want to keep an 
eye on Trash, a tale of a trio of street kids in a thinly veiled Philippines 
who discover a bag of loot and find themselves pursued by the authorities. This 
Working Title production isdirected by Stephen Daldry, with Richard Curtis 
adapting the young-adult novel by Andy Mulligan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/06/stephen-daldry-richard-curtis-trash>
. Daldry has a strong awards pedigree, picking up Oscar nominations for all of 
his features, so it would be a surprise if Toronto tossed this one to the 
dumpster. Particularly given thatSlumdog progressed, like Slave, from the 
audience award at Tiff to the best picture Oscar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/15/12-years-a-slave-toronto-film-festival-people-s-choice-winner>
.

Birdman
 Strictly for the bird 2 ... Michael Keaton. Photograph: Sarah Lee 
Alejandro González Iñarritu helped kickstart the "buena onda" of 
Latin-American cinema with his electrifyingAmores Perros 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/84950/amores.perros> back in 2001. 
Birdman, however, swoops in as as an English-language satire on fame and its 
consequences, starring Michael Keaton as a middle-aged actor, struggling to 
shake off his old superhero role and mount a Broadway adaptation of a Raymond 
Carver short story. We thought we'd spot it Cannes. We've now brought out the 
binoculars to look further afield.

Men Women & Children
 Manchild ... Ansel Elgort 
His most successful films – Juno, Up in the Air - benefited from the Telluride 
boost, but Jason Reitman is perhaps under more pressure than any other 
film-maker to stay loyal to Toronto. Apart from anything else, Tiff has been 
the recipient of much backing from the Reitman clan (the square containing the 
fest's main venue is named after them), so it would be a shock if Reitman's new 
one, a study of teenagers' (and their parents') sexual kinks, adapted from Chad 
Kulgren's novel and starring hot young thing Ansel Elgort 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/12/ansel-elgort-the-fault-in-our-stars-interview-im-happy-to-be-a-role-model>
, were to premiere anywhere else.

My Old Lady
 Flat sitter ... Maggie Smith 
We've a hunch about a Toronto slot for My Old Lady, which lights out for Paris 
in the company of Kevin Kline's impoverished American, who discovers a 
mysterious mother and daughter (Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas) supposedly 
squatting in his late father's apartment. Our hero wants to sell the place and 
pocket the profits, but the guests will not be moved. The film marks the 
directing debut of the veteran US playwright Israel Horowitz, who turned 75 in 
March. "Of all my stage-plays, My Old Lady is my very favourite," he explained 
to the Hollywood Reporter.

Fury
 Aaargh! … Fury 
It could be that Brad Pitt enjoyed his experiences on Inglourious Basterds so 
much that he decided to make the whole film again. Either that, or he's 
suffering a PTSD flashback.David Ayers's Fury casts the Hollywood A-lister as 
Sgt Wardaddy <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/04/brad-pitt-fury>, a 
tough US soldier who steers a Sherman tank behind enemy lines on a mission to 
take out Hitler during the dog days of the second world war. Shia LaBeouf, 
Michael Pena and Logan Lerman go along for the ride.

Rosewater
 The scent of torture ... Jon Stewart. Photograph: Charles Sykes/Invision/AP 
Maziar Bahari is an Iranian-Canadian journalist who was arrested and 
imprisoned in Iran 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/feb/21/maziar-bahari-memoir> 
by the Ahmadinejad regime following comments he made on Jon Stewart's Daily 
Show back in 2009. Now his experiences have been spun into a feature-length 
drama by Stewart himself, who makes his directing debut and casts Mexican actor 
Gael García Bernal in the lead. Rosewater (the title named for the stench of 
the hero's shadowy interrogator) was adapted by Stewart (with reported 
assistance from JJ Abrams) from Bahari's book, Then They Came For Me.

Suffragette
 Casting for votes ... Carey Mulligan. Photograph: Soul Brother/FilmMagic 
It will be a tough call to get this ready for the autumn festivals, 
considering they were still filming in April. But if they do, expect a 
prominent berth at Toronto for a sure-to-be-rousing study of women's-vote 
campaigners; commercially minded British films have flourished at the festival 
in recent years. Sarah "Brick Lane" Gavron directs a script by Abi "The Iron 
Lady" Morgan, withMeryl Streep 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/19/meryl-streep-emmeline-pankhurst-suffragette>
,Carey Mulligan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/25/carey-mulligan-suffragette-film-the-fury>
 and Helena Bonham Carter rounding out the cast.

The Imitation Game
 Breaking the code ... The Imitation Game 
One of the most anticipated British (at least in name) films of recent years, 
this hasBenedict Cumberbatch as tortured cryptography genius Alan Turing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/04/benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing>
, who cracked the Germans' code at Bletchley Park but who found only disgrace 
and ruin after being prosecuted for homosexuality in 1952. A blue-chip cast 
supports Cumberbatch; with Harvey Weinstein behind it, this is sure to use 
Toronto as a springboard for an Oscar bid. Cumberbatch had no fewer than four 
films playing at Tiff last year.

Wild
 Reese's pieces … Witherspoon in Wild 
There's a lot of excitement surrounding this adaptation of Cheryl Strayed's 
self-empowerment memoir of her thousand mile trek up the west coast of the US. 
Reese Witherspoon plays Strayed (as well as producing the film), andNick Hornby 
wrote the script 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/30/nick-hornby-wild-reese-witherspoon>
 – but the killer connection, as far as Toronto is concerned, is Canadian 
director Jean-Marc Vallée (ofDallas Buyers Club 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-dallas-buyers-club>). They'll be 
straining every sinew to get this.

Theory of Everything
 Happy together ... Theory of Everything 
Another British-scientist biopic, but this time we're in the company of the 
young physicist Stephen Hawking, as played by Eddie Redmayne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/13/eddie-redmayne-stephen-hawking-theory-of-everything>
, and his wife Jane (Felicity Jones). Unlike Imitation, this has some British 
beef behind the camera: Man on Wire's James Marsh is directing, and UK 
powerhouse Working Title are the producers.

A Most Violent Year
 Blood on the streets ... Oscar Isaac. Photograph: Loic Venance/AFP/Getty

Margin Call director JC Chandor stepped up into the big league with his 
follow-upAll is Lost <https://www.theguardian.com/film/all-is-lost>, containing 
aremarkable solo turn from Robert Redford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/03/robert-redford-all-is-lost-jc-chandor-sundance>
. Now Chandor looks to go gritty and epic, a la James Gray, with an immigrant 
saga set in 1980s New York. Oscar Isaac (Inside Llewyn Davis) is a successful 
Latino incomer, whose life and business is threatened by the welter of killing 
that beset NYC at the time. Any festival would be glad to get their hands on it.

Into the Woods

Capital Pictur 
Stephen Sondheim's po-mo fairy tale reboot is aimed at a Christmas release in 
the US – which, in truth, would militate against a festival run in autumn. But 
like Gone Girl, there's a lot of cred here: cast includes Emily Blunt, Johnny 
Depp and Meryl Streep, and Rob "Chicago" Marshall directs. It remains an 
outside bet for Toronto, but not impossible.
