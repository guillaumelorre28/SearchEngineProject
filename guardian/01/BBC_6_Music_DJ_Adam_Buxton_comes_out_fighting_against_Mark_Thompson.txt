Forget about Mark Thompson's interrogation by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediamonkeyblog/2010/mar/03/mark-thompson-paxman-monkey>
. The BBC director general really met his match onChannel 4 News 
<http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/arts_entertainment/media/bbc+plans+to+axe+radio+and+online+content/3566982>
 yesterday. Except it wasn't Jon Snow taking him to task – it was BBC Radio 6 
Music DJAdam Buxton. One half of Saturday morning favourites Adam and Joe, 
Buxton chose an unusual tactic when invited by Snow to put his argument for the 
station's survival direct to the DG."Mark 'Thommo' Thompson, I'm inviting you 
for a fight. I could take you, I've been practising," 
<http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid62612474001?bctid=69535760001> 
was Buxton's straight-faced opening gambit. The look on Thommo's face – 
confusion? disdain? does not compute? – was a picture. "No, seriously," added 
Buxton. "I want to know if it's completely a fait accompli or whether the BBC 
will listen to people's opinions if they are offered to the BBC Trust online. I 
don't understand why it's necessary to get rid of a station in the name of 
quality when it is a station that is working really well and people really seem 
to love and it's working because its part of the BBC." He forgot to ask if 
Thompson is aBoggins fan <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hkw16T6eDc>. Adam and 
Joe are currently on sabbatical

Come back soon, their station clearly needs them.
