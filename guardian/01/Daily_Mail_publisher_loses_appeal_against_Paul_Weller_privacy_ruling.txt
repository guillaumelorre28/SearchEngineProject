 has lost its challenge to an award of £10,000 privacy damages to three of Paul 
Weller’s children.

The group claimed High Court judge Mr Justice Dingemans was wrong in his 
application of the law and created what was, in effect, an “image right” for 
the first time.

This would have far-reaching adverse effects on the freedom of the UK media if 
allowed to stand, the Court of Appeal heard last month.

The 57-year-old frontman of The Jam and The Style Council brought the case 
after the unobscured faces of daughter Dylan, 16, and 10-month-old twins John 
Paul and Bowie were “plastered” over theMail Online 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/mail-online> website.

The Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice 
Bean dismissed the appeal on Friday and refused Associated permission to appeal 
to the Supreme Court.
