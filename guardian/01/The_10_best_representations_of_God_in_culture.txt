1 | The Creation of Adam


Michelangelo (1511)

For its first 1,200 years, Christianity followed the line in John’s gospel 
that stated, “No one has ever seen God” and avoided portraying him. Relaxation 
of the rule came when he was shown as first a hand, then a face cloaked in 
cloud, but the Renaissance knew no such restraint. In one of his frescoed 
panels for theSistine Chapel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2012/nov/01/sistine-chapel-pope-video>
 ceiling, Michelangelo’sCreation of Adam contains the most reproduced full-body 
image of God of all time. He is a benign, white-haired, bearded figure, clothed 
in a loose white robe, stretching out his finger to a naked Adam and so – as 
the Book of Genesis tells in the creation story – breathing life into him.

in Dogma (1999)

Casting women as God retains a strong contemporary kick when some patriarchal 
branches of Christianity still refuse to ordain females, but having the 
Canadian singer Alanis Morissette as the Almighty was more than a token gesture 
inDogma <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA3dzBrXYtc>, Kevin Smith’s irreverent 
comedy about two fallen angels trying to get back into heaven. Cradle Catholic 
Morissette, appearing in the wake of the global popularity of her albumJagged 
Little Pill <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFW-WfuX2Dk>, had already 
registered her interest in matters of faith in her song lyrics. Her female God 
is largely silent (a raven-haired, bewingedAlan Rickman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/15/alan-rickman-remembered-by-kevin-smith-a-huge-cauldron-of-win>
 does the talking for her), but she still manages to impose her will and 
perform the odd miracle.

3 | The Granton Star Cause


Irvine Welsh (1994)

In this lewd short story, part of The Acid House collection, Irvine Welsh – to 
the horror of many Christians – renders God as a foul-mouthed Edinburgh drunk, 
worn out by humanity’s insistence on blaming him for everything that goes wrong 
in their lives. Behind the effing and blinding and earthy setting, however, The 
Granton Star Cause poses serious questions about free will and the limits of 
God’s patience. After the success of the 1996 film adaptation of Welsh’s novel
Trainspotting <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxgqHqakXc>, The Acid House 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA5VxgR_1_M> was also made into a film. When 
Channel 4 broadcast it in 1998, Mary Whitehouse attempted to have it banned on 
the grounds of blasphemy.

4 | The Ancient of Days


William Blake (1794)

The visionary poet, painter and printmaker created his own elaborate 
mythology, but this image – taken from a phrase in the Book of Daniel and 
traditionally seen in western Christianity as referring to the creative powers 
and perfection of God – still registers as a strikingly modern take on the 
divine more than two centuries later. Awatercolour etching 
<http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/nov2007.html>, originally for a 
cover illustration, the circle design with a crouching figure set against a 
cloud backdrop, retains its power to encapsulate a hard-to-define force that 
transcends the usual barriers around religion.

in Bruce Almighty (2003)

Having been fixed by Christianity in our collective imagination as an elderly 
white man, God always makes a bigger splash when portrayed by a black actor. 
And never more so than withMorgan Freeman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/04/morgan-freeman-five-best-moments-london-has-fallen>
’s portrait inBruce Almighty <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FngXOUxklR4> and 
its 2007 sequelEvan Almighty <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnUvSn9pVaA>. 
This is a mellow God, wise enough to grant Jim Carrey’s Bruce Nolan his wish to 
play God, and then be there when he buckles under the strain of running the 
world. Freeman’s award-winning role is helped along mightily by him having the 
sort of voice that lends itself naturally to pronouncing infallibly.

(1972)

The devil, it is said, has all the best tunes, but not, for once, in The Good 
Old Bad Old Days <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVSFKjDc7PM> where God 
manages to hit a few high notes. This musical, written by Leslie Bricusse and
Anthony Newley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/apr/16/guardianobituaries1> (the second 
Mr Joan Collins) in an attempt to repeat their earlier Broadway triumph ofStop 
the World, I Want to Get Off, had a decent six-month run in the West End. It is 
built around the conceit of an ageing God, exhausted by the devil’s tricks, 
singing of his plans to retire, but persuaded to stay on after reliving some of 
humanity’s happier historical tableaux.

in Time Bandits (1981)

Everyone has their own image of God, some of them more akin to the cruel and 
vengeful character of the Old Testament narratives, but there is something 
seductively comforting about Ralph Richardson’s portrait of theSupreme Being 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw9IqUgGlzs> in Terry Gilliam’s bizarre fantasy
Time Bandits <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwnjENpIyq0>. He is your 
archetypal, utterly reasonable, besuited English civil servant of mature years, 
gently but firmly attempting to bring order and logic to a crazy universe.

in The Mysteries (1977)

God was rarely seen on stage before the modern period, save in the medieval 
mystery plays, which brought the Bible alive for illiterate folk in often 
raucous street performances. The opening part of the cycle was usually the 
creation and gave God got top billing. This tradition was maintained inThe 
Mysteries, Bill Bryden’s award-laden version at the National Theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre> in the early 1980s, where God was 
played by the bald Yorkshireman Brian Glover, putting the building blocks of 
the world into place from atop a forklift truck – a reference by the adaptor, 
Tony Harrison, to the habit of different medieval trade guilds taking ownership 
of each part of the mystery play cycle.

Goethe <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe%27s_Faust> (1772-1775)

Though God’s role is little more than a cameo in a work that took 60 years to 
complete and requires about 20 hours on stage if done in one sitting, it is 
undeniably a reassuring one. While Faust is busy succumbing to the wiles of the 
devilish Mephistopheles, God up in heaven, surrounded by angels, remains 
confident that his erring servant will eventually come good. And in part two – 
reputedly the harder section to perform – that confidence is eventually borne 
out, albeit only after this benign God has shown plenty of generosity of spirit 
and that most underrated of Christian virtues, forgiveness. “Man errs,” 
Goethe’s God concludes, “till he has ceased to strive.”

 Groucho Marx, right, as God in Skidoo. 
10 | Groucho Marx


Skidoo (1968)

In what was his last ever screen role, Groucho Marx 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsGsF8oGRkc> plays a bonkers gangster boss 
called God, with near mystical powers, who is seduced by 60s counterculture, 
dons Hare Krishna robes and a Hawaiian-style flower necklace, and comes out as 
a hippy after having his first puff of marijuana. “Mmm, pumpkin,” he mutters as 
he reaches a spiritual high. Despite its stellar cast,Harry Nilsson 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4IMX26xF9Q> soundtrack and Otto Preminger 
direction,Skidoo was panned on release – Marx labelled it “god-awful” and 
Preminger’s estate subsequently tried to bury it – but of late this oddball 
comedy has attracted a “so bad it’s good” cult following.
