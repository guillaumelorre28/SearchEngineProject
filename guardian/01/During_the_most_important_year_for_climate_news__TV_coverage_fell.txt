Media Matters for America has published a report detailing US broadcast news 
coverage of climate change in 2015 <http://mediamatters.org/research/208881>, 
and their findings are stunning.

2015 was a banner year for climate news. February, June, October, November, 
and December were each their respective hottest months on record, and2015 
shattered the record for hottest year

. The pope delivered aclimate encyclical 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/guardian-view-on-laudato-si-pope-francis-cultural-revolution>
.Investigative journalists at Inside Climate News 
<http://insideclimatenews.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken> discovered that 
Exxon knew 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/25/two-faced-exxon-the-misinformation-campaign-against-its-own-scientists>
 about the dangers of human-caused global warming while it funded a climate 
misinformation campaign, and theNew York attorney general launched an 
investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/05/exxonmobil-investigation-climate-change-peabody>
 into the company’s behavior. President Obama’sClean Power Plan went into effect
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/03/obamas-clean-power-plan-hailed-as-strongest-ever-climate-action-by-a-us-president>
, and herejected the Keystone XL pipeline 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/09/by-rejecting-keystone-president-obama-cements-his-climate-legacy>
. And most importantly,195 countries agreed to cut carbon pollution as much as 
possible 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars>
 to stem global warming.

Despite all these critically important stories, as in the presidential debates 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/14/kids-ask-us-presidential-candidates-to-debate-science>
, climate change was largely absent from US broadcast news. Climate coveragefell
 in 2015.

 US broadcast network minutes of climate coverage in 2014 and 2015. 
Illustration: Media Matters for America 
Most of the decline was due to ABC, which only spent 13 minutes in 2015 
covering climate change – three times less than evenFox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox>. While Fox’s coverage increased, most 
of the network’s climate segments featured interviews with guests who 
criticized efforts to address global warming.

The Sunday shows (ABC’s This Week, CBS’ Face the Nation, NBC’s Meet the Press, 
and Fox Broadcasting Co.’sFox News Sunday) and the network nightly news 
programs (ABC’sWorld News Tonight, CBS Evening News, and NBC Nightly News) each 
aired a combined 73 minutes of climate coverage in 2015, down a total of 8 
minutes (a 5% decline) from 2014. The Public Broadcasting System (PBS)NewsHour 
program aired more segments addressing climate change (58) than the other 
nightly news shows combined (48).

 and the launch of the Clean Power Plan were largely overlooked by the news 
networks.


When it came to interviewing or quoting scientists and doing segments about 
climate science research,PBS <https://www.theguardian.com/media/pbs> NewsHour 
again rose above its peers, while ABC’sWorld News Tonight flunked science class.

Climate scientists were entirely absent from the Sunday news shows, with one 
exception. On CBS’Face the Nation in December, anchor John Dickerson 
interviewed Dr. Marshall Shepherd, meteorologist and director of University of 
Georgia’s Atmospheric Sciences Program, to discuss the importance of the UN 
summit’s goal of limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius. This was a 
sharp decline from 2014, in which climate scientists were interviewed or quoted 
on seven Sunday news shows.

Failure to report on the most important issue of our day

Climate change <https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange> 
affects some of the most critical components of our society: food security, 
national defense, extreme weather, the economy, public health, the environment, 
and so on. The broadcast networks touched on some of these, like extreme 
weather, but largely missed others.

Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) reacted to the Media Matters report:


As the co-founder of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, I 
read Media Matters’ new study and it’s a wake up call to the news networks. The 
most important long term global and national issue shouldn’t be getting 
short-thrift. People need more information, not less.


These findings may help explain why Americans aren’t concerned about climate 
change 
<http://www.mrctv.org/blog/poll-americans-not-concerned-about-climate-change>. 
We rely on the media to inform the public, and on the most important issue of 
our time, the US broadcast news media are failing to adequately inform 
Americans. As Rep. Israel notes, they’re moving in the wrong direction and need 
to do much better.
