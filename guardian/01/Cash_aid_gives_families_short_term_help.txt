Long-term measures to reduce future food crises in countries such as Burkina 
Faso are essential, but emergency relief organisations continue to debate 
whether they should provide short-term food aid or cash to families debilitated 
by crop failure.

Joel Hafvenstein, disaster risk reduction adviser for Tearfund, says relief in 
the form of food disrupts markets, whereas giving cash to families is a rapid 
solution that aids the economy.

Hafvenstein explains how Tearfund's partner, Credo, is implementing measures 
to help communities overcome hunger by creating grain banks, starting up market 
gardening to diversify the food production and providing cash-based assistance 
for the short term.

Jean Nadembéga, program manager for Save the Children in Burkina Faso, 
supports this view: "This is very good for the local economy. The prices are 
high and normally those who buy food can just buy small packages, they can't 
buy a bag. But with this money they can buy a bag and this is cheaper than 
buying in small amounts.

"There is another strategy [of giving] food or cash for work," Nadembéga 
continues. "But at this time of year it is not good to call someone who has a 
farm and tell them to come to do public work. He will stop farming and then 
next year he won't have anything. That's why we give them the money so that 
they can choose to buy food and medicine but also work on the farm."
