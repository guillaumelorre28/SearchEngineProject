Reese Witherspoon is to reunite with director Alexander Payne

 for the first time since her Golden Globe-nominated turn in Payne’s 1999 film 
Election. The actor, who is currently in US cinemas playing Cheryl Strayed in 
an adaptation of the bestselling memoir Wild, has joined the cast of 
Downsizing, alongside Matt Damon.

Downsizing is described as a social satire in which a man “realises he would 
have a better life if he were to shrink himself”. Payne is writing the script 
with regular collaborator Jim Taylor (who had a hand in the screenplays for 
previous Payne projects Sideways, About Schmidt and Election, as well as 
Jurassic Park III); the pair are also producing, with another Payne regular, 
Jim Burke.

Payne has been working on Downsizing for some time, and ascribes the 
seven-year gap between Sideways and The Descendants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/06/matt-damon-downsizing-alexander-payne>
 to his failure to get the film off the ground. Witherspoon had been attached 
to the previous incarnation of the film, opposite Paul Giamatti and Sacha Baron 
Cohen. Damon’s casting in November 2014 revived the project, but it means 
production will have to wait until he has finished shooting the fifth Bourne 
film, later this year.
