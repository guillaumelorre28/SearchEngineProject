Local newspaper group Archant has hired a second senior executive from Local 
World <https://www.theguardian.com/media/local-world> with the appointment of 
Steve Anglesey as digital content officer.

Anglesey will report to Matt Kelly, who joined Archant in November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/15/local-world-digital-chief-matt-kelly-joins-rival-archant>
 as chief content officer just weeks after Trinity Mirror’s £220m takeover of 
Local World was announced. Anglesey was previously digital director at Local 
World, and along with Kelly has also worked at Trinity.

Anglesey will be responsible for all digital output across Archant’s 130 local 
media properties, which are run from a head office in Norwich.

Kelly said: “He has terrific experience in digital publishing with a long and 
successful track record in delivering highly engaged digital audiences. This is 
a big appointment for us and we’re delighted to have landed someone with such 
proven capabilities.”

Archant paid its first dividend since 2012 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/18/archant-boosts-profits-and-pays-first-dividend-since-2012>
 earlier this year after reporting a 20% increase in profits to £9.6m in 2015. 
The company says it is focused on serving local markets and interest groups, in 
contrast to larger competitors Trinity and Johnston Press, which are building 
up scale through deals such as the Local World takeover and Johnston’s 
acquisition of the i newspaper.

Anglesey said: “Archant has an extensive portfolio of brands that sit right at 
the heart of the communities they serve, with an impressive history of creating 
innovative and engaging content. This talent, coupled with the ambition 
demonstrated to be the best local media owner in the UK, means it is a very 
exciting company to be joining.”
