This is a super simple dish that is ideal for children, and can be served hot 
or cold. You can sneak vegetables into it and cucumber works well in summer. If 
you prefer, you can replace the tuna with chicken.

(Serves 2-3)
250g penne pasta
Handful of basil leaves
200g cherry tomatoes
Pinch of salt
Olive oil
200g tuna flakes
Parmesan, to serve

Add the pasta to a pan of salted boiling water and cook to al dente, as per 
packet instructions.

Meanwhile, get your helper to tear the basil leaves and, with supervision, 
halve the cherry tomatoes. Mix the tomatoes and basil with a little salt, and a 
dash of olive oil. Combine with the tuna flakes, mix well, check seasoning and 
leave to one side.

Drain the cooked pasta, mix with the tomato and serve with grated parmesan.
