A summer of political campaign videos, banners and broadcasts will soon come 
to a close as Russians cast their votes in the parliamentary elections this 
weekend.

The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, is currently made up of four 
parties: the pro-Kremlin behemoth UnitedRussia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia>, and three smaller opposition 
parties which provide a mere semblance of competition.

But it wasn’t always this way. In the late 1990s, after a period of political 
“opening up” and the subsequent fall of the USSR, there were more than 100 
registered parties in Russia vying for the support of the people.

With everything to play for, politicians resorted to bizarre methods to 
attract voters, from cute cat animations to films depicting apocalyptic 
near-future scenarios.

So which were the strangest, and what do they tell us about the politics of 
the past 20 years?


1993: ‘Yes you do’ support Boris Yeltsin’s policies

In April 1993 a referendum was called to ask Russians four questions on their 
confidence in PresidentBoris Yeltsin 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin>, his socio-economic policies and 
whether early elections should be called.

The campaign slogan in support of Yelstin, rather crudely, instructed voters 
on exactly how they should mark their ballot: “Yes! Yes! No! Yes!” is all 
essentially all that this advert repeats, over and over.

1996: Grigory Yavlinskyenlists a tap-dancing professor

Grigory Yavlinsky’s 11-minute-long surreal campaign film featured a dancing 
police officer, a tap-dancing professor and a singing pilot, but it didn’t stop 
5.5 million people from voting for him.

Despite his popularity, it wasn’t enough to get the liberal opposition 
candidate into the runoff vote against Boris Yeltsin, who won the vote and kept 
his job as Russian president.

2000: Yavlinsky take 2 – Soviet scare tactics

Four years after trying to win over voters with his musical campaign, 
Yavlinsky tried another approach with three videos recycling the same theme in 
different nightmarish near-future scenarios. In one version two prisoners sit 
in what appears to be a post-Soviet gulag, in another soldiers dodge bullets 
from unseen enemy, and in the final instalment a man and woman wait in a 
panicked food line.

In every setting, one person asks the other who they voted for in the recent 
election. “I should have voted for the economist – that Yavlinsky fellow,” is 
the reply.

As direct as the ads were, they couldn’t resuscitate Yavlinsky’s political 
career. He got 1.2m fewer votes than in 1996, and Putin won his first 
presidential election with ease.

2003: The ‘young reformers’ and their private jets

Featuring Russia’s “young reformer” politicians of the 1990s, the Union of 
Right Forces (SPS) released an advert showing Anatoly Chubais, Boris Nemtsov 
and Irina Khakamada on a luxury jet, deep in discussion while typing on a 
laptop.

The video was meant to emphasise the “personal success” of the party’s 
leadership, but Russians mocked the film for demonstrating the candidates’ 
wealth and alienation from ordinary voters.


In 1999, the SPS entered the Duma as the parliament’s fourth-largest party 
with 29 seats. In the 2003 election, however, it only narrowly remained, 
winning just three seats. In 2008, a year after failing to win any seats, the 
party formally disbanded.

2005: Xenophobic campaigning

“Let’s clean the trash from Moscow!” has become one of the most infamous 
political slogans in modern Russian history. The video generated so much 
controversy that it was eventually banned and the Rodina party was barred from 
the election, following a complaint by a rival group which claimed the film 
incited ethnic hatred.

The video shows dark-skinned Caucasian immigrants tossing watermelon rinds to 
the ground, complaining about a passing Russian woman pushing a stroller. Party 
leader Dmitry Rogozin is seen approaching the men and tells them to leave.

Rodina later collapsed as a political party, and Rogozin went on to become 
Russia’s ambassador to Nato. In 2011, he was appointed as deputy prime 
minister, in charge of the country’s defence and space industry.

2011: United Russia, ‘crooks and thieves’?

By 2011, United Russia was comfortably the country’s dominant political party. 
It had already gained a “super-majority” in the Duma, granting it the power to 
pass amendments to the Russian constitution, paving the way for an extension of 
presidential terms from four to six years, which Putin is currently serving.

That year, the party’s campaign focused on overcoming declining popularity 
among the public, fuelled in part by anti-corruption activistAlexei Navalny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexei-navalny>, whose epithet for United 
Russia – “the party of crooks and thieves” – became widely popular.

In response, several sleek YouTube videos appeared online defending United 
Russia. The advertisements were released unofficially – ostensibly by ordinary 
supporters of the party – but the production values suggested a professional 
hand.

In one video, a narrator tries to “take back” Navalny’s phrase, arguing that 
United Russia is responsible for years of prosperity in Russia.

The finale encourages viewers to “vote for the party of crooks and thieves”, 
as the final words of the phrase are drowned out by the words “the party of 
doctors, scientists, soldiers, businessmen”.

In another advertisement rumoured to be the creation of pro-Kremlin youth 
activist Robert Shlegel, a man and woman appear to have sex in a voting booth. 
There’s no dialogue in the video, but the message appears to be that young, 
attractive people like to vote – and that they like to vote for United Russia.

Shlegel never admitted to producing the advertisement, but he did say the 
video was “very creative”.

2012: A presidential hopeful whips a donkey

Nobody in Russian politics entertains voters like Vladimir Zhirinovsky. By 
2012, the man whose party, the LDPR, had won 12.3m votes in 1993 was now 
thoroughly transformed into a loveable public clown.

In one of his 2012 presidential campaign advertisements, Zhirinovsky is seen 
whipping a donkey that refuses to pull him through the snow. “This lousy little 
donkey is the symbol of our country!” Zhirinovsky tells viewers. “If I become 
president, we’ll again have a valiant troika.”

2013: Hipster appeal for Alexei Navalny

Claiming he had acted entirely on his own, film editor Maxim Perepelkin 
famously made an animated video in support of Navalny’s 2013 candidacy for the 
Moscow mayorship.

The video’s premise is based on the rule that allows voters to add any symbol 
they wish to their ballots to indicate support for a candidate. Perepelkin’s 
montage shows cats, flowers, fish and other creatures dancing on ballots cast 
for Navalny.

Just in case viewers weren’t sure this was a hipster appeal for the next 
generation’s candidate, Perepelkin set the whole video to a song by the English 
rock band The Leisure Society. The ad ends with one of Navalny’s campaign 
slogans: “One for all, and all for one.”
