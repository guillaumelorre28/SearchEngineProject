“I just think it’s unbelievable that in the 21st century women still get asked 
such very, very different questions from men,” said the MP for Leicester West

The article says the politician maintains her “lithe figure” by jogging 20 
miles a week and wears clothes from LK Bennett and Reiss, which are said to be

royal-sounding Christian names, looks as good in them as slinky brunette Kate. 
In fact she looks the same weight as the Duchess – about 8st – though when I 
ask she slaps me down with a raucous ‘f***off!’, adding quickly: ‘Don’t print 
that.’”
