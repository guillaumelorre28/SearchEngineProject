 The Coma <BRby Alex Garland 
Read by Matthew Macfadyen Running time 2 hours, unabridged
 Penguin Â£12.99 on 2 CDs 

 Late one night, on his way home from work, a young man called Carl is 
attacked while trying to defend a woman on a tube train. When he comes back to 
some form of consciousness, he is lying in a hospital bed, recovering from his 
injuries.

But Carl's experiences of the life he returns to are fragmented and confusing. 
Gradually, he comes to realise the new world he has entered is the land of his 
coma.

As he narrates his thoughts and dreams, Carl takes a matter-of-fact approach 
to his situation, throwing up questions about the very nature of what it means 
to be alive. If you lose your arms, you're still the same person. But take away 
consciousness, despite the full complement of arms and legs, and the person is 
gone.

Matthew Macfadyen is not the best of readers; he sometimes loses the listener 
with the monotony of his voice but he does convey a sense of who Carl is, while 
blurring the lines of imagination and reality, giving the story a hallucinatory 
feel.
