Police in Barcelona say a suspected arsonist started a small fire inside the 
Sagrada Familia basilica and forced the evacuation of hundreds of tourists. The 
blaze has been extinguished and no one has been hurt.

A Catalan regional police official said around 1,500 people had been evacuated 
from Antoni Gaud√≠'s unfinished masterpiece. It is one of the most popular 
tourist sites in Spain's second-largest city.

The official said some tourists saw smoke coming from inside the sacristy and 
alerted authorities, and that the suspected arsonist was arrested. The official 
spoke on condition of anonymity in line with department policy.

She said the fire caused damage but no injuries.

The sacristy is the area where priests put on their robes in preparation for 
mass.
