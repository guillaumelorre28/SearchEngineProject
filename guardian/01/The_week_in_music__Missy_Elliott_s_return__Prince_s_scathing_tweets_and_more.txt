Busted reformed, with Charlie Simpson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/10/busted-to-reform-with-charlie-simpson>

I must confess that I never really understood Busted the first time round, but 
no matter: they’re back. Lead singer Charlie Simpson officially quit the 
imitation-punk boyband in January 2005, but has decided to jump back into a job 
that, according to him, was “like torture 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/feb/17/popandrock>”. I can only assume 
this has everything to do with the renewed musical integrity he and his 
bandmates plan to resurface with, rather than a large paycheque.

Missy Elliott also fired up her comeback machine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/12/missy-elliott-wtf-where-they-from-released>

While we’re on the topic of returns to music, rapper Missy Elliott 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/missyelliott> shared her first new material 
in seven years, on Thursday. Produced by Pharrell – “maybe Timbaland was too 
busy with Empire?” a colleague suggested – WTF (Where They From) is a booming, 
brash return to form. The song arrived with a video featuring the usual Missy 
tropes: dancing children, silly choreography, several outfit changes and skewed 
strangeness, this time in the form of wooden puppets.

 Missy Elliott: WTF (Where They From) ft Pharrell music video 
Sandi Thom released a tearful video about … Radio 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/nov/12/sad-truth-behind-sandi-thoms-tearful-facebook-video>

Before this week, you may only have known about Thom thanks to her 2006 single 
I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair). On Wednesday, the 
34-year-old singer reportedly uploaded a now-deleted cameraphone video to her 
Facebook fan page, in which she tearfully said she was done with the music 
industry because BBC Radio 2 and Bauer radio had decided not to add her new 
single to their playlists. Hmm. For someone who started a career harnessing the 
power of the internet with her live-streamed gigs, it’s odd to see Thom want to 
pander to traditional measures of popularity – unless this was just a 
wonderfully crafted publicity stunt. If you’re curious about how Radio 1 goes 
about picking which songs to play each week, here’sa 2014 Observer piece

Prince tried to make our pop critic sing Sign o’ the Times with him … 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/12/prince-interview-paisley-park-studios-minneapolis>

It probably isn’t that easy to say no to a music-based invitation from Prince, 
but our writer Alexis Petridis did so anyway. He was one of a few journalists 
suddenly summoned to the Purple One’s Paisley Park studio complex to interview 
the eccentric musician. Highlights included Prince saying the internet hasn’t 
made any musicians rich, poking fun atRachel Dolezal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/20/rachel-dolezal-interview-vanity-fair>
 and breaking into song when asked questions he preferred not to answer.

… then he tweeted disparagingly about ticket touts  
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/13/prince-declares-war-on-touts-as-his-ticket-sales-are-postponed>

Fans hoping to nab tickets to Prince’s scheduled intimate piano gigs on Friday 
morning were left disappointed when company Ticketmasterpostponed ticket sales 
<https://twitter.com/TicketmasterUK/status/665094257011765248>. After the 
announcement, Prince tweeted a picture comparing ticket touts to vultures and 
scavengers, and republished other people’s tweets about their experiences 
struggling to get affordable tickets to his shows. For those who want to try 
again, Prince is due to play two shows each at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on 27 
November, London’s Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 29 November and Birmingham 
Symphony Hall on 1 December.

Spotify named its most-streamed song of all time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/12/spotify-most-streamed-track-all-time-major-lazer-lean-on>

It’s Lean On, by electronic music producers Major Lazer and DJ Snake, 
featuring singer-songwriter MØ. You may not have heard this song if you haven’t 
recently frequented parties hosted by people in their teens and early 20s – but 
I’ve watched a friend drunkenly play it at least three times in one evening, so 
I don’t doubt Spotify’s figures.

Queen are to headline Isle of Wight festival next year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/11/queen-isle-of-wight-festival-adam-lambert-brian-may-freddie-mercury>

The rock group, fronted by former American Idol contestant Adam Lambert, are 
to play their first UK festival headlining set in June. Guitarist Brian May 
said he reckoned “Freddie would have loved it”, though I’m not sure purists 
would consider this to even be a Queen gig without Mercury fronting the band. 
So far, the Sunday eveningIsle of Wight festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/isle-of-wight-festival> gig is the band’s 
only confirmed UK live date in 2016.

Alanis Morissette still plays fast and loose with the meaning of irony 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/11/isnt-it-ironic-alanis-morissette-vaping-uber-netflix-new-version-song>

It’s been 20 years since Morissette released her hugely successful album 
Jagged Little Pill. In that time she’s dabbled in acting, made more music and 
taken the time to humorously update the lyrics to single Ironic, on James 
Corden’s late-night talk show. Like the original song, this version blurs the 
line between situational irony – when an action has the opposite effect that 
you’d expect – and simple coincidence or misfortune. Morissette jokingly 
acknowledged the long-running debate around the song’s irony (or lack thereof), 
singing: “It’s singing ironic but there are no ironies.” Well played.

New Orleans R&B legend Allen Toussaint died, aged 77 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/10/allen-toussaint-dies-aged-77>


Toussaint, a songwriting and production pioneer and performer in his own 
right, died in Madrid on Monday, while on tour. He’dleft an indelible mark 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/nov/10/allen-toussaint-seven-of-his-greatest-songs>
 on the sound of New Orleans R&B over the course of his career, working with 
the likes of the Meters, Irma Thomas, Ernie K-Doe, Dr John and many others. 
Toussaint had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and made a 
Grammy awards trustee, and is survived by three children.

Former Motörhead drummer Phil Taylor died, aged 61 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/12/former-motorhead-drummer-phil-taylor-dies-aged-61>

Phil “Philthy Animal” Taylor died on Wednesday night, according to former 
bandmate “Fast” Eddie Clarke. According to Clarke, Taylor had been ill for some 
time. Taylor had pioneered thrash music’s double-bass drumming technique, and 
played on Motörhead’s seminal albums between 1975 and 1984 before rejoining the 
band in 1987 for a five-year period. This week also saw the death ofearly 
Beatles drummer Andy White
