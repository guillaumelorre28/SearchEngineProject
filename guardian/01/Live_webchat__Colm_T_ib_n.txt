High above the Thames, beached on the roof of the South Bank centre, sits the 
Room for London <http://www.aroomforlondon.co.uk/a-london-address>. For four 
days every month for the last year, writers and artists invited byArtangel 
<http://www.artangel.org.uk/>, have taken it in turns to spend time in the 
small one-bedroomed residence, to write about the space and London.

This month the boat welcomes Colm Tóibín 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/colm-toibin> aboard. Colm will 
be the last writer in residence and to mark the end of the project as well as 
his time in the boat, he'll be joining us and chatting to us live and answering 
your questions onMonday 10 December, 12-1pm.

You can ask Colm Tóibín any writing or Room for London-based question you 
like. Perhaps you'd like to ask him about one ofhis novels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/colm-toibin>, or maybe you'd 
like to quiz him about his collection of essaysNew Ways to Kill Your Mother: 
Writers and Their Families 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780670918164/new-ways-to-kill-your-mother-writers-and-their-families>
. Maybe you'd like to know if the solitude of the boat is conducive to his 
writing. Maybe you'd just like to know what he can see out of the window. 
Whatever your question, post it in the thread below now and come back on Monday 
lunchtime to join the conversation.
