Thank you for having the courage to put this on the Guardian's front pages! My 
question is: Government subsidies for fossil fuel extraction vs. renewable 
energy ought to be a hot election issue - how can we make it so?

The Guardian is something of a polarising brand. Climate change 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change> can be a polarising 
issue. Are you concerned that putting this issue front and centre may make some 
people think climate change is an issue only stereotypical 'Guardian readers' 
should care about? Is the Keep it in the Ground campaign trying to build broad 
public support, or galvanise those who already care?

Thanks for your comment. A few points:

- That may be true to some extent in the UK but the Guardian has a huge global 
readership (6m-7m per day) for whom that stereotype doesn't really apply.

- We are very much wanting to build a consensus around this issue. I feel 
passionately that the politicisation of this issue has been ahuge barrier to 
progress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/11/watermelon-climate-debate>
. Neither side of the political spectrum owns this issue or has a monopoly on 
solutions. On the first day of the project we had thispiece from Jonathan 
Freeland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/06/climate-activism-doomed-left-only-issue>
 arguing that the climate movement is doomed if it is a left only issue.

Right now, climate change has become an issue of the left. One look at the 
speakers lined up for today’s London rally confirms it: trade union leaders, 
the Labour MP John McDonnell and Russell Brand. In the US, climate scepticism 
has become one of the defining traits of the right, a more reliable marker even 
than attitudes to abortion or gun control.

This is a disaster. If the threat to our planet is a preoccupation confined to 
only one half of the political spectrum, meaningful action will never come. 
This has to be the cause of all humanity. That means a new, additional climate 
case has to be made, one that will appeal to the right – and come from the 
right. That’s hardly an impossibility. Who was the first world leader to 
dedicate a speech to climate change, but Margaret Thatcher in 1989? Angela 
Merkel is as sound as any left politician on the subject. Had John McCain 
beaten Barack Obama in 2008, the US would still have had a president who 
understands the climate crisis.

Lastly, we feel that if we did not mount a serious journalistic response to 
the biggest issue of our age it would be a dereliction of editorial duty.

Question: Where does the global biodiversity crisis (i.e., loss of wildlife, 
ecosystems, services, natural capital etc) fit in the scheme of things when 
compared with climate change (which is just one of the causes of this crisis)?

Good (and big) question. The two issues are inextricably linked of course 
because climate change is such animportant driver of species loss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/14/earth-faces-sixth-great-extinction-with-41-of-amphibians-set-to-go-the-way-of-the-dodo>
. Also, if we adopt the wrong solutions then we may inadvertently make the 
species crisis worse (eg chopping down natural habitats to grow biofuels).

WWF says that we have lost half of its wildlife in the last 40 years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/29/earth-lost-50-wildlife-in-40-years-wwf>
.

We plan to include species extinctions in our coverage. Watch this space.

Would it be more effective to increase taxes on fossil fuels? A question from 
EnviroCapitalist <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/3578530>, 
answered by Damian Carrington.

What will divestment achieve as long as the big state owned fossil fuel 
companies continue to produce.

The aim of divesting from, say Shell, is to make Shell produce less oil. That 
will put up the price and reduce demand - but the price rise and demand fall 
will be limited as companies like Gazprom and Saudi Aramco will increase 
production.

The main effect will a slight increase in price, a slight fall in demand, and 
an increase in wealth transfers to the major oil exporters.

Wouldn't it be more effective to increase taxes on fossil fuels? That at least 
would provide revenues to the Government, which could be used to cut other 
taxes. It would lead to a reduction in demand and a reduction in transfers to 
oil exporting countries.

good question

carbon taxes are advocated by many, including some fossil fuel companies 
themselves
but look at Australia to see how hard the fossil fuel industry fights, and how 
powerful they are, when any politician suggests implementing them

the aim of the divestment campaign is to highlight the fact that we have 
several times more fossil fuels in known reserves than we can burn safely, and 
the delegitimise the companies who are nonetheless spending billions looking 
for more

I've written more on the state-owned company question here

 with the fossil fuel companies they invest in is more effective in getting

they also won't disclose their full fossil fuel holdings, despite saying they 
are "transparent"

Thank you to the Guardian for bringing this campaign to the forefront of your 
newspaper. it is the reality check of the century indeed. I am curious about 
the reach of this campaign so far - among your readers and the general public. 
It is spreading here in Norway as well. Also, a follow up story on green 
companies and green solutions to do invest in would be great. They are out 
there, just not communicated well..

Thanks :)

There is indeed interesting action in Norway. Oslo is the first capital city 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/02/oslo-divests-from-coal-companies>
 in the world to make a commitment to divest. We have some reporting on the way 
about that.

We are going to be doing lots more reporting on what the alternative 
investments are and what are the green energy technologies that will provide 
the solutions.

Hi, regarding the first line of the campaign email you sent out "As 
yesterday's news from Vanuatu - where cyclone survivors have been reduced to 
drinking saltwater to stay alive - reminds us, the fight against climate change 
is urgent. " This is not true. Here is the fact of the matter from someone 
living in Vanuatu:

"I'm hearing reports of people drinking seawater. They seem ti ignore that our 
islands are largely porous limestone. The rain leeches down into the stone and 
exits at the shore. It is not only common, it's actually very safe to dig into 
the beach and tap these springs for drinking water. I know, because I have one 
such spring outside my house. Please people, try not to propagate this kind of 
ignorant alarmism."
https://www.facebook.com/HumansOfVanuatu 
<https://www.facebook.com/HumansOfVanuatu>

Please don't exaggerate to make your point - inaccuracies will be used as a 
weapon against you.

As you know, the BBC reported this 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-31917913>, based on the word of residents 
on the island of Moso. The reporter, John Donnison, was on the spot. If you 
look at his Twitter feedhttps://twitter.com/jondonnisonbbc 
<https://twitter.com/jondonnisonbbc> I don't think he has much need to

I suspect I am the only editor in the world to have owned not one but two G-Wiz
 <http://www.clean-transport.co.uk/e-cars/g-wiz/> . This was described as the 
worst car in the world in the 2997 Top Gear Awards before beingblown up by 
Richard Hammond <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear_(series_10)>using his 
model radio controlled car.

I mean, 2007, obviously. Though I expect Top Gear will still think it's the 
worst car in the world in 2997.

A question about our own advertising from connal99

Will The Guardian refuse advertising from fossil fuel companies? 

This would send a powerful signal that as an organisation you would not accept 
money from those engaged in continued climate destruction.

Fair question. As I wrote at the start, we're looking at our own investments. 
We publish anannual sustainability report  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/sustainability-report-2014-performance>
about the progress we're making on the cost and impact of our own operations. 
As for the advertising question, I'll discuss it with our commercial director. 
When I last saw him, he didn't think we took vast sums from fossil fuel 
companies!

Thanks for your support.

As the petition says 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/mar/16/keep-it-in-the-ground-guardian-climate-change-campaign>
 we are asking the two largest charitable foundations to first freeze their 
fossil fuel investments and then commit to divesting over 5 years.

We are under no illusion that is a huge ask. These are massive decisions 
involving vast amounts of money but we believe that the impacts of these 
investments clearly run counter to the aims and objectives of the Wellcome 
Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. If either or both were to 
decide to change their position it would have a huge impact on other 
foundations and other investors.

More generally, we want to highlight the issue and inject some energy into the 
response to climate change in a new way. The divestment movement is growing 
rapidly, but it is striking that it is only just on the radar for a lot of fund 
managers despitewarnings from the Bank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/03/bank-of-england-warns-of-financial-risk-from-fossil-fuel-investments>
 and others. We hope that this campaign will put the issue front and centre.

We will also be explaining to individuals how they can make they can divest 
their own pensions etc. and lobby for their employers and elected 
representatives to do the same. If readers decide to take that on, that will 
also be a success.

How are you working with Indigenous people and Africans in the diaspora to 
amplify their voices in this campaign to #KeepItInTheGround? After all this 
movement began in those communities. Some of the most affected by oil and gas 
extraction.

You make a very important point and we are very conscious that those voices 
need to be prominent in our campaign and reporting, and they will be.
The artwork used to illustrate one the major pieces that launched our campaign

alan, excuse my selfishness but today I had to take my wife to hospital, take 
and pick up 2 kids from school, take one kid to and from day care, take one kid 
to and from soccer training, do the grocery shopping and pick up dinner.

it's not practical to do that on a push bike and we live in a smaller city 
with limited to no public transport. I can barely afford to put petrol in the 
car as it is. won't leaving oil in the ground make the price of petrol rise and 
if so, what am I supposed to do?

given that a genuinely affordable electric family car could be years away and 
would in all likelihood be powered by a coal fired power station anyway, how do 
you propose average income earners will afford transport in the short to medium 
term if projects like these are wildly successful?

I drive a car, too. I, like you, would love a viable alternative. What are the 
levers to force action to solve this question? We haven't suggested divestment 
on its own is a magic wand. But, if successful, it would, we think, help change 
the terms of the debate.

Thanks for your support James. We wanted to keep the campaign relatively 
simple so we are not explicitly suggesting where the investments should move 
to. But you raise a good point. This is about the first steps in a huge shift 
away from an economy based on fossil fuels towards one based alternative energy.

That shift is beginning to happen. Investors ploughed $310bn into renewable 
energy last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/09/solar-power-drives-renewable-energy-investment-boom-2014>
, up 16% on the year before. And because of improvements in the technology, 
that money bought nearly twice as much renewable electricity capacity as in 
2011.

There is a strand of the rapidly growing divestment movement that advocates a 
Divest-Invest approach.

In my defence, I'd say the Guardian - with an environment staff of seven a 
monthly audience of 4m uniques - has taken the subject extremely seriously over 
the past 20 years. If you know of another paper with that kind of depth and 
range and commitment to the subject, I'd love to learn of it. We've also run 
campaigns in the past, such as theManchester report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-climate-change1>
 and the10:10 campa <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/10-10>ign. But me 
mea culpa as we kicked this thing off admitted that we have - in common with 
most media - failed to do justice to the seriousness of the subject.

Why focus on divestment from oil companies specifically? Alan Rusbridger

Why focus on disinvestment from oil companies, which will have no noticeable 
effect (using the tobacco companies as a guide) rather than going after the 
political parties, which really can change policies and the energy landscape? 
Aren't you just going for the easy sound-bite?

We did consider that question. I tried to explain our thinking in this piece  
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/16/argument-divesting-fossil-fuels-overwhelming-climate-change>

When, as Guardian colleagues, we first started discussing this climate change 
series, there were advocates for focusing the main attention on governments. 
States own much of the fossil fuels that can never be allowed to be dug up. 
Only states, it was argued, can forge the treaties that count. In the end the 
politicians will have to save us through regulation – either by limiting the 
amount of stuff that is extracted, or else by taxing, pricing and limiting the 
carbon that’s burned.


If journalism has so far failed to animate the public to exert sufficient 
pressure on politics through reporting and analysis, it seemed doubtful whether 
many people would be motivated by the idea of campaigning for a paragraph to be 
inserted into the negotiating text at the UN climate talks in Paris this 
December. So we turned to an area where campaigners have recently begun to have 
marked successes: divestment.

Thank you for having the courage to put this on the Guardian's front pages! My 
question is: Government subsidies for fossil fuel extraction vs. renewable 
energy ought to be a hot election issue - how can we make it so?

The Guardian is something of a polarising brand. Climate change 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change> can be a polarising 
issue. Are you concerned that putting this issue front and centre may make some 
people think climate change is an issue only stereotypical 'Guardian readers' 
should care about? Is the Keep it in the Ground campaign trying to build broad 
public support, or galvanise those who already care?

Thanks for your comment. A few points:

- That may be true to some extent in the UK but the Guardian has a huge global 
readership (6m-7m per day) for whom that stereotype doesn't really apply.

- We are very much wanting to build a consensus around this issue. I feel 
passionately that the politicisation of this issue has been ahuge barrier to 
progress 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/11/watermelon-climate-debate>
. Neither side of the political spectrum owns this issue or has a monopoly on 
solutions. On the first day of the project we had thispiece from Jonathan 
Freeland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/06/climate-activism-doomed-left-only-issue>
 arguing that the climate movement is doomed if it is a left only issue.

Right now, climate change has become an issue of the left. One look at the 
speakers lined up for today’s London rally confirms it: trade union leaders, 
the Labour MP John McDonnell and Russell Brand. In the US, climate scepticism 
has become one of the defining traits of the right, a more reliable marker even 
than attitudes to abortion or gun control.

This is a disaster. If the threat to our planet is a preoccupation confined to 
only one half of the political spectrum, meaningful action will never come. 
This has to be the cause of all humanity. That means a new, additional climate 
case has to be made, one that will appeal to the right – and come from the 
right. That’s hardly an impossibility. Who was the first world leader to 
dedicate a speech to climate change, but Margaret Thatcher in 1989? Angela 
Merkel is as sound as any left politician on the subject. Had John McCain 
beaten Barack Obama in 2008, the US would still have had a president who 
understands the climate crisis.

Lastly, we feel that if we did not mount a serious journalistic response to 
the biggest issue of our age it would be a dereliction of editorial duty.

Question: Where does the global biodiversity crisis (i.e., loss of wildlife, 
ecosystems, services, natural capital etc) fit in the scheme of things when 
compared with climate change (which is just one of the causes of this crisis)?

Good (and big) question. The two issues are inextricably linked of course 
because climate change is such animportant driver of species loss 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/14/earth-faces-sixth-great-extinction-with-41-of-amphibians-set-to-go-the-way-of-the-dodo>
. Also, if we adopt the wrong solutions then we may inadvertently make the 
species crisis worse (eg chopping down natural habitats to grow biofuels).

WWF says that we have lost half of its wildlife in the last 40 years

Would it be more effective to increase taxes on fossil fuels? A question from 
EnviroCapitalist <https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/3578530>, 
answered by Damian Carrington.

What will divestment achieve as long as the big state owned fossil fuel 
companies continue to produce.

The aim of divesting from, say Shell, is to make Shell produce less oil. That 
will put up the price and reduce demand - but the price rise and demand fall 
will be limited as companies like Gazprom and Saudi Aramco will increase 
production.

The main effect will a slight increase in price, a slight fall in demand, and 
an increase in wealth transfers to the major oil exporters.

Wouldn't it be more effective to increase taxes on fossil fuels? That at least 
would provide revenues to the Government, which could be used to cut other 
taxes. It would lead to a reduction in demand and a reduction in transfers to 
oil exporting countries.

good question

carbon taxes are advocated by many, including some fossil fuel companies 
themselves
but look at Australia to see how hard the fossil fuel industry fights, and how 
powerful they are, when any politician suggests implementing them

the aim of the divestment campaign is to highlight the fact that we have 
several times more fossil fuels in known reserves than we can burn safely, and 
the delegitimise the companies who are nonetheless spending billions looking 
for more

There is indeed interesting action in Norway. Oslo is the first capital city

Hi, regarding the first line of the campaign email you sent out "As 
yesterday's news from Vanuatu - where cyclone survivors have been reduced to 
drinking saltwater to stay alive - reminds us, the fight against climate change 
is urgent. " This is not true. Here is the fact of the matter from someone 
living in Vanuatu:

"I'm hearing reports of people drinking seawater. They seem ti ignore that our 
islands are largely porous limestone. The rain leeches down into the stone and 
exits at the shore. It is not only common, it's actually very safe to dig into 
the beach and tap these springs for drinking water. I know, because I have one 
such spring outside my house. Please people, try not to propagate this kind of 
ignorant alarmism."

Thanks for your support.

As the petition says 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/mar/16/keep-it-in-the-ground-guardian-climate-change-campaign>
 we are asking the two largest charitable foundations to first freeze their 
fossil fuel investments and then commit to divesting over 5 years.

We are under no illusion that is a huge ask. These are massive decisions 
involving vast amounts of money but we believe that the impacts of these 
investments clearly run counter to the aims and objectives of the Wellcome 
Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. If either or both were to 
decide to change their position it would have a huge impact on other 
foundations and other investors.

More generally, we want to highlight the issue and inject some energy into the 
response to climate change in a new way. The divestment movement is growing 
rapidly, but it is striking that it is only just on the radar for a lot of fund 
managers despitewarnings from the Bank of England 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/03/bank-of-england-warns-of-financial-risk-from-fossil-fuel-investments>
 and others. We hope that this campaign will put the issue front and centre.

We will also be explaining to individuals how they can make they can divest 
their own pensions etc. and lobby for their employers and elected 
representatives to do the same. If readers decide to take that on, that will 
also be a success.

alan, excuse my selfishness but today I had to take my wife to hospital, take

to and from soccer training, do the grocery shopping and pick up dinner.

it's not practical to do that on a push bike and we live in a smaller city 
with limited to no public transport. I can barely afford to put petrol in the 
car as it is. won't leaving oil in the ground make the price of petrol rise and 
if so, what am I supposed to do?

given that a genuinely affordable electric family car could be years away and 
would in all likelihood be powered by a coal fired power station anyway, how do 
you propose average income earners will afford transport in the short to medium

I drive a car, too. I, like you, would love a viable alternative. What are the

Thanks for your support James. We wanted to keep the campaign relatively 
simple so we are not explicitly suggesting where the investments should move 
to. But you raise a good point. This is about the first steps in a huge shift 
away from an economy based on fossil fuels towards one based alternative energy.

That shift is beginning to happen. Investors ploughed $310bn into renewable 
energy last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/09/solar-power-drives-renewable-energy-investment-boom-2014>
, up 16% on the year before. And because of improvements in the technology, 
that money bought nearly twice as much renewable electricity capacity as in 
2011.

There is a strand of the rapidly growing divestment movement that advocates a 
Divest-Invest approach.

In my defence, I'd say the Guardian - with an environment staff of seven a 
monthly audience of 4m uniques - has taken the subject extremely seriously over 
the past 20 years. If you know of another paper with that kind of depth and 
range and commitment to the subject, I'd love to learn of it. We've also run 
campaigns in the past, such as theManchester report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-climate-change1>
 and the10:10 campa <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/10-10>ign. But me 
mea culpa as we kicked this thing off admitted that we have - in common with 
most media - failed to do justice to the seriousness of the subject.

We did consider that question. I tried to explain our thinking in this piece  
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/16/argument-divesting-fossil-fuels-overwhelming-climate-change>

When, as Guardian colleagues, we first started discussing this climate change 
series, there were advocates for focusing the main attention on governments. 
States own much of the fossil fuels that can never be allowed to be dug up. 
Only states, it was argued, can forge the treaties that count. In the end the 
politicians will have to save us through regulation – either by limiting the 
amount of stuff that is extracted, or else by taxing, pricing and limiting the 
carbon that’s burned.


If journalism has so far failed to animate the public to exert sufficient 
pressure on politics through reporting and analysis, it seemed doubtful whether 
many people would be motivated by the idea of campaigning for a paragraph to be 
inserted into the negotiating text at the UN climate talks in Paris this 
December. So we turned to an area where campaigners have recently begun to have 
marked successes: divestment.
