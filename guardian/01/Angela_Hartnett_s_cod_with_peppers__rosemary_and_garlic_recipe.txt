Sustainable cod is easy to source and delicious with roasted peppers.

(Serves 4)
300g new potatoes
Maldon sea salt
100ml olive oil
15ml white wine vinegar
2 romano peppers
1 sprig rosemary
1 clove garlic, crushed
4 cod fillets, about 120g each
Handful of flat-leaf parsley, chopped 
Zest of one lemon

Add the new potatoes to a small saucepan filled with cold water, season, bring 
to the boil and simmer until cooked.

Reserve some oil for cooking, then beat the rest together with the white wine 
vinegar until emulsified.

Place the peppers in a baking tray with the rosemary, garlic, a splash of oil 
and some sea salt, then put in the oven on a medium to high heat until the skin 
blisters. Remove from the oven (leaving oven on), place in a bowl and cover 
with cling film (they will continue cooking and it will be easier to peel 
them). Allow to cool slightly, peel the skins, remove the seeds, and cut into 
strips.

Add a splash of oil to a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, season the cod 
and place skin side down for two minutes, followed by four or five minutes in 
the hot oven, depending on the thickness of the fillets.

Drain and halve the potatoes, mix with the peppers and vinaigrette, place in a 
large dish with the cod on top. Finish with the chopped parsley and lemon zest.
