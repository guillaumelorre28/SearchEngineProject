Asil Nadir <https://www.theguardian.com/business/asil-nadir>, the tycoon 
jailed in Britain for stealing millions from his business empire, has been 
removed from the UK to be transferred to prison in Turkey.

He was convicted in August 2012 of 10 charges

 of theft amounting to £28.8m from his Polly Peck International (PPI) business 
empire in the late 1980s.

Nadir was jailed for 10 years after a trial at the Old Bailey, and ordered to 
pay £5m in compensation. After repaying the money, as well as £2m in legal aid, 
Nadir was flown out of Britain on Thursday, the Ministry of Justice said.

A spokesman said: “It is right that foreign criminals are properly punished 
but not at the expense of British taxpayers. This government is committed to 
removing foreign criminals to their own countries. Since Asil Nadir has now 
repaid the £2m he owed the Legal Aid Agency, plus £5m in compensation he paid 
earlier, arrangements were made with the Turkish government for his removal as 
part of our prisoner transfer agreement.”

The former fugitive fled Britain for his native northern Cyprus in May 1993, 
but returned voluntarily in August 2010 to face trial. He had been a wealthy 
man and had an extravagant lifestyle when he stole millions from his business 
empire.

Following Nadir’s conviction of 10 counts of theft from PPI between 1987 and 
1990, Judge Mr Justice Holroyde told him: “It seems to me that you already had 
an extravagant lifestyle as a result of your success in business. It follows 
that you were a wealthy man who stole out of pure greed.”

Four months after his conviction he was ordered

despite his claims that he was penniless, to pay back some of the millions he 
stole or face more time behind bars.
