The bracken is past its best, withered to a dull, uninteresting brown; its 
crippled stems, stiff and splintering, prick painfully as we wade through the 
wood where so short a time ago the fronds were breast-high. Theferns  
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/28/gardens-ferns-shade>vary 
in autumn beauty according to their kind, some remaining dark green when their 
tips are curled and dead, grey or almost black; the osmunda, however, rightly 
named royal, increases in beauty as it ages. It is now a splendid golden 
orange, a wonderful colour when the sunâ€™s rays, somewhat rarely, light it up.

Amongst the beeches the dappled fallow deer, rustling through the leaf-drifts, 
slowly approach the carriage-drive through the park, but immediately they reach 
the gravel bound rapidly across. The bucks, full-antlered, call the does, as if 
urging haste; their voices are a strange mixture of bleat and grunt. These 
bucks are still excited by recent nuptial contests, but the successful ones 
have collected and retain their harems. After racing over the road the herd at 
once slows down to a walk on feeling grass beneath the feet, and the bucks and 
does alike pass on with a light, elastic gait. It is curious that semi-domestic 
animals should be so nervous when crossing a man-trodden pathway, for they pay 
little attention to passers-by when they are feeding a few yards away.
