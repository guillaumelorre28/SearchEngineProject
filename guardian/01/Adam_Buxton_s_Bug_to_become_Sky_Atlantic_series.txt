Adam Buxton's live music video show, Bug <http://www.bugvideos.co.uk/>, is to 
be adapted for a TV series for Sky Atlantic.

The BSkyB-owned subscription channel has ordered an eight-part series of 
30-minute shows to be presented by Buxton and broadcast in the autumn.

Adam Buxton's Bug will celebrate "innovative and groundbreaking videos, 
include special guests from the world of music videos and highlight the 
funniest comments on the web", according to Sky. Each episode will also feature 
an original music video created by Buxton and leading directors.

"I tell people that Bug is like going round to a friend's house and having 
them open up their laptop and show you interesting and amusing things they've 
found or made, except not as tedious and shit as that sounds," he said.

Buxton, the sometime co-presenter of a BBC 6 Music 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/6music> show with Joe Cornish, has been 
touring live Bug shows for the past five years.

Adam Buxton's Bug was ordered by Antonia Hurford-Jones, Sky entertainment 
commissioning editor, and will be made by independent producer Burning Bright. 
Clive Tulloh will executive produce for Burning Bright.
