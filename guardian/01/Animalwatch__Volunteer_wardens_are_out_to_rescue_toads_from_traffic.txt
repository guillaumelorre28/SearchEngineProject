Toads are on the move. The recent balmy weather was the starting pistol for 
one of the greatest wildlife phenomena in Britain, when thousands of toads come 
out of hibernation and waddle their way to ponds for breeding. Toads always 
return to the ponds where they were born, and warm and moist nights are ideal 
for their mass migration. Unfortunately many of the migration routes have to 
cross roads where toad casualties are high, but the charity Froglife uses 
reports of the mass casualties to get special road signs put up, warning 
motorists about the toads crossing. Volunteer toad wardens also carry the 
creatures to safety, and last year gave 73,000 toads safe passage â€” a national 
map of over 800 toad crossings can be foundhere <http://bit.ly/dZEvgU>. And in 
Oxton, Nottinghamshire, one particular road is closed to all traffic in March 
for the toads to cross safely.

Frogs are also making their way to ponds for breeding, but they go to any 
nearby water they can find, which is why having a pond in a garden encourages 
frogs.

Fortunately the cold spell this month was too short to do much harm to pond 
life. But the worsening drought in southern Britain could dry up ponds, and 
newts may be especially vulnerable because their breeding season only begins 
later this month. On the other hand, dry ponds later on could help the larvae 
of toads and frogs to survive, by avoiding being eaten by fish.
