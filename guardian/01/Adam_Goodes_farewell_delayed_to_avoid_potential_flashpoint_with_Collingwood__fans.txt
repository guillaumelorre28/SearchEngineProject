Adam Goodes’ final farewell to Sydney Swans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sydney-swans> fans will be put back two 
weeks in an effort to avoid further jeering from Collingwood supporters.

Goodes, who announced his retirement after full-time in last year’s semi-final 
loss to North Melbourne, missed the opportunity for a lap of honour after the 
match.

Normally, he would wave goodbye to Swans supporters at their first home match 
of the season, but Sydney have opted to wait until round three when they take 
on GWS at the SCG to pay tribute to the club legend.

Goodes will be joined in the lap of honour by fellow retiree Mike Pyke.

“I think it’s important Swans fans get the chance to say goodbye to Adam and 
Adam gets a chance to say goodbye to the fans,” Swans CEO Andrew Ireland told 
News Corp Australia.

“The fans have been so supportive of both Adam and Mike throughout their 
careers and this will give all parties the opportunity to show their feelings. 
It will happen at half time of the round three match against GWS.”

It was in a match against Collingwood at the MCG in 2013 that the two-times 
Brownlow medallist singled out a female teenage Magpies supporter for calling 
him an ape.

From there, Goodes was named Australian of the Year but also attracted a large 
amount of jeering from opposition fans.

It reached such a point in 2015 that Goodes opted to sit out a round-18 match 
last year against the Adelaide Crowds, before he eventually retired from the 
sport at the end of the season.
