Marguerite of Valois, known within her family as Margot, was queen of Navarre 
from 1572 and of France from 1589. She was famed as a poet, a leader of fashion 
and a political operator. After her death in 1615, she achieved further fame 
when her juicy memoirs were published.

Marriage
 Marriage plot … Catherine de'Medici presses Margot into an inter-faith match 
The film begins with the Catholic Margot (Isabelle Adjani) reluctantly 
marrying the Huguenot King Henri of Navarre (who should be 19, but is played by 
the 44-year-old Daniel Auteuil). In the film, as in real life, this causes 
trouble. The inter-faith match has been fixed by Margot's mother Catherine 
de'Medici (played brilliantly by Virna Lisi as thewicked queen 
<http://www.freewebs.com/disneywicca/snowwhite.htm> from Snow White), who has 
thoughtfully murdered Henri's mother as a wedding gift. Historians generally 
regard the story that Catherine sent Jeanne of Navarre a pair of poisoned 
gloves as fiction.

Sex
 Family affair … was Margot was shagging her brothers? Photo: Allstar 
According to this movie, any two people who weren't killing each other at the 
French court were probably shagging. Margot is shagging the Duke of Guise. Her 
new husband, Henri of Navarre, is shaggingCharlotte de Sauve 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_de_Sauve>. It is heavily implied that 
Margot and her royal brothers have all been shagging each other. Margot's 
second surviving brother, theDuke of Anjou 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis,_Duke_of_Anjou>, is not only the 
favourite child of Catherine de'Medici, but is possibly shagging her too. Most 
of this is malicious rumour, stoked enthusiastically by novelistAlexandre Dumas 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/alexandredumaspere>. Dumas wrote the novel on 
which this movie is based almost three centuries after the actual events 
therein. If you like breathless sixteenth-century gossip, the more common story 
about the Duke of Anjou (later Henri III of France) was that he was gay.

More sex
 The lady doth Protestant … Margot and her Huguenot, Joseph de la Môle 
Almost the only people who aren't shagging or killing each other are Margot 
and her husband. Margot meant to spend her wedding night with the Duke of 
Guise, but he's sulking because she married someone else. She roams the streets 
looking for a replacement. Fortuitously, the streets are full of hunky 
Protestants lounging around in billowing linen shirts and leather bloomers, all 
looking pretty much up for it despite their presumably puritanical leanings. 
Margot picks the hunkiest,Joseph de la Môle 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Boniface_de_La_M%C3%B4le> (Vincent Pérez). 
La Môle was a real person, and is often listed among Marguerite's reputed 
lovers (though no historian claims they met under these circumstances). That's 
about as far as the reality goes.

Violence
 Battle royale … violence sweeps Paris days after Margot weds. Photo: Allstar 
Just six days after Margot and Henri marry, the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre> is unleashed on 
the Huguenots in Paris. During the fighting, La Môle is multiply wounded by 
marauding Catholics. He staggers into Margot's bedroom and collapses. This is 
based approximately on a real story: the morning after the massacre, a 
gentleman wounded by sword and pike was chased into Marguerite's chamber by 
four archers. "I screamed aloud, and he cried out likewise," she admitted in 
her memoirs, "for our fright was mutual." When they both calmed down, she saved 
his life. But she named the man as Monsieur de Teian – not La Môle.

Death
 Royal blood … Charles IX endures a gruesome death from arsenic poisoning 
Plotting to poison Henri of Navarre, Catherine de'Medici infuses a book with 
arsenic and leaves it for him. Instead, her own son Charles IX picks it up. The 
king endures a slow and disgusting death, convulsing and literally sweating 
blood. Both he and Margot wear white for the duration of his torment, 
apparently with the sole purpose of providing a graphic image for the film 
poster when he bleeds copiously all over them both. By contrast, the American 
poster instead featured Margot and La Môle looking all lovey-dovey, wrapped in 
a comfy blanket. Pity anyone who turned up to La Reine Margot expecting 
heartwarming romance and instead got two hours of stabbing, shooting, goring, 
poisoning, incest, beheading and defenestration, ending with the king of France 
turning into a human blood fountain. The real Charles IX did indeed die 
horribly at the age of 23, but the cause was probably tuberculosis.

Verdict
 Fairy tale … La Reine Margot's wicked queen, played by Virna Lisi 
La Reine Margot is a spirited adaptation of Alexandre Dumas's novel. Both 
novel and movie, though, are rambunctiously fictional versions of history.
