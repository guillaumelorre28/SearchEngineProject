1. Whitney Museum reopening
New York

The opening of the new Whitney Museum, in Manhattan’s Meatpacking district, 
last May was the event of the year. Living, as Londoners now do, in the shadow 
of the sci-fi spire of Renzo Piano’s Shard of Doom, I feared that his museum 
would be yet one more hubristic, grandiose architectural folly. Instead, 
Piano’s building is a ship afloat between the Hudson and the city. Light from 
the river gets sucked in at one end of the building, while at the other, the 
layered, open sculpture decks rise above the High Line, in a great dialogue 
with the rooftops and fire escapes beyond. You never forget where you are. Even 
inside the building, the art is in conversation with the city where so much of 
it has been made.

The Whitney’s move downtown was considered controversial by those who loved 
Marcel Breuer’s austere, modernist bunker on the Upper East Side. What the new 
Whitney’s opening show ably demonstrated was that the previous building had 
been unable to show more than a fraction of its holdings of 20th- and 
21st-century American painting, sculpture, photography, drawing and artefacts.

The opening show, America Is Hard to See, told a story of US art in a series 
of chapters that went beyond the usual trudge through movements to include 
their wider cultural contexts. History is never a smooth transition of one damn 
thing after another, but is filled with conflicts, parallel and antithetical 
diversions. Many of the works on show had rarely, if ever, left the museum’s 
vaults.

Art’s relationship to Hollywood, to the prairies, to interwar 
industrialisation and to the civil rights movement all got a look in. There was 
also a sobering section on art in the time of Aids. It was a time of terrible 
losses, but also of community, which resonated very strongly in the 
neighbourhood where the new Whitney stands. All this, and more, was managed 
with a light hand in the opening show.

There is a lesson here for Tate Britain, which this year lost and gained a 
director. With its relentless historical timeline, the display of Tate’s 
permanent collection – and particularly of art since 1900 – is more than hard 
to see, let alone look at. Much remains in storage. The enormous resources of 
the gallery’s collection could be used to tell multiple stories, just as the 
Whitney is now able to do. This was both my museum – and my show – of the year.

 Full-blooded … Rhythm Colour No 1076, 1939, by Sonia Delaunay. Photograph: 
Centre National des Arts Plastiques/Fonds National d’Art Contemporain, Paris 
As a female artist, Sonia Delauney had to overcome not only the gender roles 
of her time, but also art history. Only now can we appreciate her in full as a 
painter, textile and dress designer, illustrator and photographer. She even 
turned her family apartment into a kind of domestic installation, and in some 
ways became a pop artist avant la lettre. It is not that Delaunay was in any 
way an undiscovered genius but more that her full-blooded and often ravishing 
output shows an artist who fought to extend her art by any means possible.Read

 Cavalier, funning, touching … Antonia Zárate, circa 1805, by Francisco Goya. 
Photograph: National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin 
The works were hung too close, there was much that was missing or unavailable, 
but Goya is always Goya – no matter how good or bad the exhibition. And in the 
end it didn’t matter. Kings, queens, courtiers, commissions, friends and 
enemies and the artist himself appear and reappear throughout the exhibition. 
Goya was a jobbing painter much of the time, but every turn of the brush 
follows his perceptive and sometimes hurried gaze. He could be cavalier, funny 
and touching. Coming out, I just wanted to go and look at more Goya. So what if 
the anatomy sometimes goes awry, or the feet don’t always touch the ground. The 
exhibition continues until 10 January.Read the full review

 Superb conjunctions … La Bocca/Bosch, 2005, by Zoe Leonard at Slip of the 
Tongue. Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian 
While the Venice Biennale roared and postured on, Vietnamese-born artist Danh 
Vō (who also represented Denmark) curated this marvellous exhibition in the 
François Pinault Collection’s Punta della Dogana. Filling the rambling building 
with new works and old, from a Giovanni Bellini Head of Christ to Nancy Spero’s 
Artaud Codex, it included dozens of unlikely things – whether medieval 
illuminated manuscripts or Lee Lozano’s statements of withdrawal from the art 
world in 1992. Artists frequently make the best curators. While most of the 
biennale has by now evaporated, I am still thinking about these superb 
conjunctions. The exhibition continues until 10 January.Read the full review

 Powerful and considered … Tree, 2009-10 and 2015, by Ai Weiwei. Photograph: 
Jens Ziehe 
This exhibition by Ai Weiwei – often derided as a trickster with an inflated 
reputation as the most public dissident Chinese artist – was powerful, playful, 
angry and considered. For all his critiques of present-day Chinese society, of 
the “tofu-dregs” construction of the schools that collapsed during the Sichuan 
earthquake, and his wilful destruction of Neolithic ceramic pots, Ai’s work 
also honours traditional craftsmanship and artisanal labour. This was a great 
show on all kinds of levels. It had everything from terrific craftsmanship and 
piles of ceramic mitten crabs, to dioramas of the artist’s imprisonment. 
Leaving the exhibition, I passed an elderly pair of visitors and overheard the 
woman say to her companion: “I loved that jade dildo!” He replied: “I preferred 
the handcuffs.”Read the full review

 Beguiles and astonishes … Conversation Piece, Dublin, 1994 (detail), by Juan 
Muñoz. Photograph: Attilio Maranzano/The Estate of Juan Muñoz 
So much of the power of his work depended on Muñoz’s acute feel for space and 
objects, and visual and psychological drama, that it seemed perilous to 
recreate and reinstall his 2001 Turbine Hall commission, with its grey figures, 
imaginary architecture and optical illusions, without him. The artist died soon 
after the Tate Modern installation opened. Fourteen years on, Double Bind 
worked even more impressively in this vast industrial hangar on the outskirts 
of Milan, where it was joined by the artist’s ventriloquist dummies, his 
laughing crowds and hanging acrobats. Muñoz could be sinister and 
carnivalesque, dramatic and quiet, and his work still has a capacity to beguile 
and astonish.Read the full review

 The mind at work … Untitled #1, 2003, by Agnes Martin. Photograph: Fondation 
Louis Vuitton/Artists Rights Society 
What a delight Agnes Martin’s retrospective was. After a while, you got 
accustomed to her quiet voice, her hand-drawn grids and rows and pale colours 
that opened up like beatific grins. Her falterings and deviation from the 
strict geometries of her art gave it life. You could never forget that the 
regularity of her canvases, and the insistent measurements and repetition, were 
as natural as breathing or walking and were not mechanical at all. Martin honed 
things to a beautiful bareness that took you to roads crossing a prairie, long 
horizons, sparse places that were never empty. Forget mindfulness. This was a 
mind at work – and you had to work, too.Read the full review

 As strange as the world itself … Papagaio by João Maria Gusmão + Pedro Paiva. 
In February, Portuguese artists transformed Camden Arts Centre into a mad 
cinema filled with whirring projectors, optical illusions, parrots and smoking 
cyclists, wobbly suns and fried eggs. There was voodoo, there was a bald man 
having a haircut. Sometimes you had to peek through holes drilled through the 
walls, or swivel on little seats as one film ended on one wall and another 
began behind you. I felt I was being strangled in celluloid, and re-enchanted 
with the awe audiences of early cinema must have felt. It was wilful and mad – 
and as strange and unaccountable as the world itself, if we allow ourselves to 
look.Review the full review

 Whispers and echoes of the artist … NOW, 2015, by Chantal Akerman. Photograph: 
Sara Cuono 
Opening less than a month after the artist killed herself on 5 October, this 
survey of the legendary Belgian film-maker’s installation works was a moving 
experience. Akerman was everywhere, onscreen and behind the camera; her voice 
whispered and echoed through the cavernous space. We glimpsed her in her 
apartment, everyday life passing by. As she read a long story about her mother, 
she was almost drowned out by the roar of explosions and gunfire of her final 
work NOW – which premiered at the 2015 Venice Biennale – with its soundtrack of 
war and its hectic footage shot from vehicles hurtling over unnamed empty 
deserts.Read the full review

 Grandeur and a disturbing grace … Crossroads, 1976, by Bruce Conner 
Thirty-seven minutes long, Crossroads by Bruce Conner, who died in 2008, is a 
film of terrible beauty. Counterpointed by Patrick Gleeson and Terry Riley’s 
bubbling soundtrack, the American artist’s newly restored, unforgettable 1976 
film has both grandeur and a disturbing grace. Using archival footage of the 
first nuclear tests conducted at Bikini Atoll in the summer of 1946, Crossroads 
records a nuclear detonation 90 feet below a fleet of decayed and abandoned 
naval ships. In many respects, Crossroads is a found film. “All I added was the 
splices,” Conner once remarked. Of course, he did more than that. The artist 
presents us not just with an event but with the new condition of the postwar 
world. I still can’t watch it without feeling overwhelmed.Read the full review
