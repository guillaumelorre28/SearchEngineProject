Did he jump or was he pushed? Or was it a bit of both?

Jonathan Ross said this morning:  
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/07/jonathan-ross-quits-bbc>
 "Over the last two weeks I have decided not to renegotiate when my current 
contract comes to an end ... I would like to make it perfectly clear that no 
negotiations ever took place and that my decision is not financially motivated.
"I signed my current contract with the BBC having turned down more lucrative 
offers from other channels because it was where I wanted to be and – as I have 
said before – would happily have stayed there for any fee they cared to offer, 
but there were other considerations." 
He doesn't say what the "other considerations" were. The BBC seems to have 
been caught on the hop bythe statement he gave to the Press Association 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/07/jonathan-ross-bbc-resignation-statement>
, putting their release out 30 minutes later.

There is no doubt that for the past few years Ross has been a leitmotif for 
those who wish to attack theBBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> for its 
lack of morals and its spendthrift ways.

His £16.9m three-year BBC contract made him a poster child for those who felt 
that the corporation was too free and easy with licence fee payers' money and 
used it to squeeze commercial rivals. It is true to say that the deal was 
signed before the global financial meltdown, but it always seemed excessive. 
The party line has been that the BBC wasn't the highest bidder for his 
services. Industry sources say that this honour fell to Andy Duncan'sChannel 4 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4>.

But when Ross and Russell Brand decided to make an ill-thought-out phone call 
to Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/29/jonathan-ross-russell-brand-suspended>
, the BBC was put under enormous pressure to curb the activities of its biggest 
(and most overpaid) star. The BBC wasfined £150,000 by Ofcom over Sachsgate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/03/russell-brand-jonathan-ross-bbc-fine>
.

Since Sachsgate <https://www.theguardian.com/media/sachsgate> Ross has 
appeared straitjacketed in his interviewing style, unable to push the 
boundaries of taste. Without the ability to be rude, he has been stilted.

While other BBC stars have been taking pay cuts, there has been little sense 
that the BBC was even interested in a new deal with Ross.

Insiders told MediaGuardian that Ross was willing to take a pay cut 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/dec/17/jonathan-ross-bbc-pay-deal>, but 
no formal talks were held. So now Ross appears to have made the BBC's mind up 
for them. This certainly saves the corporation the embarrassment of sacking 
him. But it also makes the BBC look indecisive.

Maybe the BBC director general, Mark Thompson, is hoping that this is the 
least controversial way to part with the presenter. Ross can now go looking for 
a new broadcaster. It seems unlikely that ITV or Channel 4 could afford him 
(certainly not at his old rates), and why would they want him? Sky might come 
a-courting, though. He is the sort of big name they crave (see also Davina 
McCall, thought of as hugely popular but actually just the host of a prime-time 
show which would be popular anyway).
