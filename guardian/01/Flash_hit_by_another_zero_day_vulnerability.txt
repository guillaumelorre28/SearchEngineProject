Yet again, Adobe’s Flash plugin has been hit by a “zero-day” exploit, meaning 
that even users with a fully up-to-date installation of the software are 
vulnerable to attacks.

Hackers exploiting the vulnerability can install software on users’ computers 
against their will, and at least one group is doing just that,according to 
security researchers at Trend Micro

.

The hacking campaign began with phishing emails sent out using subject lines 
such as “Syrian troops make gains as Putin defends air strikes” and “Israel 
launches airstrikes on targets in Gaza”. Those emails contain links to websites 
hosting the exploit, and so when a user with flash installed clicks on the 
link, the malware is installed on their computer.

The vulnerability is just the latest in a long string of weaknesses from 
Flash. In July,the company was forced to issue an urgent patch

 after another zero day vulnerability came to light following the hack of 
hackers-for-hire Hacking Team; and in June, Adobe barely beat the bad guys to 
the punch, issuing a patch for another critical weaknessjust days before

 it began being exploited by hackers in the wild.

As a result, the news has led to renewed calls for users to uninstall Flash.

The plugin, once single-handedly responsible for the rise of online video, has 
been showing its age in the era of mobiles. The iPhone, which has never 
supported Flash video, has been the catalyst for an increasing number of sites 
dropping support.

In January this year, YouTube announced it would stop serving videos using 
Flash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/30/flash-youtube-nostalgia> to 
anyone with a browser that supported modern streaming technology. And in August,
Amazon announced it would block the use of Flash in advertising

 on its sites.
