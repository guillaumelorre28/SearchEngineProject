When the Guardian first book award was launched in 1999, Zadie Smith was a 
smart student still waiting to be published, and a shocking account of the 
Rwandan genocidecaused a stand-off 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/03/guardianfirstbookaward1999.gurardianfirstbookaward>
 between judges and reading groups before narrowly beating David Mitchell’s 
first novel to the inaugural prize.

The Rwanda book was Philip Gourevitch’s magisterial We Wish to Inform You that 
Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/mar/13/guardianfirstbookaward1999.gurardianfirstbookaward>
. Mitchell’s debut wasGhostwritten 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/aug/08/guardianfirstbookaward1999.guardianfirstbookaward>
, which some fans still maintain is his finest work, and Smith would burst on 
to the literary scene in 2000 to take the prize withWhite Teeth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/22/fiction.zadiesmith>.

In its 16 years, the £10,000 prize – which is judged with help from 
Waterstones reading groups across the country – has gone to seven works of 
non-fiction, five novels, three short-story collections, and one graphic novel.


Proud as we are of every one of those winners, each was selected from a 
shortlist and it’s in the shortlists that the soul of any prize lives. Naomi 
Klein, Hari Kunzru,Eleanor Catton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/eleanor-catton> and Hisham Matar are among 
the writers who made their first appearances on ours.

As did Dave Eggers, who has abundantly vindicated our hunch that he was more 
than the brat that the title of his memoir debut – A Heartbreaking Work of 
Staggering Genius – might suggest, and Susanna Clarke, whose 2004 shortlistee, 
Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, has only nowmade it to television 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/02/neil-gaiman-why-i-love-jonathan-strange-and-mr-norrell>
.

As admission opens for entries to the 17th prize, we’ve been delving into the
