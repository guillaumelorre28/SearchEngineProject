How did you become a wildlife ranger?

The best way to get involved in any wildlife- or land-based career is to 
volunteer. academic knowledge and Qualifications can get you a long way, but 
helping out at your local wildlife or conservation organisation is vital. Many 
have a very competitive volunteer base, so enthusiasm is key! Unsociable hours 
are inevitable (wildlife doesn't care about your tea-time), but it is very 
rewarding: you learn so much by meeting people out in the field.

What animal or bird were you most excited to spot in an English forest?

Wow, that's hard! I remember being amazed when I saw my first jay. Though 
quite common, I had never seen one and had just started taking an interest in 
birdwatching. The blue streak makes them a little exotic and the screeching is 
quite alarming, so I was caught off guard. I love that they are in Blackwood; 
it reminds me of how I started.

What animals do you still most want to spot?

Grey whales – despite a totally irrational phobia of cetaceans.

What equipment do you always carry?

Small binoculars and my phone – which is my camera, my ID guide, my lifeline! 
If you have a good spot or a quick snap, you can always go back with more 
equipment/bigger binoculars.

Do you have another favourite English forest?

There's a small copse, Ower Wood, in the grounds of Sparsholt where I studied. 
It's very dear to me as it's where I learned to identify plants and trees 
seriously; where I saw so many "firsts"; and where I have spent many hours with 
my daughter in snatched moments of peace. It's sentimental for many reasons.

Besides wildlife, what's your favourite other forest pastime?

I'm a geocacher and a bit of a Baggins: I love a good barefoot stroll through 
the woods (with several meal stops, of course).
