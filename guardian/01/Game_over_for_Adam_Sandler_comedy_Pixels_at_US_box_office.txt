Analysts suggest the weak return could spell “game over” for the Billy Madison 
comic as a major Hollywood player after a run of weakly performing films. 
Pixels, the poorly reviewed story of an alien invasion by beings resembling 
1980s video game icons such as Pac Man and Donkey Kong, had been much hyped 
with studio Sony declaring in March that the debut trailer for the film had
smashed 24-hour viewing records 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/20/pixels-avengers-2-adam-sandler-box-office-trailer-smashes-records>
. Predictions that the $88m budget movie could be one of the year’s highest 
grossing now seem spectacularly far fetched and Sandler may be thankful that he
recently signed a deal for streaming service Netflix 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/adam-sandler-netflix-movie-deal> 
to finance and release his next four films after 2014 rom com Blended, 2012’s 
That’s My Boy and 2011’s Jack and Jill all struggled at the box office.

Ant-Man <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ant-man> instead emerged as the 
weekend’s big winner after taking another $24.7m for a two-week total of $106m 
in first place. The superhero tale remains an underperformer in comparison to 
recent Marvel efforts, but a two-week global take of $226.4m worldwide against 
a shooting budget of just $130m suggests this will be another financial success 
for the Disney-owned studio.

Of other new entries this week, the boxing drama Southpaw ($16.5m in fifth) 
surprisingly beat young adult drama Paper Towns ($12.5m in sixth) despite 
middling reviews. Antoine Fuqua’s film, featuringJake Gyllenhaal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jake-gyllenhaal> as a boxing champion who 
must fight his way back to the top after experiencing tragedy, also stars 
Rachel McAdams, Forest Whitaker and Naomie Harris.

Paper Towns is based on the novel by John Green, whose novel The Fault in Our 
Starswas adapted for one of the biggest sleeper box office hits of 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/04/the-fault-in-our-stars-hit-summer-social-media-john-green>
, taking more than $300m worldwide. On that basis, the new film, which stars 
Nat Wolff and Britain’s Cara Delevingne, has so far proved a disappointment 
despite semi-decent reviews. Wolff plays a high school student roped into a 
series of revenge prank attacks by popular Margo (Delevingne) against the 
friends who have betrayed her.

The top five was completed by animated blockbuster sequel Minions in third 
place, with another $22m in its third week on release for a north American 
total of $261.5m, andAmy Schumer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amy-schumer> comedy Trainwreck in fourth, 
with $17.2m this time around for a two week total of $61.5m.


The Thursday night fatal shooting of two filmgoers at a cinema in Louisiana by 
a gunman who later turned the weapon on himself does not appear to have damaged
Trainwreck <https://www.theguardian.com/film/trainwreck>, which was screening 
at the time. But analysts believe numbers for family-oriented films may have 
dipped somewhat on expectations with parents choosing to keep their children at 
home.
