Are you happy?

I’m very happy. But I was before, too. It’s a slightly different kind of happy 
because it involves a house or two and a pool ... things to which I never 
really aspired and certainly didn’t expect. However, in the 10 years that I’ve 
gone from having barely a pot to piss in to havingune piscine (that shit’s why 
I get the big bucks) I have also acquired two children which didn’t cost me 
anything. So I suppose the nature of my happiness would have changed anyway.

What’s your favourite insult? And least favourite compliment?

In answer to your first question: Suck my dick, bitch. To your second: I don’t 
like people saying I look good because I’m skinny. I don’t like words like 
“good” or “bad” being associated with female weight.

Are you afraid of death?

Yes. Looking forward to it also. It’s every person’s ultimate condition. So 
I’m in no rush!!! I have no proof of the afterlife. And therefore wait and see. 
I had one near-death experience in my life – I was in a coma for four months. 
There was no Hark the Herald Angels Sing, there was no tunnel with the light at 
the end of it. There were no happy faces floating on clouds. But there was me 
in agony, which, in the long run, is currently preferable.

How do you deal with the ugly souls that persecute and attack you?

I just have to get on with it. Once, when my boyfriend left me and we’d been 
together for years, it was a Saturday night and I went to sleep on the sofa in 
tears. And I woke up to hear my name – on the TV there was a programme called 
The Hundred Most Hated People in Britain. I was number fortysomething. It’s 
this kind of thing that can really knock people over the edge, but luckily I 
dined out on it.

Who are your top three all-time favourite Kevins?

My favourite Kevins are the ones I’m constantly mistaken for. The best time 
was when I was in a piano bar. Some guy was absolutely convinced that I was 
that musician ... what’s his name? The guy in Genesis? Phil Collins! To the 
point that I even put on a British accent and signed a napkin as him.

Can you describe why you have such an affinity for trees in your writing?

When you hold a book you’re also holding a tree in one form or another, and 
that direct connection lets me know how important books are in the world. Pages 
are called leaves, a spine of a book comes from the spine of the animal whose 
skin was used in the first books as covers; everything about books refers us 
back to the physical world. Not that ebook readers aren’t useful for those of 
us whose eyes are getting worse with age. But the reading of a book – a 
physical book – lets us know how time is passing, and how we are passing time, 
in something more than percentage numbers.

How do you see yourself “artistically” in 20 years?

I imagine myself very overweight and maybe, a beard, with lots of young 
artists living in my house making albums and shit.

Was it your time with Hooters that got you into performing comedy?

It’s a long story, but I’m very fond of my time as a Hooters Girl. It’s like 
being a cheerleader or beauty pageant contestant – we were objectified, but 
didn’t understand. Dressing identically to everyone else and serving customers 
chicken with a smile forced me to develop a very strong voice that I’m grateful 
for today.

What do you think we can learn from cats, if anything?

Nothing. In classical Hollywood, vampires and zombies designate class 
struggle. Vampires are rich, they live among us. Zombies are the poor, living 
dead, ugly, stupid, attacking from outside. And it’s the same with cats and 
dogs. Cats are lazy, evil, exploitative, dogs are faithful, they work hard, so 
if I were to be in government, I would tax having a cat, tax it really heavy.

Did you and William Hurt sense at the time that you had made one of the 
all-time great screen couples in Body Heat?

I’m not sure what makes great chemistry other than liking and respecting the 
other person. We broke new ground in Body Heat when it came to sexuality in 
film. It was very scary. If you feel used it’s not going to work. And you have 
to be very careful of that as a woman.

Please can you be my life mentor?

I am your life mentor already – I am the still and silent voice you hear 
muttering evil things at 3am; I am the hortatory, steroid-pumped personal 
trainer who drives you from under the duvet at the very crack of dawn; I am the 
motivational speaker who drives you into a coma during the afternoon meeting; I 
am the fitness instructor who kicks and punches you into the raft that then 
disappears into a maelstrom of white water ... Be careful what you wish for ...

When lazy journos riffed that you were a man - did you take it as an insult or 
a compliment?

Chris Stein: I think most dynamic female artistes have heard that: Marlene 
Dietrich, Grace Jones ... This is just misogyny: if a woman is powerful, she 
might be a man.

Debbie Harry: Gender is just a big fucking mess. It’s a big glandular mixup, 
it’s up for grabs. They’re applauding men who can express their feminine side, 
without saying women can express their masculine side. We both have everything, 
and we both have moments when we need to use them, and society is totally 
inhibiting and quite cruel really.

What is it about Jewishness that makes for such great writers? 

Jews became the People of the Book when they were first exiled. It’s not 
uncommon for marginalised people to value (or even overvalue) culture. You 
fight with what weapons you’ve got. The constant sense of impending doom also 
does wonders for a sense of humour. And if Jews have the blackest humour of 
anybody it’s because they know how much there is to fear out there.

Yes, you can turn from a stooped library smelling tweed-skirt wearing

How do you work as a partnership? Is one of you the ideas man or do you share 
the creative process equally?

We call this the great heterosexual question. We are equal in our partnership 
where most mixed couples are not. We don’t cook, clean, shop or wash up. This 
makes a lot of ladies jealous.

Will you marry me?

Okay, but there are some conditions: I don’t like the word wife. We both have 
to be husbands. I think heart-husbands is how we’ll refer to each other. The 
ceremony will have no men giving away women, and we’ll both have to give 
speeches. Mine has to be funnier. I will get a whole writing team. You will pay 
for this as my dowry.

When does the future begin?

In the 20th century, the “21st century” was used a great deal – in the 21st 
century we never mention the 22nd century, and culturally that’s very 
significant. Something has changed hugely in the past 30 years. Americans, for 
instance, no longer believe in the future as some completely other place. 
Europeans never believed in that, because in Europe the evidence is all around 
us that the future is built in the past. The American vision of the future was 
over the hill, down the highway, we’ll build a new world. Americans have gotten 
the message. I think that Blade Runner was very important in that, in its 
wonderfully European depiction of a future Los Angeles that grew perpetually 
out of its own ruins. A very un-American vision, radically un-American.

I doubt it. I have no real urge to copy a corny heterosexual tradition, even

When you recorded at Rick Halls’ Fame Studios I believe you had over 15 big 
hits, yet your songs seem very difficult to find.

We had an era when DJs were mostly men ... women’s lib had not come to be. We 
were in a jail, in a sense. We could only sing songs about: “Men, please don’t 
leave me!” The male DJs would play the big pleading songs, “You can do anything 
you want to me, just take me back.” Men love to hear that – if you got too 
liberated they wouldn’t play your record. Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive broke 
that mould, and then me with Young Hearts Run Free – suddenly women were buying

Why do you not favour the sock as part of the suit’s ensemble?

Good question. I’ve always seen them as a kind of underwear. They’re 
foundation garments, something that comes in between a boot and the skin. I 
don’t want to be too hard and fast about this, I know people who really work 
the sock and good luck to them but me, I’ve always been a boot wearer. You 
don’t need hosiery on a man, there’s something effeminate about it.

Amanda Palmer

How did you become so brave? Did you ever fake being fearless? What are your 
fears?

I am scared of:

– being unloved

– being alone

– being misunderstood

– being invisible

... and oh the list goes on.

Who would win in a fight between an otter and a fox?

Where did you buy your weed, I need some. Hopefully no one else is reading 
this but you and I. The only thing in my hotel is bath salts, and I’ve already 
smoked that.

Kirsty Wark

Do you think the BBC chose the right Kirsty for the Desert Island Discs gig?

Kirsty Young is certainly the right woman for the job. Funnily enough the 
other night we had a pretty clueless London taxi driver and I am not very good 
on “the knowledge”, so it was a bit tense in the back of the cab. When I got 
out, he said: “Don’t worry, I’ll still listen to you on Desert Island Discs.”

Simon Amstell

Please can you tell us more about why veganism is important to you?

I saw the documentary Earthlings, and it felt like in the future we will look 
at what we do to animals with the same horror that we now look at slavery or 
the Holocaust. Happy Christmas!
