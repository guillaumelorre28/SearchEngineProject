Serena and Venus Williams won their eighth grand slam women's doubles title 
with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Daniela Hantuchova and Ai Sugiyama at the
Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>. The 
triumph was also the Williams' third title in Melbourne after winning in 2001 
and 2003.

The sisters are now the joint third most successful partnership in the open 
era in terms of grand slam doubles titles. Only Martina Navratilova and Pam 
Shriver, with 21 titles, and and Gigi Fernandez and Natasha Zvereva, with 14, 
have more. Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Suarez also have eight.

Serena Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> is due to 
play Dinara Safina in the women's singles final on Saturday as she pursues her 
10th grand slam singles title.

Serena's success in reaching two finals in Australia has made her the top 
woman earner in sport. She eclipsed female golfer Annika Sorenstam, who had 
held the record for career earnings with a total of $22,573,192.

With her semi-final wins in both draws, Serena's career earnings from prize 
money totalled $22,725,475, surpassing fellow tennis player Lindsay Davenport 
by $580,740 and Sorenstam by $152,283.

"I'm thrilled with the news," said Williams. "I remember earning my first 
cheque of $240 at Quebec City in 1995 and while I knew that I could have a 
great career in tennis, I could not have imagined or dreamed of all of this.

"It's amazing how much women's tennis has grown since I joined the Tour 14 
years ago. I am very proud to have reached this milestone for me, my family and 
all women athletes out there.

The American turned professional aged 14 in 1995 and has amassed nine grand 
slam singles titles.
