That's all for today ...

On a soggy day at Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>, 
Frankie Dettori took the St James’s Palace Stakes feature race on board Galileo 
Gold for trainer Hugo Palmer. In the day’s other Group One races, Profitable 
won the King’s Stand Stakes with a highly emotional new dad Adam Kirby in the 
plate, while American raider Teplin and Julien Leparoux won at their first 
attempt in Europe in the Queen Anne Stakes.

Elsewhere, there were wins for the Aidan O’Brien-trained Caravaggio in the 
Queen Anne Stakes, while Jennies Jewel won for another Irish trainer, Jarlath 
Fahey, in theAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> Stakes. Rab Havlin 
and Ardad were the surprise winners of the last, the Windsor Castle Stakes.


Join us tomorrow when we’ll be back around the same time for day two of Royal 
Ascot, described on the racecourse’s own website as “a more gently-paced day 
that nevertheless features an exciting card and includes the Group One Prince 
of Wales’s Stakes”.

Jewel sparkles in Ascot Stakes

Jennies Jewel bravely fended off all-comers to win the Ascot Stakes at Royal 
Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. Trained in Ireland by 
Jarlath Fahey, the Grade Three-winning chaser and Grade One-placed hurdler 
demonstrated her versatility with a really gutsy effort under Ronan Whelan.

The 6-1 chance simply refused to buckle from the head of affairs, and though 
Qewy came fast and late, the nine-year-old Jennies Jewel had done enough, with 
a neck the winning distance.

Mill Springs was third, another length and three-quarters away, with Moscato 
fourth.

Whelan said: “I thought if she was with any other yard she would have been a 
lot shorter [in the betting] than she was. Everything was in her favour - the 
trip, the ground - and she’s just so honest. She’s just so straightforward and 
she tries her heart out.”

Fahey, who only has six horses in training, said: “To come here with a 
nine-year-old and win at RoyalAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot>, 
it’s what dreams are made of. He [Qewy] was closing her down rapidly at the 
line, but Ronan gave her a very good ride.

“This year, for some reason or another, she has just come into her own. She’s 
all heart and determination, she really gives it her all. We were always going 
to be handy, we were just a little bit worried about the hustle and bustle at 
the start, as she has only raced out of stalls once.


“I said if she breaks well to go forward with her and don’t get covered in, as 
we ride her with plenty of space over hurdles. He got a handy lead and she’s a 
good stayer. I don’t know what the plans will be now, the owners will have a 
talk. She’s had a long season, she’s been on the go since October and probably 
needs a break. But she just keeps looking for more.”PA Sport

The bookies are moaning ...

Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> went the way of 
the punters on the opening day, according to Ladbrokes. Wins for favourite 
Caravaggio and the well-fancied Jennies Jewel helped ensure bookies had little 
chance to enjoy some fancied flops such as odds-on The Gurkha.


“We’re feeling as gloomy as the Ascot skies,” said David Williams from 
Ladbrokes. “It’s been a topsy-turvy day but nothing whatsoever to get excited 
about. The feature races grab the headlines but it’s all too often the 
handicaps where the real meaning is found. When the well-backed Jennies Jewel 
held on in theAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> Stakes from the 
unbacked Qewy we knew it wouldn’t be our day.

“It’s not been horrendous and we’ve known worse opening days to major meetings 
but it wasn’t the lottery of results we hoped the rain might have provided.”

Preview: Windsor Castle Stakes (5.35)

Chris Cook

Another juvenile race, rather lower in class than the Coventry and over the 
minimum distance of five furlongs. The US trainer Wesley Ward has sent over one 
of his speedsters, Big City Dreamin, but this kind of ground is most unlikely 
to suit his flashy types and this will be much more testing than the chestnut’s 
debut over half a furlong less on fast turf at Keeneland.

Similar comments apply to another US raider, Drafted, who is also prominent in 
the betting. Mister Trader chased home Caravaggio last time and will become 
popular if that horse wins the Coventry earlier on this card. Godolphin’s 
Kananee is unbeaten in two but untested on ground like this. Tomily could be 
the way to go, seeming steeply progressive and already a winner on soft.

A big win for Jarleth Fahy

The Irish trainer has a small string in County Kildare, but has secured 
himself a bigRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> winner 
here. James McDonald came with a late run on Qewy, making up about 20 lengths 
to finish second by half-a-length. Only McDonald will know if he mistimed a 
potentially winning run. It was a fine pillar-to-post victory for Ronan Whelan 
on Jennies Jewel.

Chris Cook's take on the St James's Palace Stakes

Chris Cook

Frankie Dettori crossed the line with his arm aloft as he rode Galileo Gold to 
victory in the St James’s Palace Stakes, the big race on the opening day of
Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. The bonny 
chestnut, such an impressive winner of the 2,000 Guineas in April, was deserted 
by punters after his defeat in Ireland last time and sent off at 6-1 but 
benefited from a tactically faultless ride as he held off the late challenge of 
The Gurkha.

While Dettori tracked the Godolphin pacemaker, Cymric, from the outset, Ryan 
Moore settled The Gurkha at the back of the field and was still there at the 
turn for home with little more than two furlongs to run. As The Gurkha cruised 
forward, his route was blocked by Awtaad hanging across him and Moore had to 
switch him to mid-track in the final furlong.

Though The Gurkha made further ground, he was a length and a quarter adrift at 
the line, frustrating those backers who had sent him off at odds of 4-5. Awtaad 
was third, while Cymric held on for fourth of the seven runners.

“Everything went to plan,” Dettori said. “Three Guineas winners, I managed to 
get first run on the other two. He’s a Guineas winner, a St James’s Palace 
winner, he’s a great horse to have.”

Dettori said Galileo Gold had had “a few excuses” for his Irish defeat, when 
he trailed Awtaad by two and a half lengths. The Hugo Palmer-trained colt was 
hemmed in from an early stage in the Curragh race, had to fight for racing room 
in the straight and the winner had flown by the time he got free.

Moore and Aidan O’Brien, trainer of The Gurkha, were in happier mood earlier 
when pairing up to land the Coventry with Caravaggio. The unbeaten juvenile was 
so impressive that he now heads the market for next year’s 2,000 Guineas at no 
bigger than 6-1, with everything else available at 20-1 or bigger.

“I was a bit worried about the ground, but he’s won in spite of it,” Moore 
said of Caravaggio. “When he gets on better ground, he will be a better horse. 
At this stage of his career, he’s very good. At this stage, he’d be the best 
I’ve sat on.”

Gold for Galileo at Royal Ascot

Galileo Gold won the battle of the 2000 Guineas winners in the St James’s 
Palace Stakes atRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. 
Hugo Palmer’s three-year-old claimed Classic glory at Newmarket in early May, 
but had to make do with the runner-up spot behind Awtaad in the Irish version 
at the Curragh and the pair clashed once more in Berkshire.

Adding further spice to the mix was the presence of Aidan O’Brien’s runaway 
French Guineas winner The Gurkha and he was sent off the heavily backed 4-5 
favourite.

Galileo Gold (6-1) was ridden prominently by Frankie Dettori, with his major 
rivals adopting more patient tactics. Dettori sent his mount to the front with 
two furlongs to run and while Awtaad and The Gurkha gave chase, it was all too 
late as Galileo Gold galloped on to score by a length and a quarter.

The Gurkha narrowly beat Awtaad to the runner-up spot, with the trio clear of 
the field. “Everything went to plan.” said Dettori. “Three Guineas winners, I 
managed to get first run on the other two. Hugo was so nervous today - he made 
me feeling nervous when I talked to him. He’s a Guineas winner, a St James’s 
Palace winner - he’s a great horse to have. We had a few excuses in Ireland, 
but he had no place to hide today and he’s redeemed himself.”

Preview: Ascot Stakes (5.00)

Chris Cook

This is a proper marathon and, not unusually for a marathon Flat handicap, has 
been dominated by trainers better known for their handling of jumpers (Mullins, 
Henderson, Pipe...). Willie Mullins has the favourite in Pique Sous, a winner 
at this meeting two years ago, but he was stuffed last month on his first 
outing since that day, so the market’s enthusiasm is hard to share, for me.

Dermot Weld’s Silver Concorde looks more like it, a bumper winner at the 2014 
Cheltenham Festival who has since done well in exactly this type of race. No 
Heretic, the Chester Cup winner, is very fairly treated on just a 4lb higher 
mark, though he was helped by the draw that day. Penglai Pavilion would be 
thrown in on the pick of his Flat form but that was years ago and he probably 
doesn’t want this ground.

St James's Palace Stakes (4.20)

Another Group One, the third of the afternoon with The Gurkha a very 
short-priced favourite. One mile is the trip with £226,840 going to the winner.

They jump away with The Gurkha a little slow away and finding himself at the 
rear of the field. Galileo Gold takes up a position in second behind Cymric, 
the pacemaker from Ballydoyle.

Cymric leads Galileo Gold by two leads as they head around the bend and make 
for home. Galileo Gold takes the lead with The Gurkha in hot pursuit. Galileo 
Gold is going to hang on and wins under a fine ride from Frankie Dettori. He’s 
given them all the slip there, winning from The Gurkha and Awtaad. Galileo Gold 
wins the St James’s Palace Stakes.

Preview: St James's Palace Stakes (4.10)

Chris Cook

Here is exactly what this race was made for, a clash between the winners of 
the 2,000 Guineas in England, Ireland and France. The Gurkha, trained in 
Ireland but representing the French form, looks the way to go on the way he 
shot clear last month and better can be expected in view of how lightly raced 
he is.

Awtaad, the Irish Guineas winner, is a live threat after moving though the 
Curragh Classic very smoothly. Galileo Gold, the Newmarket winner, needs to 
re-establish himself here but this ground probably won’t help. That also looks 
the stumbling block for Godolphin’s Emotionless, last seen flopping in the 
Dewhurst.

Kirby and Cox enjoy Profitable afternoon

Profitable continued his flying start to the season with a thrilling success 
in the King’s Stand Stakes atRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. 
Clive Cox’s four-year-old lined up for the five-furlong Group One in 
tremendous form having won his first two starts of the campaign, in the Palace 
House at Newmarket and the Temple Stakes at Haydock.

Adam Kirby had the 4-1 shot buried in the middle of the pack early on, but he 
hit the front a furlong out and knuckled down to get the better of a protracted 
duel with Cotai Glory by a neck. Goken finished strongly to grab third.

Hot favourite Mecca’s Angel raced up with the pace before weakening rapidly 
and was ultimately bitterly disappointing.
A tearful Kirby revealed his girlfriend had given birth to a baby boy just 
hours before.

“I think he’s the best five-furlong horse I’ve ever ridden,” he said. “His 
cruising speed is phenomenal. I’m delighted for everyone involved, but, more 
importantly, I’m delighted for Clive. My girlfriend gave birth to a baby boy a 
few hours ago, so it’s all good.”PA Sport

A good day for Adam Kirby

In a very emotional interview on Channel 4, tearful winning jockey Adam Kirby 
struggles to regain his composure before revealing that his girlfriend gave 
birth to a baby boy just a couple of hours ago. Congratulations to him and her 
on a great afternoon he’s unlikely to forget any time soon.

Mongolian Saturday is an interesting one here ...

A well-travelled horse that’s trained out of the USA, he’s trained by 
Mongolian trainer Enebish Ganbat and some of her connections are looking 
fantastic in their national dress in the parade ring.

Ganbat reckons his charge will finish in the first three at a big price, but 
the horse is being led to the start with jockey Florent Geroux walking behind 
him. Here’s hoping he copes with these unfamiliar surroundings.

On Channel 4, they say the option of having a pony lead them to the start, as 
happens in the States, is open to competing horses, but Ganbat has eschewed 
that option.

Caravaggio wins the Coventry Stakes (3.05)

Caravaggio kept his unbeaten record intact with a brilliant victory in the 
Coventry Stakes atRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. 
A winner at Dundalk and the Curragh earlier this year, the Scat Daddy colt was 
sent off the 13-8 favourite to complete his hat-trick and provide trainer Aidan 
O’Brien with a record eighth victory in this prestigious juvenile contest.

Ryan Moore rode a patient race in the group racing towards the stands rail 
before angling wide to mount his challenge with over a furlong to run. 
Caravaggio showed thrilling acceleration to grab the lead and he powered clear 
close home to beat Mehmas going away.

Psychedelic Funk just held on in a three-way photo for third. 
“He’s won two races really [having had to switch from main group], the others 
couldn’t take me far enough,” said Ryan Moore. “He was very impressive. I was a

Preview: King's Stand Stakes

Chris Cook

All the recent rain is excellent news for Mecca’s Angel, who powered home to 
land the Nunthorpe on good to soft at York in August. But she was worried out 
of it on her reappearance at Haydock by Profitable and it’s surprising to find 
the market is so confident about her reversing that form.

While Profitable had a fitness edge that day, he was pulling away at the line 
and looks an altogether stronger sort this year. Goldream and Medicean Man, 
first and second last year, would probably prefer a sounder surface, as would 
Muthmir and Take Cover. Double Up is interesting at a big price, being 
progressive and possibly effective with some cut.

Caravaggio wins the Coventry Stakes (3.05)

Ryan Moore let Caravaggio drift all the way across the track in the final half 
furlong, but still won at his leisure to give Aidan O’Brien a record eighth win 
in the Coventry Stakes. Mehmas was second, while Psychedelic Funk was third.

Coventry Stakes (3.05) preliminaries

Six furlongs is the trip, with £85,065 going to the winners. Aidan O’Brien 
saddles the favourite Caravaagio, while his son Joseph trains Lundy, an 
outsider he says would like nicer ground but is a colt to watch for the future. 
They’re loading the stalls and will be off very shortly.

Tepin wins the Queen Anne Stakes

Brilliant North American mare Tepin claimed Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> glory in the Queen Anne Stakes. 
Trained by Mark Casse and ridden by Julien Leparoux, the five-year-old was 
making her British and European debut having won a host of big races in her 
homeland, including the Breeders’ Cup Mile at Keeneland last October.

Sent off at 11-2 due to doubts about the rain-softened ground, Tepin was 
always travelling well and knuckled down admirably in the final furlong to get 
the better of Belardo by half a length.

“It’s just amazing,” said Leparoux. “It’s a great feeling. She’s a champion 
and she proved it today. She had to work hard, for sure, as the last 100 metres 
was a long way to go. It’s awesome.”

When the starting stalls opened, the field initially split into two groups, 
with Tepin leading a contingent that raced closer to the stands side. With 
ground conditions in his favour, Belardo was the 9-2 joint-favourite to add to 
last month’s top-level triumph in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury and his 
pacemaker, Barchan, ensured it was a serious test of stamina by setting a 
furious gallop.

When he inevitably folded heading inside the final quarter-mile, Kodi Bear was 
left in front, but he was quickly pressed by Tepin and the more 
patiently-ridden Belardo. That pair settled down to fight it out and it was 
Tepin who found most for pressure to clinch a momentous victory under her 
jubilant rider. Lightning Spear came from a long way back to finish third.PA

Preview: Coventry Stakes (3.05)

One of the key two-year-old races of each year and therefore an important 
target for Aidan O’Brien, who has won it twice in the past five years. He 
fields the well-fancied Caravaggio, unbeaten in two, whose Listed success on 
similar going at The Curragh last month was achieved in what looked a very 
sharp time by comparison with a Group Three sprint on the card.

Mehmas represents another yard that is typically strong in juvenile races, 
that of Richard Hannon, and this one will relish the return to six furlongs 
after his Sandown second over five last time. Psychedelic Funk was deeply 
impressive at Navan last time but faces much stronger opposition here. 
Godolphin’s Thunder Snow, a Leicester maiden winner, is bred to make a good 
two-year-old but might struggle on this ground.

On a soggy day at Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>, 
Frankie Dettori took the St James’s Palace Stakes feature race on board Galileo 
Gold for trainer Hugo Palmer. In the day’s other Group One races, Profitable 
won the King’s Stand Stakes with a highly emotional new dad Adam Kirby in the 
plate, while American raider Teplin and Julien Leparoux won at their first 
attempt in Europe in the Queen Anne Stakes.

Elsewhere, there were wins for the Aidan O’Brien-trained Caravaggio in the 
Queen Anne Stakes, while Jennies Jewel won for another Irish trainer, Jarlath 
Fahey, in theAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> Stakes. Rab Havlin 
and Ardad were the surprise winners of the last, the Windsor Castle Stakes.


Join us tomorrow when we’ll be back around the same time for day two of Royal 
Ascot, described on the racecourse’s own website as “a more gently-paced day 
that nevertheless features an exciting card and includes the Group One Prince 
of Wales’s Stakes”.

Jennies Jewel bravely fended off all-comers to win the Ascot Stakes at Royal 
Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. Trained in Ireland by 
Jarlath Fahey, the Grade Three-winning chaser and Grade One-placed hurdler 
demonstrated her versatility with a really gutsy effort under Ronan Whelan.

The 6-1 chance simply refused to buckle from the head of affairs, and though 
Qewy came fast and late, the nine-year-old Jennies Jewel had done enough, with 
a neck the winning distance.

Mill Springs was third, another length and three-quarters away, with Moscato 
fourth.

Whelan said: “I thought if she was with any other yard she would have been a 
lot shorter [in the betting] than she was. Everything was in her favour - the 
trip, the ground - and she’s just so honest. She’s just so straightforward and 
she tries her heart out.”

Fahey, who only has six horses in training, said: “To come here with a 
nine-year-old and win at RoyalAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot>, 
it’s what dreams are made of. He [Qewy] was closing her down rapidly at the 
line, but Ronan gave her a very good ride.

“This year, for some reason or another, she has just come into her own. She’s 
all heart and determination, she really gives it her all. We were always going 
to be handy, we were just a little bit worried about the hustle and bustle at 
the start, as she has only raced out of stalls once.


“I said if she breaks well to go forward with her and don’t get covered in, as 
we ride her with plenty of space over hurdles. He got a handy lead and she’s a 
good stayer. I don’t know what the plans will be now, the owners will have a 
talk. She’s had a long season, she’s been on the go since October and probably 
needs a break. But she just keeps looking for more.”PA Sport

Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> went the way of 
the punters on the opening day, according to Ladbrokes. Wins for favourite 
Caravaggio and the well-fancied Jennies Jewel helped ensure bookies had little 
chance to enjoy some fancied flops such as odds-on The Gurkha.


“We’re feeling as gloomy as the Ascot skies,” said David Williams from 
Ladbrokes. “It’s been a topsy-turvy day but nothing whatsoever to get excited 
about. The feature races grab the headlines but it’s all too often the 
handicaps where the real meaning is found. When the well-backed Jennies Jewel 
held on in theAscot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> Stakes from the 
unbacked Qewy we knew it wouldn’t be our day.

“It’s not been horrendous and we’ve known worse opening days to major meetings 
but it wasn’t the lottery of results we hoped the rain might have provided.”

Another juvenile race, rather lower in class than the Coventry and over the 
minimum distance of five furlongs. The US trainer Wesley Ward has sent over one 
of his speedsters, Big City Dreamin, but this kind of ground is most unlikely 
to suit his flashy types and this will be much more testing than the chestnut’s 
debut over half a furlong less on fast turf at Keeneland.

Similar comments apply to another US raider, Drafted, who is also prominent in 
the betting. Mister Trader chased home Caravaggio last time and will become 
popular if that horse wins the Coventry earlier on this card. Godolphin’s 
Kananee is unbeaten in two but untested on ground like this. Tomily could be 
the way to go, seeming steeply progressive and already a winner on soft.
 
The Irish trainer has a small string in County Kildare, but has secured 
himself a bigRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> winner 
here. James McDonald came with a late run on Qewy, making up about 20 lengths 
to finish second by half-a-length. Only McDonald will know if he mistimed a 
potentially winning run. It was a fine pillar-to-post victory for Ronan Whelan 
on Jennies Jewel.

Frankie Dettori crossed the line with his arm aloft as he rode Galileo Gold to 
victory in the St James’s Palace Stakes, the big race on the opening day of
Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. The bonny 
chestnut, such an impressive winner of the 2,000 Guineas in April, was deserted 
by punters after his defeat in Ireland last time and sent off at 6-1 but 
benefited from a tactically faultless ride as he held off the late challenge of 
The Gurkha.

While Dettori tracked the Godolphin pacemaker, Cymric, from the outset, Ryan 
Moore settled The Gurkha at the back of the field and was still there at the 
turn for home with little more than two furlongs to run. As The Gurkha cruised 
forward, his route was blocked by Awtaad hanging across him and Moore had to 
switch him to mid-track in the final furlong.

Though The Gurkha made further ground, he was a length and a quarter adrift at 
the line, frustrating those backers who had sent him off at odds of 4-5. Awtaad 
was third, while Cymric held on for fourth of the seven runners.

“Everything went to plan,” Dettori said. “Three Guineas winners, I managed to 
get first run on the other two. He’s a Guineas winner, a St James’s Palace 
winner, he’s a great horse to have.”

Dettori said Galileo Gold had had “a few excuses” for his Irish defeat, when 
he trailed Awtaad by two and a half lengths. The Hugo Palmer-trained colt was 
hemmed in from an early stage in the Curragh race, had to fight for racing room 
in the straight and the winner had flown by the time he got free.

Moore and Aidan O’Brien, trainer of The Gurkha, were in happier mood earlier 
when pairing up to land the Coventry with Caravaggio. The unbeaten juvenile was 
so impressive that he now heads the market for next year’s 2,000 Guineas at no 
bigger than 6-1, with everything else available at 20-1 or bigger.

“I was a bit worried about the ground, but he’s won in spite of it,” Moore 
said of Caravaggio. “When he gets on better ground, he will be a better horse. 
At this stage of his career, he’s very good. At this stage, he’d be the best 
I’ve sat on.”

Palace Stakes atRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. 
Hugo Palmer’s three-year-old claimed Classic glory at Newmarket in early May, 
but had to make do with the runner-up spot behind Awtaad in the Irish version 
at the Curragh and the pair clashed once more in Berkshire.

Adding further spice to the mix was the presence of Aidan O’Brien’s runaway 
French Guineas winner The Gurkha and he was sent off the heavily backed 4-5 
favourite.

Galileo Gold (6-1) was ridden prominently by Frankie Dettori, with his major 
rivals adopting more patient tactics. Dettori sent his mount to the front with 
two furlongs to run and while Awtaad and The Gurkha gave chase, it was all too 
late as Galileo Gold galloped on to score by a length and a quarter.

The Gurkha narrowly beat Awtaad to the runner-up spot, with the trio clear of 
the field. “Everything went to plan.” said Dettori. “Three Guineas winners, I 
managed to get first run on the other two. Hugo was so nervous today - he made 
me feeling nervous when I talked to him. He’s a Guineas winner, a St James’s 
Palace winner - he’s a great horse to have. We had a few excuses in Ireland, 
but he had no place to hide today and he’s redeemed himself.”

This is a proper marathon and, not unusually for a marathon Flat handicap, has 
been dominated by trainers better known for their handling of jumpers (Mullins, 
Henderson, Pipe...). Willie Mullins has the favourite in Pique Sous, a winner 
at this meeting two years ago, but he was stuffed last month on his first 
outing since that day, so the market’s enthusiasm is hard to share, for me.

Dermot Weld’s Silver Concorde looks more like it, a bumper winner at the 2014 
Cheltenham Festival who has since done well in exactly this type of race. No 
Heretic, the Chester Cup winner, is very fairly treated on just a 4lb higher 
mark, though he was helped by the draw that day. Penglai Pavilion would be 
thrown in on the pick of his Flat form but that was years ago and he probably 
doesn’t want this ground.

Another Group One, the third of the afternoon with The Gurkha a very 
short-priced favourite. One mile is the trip with £226,840 going to the winner.

They jump away with The Gurkha a little slow away and finding himself at the 
rear of the field. Galileo Gold takes up a position in second behind Cymric, 
the pacemaker from Ballydoyle.

Cymric leads Galileo Gold by two leads as they head around the bend and make 
for home. Galileo Gold takes the lead with The Gurkha in hot pursuit. Galileo 
Gold is going to hang on and wins under a fine ride from Frankie Dettori. He’s 
given them all the slip there, winning from The Gurkha and Awtaad. Galileo Gold 
wins the St James’s Palace Stakes.

Here is exactly what this race was made for, a clash between the winners of 
the 2,000 Guineas in England, Ireland and France. The Gurkha, trained in 
Ireland but representing the French form, looks the way to go on the way he 
shot clear last month and better can be expected in view of how lightly raced 
he is.

Awtaad, the Irish Guineas winner, is a live threat after moving though the 
Curragh Classic very smoothly. Galileo Gold, the Newmarket winner, needs to 
re-establish himself here but this ground probably won’t help. That also looks 
the stumbling block for Godolphin’s Emotionless, last seen flopping in the 
Dewhurst.

 
Profitable continued his flying start to the season with a thrilling success 
in the King’s Stand Stakes atRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. 
Clive Cox’s four-year-old lined up for the five-furlong Group One in 
tremendous form having won his first two starts of the campaign, in the Palace 
House at Newmarket and the Temple Stakes at Haydock.

Adam Kirby had the 4-1 shot buried in the middle of the pack early on, but he 
hit the front a furlong out and knuckled down to get the better of a protracted 
duel with Cotai Glory by a neck. Goken finished strongly to grab third.

Hot favourite Mecca’s Angel raced up with the pace before weakening rapidly 
and was ultimately bitterly disappointing.
A tearful Kirby revealed his girlfriend had given birth to a baby boy just 
hours before.

“I think he’s the best five-furlong horse I’ve ever ridden,” he said. “His 
cruising speed is phenomenal. I’m delighted for everyone involved, but, more 
importantly, I’m delighted for Clive. My girlfriend gave birth to a baby boy a 
few hours ago, so it’s all good.”PA Sport

A well-travelled horse that’s trained out of the USA, he’s trained by 
Mongolian trainer Enebish Ganbat and some of her connections are looking 
fantastic in their national dress in the parade ring.

Ganbat reckons his charge will finish in the first three at a big price, but 
the horse is being led to the start with jockey Florent Geroux walking behind 
him. Here’s hoping he copes with these unfamiliar surroundings.

On Channel 4, they say the option of having a pony lead them to the start, as 
happens in the States, is open to competing horses, but Ganbat has eschewed 
that option.

Caravaggio kept his unbeaten record intact with a brilliant victory in the 
Coventry Stakes atRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. 
A winner at Dundalk and the Curragh earlier this year, the Scat Daddy colt was 
sent off the 13-8 favourite to complete his hat-trick and provide trainer Aidan 
O’Brien with a record eighth victory in this prestigious juvenile contest.

Ryan Moore rode a patient race in the group racing towards the stands rail 
before angling wide to mount his challenge with over a furlong to run. 
Caravaggio showed thrilling acceleration to grab the lead and he powered clear 
close home to beat Mehmas going away.

Psychedelic Funk just held on in a three-way photo for third. 
“He’s won two races really [having had to switch from main group], the others 
couldn’t take me far enough,” said Ryan Moore. “He was very impressive. I was a 
bit worried about the ground, but he’s won in spite of it.”

All the recent rain is excellent news for Mecca’s Angel, who powered home to 
land the Nunthorpe on good to soft at York in August. But she was worried out 
of it on her reappearance at Haydock by Profitable and it’s surprising to find 
the market is so confident about her reversing that form.

While Profitable had a fitness edge that day, he was pulling away at the line 
and looks an altogether stronger sort this year. Goldream and Medicean Man, 
first and second last year, would probably prefer a sounder surface, as would 
Muthmir and Take Cover. Double Up is interesting at a big price, being 
progressive and possibly effective with some cut.

Brilliant North American mare Tepin claimed Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> glory in the Queen Anne Stakes. 
Trained by Mark Casse and ridden by Julien Leparoux, the five-year-old was 
making her British and European debut having won a host of big races in her 
homeland, including the Breeders’ Cup Mile at Keeneland last October.

Sent off at 11-2 due to doubts about the rain-softened ground, Tepin was 
always travelling well and knuckled down admirably in the final furlong to get 
the better of Belardo by half a length.

“It’s just amazing,” said Leparoux. “It’s a great feeling. She’s a champion 
and she proved it today. She had to work hard, for sure, as the last 100 metres 
was a long way to go. It’s awesome.”

When the starting stalls opened, the field initially split into two groups, 
with Tepin leading a contingent that raced closer to the stands side. With 
ground conditions in his favour, Belardo was the 9-2 joint-favourite to add to 
last month’s top-level triumph in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury and his 
pacemaker, Barchan, ensured it was a serious test of stamina by setting a 
furious gallop.

When he inevitably folded heading inside the final quarter-mile, Kodi Bear was 
left in front, but he was quickly pressed by Tepin and the more 
patiently-ridden Belardo. That pair settled down to fight it out and it was 
Tepin who found most for pressure to clinch a momentous victory under her 
jubilant rider. Lightning Spear came from a long way back to finish third.PA

One of the key two-year-old races of each year and therefore an important 
target for Aidan O’Brien, who has won it twice in the past five years. He 
fields the well-fancied Caravaggio, unbeaten in two, whose Listed success on 
similar going at The Curragh last month was achieved in what looked a very 
sharp time by comparison with a Group Three sprint on the card.

Mehmas represents another yard that is typically strong in juvenile races, 
that of Richard Hannon, and this one will relish the return to six furlongs 
after his Sandown second over five last time. Psychedelic Funk was deeply 
impressive at Navan last time but faces much stronger opposition here. 
Godolphin’s Thunder Snow, a Leicester maiden winner, is bred to make a good 
two-year-old but might struggle on this ground.
