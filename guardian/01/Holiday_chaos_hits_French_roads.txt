Thousands of holiday makers were caught up in traffic chaos in France on 
Saturday as they hit the road on their way to or from summer vacations, 
fuelling the year's worst traffic jams. Officials said that tailbacks in the 
worst hit areas reached 93 miles.

"I have never seen such traffic jams," one motorist told a television station 
in France's south-east Rhone-Alpes, the worst affected area as holiday makers 
tried to make their way to Provence.

 The government's road safety unit said the whole of the weekend would be 
exceptionally difficult with one wave of families leaving for their summer 
holidays, which usually last a month, as others returned from July vacations.
