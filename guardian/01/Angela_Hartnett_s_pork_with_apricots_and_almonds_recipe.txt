I wouldn't normally pair pork with apricots, but I was served it once in 
France and it combined really well with the almonds and the slight bitterness 
of the radicchio. You can try it with pork belly, too, it's just not as quick 
to make.

(Serves 2)
500g pork tenderloin
30g butter
1 tsp coarse grain mustard
100ml olive oil
20ml red wine vinegar
3 spring onions, sliced
200g radicchio, torn
50g almonds, skin on
4 apricots, sliced

Add a dash of oil to a roasting pan, put it on the stove top on a medium heat, 
season the pork and brown for a few minutes, turning so it colours evenly.

Add the butter to the pan and place in a preheated oven at 200C/400F/gas mark 
6 for 7-10 minutes.

Check the meat is cooked, remove from the pan and allow to rest for about four 
minutes.

Meanwhile, beat together the mustard, oil and vinegar until emulsified.

Put the radicchio and spring onions in a bowl and add the vinaigrette.

Smash the almonds into fairly large chunks, add them to the bowl along with 
the sliced apricots and mix everything together.

Slice the pork, toss through and serve immediately.
