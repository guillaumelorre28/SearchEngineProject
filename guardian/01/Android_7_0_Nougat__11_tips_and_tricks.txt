 Quick replies are now available for almost any messaging app on Android.

There’s no need to actually go to into a messaging app anymore, as basically 
everything gets quick reply through the new modifications made to Android’s 
notifications.

You can reply to messages, see other replies and conduct your business without 
ever leaving the app you were already in. It’s great.

 Doze helps prolong battery life whenever the phone is locked. Photograph: 
Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian 
You don’t have to do anything for the new version of Doze to give you better 
battery life apart from update your phone. Doze reduces the impact that apps 
not actively running in the foreground have on battery life by working out 
which ones need to receive updates and use the processor, and which don’t.

Using Marshmallow, that only happened when the phone was not moving around, 
but now it works even if the phone is in your pocket. It should give you 
anywhere between 10% and 25% longer battery life, depending on how long you 
leave the phone in standby.

3. Multitasking without having to hack around

for the Guardian 
A few Android phones, such as Samsung’s Galaxy Note series, have had 
side-by-side app multitasking before, but now it’s baked into Android and works 
with almost every app out of the box.

Simply hold the overview button on the right side of the navigation bar when 
in an app to choose another to place beside it or above it.

4. Quick app switch

hidden System UI tuner is your friend.

To activate it, hold the cog at the top of the quick settings panel for around

“System UI Tuner” will then appear for you to play around with.

 Power notifications provides granular control over what apps can and can’t 
notify about and when. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian 
Inside the System UI tuner menu there’s a setting for even more granular 
control over notifications called power notification controls.

There are various levels of notification access, which can prevent 
notifications from showing when an app is full screen but still make a sound or 
vibrate, for instance, instead of outright blocking them. Activating power 
notification settings in the System UI tuner adds a new slider to notification 
settings that allows you to pick how important they are, instead of the app 
automatically picking for you.

If you have a tight or no mobile data budget, the new built-in data saver 
function can help. The setting hidden under Data usage stops apps from sending 
or receiving data when in the background and limits an app’s data usage when 
being actively used.

You an set a whitelist to allow free data access for certain apps, and there’s 
a quick toggle available too. The feature isn’t the same as the data saver 
function of Chrome, which must be activated separately.

Android 7.0 Nougat comes with a built-in cat collecting game. It’s an easter 
egg mini-game similar to Neko Atsume.

To activate it, scroll down the list of settings to About and tap on the 
Android version number three times to bring up a big N logo. Tap the N logo a 
couple of times before holding down on it until a cat emoji pops up at the 
bottom of the screen.

Then edit your quick settings panel and add the Android easter egg tile to 
your collection. Then tap on the empty dish to put out bait and wait.
