The horrors of Holman penitentiary in southern Alabama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama> – the stabbings, riots, fires, 
abuse – have earned it a reputation as the most violent prison in the United 
States. As recently as Thursday a prisoner cut a guard’s eye during a fight.

DoJ to investigate Alabama prisons in 'possibly unprecedented' move

Holman stands alone, isolated, surrounded by mile after mile of cotton fields. 
It’s also at the center of recent prisoner strikes across the country, and is 
the only place where correctional officers have gone on strike as well. On 6 
October the US Department of Justice (DoJ) announced astate-wide investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/06/alabama-prison-doj-investigation>
 of Alabama’s prisons for men, targeting sex abuse, violence, and generally 
unsafe conditions for both prisoners and officers. Such a colossal 
investigation is, according to legal experts, unprecedented.

Current employees at the prison are afraid to discuss conditions inside. But 
Lt Curt Stidham agreed to meet and describe life at the prison for the 
Guardian. He left Holman this summer but Holman hasn’t left him; at a local 
pizza place he insisted on sitting in the corner, facing the doors. “I need to 
be able to see,” he said. “You’ll find all the officers are like this.”

He sketched a layout of the prison on a napkin, and described the hierarchy of 
officers. “There’s the warden at the top, then two captains, and then 
lieutenants,” he said. As a lieutenant his first order every day was to figure 
out how many of his shift officers had reported for duty. The prison is run by 
a staff as thin as the razor wire that surrounds the prison. Sometimes as few 
as nine guards would try to control the entire population, Stidham said.

And how big is the population?

“Nine-hundred fifty,” he said, in a facility built to house 637.

The department of corrections confirmed Stidham’s allegations. 
“Over-population and understaffing, yes,” said Bob Horton, spokesman for 
Alabama’s prisons. He described it as an intractable problem that took root in 
the 1970s and has flourished for decades due to “neglect”. “But there’s no one 
person or entity to point blame at,” he said. “This has been going on for 
decades.”

When the problems started

In the 1960s the newly built William C Holman prison represented the latest 
advancements, compared with previous medieval conditions. It had two wire 
fences and six towers, which should have given guards a constant view from 
every angle. But today it’s a shell game – typically only two of the towers are 
manned at any time.

The first warden at Holman, Novy Lee Hale, toured the prison with his 
granddaughter, Teresa. She still lives nearby, and stays in touch with staff. 
“I believe the correction officers are overworked, underpaid, and feel they are 
not backed by the administration,” she said recently.

According to the DoJ, the investigation will focus on whether prisoners are 
protected from physical and sexual abuse by other prisoners and guards, and 
whether living conditions are sanitary and safe in general at men’s prisons.

The problems at Holman and other Alabama prisons started with what Horton, the 
prisons spokesman, called “tough-on-crime” laws; laws pushed by politicians who 
didn’t want to appear soft, but who also couldn’t afford to build enough 
prisons to house a mushrooming population of drug offenders. They arrived in 
droves, and they stayed longer; Lisa Graybill, a prisons expert at the Southern 
Poverty Law Center, called it a “sentencing binge”.

Now Alabama has the nation’s most overcrowded prison system. It was built to 
hold 13,318 inmates. According to the department of correction’slatest report 
<http://www.doc.state.al.us/docs/MonthlyRpts/2016-08.pdf>, in August, the 
population now exceeds 24,000.

That means officers have to cut corners, according to Stidham, the recently 
resigned lieutenant. Regulations might call for two officers to transport a 
prisoner, for instance, but there’s only one available. Or a lone guard might 
stand at the door of a dorm housing 115 inmates; if a group of prisoners 
assaults another one, it’s that guard’s job to wade into the chaos and protect 
the victim.

Stidham unfurled a canvas jacket on the trunk of his car, revealing dozens of 
prison-made knives. They ranged from small blades made of metal bed slats to a 
massive glass shard with a cloth-wrapped handle. “Would you go into that dorm?” 
he said.

The lieutenant said the problem goes far beyond cinematic notions of bullying 
guards or vicious prisoners. “No one is winning at Holman,” he said. “There is 
only survival.”

Pastor Kenneth Glasgow works with prisoners there. “It’s a bloodbath. There 
are killings every day at Holman,” he said Thursday. He served time himself, 
many years ago, but said Alabama’s prisons have since spiraled down. “Three 
Saturdays ago they had seven officers for a thousand-man prison. It creates a 
hostile environment. Everybody at Holman’s got knives. As soon as you arrive 
they tell you, ‘better get yourself a knife because everybody else has one’.”

The riots begin

The bloodbath spilled over in March. Inmates rioted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/20/alabama-prison-riots-chaos-and-mayhem>
, stabbing a guard. When the warden, then Carter Davenport, responded, they 
stabbed him too. They set fire to the dorm, and patrolled hallways while 
carrying full-length swords.

The warden and guard survived the attack, and special security squads swept in 
to quash the riot. A few days later another riot flared up, and one inmate 
stabbed another. The warden called in the security squads again.

As soon as you arrive they tell you, ‘better get yourself a knife because 
everybody else has one'

That’s when Stidham decided to resign. In September he got word that one of 
his officers, 44-year-old Kenneth Bettis, had refused to give a prisoner an 
extra tray of food, and the prisoner had stabbed him in the temple with an 
icepick-like weapon.

While Bettis was in the hospital the prisoners staged a strike on 9 September, 
refusing to work in the prison’s kitchen or the license-plate production plant. 
Inmates at other prisons across the US enacted similar plans, involving as many 
as 24,000 prisoners who demanded safer living conditions.

A few days later Bettis, the guard, died in the hospital. That night the 
officers from Bettis’s shift all gathered at a gas station off the prison 
grounds and discussed how to respond. Someone suggested officers call in sick 
during an extended “blue flu”. Others were angrier. They decided to skip work 
for one day, as a protest of Holman’s treacherous conditions. And they wouldn’t 
bend the rules for the prison’s administration anymore – if moving a prisoner 
required two guards, they would refuse to do it alone.

That’s when the warden’s white Chevrolet Impala pulled in to the parking lot, 
and everyone quickly changed the subject to Bettis’s death. They took each 
other’s hands.

“We all just gathered in a circle and started praying,” Stidham said. “The 
warden walked up and joined right in the prayer, and had no idea we were 
plotting against the prison.”

On the following Saturday just two officers showed up for work, crippling a 
shift that would normally require about 16 guards. “We brought in officers from 
other areas,” said Horton, the prisons representative. “It only lasted a day, 
if you want to call that a strike. They didn’t list any demands, but we know 
what their grievances were. We know the situation at Holman.”

He said the state plans to comply with federal investigators as they examine 
the prison system. “It’s welcomed,” he said.

The DoJ plans far-ranging look at threats in Alabama’s prisons, perpetrated by 
both guards and inmates, from sexual offenses to unsanitary conditions to 
physical violence.

“The constitution requires that prisons provide humane conditions of 
confinement,” Vanita Gupta, head of the DoJ’s civil rights division said in a 
statement. The general goal, she said, is “ensuring that the state’s facilities 
keep prisoners safe from harm”.


In the meantime, turnover among prison guards is 60%. Thursday prisoners 
attacked an officer and reportedly tried to stab his eye, but his glasses 
deflected the blow and he survived with a cut to one eye.

Officers like Stidham say it’s not worth the risk. Among the guards who 
skipped work in protest, three never returned.

“Well, I’ve been thinking about a job at a little local jail. It’s in me, 
now,” he said. He stared at his hands. “I guess I’m just as institutionalized 
as the prisoners.”
