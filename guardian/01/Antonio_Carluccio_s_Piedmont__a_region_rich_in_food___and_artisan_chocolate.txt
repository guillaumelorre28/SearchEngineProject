I was brought up in a village called Borgofranco in the Aosta valley. The area 
is practically made of food. Here you can eat wonderful stuff: polenta is a 
typical dish, as is chicken or sausageragù – they do eat quite a lot of meat. 
You get amazing food knowledge just from standing in the butchers as people in 
the queue discuss how to cook a particular cut of meat.

Ivrea, near Borgofranco, is a little town that has wonderful markets, and 
where the seasonal ingredients are exceptional. Even the cabbage in winter is 
very good. During the carnival in early March the town is covered in Sicilian 
oranges – there is even a local tradition of fighting battles with them – and 
it makes Ivrea very pungent.

Fagioli grassi is a traditional dish, which is served on the streets during 
carnival: it's sausages and beans cooked in huge cauldrons over wood fires for 
about 24 hours. You take your pot along and fill it up then eat it at home – it 
is the best kind of food.

More than once when I was growing up I came home tipsy, having drunk the 
"must" – freshly pressed grapes – of the moscato wine made in Ivrea. It is 
sweet and non-alcoholic but it ferments in your stomach. Other great wines to 
try are barbera, barolo and dolcetto. Look out for wonderful wines by Luigi 
Ferrando and his son Roberto (ferrandovini.it <http://www.ferrandovini.it/>) 
who grow a type of nebbiolo called carema, which is sold inenoteche (wine bars) 
in Ivrea such as Nuova Enoteca Ferrando Di Cornelio Simone Antonio by the river 
at 1a Corso Re Umberto (+39 0125 641176).
 Piedmont 
The village of Andrate is a bit further up into the hills from where I grew 
up. At trattorias here you get very, very good local food – polenta with game, 
especially rabbit or jugged hare. It's not at all touristy because it is mostly 
only visited by walkers. TryLa Cucina di Luisa <http://www.lacucinadiluisa.it/>.

In Settimo Vittone nearby, there are a couple of restaurants known for cooking 
very good Piedmontese food. Try,Osteria La Sosta 
<http://www.osteria-lasosta.com/>, they serve chestnuts as a vegetable – and 
what chestnuts! They finish cooking them with cubes of fresh butter. Then there 
is thebagna cauda, an anchovy dip that you eat with raw vegetables, especially 
the wonderful local cardoons, which are related to artichokes.

Asti and Alba are both known for their truffles, but the people of Asti 
obviously think theirs are the best. I recommend the shop and restaurant
Sandrino Tartufi <http://sandrino-tartufi.it/>. During the season 
(September-early January for the white variety), you can eat fabulous truffles 
in any trattoria in Asti.

Further south at Monforte d'Alba, the Trattoria della Posta 
<http://www.trattoriadellaposta.it/> is a fantastic family-run restaurant that 
serves traditional dishes, in particular ravioli, bagna cauda, game, truffles 
and mushrooms.

The Piedmontese capital, Turin, is where you will find what I think are the 
best chocolates in the world, especially those made by Peyrano (peyrano.com 
<http://peyrano.com/>) and sold in its two shops (Corso Moncalieri 47, and 
Corso Vittorio Emanuele 76). There are lovelypasticcerie, sweet shops selling 
traditional sugared almond favours, and cafes.

A favourite is Caffè Torino, which is under the portico of Piazza San Carlo, 
near a bronze bull, the emblem of Turin. People say, "I'll see you at the 
bull." At the cafe – indeed all over Turin – they do incredible choux pastries 
calledbignole, which are stuffed with custard. Or visit Barratti e Milano 
<http://barattiemilano.it/>, the restaurant and cafe where they filmed part of 
the Italian Job.
