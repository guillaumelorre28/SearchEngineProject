They are avant-garde and often tricky to wear but the 1,800 earrings, 
bracelets, necklaces and brooches hand made byAlexander Calder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/09/alexander-calder-performing-sculpture-tate-modern-london-review-art>
 are seen as “the pinnacle of art meets jewellery,” according to gallerist 
Louisa Guinness.

She is staging the UK’s first solo exhibition of jewellery by the late 
American sculptor, best known asthe inventor of the mobile 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/23/alexander-calder-sculpture-fine-balance>
.

The jewellery was worn by Calder’s friends such as Peggy Guggenheim, Simone de 
Beauvoir and Georgia O’Keeffe, with the artist sometimes raiding cutlery 
drawers to create a bespoke piece from their knives, forks and scissors.

“It was like a secret club,” said Guinness. “People would wear it and you had 
to be bold and brave, it was like wearing a funny hat … people would look at 
you. It wasn’t for everyone, it wasn’t for the timid.”

It is easy to look at enormous Calder earrings worn by Guggenheim, or 
necklaces modelled by Angelica Huston and Brooke Shields and think: ‘Too 
difficult surely?’

Guinness disagrees. “The great saying that women have … we suffer to be 
beautiful. You don’t really suffer but it is not as comfortable as wearing a 
pair of gold studs. You feel great when you’re wearing it but you know you’re 
wearing it.”

Calder is probably the most famous artist who created jewellery on a regular 
basis. “He was the greatest because he actually, properly made it himself,” 
said Guinness. “He hammered on a bench, there were no intermediaries.”

His grandson, Sandy Rower, who runs the Calder Foundation 
<http://www.calder.org/>, said the artist started started making it as a child, 
making jewellery out of copper wire for his sister’s doll.

During the second world war it became something of a second income for him, 
but Calder continued even when his superstar status meant he made enough money 
from his sculptures.

It was an “extremely personal” undertaking, said Calder, mostly made for 
friends or special occasions. The artist shunned approaches from companies such 
as Tiffany to make editions for them.

“He felt that the physical object, like his sculptures, were imbued literally 
with his personal energy and to copy it would be just that, a copy. It wouldn’t 
be the same thing.

“Each piece is designed by him and made by his own hand and they’re all made 
by hammer, not made by casting, they’re not reproducible.”

Calder, who died in 1976, is recognised as one of the greatest American 
sculptors of the last century and wasthe subject of a major show at Tate Modern 
earlier this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/09/alexander-calder-exhibition-to-show-vandalised-sculpture-for-first-time>
.

Guinness, whose London gallery specialises in art jewellery said she was keen 
to show the contemporary relevance of Calder’s jewellery and hoped it might 
inspire the next generation of artists to take up the practice.
