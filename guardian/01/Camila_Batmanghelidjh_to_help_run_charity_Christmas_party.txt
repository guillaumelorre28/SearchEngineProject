Camila Batmanghelidjh, founder of the failed Kids Company 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/kids-company> charity, is to help run a 
Christmas party for more than 1,500 underprivileged children and their 
families, it has been reported.

She has been invited by the Rev Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis charitable 
trust <http://www.oasisuk.org/>, which is planning an event with bouncy 
castles, magicians and dance competitions on Christmas Eve. A smaller party for 
people who have been in care and would otherwise be alone will be held on 
Christmas Day.

Chalke told the Sunday Times: “I am in charge but I have invited Camila and 
some of her former staff to help run it and advise us. We think she is 
fantastic.”

Last week Alan Yentob, chair of trustees at Kids Company for more than a 
decade,resigned as the BBC’s creative director 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/dec/03/alan-yentob-steps-down-bbc-kids-company>
, saying media coverage of the scandal had become a distraction.

Yentob, who will retain his presenting role at the corporation, is expected to 
be criticised by MPs on the public administration and constitutional affairs 
committee when it reports on theKids Company 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/kids-company> collapse in a few weeks’ 
time. He has denied there was any mismanagement or failure of governance.

Yentob <https://www.theguardian.com/media/alan-yentob> had been the chair of 
trustees at Kids Company for 20 years.
