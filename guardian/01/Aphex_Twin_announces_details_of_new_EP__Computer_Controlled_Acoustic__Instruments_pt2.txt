Perhaps he blew his budget on Syro’s blimps and stencils 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjeseEtg04c>, because Aphex Twin just 
announced a new batch of songs via the very traditional method of email. 
Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt 2 comes out “everywhere” on 23 
January.

While described in the artwork as an EP, the release clocks up 14 tracks in 
total, given titles in Aphex’s garbled computer language, such as “piano un1 
arpej” and “diskhat2”.

News of this fresh material won’t come as such a surprise to fans, however: in 
an interview ahead of the release of his first new album in 13 years,Aphex Twin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/aphex-twin> explained that he has an 
extensive archive of unreleased music in the vaults “pretty much ready to go”, 
and that Syro represented about a fifth of what he’s done over the past 10 
years: “One album out of many possible ones,” he toldRolling Stone 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/04/aphex-twin-albums-eps-ready-syro-new-material>
.

He added: “I’m in that mode now, so hopefully I’ll stay in it for a while,” 
James said. “I’ve got a few more things planned – at least a couple more 
albums, some EPs, things like that. Some more dancey things I did about 10 
years ago. Experimental things, noise things, weird things. Shitloads of stuff. 
They’re all pretty much ready to go.”

Syro was released in September 2014. It clocked in at No 4 on the list of the 
Guardian’s album of the year list
