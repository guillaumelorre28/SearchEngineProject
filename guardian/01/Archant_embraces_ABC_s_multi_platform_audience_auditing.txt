Archant, the regional newspaper publisher that pulled 17 of its titles out of 
ABC auditing in 2011 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/feb/23/abcs-local-newspapers>
, is returning to the fold.

The company is also going to embrace ABC’s multi-platform reporting of 
audiences in future, providing figures for print, digital, web and social media.

ABC’s chief executive, Jerry Wright, said: “This is a smart move by Archant”. 
Multi-platform reporting “will be welcomed by agencies who are always keen to 
provide their clients with maximum transparency.”

According to its press release, all of Archant 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/archant> titles - its London weeklies plus 
its Norfolk and Suffolk-based dailies, such as the Eastern Daily Press and East 
Anglian Daily Times - will use the new audience system.

The London locals include the Ham & High, Ilford Recorder, London Advertiser 
and the Barking & Dagenham Post.
