Airy, chewy, choc-infused meringues bulging with a healthy berry and low-fat 
yoghurt filling. The lighter side of indulgence.

Serves 6

4 egg whites
A pinch of salt
225g golden caster sugar
25g cocoa powder
500g strawberries or blackberries, depending on the season, sliced
200g low-fat fromage frais

1. Preheat the oven to 140C/gas 1. Whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt 
until very stiff. Gradually add the sugar until stiff and shiny. Sift the 
cocoa, then whisk it in.

2. Spoon 12 oval shapes on to two baking trays lined with baking paper. Bake 
for 45 minutes until the outer shell is crisp, but the centre still feels soft. 
Carefully peel off the paper and leave to cool.

3. Wash and slice the berries. StirÂ them into the fromage frais.

4. Spoon the yoghurt mixture on to six of the meringues. Cover with the 
remaining meringue halves.
