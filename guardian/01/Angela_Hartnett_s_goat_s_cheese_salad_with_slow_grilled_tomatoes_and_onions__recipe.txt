This is a simple version of panzanella – a Tuscan salad using leftover bread 
to soak up the juices from over-ripe tomatoes. Try it with tapas-style dishes 
for a really summery supper.

(Serves 2)
8 ripe plum tomatoes
1 red onion
Pinch of rock salt
Touch of sugar (less than ¼ tsp)
2 sprigs of thyme, torn
One clove of garlic, roughly chopped
100ml olive oil, plus extra
20ml white wine vinegar
2 large pieces of sourdough bread, torn into cubes
1 spring onion, chopped
200g goat's cheese, crumbled

Cut the tomatoes in half and quarter the red onion, combine them and season 
with salt and a touch of sugar.

Add the thyme and garlic and a dash of olive oil.

Place in the oven at 180C (350F/gas mark 4) for 20 minutes until it all starts 
to shrivel.

Beat together the oil and vinegar until emulsified and set aside.

Put a dash of oil into a large frying pan, add the torn sourdough, season with 
a touch of rock salt and toast until golden brown and crispy.

Remove the vegetables from the oven, allow to cool slightly and then mix with 
the toasted sourdough.

Combine with the vinaigrette and spring onion and finish with the crumbled 
goat's cheese.
