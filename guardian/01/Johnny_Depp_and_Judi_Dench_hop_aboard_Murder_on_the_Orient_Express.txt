The casting mirrors the A-list pedigree that characterized Sidney Lumet’s 1974 
take on Christie’s 1934 mystery novel, which starred Albert Finney, Lauren 
Bacall, Ingrid Bergman and Sean Connery. The plot follows detective Hercule 
Poirot and his efforts to solve a murder case aboard the famous train.

Branagh is pulling double-duty on the project, leading his cast as Poirot. 
Angelina Jolie <https://www.theguardian.com/film/angelinajolie> was initially 
offered the role of Mrs Harriet Hubbard, a glamorous passenger who’s deemed a 
suspect, but after she passed, it’s now gone to Pfeiffer. Dench is on as 
Princess Dragomiroff, who hails from Russian royalty, while Depp will play 
Ratchett, the man whose murder sets the plot into motion. Further additions to 
the cast include Derek Jacobi and Hamilton actor Leslie Odom Jr.

This marks Depp’s second casting announcement since settling

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/07/johnny-depp-set-tupac-notorious-big-film-labyrinth>
. Coming up, he reprises his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in next summer’s 
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.

Shooting for Murder on the Orient Express is expected to begin in November, 
with locations including London and Malta. Green Lantern writer Michael Green 
penned the screenplay.

Fox will release the film on 22 November 2017.
