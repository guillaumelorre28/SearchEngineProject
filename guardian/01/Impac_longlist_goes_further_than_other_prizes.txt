As a reader, I've always felt that the real thrill of prize nomination lists 
lies not so much in the winner they produce, but in the surprises they throw up 
along the way – the discovery of writers and novels who might otherwise have 
remained outside our fields of vision. And it is for this reason that the 
announcement of theImpac Dublin International Literary Award 
<http://www.impacdublinaward.ie/> longlist is a gift for readers in search of 
unexpected delights.

First things first: the Impac longlist is not like other longlists; it is not 
a handful of carefully selected books that will be further winnowed to achieve 
the shortlist. Rather, it is a full list of the books competing for next year's 
prize: every single title nominated by 110 participating libraries across the 
world. Each library can select up to three titles published in English 
(including translations), but many end up nominating the same novel –Hilary 
Mantel's Bring Up the Bodies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/bring-up-the-bodies-hilary-mantel-review>
 andRichard Ford's Canada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/canada-richard-ford-review> 
received nine nominations each – and so the list consists of a formidable 152 
titles rather than a truly gargantuan 300.

It is this lack of pre-selection – no limit on publishers' entries, no 
pre-selection of titles – that makes the Impac longlist so interesting and 
varied, if not slightly idiosyncratic. Nobel, Booker and Pulitzer Prize-winners 
(Herta Müller,Peter Carey <https://www.theguardian.com/books/petercarey>, Pat 
Barker <https://www.theguardian.com/books/pat-barker>) sit alongside 
determinedly commercial novels (Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/01/gillian-flynn-bestseller-gone-girl-misogyny>
,Ian Rankin's Standing in Another Man's Grave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/01/standing-mans-grave-ian-rankin-review>
). Giant New York Times bestsellers (JK Rowling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/jkrowling>, Richard Ford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/richard-ford>) jostle for the judges' 
attention with writers published by small independent presses in Ethiopia or 
Bosnia (Tariku Abas Etenesh, Selvedin Avdić). Libraries are free to nominate 
whatever novel they wish, as long as they consider their choice representative 
of "excellence", but it is clear from the list that libraries interpret this 
differently, which results in its unpredictability and democracy.

For me, the real attraction of the huge scale of the Impac longlist is the 
inclusion of translated works, which creates a feeling that literature is 
universal, and that readers all over the world are somehow participating in a 
joint exercise of discovering what people are reading elsewhere. Over the past 
two years, I've been devoting much time and energy to the art of translating 
fiction, and have been struck by just how much readers in English are missing 
out because of the lack of commercial support for titles in translation – so 
the inclusion of 41 novels drawn from 17 languages on the Impac list is a way 
of opening a window to the vast wealth of non-Anglophone literature. So far, 
seven translated titles have won the Impac Dublin award, so these novels are 
not on the list for mere decoration.

The award has a reputation for producing quirky, if not downright obscure, 
winners. That may be to do with the fact that some winning authors have been 
little known to English-speaking readers –Michel Houellebecq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/michelhouellebecq>, Javier Marias 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/may/07/featuresreviews.guardianreview34>
,Tahar Ben Jelloun 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview27>
 andPer Pettersen  
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/03/per-petterson-interview>were 
already well-established in their own countries and indeed elsewhere, but 
winning the Impac certainly boosted their reputations. However, the last three 
winners have been Anglophone (City of Bohane by Kevin Barry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/14/city-bohane-kevin-barry-review>, 
Even the Dogs by Jon McGregor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/23/even-the-dogs-jon-mcgregor>, Let 
the Great World Spin by Colum McCann 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/30/let-great-world-spin-mccann>), 
and it's also true that reading books from so many different literary cultures 
and genres helps the reader think about fiction in different, less rigid ways – 
this too might explain the unconventional results. Reading a Nobel Prize winner 
followed by a Scandinavian crime novel is not something most readers will be in 
the habit of doing, but I'm looking forward to the experience.

The shortlist will be announced next April
