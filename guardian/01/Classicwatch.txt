Antoine de Saint-Exupéry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/antoine-de-saint-exupery>, best known for 
The Little Prince , became obsessed with aviation as a boy, and in 1926, after 
qualifying as a military pilot, he began flying for the airline Latécoere, 
opening up the first mail routes across the Sahara and the Andes.

Wind, Sand and Stars , first published in 1939, is his poetic account of the 
five years spent in pioneering flights for Latécoere. The perils of early 
flight are not romanticised - the unreliable engines, the terrifying weather of 
desert and mountain. But Saint-Exupéry evokes with the pure passion of the 
adventurer how it feels to look down over uncharted territories. 'Those who 
have experienced the inexpressible love of flying will understand me fully.'

Into his own history he weaves the stories of nomadic Arabs he meets, and the 
courage of fellow pilots, but the climax of this slim and beautifully written 
book is the tale of his near-fatal crash in the Libyan desert in 1936. The 
description of his survival is unemotional and profoundly moving.
