A producer of An Open Secret, a controversial documentary about child sex 
abuse in Hollywood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/22/an-open-secret-documentary-reveals-paedophilia-in-hollywood>
, has complained to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) afterthe 
ratings body <http://www.mpaa.org/film-ratings/> gave the film an R 
classification, “for some descriptions of sexual abuse 
<http://filmratings.com/search.html?filmTitle=open+secret&x=0&y=0>”. 

The documentary explores the systematic grooming and abuse of young actors. It 
includes testimonials from men who claim they were drugged and coerced into 
performing sex acts at parties hosted by prominent film-makers.

In a letter to the MPAA 
<http://anopensecretfilm.com/2015/07/12/producer-gabe-hoffmans-letter-to-the-mpaa-about-films-r-rating/>
, the documentary’s producer Gabe Hoffman wrote that the film-makers had 
purposefully included “extremely bland language” in the film to describe sex in 
order to make the documentary accessible to the teenage audience it aims to 
protect. “It is quite difficult to understand how such descriptions would 
qualify for an R rating, utilising either commonsense analysis or the MPAA’s 
own ratings precedents,” he wrote.

The MPAA’s R rating prevents those under 17 from seeing a film without a 
parent or guardian. It is considered to negatively influence a film’s chances 
at the box office, as many cinemas refuse to show R-rated films.

“We were extremely disappointed to find our film – which discusses these 
issues maturely and carefully – thrown into the same category as films which 
display gratuitous sex and violence,” he wrote. “I am especially disappointed 
to think that millions of Americans, both young and old, may be misled by this 
rating, and conclude that the content ofAn Open Secret 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/an-open-secret> is not appropriate for them – 
when it most certainly is.”

Hoffman has asked MPAA chairman Christopher Dodd to review the decision and 
recategorise An Open Secret as PG-13. He wrote: “If just one single teen … 
finds their inner strength, and is able to escape their current abuse situation 
because of your decision, wouldn’t that make your time spent personally 
reviewing the film, and its rating, all worthwhile?”

The MPPA has not commented on Hoffman’s request. 

Hoffman, a hedge-fund manager, told an audience at this year’s Cannes film 
festival that he had bankrolled screenings of the film in 20 US cities after 
American distribution companies had refused to touch it. He has since secured a 
distribution deal with Rocky Mountain Pictures. An Open Secret is on limited 
release in the US now and is yet to secure a release date in the UK.

Gabe Hoffman as a “former hedge fund manager”. In fact he is still a hedge fund 
manager as well as a producer. This has been corrected.
