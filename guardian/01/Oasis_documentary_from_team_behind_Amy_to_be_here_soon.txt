.

Amy director Asif Kapadia will join James Gay-Rees, producer of Amy and Senna, 
in a production role on theOasis <https://www.theguardian.com/music/oasis> 
film, which according to Screen will “chart the journey from the moment in 1991 
when Noel joined his brother Liam’s band”. Screen also reports that “the 
film-makers have been given ‘unprecedented’ access to the band and unseen 
archive footage and the film will include candid insight from the famously 
stormy brothers”.

Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll’s Mat Whitecross will direct the film, having 
previously taken charge of not-dissimilar material in the shape of Spike 
Island, the 2012 feature about a group of music fans desperate to get tickets 
for the Stone Roses’ Spike Island concert in 1990.

, its success has given fresh impetus to films about popular British music 
acts. After the release of their debut album Definitely Maybe in 1994, Oasis 
achieved consistently high sales and fan adulation until the band split in 2009.
