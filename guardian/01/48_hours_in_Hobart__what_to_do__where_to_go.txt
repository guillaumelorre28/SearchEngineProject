Call it the Mona <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/mona> effect if you 
will, but Hobart is having a long tourist moment, and Australia’s southernmost 
capital is more than ready.

Hobart now hosts Australia’s edgiest (and best) arts festivals, Dark Mofo 
<https://darkmofo.net.au/> and Mona Foma, has the country’s most consistently 
interesting and talked-about art gallery with a roster of brilliant visiting 
artists, and an increasing number of creative Australians are relocating from 
the mainland to call it home.

The music and the art are just the start of it. The Tasmanian capital today is 
also a magnet for gourmands, with fresh local produce as well as wine and cider 
making the short journey from farm to your table. It’s also – in warmer months 
– ideal for those who like outdoor adventures. On a recent visit I took a walk 
up nearby Mount Wellington, with its cool, thin air, eucalyptus trees and 
stunning views, and also kayaked on the Derwent river.

If you don’t feel like exerting yourself, Hobart’s lively market and 
restaurant scene is more than enough reason to go to there for 48 hours.

You can take the Spirit of Tasmania ferry <http://www.spiritoftasmania.com.au/>
 from Melbourne, but cheap flights are available from most Australian cities.

A cab will cost you around $50 from the airport to the CBD, but if you’d 
prefer to save money for pinot noir, the shuttle bus will cost you considerably 
less.

Friday

4pm: Pre-dinner drinks at Preachers

My favourite pub in Hobart 
<https://www.zomato.com/tasmania-tas/preachers-battery-point> is just up a hill 
and down a side street from the wharf area of Salamanca. Preachers won’t jump 
out at you if you’re in the main waterfront area but it is worth seeking out.

Some of the best things about this laid-back pub? In winter, board games and 
an open fire. In summer, an old bus parked on the lawn where you can take your 
drinks and feel like a subversive schoolkid, plus the fabulous front lawn with 
loads of places to sit in the sun.

All year round it has great burgers and the some of the best hot chips I’ve 
ever eaten.

But don’t fill up too much. There has been a burst of new restaurants in 
Hobart, and each time I’ve visited there seems to be more choice than the 
previous year.

7pm: Dinner

Frank, a newish restaurant <http://frankrestaurant.com.au/> on the waterfront, 
does very good South American food, with a lot of the dishes designed for 
sharing. We started with negronis and local oysters before moving on to the 
heavier stuff.

The beef rump cap is great and has a nice char on it, but I also recommend the 
grilled Tasmanian salmon with brazil nuts, dill, coriander and mixed herb 
salsa, and if you’re vegetarian, the charred sweet potato, goat’s curd, muddled 
almonds, garlic and coriander dish.

10pm: Cocktails

If it’s a mild night, wander down the other end of the wharf to the Henry 
Jones Art hotel <http://www.thehenryjones.com/wineanddine-en.html> for an 
after-dinner drink in the exposed sandstone bar. They have a great range of 
cocktails plus local beers and ciders.

Coghlan/flickr <https://www.flickr.com/photos/mikecogh/3067121151/> 
But if it’s after midnight, maybe turn in. Local political adviser and former 
journalist Alex Johnston helped the Guardian with our itinerary after we met 
him at a bar in Salamanca. His advice for late Friday night: cut your losses. 
“Hobart’s achilles heel is a lack of really good options after midnight. If 
you’re desperately thirsty, ask a local how to get to Mobius for a cleansing 
ale and maybe even a dance. It’s not pretty, but it’s fun. But I stress, the 
later you have dinner, the better night you’ll have.”

As for accommodation, here’s his advice: “If you’ve just won big in a poker 
game or inherited a fortune from an email-savvy Nigerian, you should probably 
stay at theIslington hotel <http://www.islingtonhotel.com/> or the Henry Jones 
<http://www.thehenryjones.com/>. If those prices make your head hurt, you’ll 
have a perfectly nice time staying at theSalamanca Inn. 
<http://www.salamancainn.com.au/>”

I split my time between the Salamanca Wharf hotel  
<http://www.salamancawharfhotel.com/>and the Salamanca Inn.

When I was there last, rooms at the Salamanca Inn were, well, roomy, but 
slightly dated. The Salamanca Wharf hotel was much smarter, had more modern 
fittings and a very good cafe attached. Both are centrally located and just a 
short walk to the wharf so you can get a ferry to Mona without too much mucking 
around.

Saturday

10am: Brunch and Salamanca market

A good breakfast is not hard to find in Hobart. Tricycle 
<https://www.zomato.com/tasmania-tas/tricycle-cafe-bar-hobart> is cute, with 
yummy baked eggs, andMachine Laundry cafe 
<https://plus.google.com/106606662649561947702/about?gl=au&hl=en> at Salamanca 
Place has great coffee. It’s both a laundromat and a cafe (hence the name) and 
also looks out on to a giant chess set in the square if you fancy a game 
between rinse cycles.

Our local pal Alex recommends Berta <http://www.bertahobart.com.au/> and Room 
For A Pony <https://www.facebook.com/pages/Room-for-a-pony/632297296859789>, 
both in North Hobart, for breakfast. “However if you’re closer to the 
waterfront,Smolt <http://smolt.com.au/> or Machine Laundry cafe are the 
standout choices,” he says. “Be careful though, the Salamanca market is on 
every Saturday. It might be prudent to keep away if you’ve got a hangover, 
unless you’re really craving a bratwurst, a lamb roll or some ornamental wooden 
fruit. If you’ve got a car, zip five minutes up the road to South Hobart’s
Ginger Brown <https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ginger-Brown-Cafe/251311604926180>
.”

I don’t actually mind the markets, but on big weekends, such as any time Mona 
has a festival, it can become impossible to navigate. Otherwise it’s a treat. 
There’s the usual tourist tat but also some lovely jewellery, secondhand 
clothes, secondhand books, Australiana and some delicious local produce. As 
well as cheese, jams and chutneys, there are a couple of caravans selling pies. 
If you’re game, try the wallaby. I had the scallop pie. Yum! The morning air 
was so crisp that biting into it unleashed a torrent of steam. Be careful not 
to burn the roof of your mouth. My pie was $7 from a van calledSmiths 
<http://www.smithspies.com.au/>.

There are some good shops in the arcades around the market. My favourite is a 
cramped and marvellous secondhand bookstore called Deja Vu Books. Make sure you 
are not just flying in with carry-on luggage so you can take a haul back.

Also good is Fullers bookshop <http://www.fullersbookshop.com.au/>, which is 
up in the main shopping area and has a cafe inside. While there are good shops 
down on Salamanca, it would be a mistake to confine yourself to that precinct.

Daci & Daci <https://www.zomato.com/tasmania-tas/daci-daci-bakers-hobart> 
sells amazing cakes,Red Parka <http://redparka.com.au/> stocks cool crafts and 
fun non-souvenir souvenirs, whileLuxe <http://www.luxestore.com.au/> sells posh 
clothes and shoes. There was a pop-up shop selling jewellery and clothes made 
in Hobart (now sadly gone, but keep your eyes peeled for other pop-up stores) 
plus half a dozen great places to have coffee including the Criterion Street 
Cafe and Betsey.

2.30pm: Mona (Museum of Old and New Art)

The Mona ferry <http://www.mona.net.au/visit/getting-here/>, which leaves at 
2:30pm on Saturdays from the wharf down at Salamanca, is an experience in 
itself. It’s a proper grown-up ferry, with a smart bar attached, music and cool 
couches, not the usual utilitarian public transport-style seats.

You could spend a whole day at Mona <http://www.mona.net.au/> but two or three 
hours will give you a sense of the best bits. The building itself is stunning. 
Have a drink at the bar – and make sure you check out the Madonna room, one of 
my favourite exhibits at the museum, where 30 of her fans are depicted singing 
songs from her Immaculate Collection.

The stunning Sidney Nolan snake mural is also a must-see.

If you want an alternate activity, I recommend a visit to the Cascade Brewery 
<https://cascadebreweryco.com.au/>, a gorgeous 183-year-old building where you 
can take a brewery tour. For the more active, take a walk up Mount Wellington, 
which looms atmospherically over Hobart.

7pm: Fancy dinner

We dined at Garagistes, which was like Tetsuya’s in Sydney but hipper and more 
chilled out. Unfortunately, between my visit and this piece being published, it 
shut down, but I’m hoping for some very similar creative, high-end, fusion food 
to come up in its place.

In the mean time, our local guide Alex has some hot tips. For pre-dinner 
drinks he advises heading toWilling Bros <https://www.facebook.com/willingbros> 
in North Hobart.

“Willing Bros was the best bar to open in Hobart in 2014 and I promise you 
it’ll be a good time,” says Alex. “[It has an] interesting, well-priced wine 
list, plenty of good beers and excellent service. You can’t go wrong. They 
serve some tasty morsels too, so if you’re confident of not ruining dinner you 
should go right ahead. Pull the pin and jump back in a cab when it’s time to go 
to dinner.”

Alex advises booking a couple of weeks in advance for Franklin 
<http://franklinhobart.com.au/>, but be careful not to get it confused with 
Franks, where the Guardian ate the night before.

“Franklin is the latest venture from the perversely talented David Moyle. Here 
you’re going to try things you’ve probably never eaten before. Lots of seafood 
but not a fisherman’s basket in sight. This is refined stuff. If you dig 
organic wines, you’ll be right at home.”

Sunday

9am: Farmers’ market

The Farm Gate market <http://farmgatemarket.com.au/> is held on Bathurst 
Street in Hobart’s CBD every Sunday from 8:30am-1pm and is the place to go for 
fresh Tassie grown-and-raised produce.

As the largest farmers’ market in Tasmania, be sure to bring a basket to stock 
up on pickles, relishes, jams and fresh meats such as free-range Berkshire pork 
as well as game and rare breed beef.

Alex reckons you can eat the best sushi in Tasmania at the market, so maybe 
have an early lunch. “Masaaki is normally down at Geeveston but on Sundays he 
comes to you. I can guarantee the wasabi will be a lot fresher than you.”

When I visited I bought Tasmanian apples picked fresh from the farm which I 
ate from the bag. Be sure to you line your stomach as you’ll be hitting the 
hard stuff before you return to the mainland.

Midday: Seaplane

Beyond the restaurant scene and galleries, Tasmania is still largely 
wilderness. You might not have time to explore much of it over the course of 
your 48 hours, but ashort seaplane ride <http://tasmanianairadventures.com.au/> 
will allow you get a sense of Hobart from the air. A 30-minute trip around 
Hobart, the majestic Derwent river and surrounds is sufficient to get a sense 
of the lie of the land and costs $125.

2pm, Lark whisky distillery 


I’d never been much of a whisky drinker, but in the interests of thorough 
journalism I thought I’d pay a visit to one of Australia’s most famous 
distilleries.


Located near Salamanca wharf, Lark <http://www.larkdistillery.com.au/> has won 
many awards for its single malt whisky.

<https://www.flickr.com/photos/haynes/5272632925/> 
Scotsman Robbie gave us an enthusiastic lecture about the product, which he is 
clearly passionate about. You don’t scull whisky like you would a tequila shot, 
he explained, but take small sips and sort of roll it around in your mouth, 
letting it coat your tongue and throat.

Once I got used to the whisky’s “burn”, the warm feeling afterwards was lovely.

After two or three tastings I was ready – or maybe I wasn’t – to take a flight 
back to the mainland.
