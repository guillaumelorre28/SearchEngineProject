I'm single and often buy too much food for just one person. What is the best 
way to avoid doing this?

Joanna Wood, Stockport

Shopping for one would be a pleasure for me! You can choose what you want and 
cook it exactly the way you like it without any complaints. That said, I 
understand the need to avoid overbuying. Unfortunately, it's something that 
affects us all. I have often succumbed to 2-for-1 "bargains" only to find the 
second packet weeks later lurking in the nether regions of the fridge, uneaten.

To begin, try to get in the habit of shopping more regularly. Although this 
sounds time-consuming, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. Use 
independent shops if they are within easy reach of your home or place of work. 
Even though supermarkets do have their best offers wrapped and packed in twos, 
threes or fours, you can buy smaller quantities of food, such as individual 
fruit and vegetables, from independent shops. Because you are not overbuying, 
the little extra you spend is nearly always saved, rather than thrown away, in 
the long run.

When you are buying for one meal, try to visualise how much you would like to 
eat. Resist the urge to buy enough for two or three meals. In my experience, 
you won't want to eat the same meal tomorrow, or (my failing) you'll end up 
eating too much in one sitting just because it's there.

But the biggest bonus of buying regularly from independent shops is that the 
process itself should become a social pleasure. I speak from experience: some 
of my customers will buy only 50g of Wigmore cheese or a dozen olives at a 
time, but because they come in daily, they have become more than customers to 
me.
