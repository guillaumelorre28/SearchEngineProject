For many people it is easy to stereotype Somalis as agents of terrorism, 
annoying refugees, gun-wielding pirates or competing warlords. Not the 
peaceful, resilient people they really are, say the team behindSomali Faces 
<http://www.somalifaces.org/> – an online project highlighting the everyday 
stories of Somalis around the world.

Ever since the civil war broke out in 1991, millions of Somalis  
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12285365>have sought refuge abroad. 
Some stayed in the region <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-35478963>, 
others made their way to Europe and continue to do so.

On Monday, up to 200  <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-36071737>Somali 
refugees were reported to have drowned in a boat crossing the Mediterranean on 
the way to Greece.

The United Nations refugee agency said “hopes of greater stability” have led 
to waves of refugees returning to Somalia, but a further1 millio 
<http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e483ad6.html>n remain internally displaced 
<http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e483ad6.html>, mostly in the south, which has 
been blighted by violence at the hands ofIslamist militant group al-Sh

.

Loss and hope

Somalis live to tell powerful stories – of loss but also of hope, say the duo 
behind the project, who have been sharing people’s stories in English and 
Somali but say they want to withhold their contributors’ names for now.

Donia Jamal Adam <http://www.somalifaces.org/team> is a human rights advocate 
and campaigner, andMohammed Ibrahim Shire <http://www.somalifaces.org/team> is 
an author and PhD student. Both are also amateur photographers.

They have two objectives <http://www.somalifaces.org/about>: to reconstruct 
the global image of Somalis by challenging tired stereotypes, and to encourage 
fellow Somalis to rise above tribalism.

Adam and Shire curated the project by visiting and talking to Somalis across 
the globe, from the residents of the autonomous republic ofSomaliland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/somaliland> to the diaspora, and found that 
“every Somali – toddler or a centenarian – has a story to tell”.

My biggest ambition is to make my country great again. I’ve seen pictures of 
howSomalia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia> used to be before I was 
born, before the destruction. How could it have disappeared?

I ask myself why I wasn’t born in the generation enjoying peace. Then I think 
that it can be rebuilt and it makes me smile. I want my generation to be the 
ones to make Somalia great again. God willing.

Somali girls usually follow one of three routes: they shun education and get 
married young, they risk their lives trying to get to Europe, or waste time 
until their wedding day.

I’ve been told numerous times that my place is at home

I’ve been told numerous times that my place is at home and I’m wasting it with 
education, but I never let other people’s opinions sway the path I’ve set. I 
will be going to university soon.

The majority of my peers see education as something to occupy yourself with 
until marriage, a leisure activity. I love helping out at the house but it 
should not deter me from pursuing an education too. Somali women are not just 
house objects or baby-making machines.

My family, and others I interacted with, didn’t really know how to raise, or 
approach, a blind girl.

During my younger years, we lived in a village called Higlale, close to a 
large well, and one morning I accompanied my mother to collect water.

Two figures approached, they turned out to be a distant aunt and her son. My 
aunt said: “Who is this beautiful girl sitting next to you... is she the blind 
girl?” Over the years I have got used to that term.

The son sat next to me and patiently told me the names and the colours of the 
flowers I was holding – although I’ve never seen them, I love how they feel in 
my hands. No one had ever done that for me before.

From that day we spent a lot of time together. I fell in love with him but it 
took years to pluck up the courage to say it. When I did he replied: “How is it 
possible for you to love ... you are blind and can’t see me?”

 A close friend and I decided to leave the capital Mogadishu and travel the 
usual path: from Ethiopia, Sudan, Libya and then into Europe.

But we ran out of money and got stranded in Ethiopia. I was broke, couldn’t 
speak Amharic. I had very little money left but decided to buy a Somali-English 
dictionary. Every day I studied 20 words and within two months I was able to 
understand news programmes in English.

One day, I met an American who wanted to learn Somali and we agreed that he 
would pay me 50 Ethiopian birr (£1.65) every half an hour of teaching. He 
tested it on a trip to the Ethiopia-Somali region and returned praising me 
profusely and offered me a good job. Money comes and goes but knowledge lasts 
forever.

I was six years old when I went out to play with my friends. We didn’t have 
much so we scanned the place for objects that we could play with. I found a 
metal object that was beautifully shaped but it got hot so I chucked it away, 
throwing it in the air and giving it a kick. It blew up and I fell unconscious.

The UN visited me and offered to help me walk again. I was the first Somali to 
have artificial legs fitted

I next opened my eyes in hospital. I tried to get up but I had lost both of my 
legs. After several months the United Nations visited and offered to help me 
walk again. I was the first Somali to have artificial legs fitted.

In 1996, I attended an international conference on the elimination of 
landmines in Switzerland and they asked me what they could do to help. I told 
them to build a school in my birth city [Hargeisa] and they did.


It was named after me and I finished high school there. I now have a 
bachelor’s degree and campaign for local organisations that raise awareness for 
disabled Somali people.

There is a huge difference in the way Somalis use the clan structure these 
days. We had a code of conduct back in the day.

For example, if a local from Hargeisa [in Somaliland] was travelling by car or 
horse all the way to [the Somalian capital] Mogadishu without food or water, 
the Somali clans he would meet on the way would supply him with provisions.

They would help him with tips and advice. They would never refuse him, that 
would be the biggest disgrace. He would be treated better as a traveller from a 
different clan than a local member from the area.

This was our code, before we acquired statehood in 1960. Now we have pure 
tribalism devoid of rationality.
