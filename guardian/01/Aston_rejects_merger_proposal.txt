Aston University has rejected the University of Central England's merger 
proposal, citing "significant differences between the missions and strategies" 
of the two institutions as a main influencing factor in its decision.

Another factor could have been a last-minute letter from Advantage West 
Midlands - a regional development agency - the government office of the West 
Midlands and Birmingham city council, that suggested Aston merge with the 
University of Birmingham as well as UCE.

Two hours before the decision, Advantage West Midlands sent a fax to Aston, 
UCE and Birmingham stressing that, considering growing economic competition 
from Manchester and the south, it would be financially more viable for the 
region to consider a "three way convergence".

The vice-chancellor of UCE, Peter Knight, had hoped a merged university would 
establish a major economic force in the north and east of the city, as well as 
regenerating the area around both campuses.

Dr Knight said he was "clearly disappointed" at Aston's decision. One of the 
reasons for the proposed merger was that the two universities had little direct 
competition in the curriculum.

"Leading-edge research could have been developed side-by-side with initiatives 
to widen participation among groups that have not traditionally had access to 
higher education," said Dr Knight.

But he added: "Nobody can argue for a bilateral merger if Advantage West 
Midlands and Birmingham city council oppose it."

The UCE board has yet to consider a merger between all three universities and 
will not discuss it until the next year.

But Dr Knight said he did not believe an association between the three 
universities would happen in the near future. "Bringing the three universities 
together is extraordinarily difficult," he said. "From the perspective of UCE 
it is now 100% business as usual."
