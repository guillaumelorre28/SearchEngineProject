There are two things to say about the extraordinary rise and rise of the Daily 
Mail's online operation. One is that with unique browsers up 82.6% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/23/abce-mail-online> in a year (to 
77.2 million a month and 4.36 million a day on the ABCe figures for May) it's a 
phenomenon, making huge strides in the US, on apps and in every direction.

The other is that, as Mail executives themselves say, it's separate – 
deliberately "different". It isn't like the (also surging)Guardian and Telegraph
 sites. It isn't integrated with the main print paper or its journalism. It is 
there, in their words, to "defend" the print product, not supplant it.

It is lightly staffed, without paywalls, making a profit from relatively small 
advertising revenue and concentrating on highly professional celebrity 
journalism in a way that Richard Desmond (who has sold hisOK! magazine's 
American venture after six stony years) can only envy.

The future for newspapers, then? Perhaps: but only if you register the extreme 
levels of separation. Martin Clarke and his team have, in effect, started a new 
news product on the net sailing underMail colours: salvation a very distinct 
and targeted way.

■ Revenue: up 9%. Operating profit: up 10%. Advertising: up 15%. Print 
circulation: up 4% (and 11% in the UK). Online unique visits: up 39%. And, as 
theEconomist takes its £63m from the last financial year and moves buoyantly 
on, remember one vital thing.

The vast bulk of this success still comes from printed words on paper. There 
is no digital draining effect, just added impact. The business of news analysis 
– and explanation with attitude – has never been stronger.
