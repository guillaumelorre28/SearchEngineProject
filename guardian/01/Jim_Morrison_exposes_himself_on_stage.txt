By 1969, the authorities had it in for Jim Morrison. The Doors were now at the 
forefront of the Dionysiac wing of the hippy movement, with all the altered 
states, carnality, disorder and disregardÂ for authority that entailed. One hot, 
late night in Miami, a worse-for-wear Morrison baited the crowd at a gig, 
disrobing. The incident has gone down in rock lore as the beginning of the end 
for Morrison, who died two years later.
