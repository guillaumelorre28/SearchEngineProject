Angus Deayton <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/angus-deayton>, the 
former Have I Got News for You host, is returning to BBC Radio 4 next year for 
his first major radio comedy series in more than 20 years.

Deayton will present a new six-part series called It's Your Round in which 
guests bring their own invented round to the programme. Recording has started 
and has so far featured the comedian Miles Jupp – whose round is called "What 
would you dad say?" – Arthur Smith and Rebecca Front.

It's Your Round launches on 17 February at 11pm and is Deayton's first major 
series since Radio Active, theRadio 4 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio4>
 comedy set in a fictional radio station and including in its cast the late 
Geoffrey Perkins and Helen Atkinson-Wood. The award-winning show ran on the 
network between 1981 and 1987 before transferring to BBC2 as KYTV.

After that Deayton went on to a number of high profile TV roles including a 
part in the comedy One Foot in the Grave as well as presenting Have I Got News 
for You for 12 years. He left theBBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> 
panel show in 2002 following a string of revelations about his private life.

Other Radio <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/radio> 4 comedy promised for 
next year includes the launch of a podcast called Comedy of the Week: Mondays 
Don't Have to be Miserable, which follows the network's successful Friday night 
podcast.

January called Showstopper! The Improvised Musical. It stars Pippa Evans, Ruth 
Bratt, Lucy Todd, Sean McCann, Dylan Emery and Oliver Senton.
