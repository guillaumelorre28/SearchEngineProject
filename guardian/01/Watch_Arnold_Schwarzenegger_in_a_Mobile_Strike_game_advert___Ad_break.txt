Android: ‘Monotune’ (starts at 00:06) - US

As the “making of” film <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwls25ooBmY> makes 
clear, the team behind this advert for Android went to extraordinary lengths to 
make their point. Rather than taking advantage of post-production techniques, 
they actually re-engineered a piano so each key produced the same note and 
obliged professional pianist Ji Yong Kim to see what kind of music he could 
make with it. All in the name of implying that iPhone devotees are mindless 
clones.

Samsung: ‘The Only Way To Know’ (starts at 01:07) - US

This beautiful representation of the odyssey towards Olympic greatness 
features battles with self-doubt evolving into something more hopeful in a 
fashion that puts you on the edge of your seat. It’s a style of advertising 
that can be overblown and bombastic, but when done well it can result in a 
really compelling piece of film - and this is terrific.

Anchor Milk: ‘Go Strong’ (starts at 02:47) - New Zealand

Australian-Japanese director Kiku Ohe has pulled out all the stops in this 
solemn New Zealand commercial for Anchor which urges the locals to ‘go strong’ 
in pursuit of whatever moves them. It incorporates a rugged sailor; a 
transgender beauty queen; and a collection of grannies practising a haka... 
that’s not a sentence you expected to read today, is it?

Mobile Strike: ‘Arnold’s Fight’ (starts at 04:08) - UK

Arnold Schwarzenegger trades on his reputation for enjoying nihilistic mayhem 
in a scene which appears to have him fighting off determined News of the Word 
reporters trying to get hold of his mobile phone. It’s downright silly but 
Arnie’s fans seem certain to enjoy it and will be desperate to download this 
free game... if they can just figure out where to find the “Up Store”.

Toyota Prius: ‘The Longest Chase’ (starts at 05:13) - US

Fans of The Wire will notice something very familiar about this gang of 
ham-fisted bank robbers. In a nod to the drama’s second season, Toyota have 
reunited three members of the Sobotka family (actors Chris Bauer, Pablo 
Schreiber, and James Ransone) for some light-hearted criminal activity. Along 
the way, they make the case for the environmentally-friendly vehicle.

Toyota Prius: ‘Heck on Wheels’ (starts at 06:47) - US

If you’re going to challenge mistaken perceptions about your car, you may as 
well go the whole hog – and directorial duo Terri Timely has done exactly that 
in this exceedingly daft piece... also for the Toyota’s Prius. It is – 
according to the lyrics of the advert’s magnificent silly song – “heck on 
wheels”.
