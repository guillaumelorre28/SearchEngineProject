Forget elves, Santa and reindeer – Christmas 2016 is all about the mermaid. 
Or, to put it more accurately, the mermaid blanket. Resembling a knitted 
sleeping bag with a fish-like tail, and available for children and adults, the 
mermaid blanket is this year’s answer to theslanket

or theonesie

Sceptics might not appreciate the slightly fishy design, not to mention the 
impracticality of whipping it off for that ad-break cup of tea, but this 
accessory has already become themost-watched deal on Amazon on Cyber Monday 
<http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/25/pf/amazon-cyber-monday-sales/> and a 
bestseller on Asos.

Anyone who uses public transport in London will be familiar with Blue 
Vanilla’s Ariel mermaid blanket – advertised on the tube with the image of a 
glamorous young woman on a couch, in full hair and makeup, blanket pulled up to 
her chest.

The online fast-fashion retailer has already sold more than 11,000 Ariels at 
£29 a pop, and has a waiting list of roughly 1,000 people. Online marketing 
manager Teresa Ktistaki predicts another 6,000 could be sold before Christmas. 
“It’s a nice gift because it’s useful but also fun,” she says of the product, 
which was originally launched in October.

Mermaids have been a thing in pop culture for a while – from Azealia Banks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/azealia-banks>’s Mermaid Ball performance 
<http://pitchfork.com/news/46734-photos-azealia-banks-mermaid-ball/> in 2012 to

Mermaid blankets are already massive on social media, with more than 27,000 
posts for#mermaidblanket 
<https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mermaidblanket/> – and that’s before 
the tearing of wrapping paper on Christmas morning reveals several thousand 
more.

Celebrities including Geordie Shore <http://www.mtv.co.uk/geordie-shore>’s 
Holly Hagan 
<https://twitter.com/HollyGShore?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor>
 have further boosted the chances of finding a mermaid blanket under the tree – 
in September, sheposted a picture on Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/hollygshore/status/780483349202735106> of her wearing one, 
accessorised with a Barbie-like manicured hand.

It is reality TV stars such as Hagan, says Ktistaki, who influence her 
customers as well as the current cross-generationpreoccupation with mythical 
undersea creatures 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2016/aug/17/mermaiding-summer-2016s-fashion-inspiration>
. “The feedback we’re getting is that everyone loves mermaids,” she says. 
“Grandmothers, grandchildren … it’s a bit of a dream.”
