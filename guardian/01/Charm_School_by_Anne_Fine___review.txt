Bonny is not very happy when her mother sends her to Charm School 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/school> just because she needs to attend a 
one day class and Bonny is perhaps everything except from charming. Soon enough 
she is surrounded by bratty fashion-crazed girls who will not let anything 
stand in the way of their chance to receive the Glistering Tiara. It's Bonny's 
worst nightmare.

Charm School is a very good book which is hilarious and extremely well 
written. Those who enjoy humorous tales for all will thoroughly enjoy this work 
of art. Be prepared for a one way ticket to Charm School as multi-award winning 
authorAnne Fine <https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-fine> reveals the 
restâ€¦..
