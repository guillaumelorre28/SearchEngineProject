An indication of Bob Hoskins' humanity and confidence as a stage actor (Report 
<http://www.guprod.gnl/film/2014/apr/30/bob-hoskins-family-film-industry-tribute>
, 30 April) was shown during a performance of The Duchess of Malfi I saw at the 
Roundhouse in London. A woman in the audience had an epileptic seizure, and Bob 
Hoskins calmly suggested the action of play be stopped while she was given 
medical assistance. When she had been removed, he returned in character 
straight back to the action of the stage, which had reached a very violent 
point in the play, as if nothing had happened. What an actor he was and he will 
be sorely missed.

â€¢ RIP Bob Hoskins. Best remembered for the beautifully crafted BBC television 
seriesOn the Move <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Move_%28TV_series%29>, 
with Donald Gee, in the late 70s. Fifty 10-minute episodes that focused, 
sympathetically and with subtle humour, on coping with aspects of illiteracy.
