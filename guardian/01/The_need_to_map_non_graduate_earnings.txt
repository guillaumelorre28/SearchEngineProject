The Bank of England’s ongoing focus on graduates’ earnings is to be welcomed (
Growth in university education is affecting graduate earning power 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/12/growth-in-university-education-is-affecting-graduate-earning-power>
, 12 March). But might the bank not now broaden its focus to cover the earnings 
of non-graduates who instead go down the apprenticeship route? In 2014, on the 
back of my request, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) carried out some 
ad hoc work on this basis.

The ONS found that more than a quarter of university graduates earn lower 
wages than non-graduate employees who have completed an apprenticeship. They 
showed also that the lowest-earning 40% of graduates are more likely to work in 
part-time roles than non-graduates with an apprenticeship.

Such an analysis published on an annual basis would provide a much fuller 
understanding of younger people’s career prospects. It would also serve as a 
reminder to would-be students and their parents, in that any old degree is not 
necessarily the most preferable option for their career.
