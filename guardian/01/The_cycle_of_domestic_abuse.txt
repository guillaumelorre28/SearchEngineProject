Victoria Jiménez's fourth job was working for a woman in Guayaquil looking 
after her nine-month and two-year-old sons.

"This woman's partner was abusive. I would have to flee with her and the 
children to the coast for a month. Then we'd come back and the relationship 
would start up again," Jiménez explains. Jiménez spent seven years doing this 
until one day the relationship reached breaking point.

"One time my employer started cutting her legs. Her partner had started to 
shave her body 'to make her pure'. When he started to shave her 'down there' 
she just lost it. She said that if he was going to kill her she might as well 
kill herself. There was blood everywhere."

Jiménez left – and went to live with her mother. But after a year her former 
employer, who had just given birth to another child with a new partner, tracked 
her down. "She called and I went," says Jiménez.

"This time the new husband wasn't a psychopath but a sexual freak. He would 
stand in the living room in front of the television, which the children and I 
were trying to watch, and start masturbating. He raped another domestic worker 
in the household and sexually abused me too."

She wished she had had the strength to leave her abusive employer earlier: "I 
stayed because I felt like a mother to all of them but now I regret that 
decision," she says.
