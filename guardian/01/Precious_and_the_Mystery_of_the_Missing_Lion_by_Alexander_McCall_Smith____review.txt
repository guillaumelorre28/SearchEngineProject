This book is about a girl called Precious. One day her Aunt sent her a letter 
which asked her if she would like to come for a visit. Her Auntie lived in a 
Safari park. When Precious arrived they were making a film about a lion. The 
lion was a tame lion called Teddy.

Precious and her friend Khumo were asked to help. As they were so good the 
film director gave them a fat cake. Fat cakes are round they have lots of sugar 
and that is probably it! I would like a fat cake but it would probably make me 
hyper.

The next day Teddy goes missing they search all over the camp for him and have 
adventures trying to find him.

I like this book because although it is a fiction book it actually tells you 
facts too. Precious is a very smart girl because she's got a good memory and 
good thinking.
