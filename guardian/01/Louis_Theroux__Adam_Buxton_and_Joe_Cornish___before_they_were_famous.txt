One of the tall people in this video became a Bafta-winning documentary maker 
<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0857621/>. The second tall chap co-wrote Steven 
Spielberg's big-screen adaptation of TinTin 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz3j8gKRUTg>, as well as becoming a film 
director in his own right 
<http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a318916/joe-cornish-discusses-ant-man-tintin.html>
. He also teamed up with the shorter chap at the front – who does stand-up and 
has arather appealing website <http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/> – to present 
various TV shows and aSony award-winning radio show 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00876k2>. Except, back when this video was 
made in 1990, schoolmates Louis Theroux, Joe Cornish and Adam Buxton were 
messing around in south London dancing to Groove Is In The Heart 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taUqt_E0aOs&feature=share>. We've all done it, 
haven't we? The dancing around the living room bit. Not the award-winning stuff.
