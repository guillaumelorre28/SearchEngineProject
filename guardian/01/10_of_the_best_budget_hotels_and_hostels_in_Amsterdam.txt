Flying Pig Uptown Hostel

Situated just off Vondelpark and the museum district, the Flying Pig Uptown 
was freshly refurbished in 2010 and is a fine alternative to the Flying Pig 
Downtown, the owners' ever-hectic flagship hostel in the red light district. 
Uptown you get the party-centric atmosphere with the detoxing properties of the 
Vondelpark next door – you can even borrow inline skates to explore. The bar is 
always full; likewise the kitchen, where visitors bond over the stove. 
Unsurprisingly, this breeds an active space with guests coming and going at all 
hours. Be warned: the hostel is strict on its under-35s only policy, but if 
you're beyond that limit, you're unlikely to want to share a room with a horde 
of rowdy 18-year-olds.

Backstage Hotel
 Backstage Hotel 
You can guess that the Backstage's owners are big music lovers from the 
hotel's name alone, and the interior drives the theme home – guitars and 
memorabilia adorn the walls, and it's even sponsored by Jack Daniel's. Part of 
the concept comes from the location: minutes away from music venuesMelkweg 
<http://www.melkweg.nl/artikelpagina.jsp?infoid=35430&subinfoid=196213> and 
Paradiso <http://www.paradiso.nl/web/English-Agenda.htm>, the theatre district 
and a hearty selection of blues bars. The furniture is all inspired by flight 
cases, while light bulbs border mirrors to recreate that authentic dressing 
room vibe. There's even a four-person Guitar Hero room (yes, including the 
game) that's decked out in wall-to-wall original drawings by legendary 
Amsterdam tattooist Henk Schiffmacher.

Stayokay Hostel Amsterdam Vondelpark

Whether you've been to Amsterdam before or are heading for your first visit, 
chances are you'll find your way into favourite hippy hangout Vondelpark – be 
it for lounging, picnicking, drinking, cycling or skating. This quirky 
schoolhouse-turned-hostel is virtually inside the park, located along a 
parallel lane, with many of the rooms looking down on to the grass. As hostels 
go, it's modern and refined, with hordes of uniformed staff ready to look after 
the hundreds of guests it can accommodate. Despite the high numbers coming 
through, it's extremely clean, making it a viable option for more than just 
backpackers.

Between Art and Kitsch B&B
 Between Art and Kitsch B&B 
A cute alternative to the design and boutique hotels blossoming all over town, 
this quirky B&B in De Pijp, just a short walk from dozens of museums, is 
lovingly decorated by its owners. Its three rooms embrace a mishmash of styles 
– filled with antiques, curiosities and other seemingly random items picked up 
on travels, ranging from colonial cabinets and Arab rugs to neoclassical 
chandeliers. All rooms are equipped with en suite bathrooms, and there's a 
shared kitchen for all guests. As is so common in Amsterdam's budget range, 
however, you'll have to beware of the climb. It can feel like a stairway to 
hell to reach the third-floor rooms, especially when dragging your luggage.

Budget stays around Central Station are notoriously shoddy, but take a 
five-minute walk west and you'll find this honest little gem which is suitably 
chic and, well, basic. Situated on one of the quietest segments of the 
Herengracht, this canal house hotel has been renovated from a classic 
Mediterranean feel to the crispness of bright white walls and bedding with 
black trims and minimal furniture. Admittedly, there's an Ikea feel to the 
furnishings at times, but it's a solid, value-for-money option. And key details 
such as location, cleanliness, service and free internet terminals should make 
up for having a generic art print above your bed.

CitizenM
 CitizenM 
This new Dutch chain has been racking up praise, particularly since opening in 
Glasgow in 2010. It started in Amsterdam, first as an airport hotel at 
Schiphol, then in the south of the city. Although a boutique hotel at heart 
(the fancy Vitra furnishings are a giveaway), the quality service, luxury 
bedding and budget prices make this a haven for everyone from backpackers to 
business travellers. Every room is identical, with a wall-to-wall bed against 
the window, and futuristic glass toilet and shower off to the side. All tech 
features, including ambient coloured lighting, are controlled via the Philips 
MoodPad. Party people may feel out of sorts in this residential area, but the 
centre is only a short tram or train ride away.

CityCenter Bed and Breakfast
 CityCenter Bed and Breakfast 
Proving it's possible to find seclusion among the noise and action of the city 
centre, this delicate little B&B sits above a small side street between the 
rumbling trams on Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal and the bustle of the Nieuwendijk 
shopping street. As it's just five minutes from Central Station, you'll get a 
rare taste of central Amsterdam living with easy access to nearby attractions 
while avoiding the area's seedier hotels. The rooms have a clean, Swedish feel. 
The only minor downer is sharing the plush bathroom facilities with other 
guests, but given that there are only two rooms to rent, that isn't such a 
hardship. Besides, it's renowned for friendliness, comfort and cleanliness, and 
you'll feel waited on by owner Camillo.

Hans Brinker Budget Hotel
 Hans Brinker Budget Hotel 
This place is all about location and price: a quiet courtyard on the doorstep 
of nightlife-saturated Leidseplein. Brinker is as budget as budget gets, a fact 
famously exploited in the long-running marketing campaign which boasts that 
it's "a cheap, dirty, cold, poorly-lit youth hostel" with "rusty beds in 
awkwardly-shaped dormitories" and used paper flags stuck into dog excrement 
throughout the city exclaiming that more of the same could be found at the 
hostel's entrance. The sleeping quarters, with their closely arranged metal 
bunks and lockers, call to mind the set of Porridge, and the rooms are 
awkwardly shaped, but the place is surprisingly tidy. It's the perfect place 
for younger travellers who are likely to fall asleep in one of the surrounding 
bars anyway.

St Christopher's at the Winston 
 St Christopher’s at the Winston 
Like its adjoining pub and club, the Winston hotel/hostel is dripping with 
character. On the edge of the red light district, it's surrounded by S&M clubs, 
coffee shops, bars and restaurants. But Dam Square and more cultural outings 
are only a short walk away. The cheapest options are the hostel rooms, but 
don't expect much sleep there. Instead, splash out on a private room for a 
unique stay in Amsterdam as each room has been customised by local artists. 
From bold street art murals and drug-inspired scribbles to debauched red light 
vibes that will haunt you even after you close your eyes, you're unlikely to 
forget the experience.

Stayokay Hostel Amsterdam Zeeburg
 Stayokay Hostel 
This ultra-modern hostel opened in 2007 and offers spacious rooms (shared and 
private), attractive interior design that uses orange tones without the 
eye-watering issues of easyHotel, a large glistening dining area, and excellent 
toilets and showers. As in all Stayokay hostels, staff are well-trained 
professionals who look after the public spaces day and night. But where it 
differs from other hostel options is its location in the east of the city. Off 
the beaten tourist track, it gives a taste of the real multicultural city, for 
example at the nearby Dappermarkt. The building is shared withStudio K 
<http://www.studio-k.nu/page=site.calendar/lang=nl?start>, a 
bar/restaurant/cinema/club, and a bike rental shop, so you can cycle to the 
centre in only minutes.
