Badgers and hedgehogs have had a great time feasting on slugs, snails and 
earthworms during this sodden summer, while water voles were in their element 
in the water and with plenty of plants to feed on, but they remain an 
endangered species.

However, many other small mammals faced a tough time. Numerous creatures were 
flooded out of their nests, and people reported wood mice scampering into their 
homes to escape the deluges that swamped the mice nests in the ground.

The dormouse has also had a bad year. This delightful little creature gets its 
name from the Latin verb dormire, meaning to sleep, because it spends half the 
year curled up hibernating or in torpor – a temporary hibernation – hence the 
sleepy dormouse in Alice in Wonderland.

In fact, Surrey Wildlife Trust actually filmed a snoring dormouse recently 
during a survey, which can be seen at http://bit.ly/tSqFb0. But the survey also 
revealed an alarming absence of baby dormice, after months of bad weather.

The dormice came out of hibernation early in the unusually hot March, but then 
faced a cold, wet late spring with few flowers to feed on for pollen. They went 
back into hibernation, and stayed asleep in July, which is unheard of, when 
they should be breeding. The hope now is that the wild berries, nuts and fungi 
this autumn will give the adults a chance to fatten up ready for their return 
to hibernation in a month or two.
