Abi Morgan <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/abimorgan>, the award-winning 
film and TV writer, has said she plans to work only on projects that focus on 
women for the next few years, after her experiences on her latest movie,
Suffragette <https://www.theguardian.com/film/suffragette>.

Morgan, who wrote the screenplay for the film, starring Meryl Streep and Carey 
Mulligan, said the success she had achieved on projects includingThe Hour 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/scripts/the-hour-s1-ep1> and The Iron Lady 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyh6xrJsIkI> had given her the confidence to 
take more risks in the projects she pitched to producers and broadcasters.

Speaking on a panel

 at theBFI London Film Festival <http://www.bfi.org.uk/lff> on Friday, Morgan 
said that she had realised, “with the little bit of success and power I have, I 
could try to say, ‘For the next four or five years, I’m just writing films and 
TV that focus on women’ –and that is what I am going to do.”

 Watch the trailer for Suffragette. 
In addition to Suffragette, Morgan has written a new six-part detective drama, 
River 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/06/bbc-drama-river-abi-morgan-explore-mental-health-issues>
, which she has said will explore issues of mental health and will be screened 
on BBC1 from next week.

The Bafta- and Emmy-winning dramatist cautioned, however, that while she may 
be “big in the UK”, her influence in Hollywood is limited. “I can go to the BBC 
and say, ‘OK, my next drama is for women, and it is diverse women.’ I take that 
to America, however, and I have another set of conversations.”

To gasps from the audience, Morgan said she had been dropped as a screenwriter 
from a film project only two or three years ago “because I was told I didn’t 
know how to flirt with the director”.

“But one of the things I feel more and more is that I use each [project], and 
my experience onSuffragette <https://www.theguardian.com/film/suffragette> has 
been really, really healing, because I have reclaimed some power.”

 Watch the trailer for River, the BBC detective drama written by Abi Morgan. 
The film, which also had a female director and producers and a production crew 
that was almost all women, is the first ever mainstream film about the British 
campaign for equal votes a century ago.

Its premiere in London on Wednesday night was disrupted by a group of women 
protesting about domestic violence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/oct/07/feminist-protesters-suffragette-london-film-premiere-video>
, who lay down on the red carpet and shouted “dead women can’t vote”. Morganhas 
described their actions as “fantastic” 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/suffragette-writer-abi-morgan-praises-premiere-protesters-for-their-spirit-of-pankhurst-a3085461.html>
 and in “the spirit of Emmeline Pankhurst”, the leader of the suffragette 
movement.

Speaking to the BBC <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p034nz8v>, Streep, who 
plays Pankhurst in the movie, blamed “a conspiracy of silence” for the delay in 
bringing the suffragettes’ story to the big screen.

“For a long time it was difficult to convince the people in a position to make 
decisions – who were mostly male – that it was interesting to anyone. It wasn’t 
their fight.

“But, increasingly, we think now that women’s rights and issues are men’s 
issues, it belongs to all of us to right this imbalance in the world. Certain 
things have changed in our industry to allow them to understand that women will 
be interested in this film, and so will men.”
