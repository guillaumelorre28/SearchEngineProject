During the last 25 years, my constituency Labour party, Bury St Edmunds, sent 
a resolution to annual conference on more than one occasion, proposing the 
restriction of newspaper ownership by an individual or company, to one national 
daily, one Sunday and one local newspaper (Politicians gave Murdoch his power, 
now we must challenge it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/25/rupert-murdoch-powerful-politicians-british-media-owners>
, Tom Watson, 26 June). Those resolutions fell on stony ground. I wish Tom 
Watson better luck in his efforts to press for this vital change.

• This shows that David Cameron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> thought nothing about the 
criminal judicial process, but simply about his own survival. That he sought 
the legal opinion of attorney general Dominic Grieve shows the difficulty of 
mixing the crucial independence of the criminal law with politics.

• As a Tory voter and one-time canvasser I simply cannot support and vote for 
the Conservatives with David Cameron at the helm. His poor judgment, foresight, 
and lack of basic common sense in employingAndy Coulson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/andy-coulson> is a major embarrassment 
and a clear resignation issue. Cameron must bite the bullet here and go with 
honour, but go he must.

• I sense in the criticism of David Cameron (Eton) by the judge in the 
phone-hacking case (Uppingham) some settling of old ruling class scores. Could 
it be the 1973 cricket match when Eton beat Uppingham by 55 runs I wonder?
