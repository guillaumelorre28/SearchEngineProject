Hovering over a microphone and clutching their scripts, a group of students 
fills a radio booth at a school in the city of Santa Ana.

This is Promoting Child Rights in Disaster-Prone Areas a radio project set up 
by Plan International to encourage children and young people to get involved in 
disaster risk reduction. Young people of all ages broadcast a radio programme 
that includes news of local hazards, early warnings of potential disasters and 
shelter locations.

"When there was a disaster in 2006, I had to broadcast," says Sindy Palacios, 
19, who is one of the DJs. "I informed people that the school was a sheltered 
location, and I tried everything to get them here."

The radio programme was launched in 2005 and is listened to by about 200 
families in Cangrejera, La Libertad. Project co-ordinator Marvin Castillo, 33, 
says the broadcast is particularly effective as it provides children who do not 
always have the opportunity to go to school with a chance to learn about 
preparing for disaster.

According to the Unesco Institute for Statistics, in 2010 there were 38,366 
children in El Salvador who were not enrolled in primary or secondary education.

David Rodríguez, 22, a media technician, was sponsored by Plan International 
as a child and knows just how important the involvement of children and young 
people is.

"Not everybody understands the terms risk reduction or climate change," says 
Rodríguez. "Broadcasting the message from children and young adults' point of 
view makes it very innovative, and helps put the message out there in a 
different way."
