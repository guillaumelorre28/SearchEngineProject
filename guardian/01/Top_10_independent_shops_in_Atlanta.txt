Criminal Records

Nestled in the Little Five Points neighbourhood, Criminal Records is a 
favourite with locals. The staff are friendly and are big on new music –you can

store. With regular, free in-store performances, and weekly comics deliveries, 
Criminal Records is must for music lovers and comic nerds alike.

than retail price. Its weekly used-books event is a treat for locals, as well 
as its regular signing events with popular authors.

graphics abound, and antique pictures line the walls. There are wonderful 
collections of western, evening, disco and T-shirts, tracksuits and sweats. The 
bright-blue boot room has a wall-to-wall display of 400 pairs of vintage 
leather boots. And the staff are smart, young and helpful.
