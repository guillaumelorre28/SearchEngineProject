Win, Lose or Draw 
<https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/fiction/crime-mystery/Win-Lose-or-Draw-Peter-Corris-9781760294786>
 by Peter Corris (Allen & Unwin)


If crime novels are your summer reading matter of choice, Peter Corris has you 
covered. The Australian writer has been churning out his Cliff Hardy detective 
novels for years now – there are more than 40 of them – but with this book, 
he’s about to send Hardy into retirement.

Win, Lose or Draw is not just the final instalment in the series, but also 
Corris’ final novel – the author’s eyesight has been steadily deteriorating 
over the past few years, and writing has become impossible.

In it, we find Hardy grappling with a missing 14-year-old girl, her wealthy 
and highly regarded father, and a search that takes him all the way out into 
the islands of the South Pacific. And if you like this one, there’s plenty more 
where it came from.– SC

The Trapeze Act <https://www.textpublishing.com.au/books/the-trapeze-act> by 
Libby Angel (Text)

Better known as a poet, Libby Angel’s debut novel, The Trapeze Act, has been a 
long time in the making. Beginning as a PhD project 12 years ago, it was 
shortlisted for a South Australian unpublished manuscript award in 2006 and 
later won a prize supported by Penguin and the University of Melbourne. The 
final product, however, is delivered courtesy of Text.

The Trapeze Act is not a novel about being in the circus, but about what 
happensafter the circus. Loretta is the daughter of Leda, a former trapeze 
artist, and Gilbert, a barrister. Having two imposing personalities as parents 
affects Loretta and her brother, Kingston, very differently; the novel follows 
Loretta’s journey as she grapples with her parents’ past and their influence on 
her present.– SC

The Telomere Effect 
<https://www.hachette.com.au/elizabeth-blackburn/the-telomere-effect> by 
Elizabeth Blackburn and Elissa Epel (Orion Spring)

How can a 40-year-old look 60 while a 60-year-old looks 40? Can we influence 
the rate of our ageing, or is it all down to genes?

These are the driving questions behind The Telomere Effect, a science-based 
health book that places at its centre the telomere: the part of our chromosomes 
that determines how fast our cells age and die. By Dr Elizabeth Blackburn (a 
molecular biologist) and Dr Elissa Epel (a health psychologist), the book takes 
the matter of longevity and health right down to a cellular level, and 
investigates ways to alter a course previously thought to be unalterable.

They explain the science and suggest lifestyle changes to delay the inevitable 
– and while there is nothing really new here (eat healthily, sleep well, don’t 
stress, exercise) the explanations about how these things can affect cellular 
ageing are galvanising. As they write: you can’t successfully fight your enemy 
until you really understand it.– LC

Good Me, Bad Me <https://penguin.com.au/books/good-me-bad-me-9780718182939> by

This is one of those books that publishers peg as a bestseller from the

<http://www.thebookseller.com/news/flurry-six-figure-deals-get-lbf-bang> for 
Good Me, Bad Me off the back of a slush-pile submission, and the marketing hype 
is already in full swing, with words such as “explosive” and “controversial” 
beingsplashed <https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/289119/good-me-bad-me/> in 
all-caps across the listings.

We can neither confirm nor deny if these are accurate descriptors for Good Me, 
Bad Me, but we can tell you that it is one of a number of “toxic family 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/19/toxic-family-dynamics-summer-hottest-reads>
” thrillers that have come out recently. Good Me, Bad Me is written from the 
perspective of Annie (or is it Milly?), whose mother is a serial killer – and 
you probably already know whether or not you want to read it, right? If you’re 
still not sure,there’s an extract available

Override: My Quest to Go Beyond Brain Training and Take Control of My Mind 
<https://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/books/override> by Caroline 
Williams (Scribe)

In neuroplasticity studies over the last decade, we have explored ways in 
which the brain can change itself through the prism of an injured brain. Of 
course it makes sense to repair a damaged brain using the principles of 
plasticity, but why would you want to change a perfectly healthy one?

This is the first question science writer Caroline Williams comes up against 
when she decides to apply the latest neuroscience to herself. She sets out to 
see if she can change some parts of her thinking processes that have, in a way, 
made her who she is – her attention span, her worrying, her creativity, her 
sense of direction, her time perception and her number sense. She submits to 
testing and brain training, surveys the vast landscape of research and makes 
practical suggestions for taking control of your own mind.– LC

Flint is not the first to have found inspiration for fiction in the grim 
story, but theGuardian reviewer Maggie Orford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/27/little-deaths-emma-flint-review> 
argues that it’s a “strong and confident” contribution to the new domestic noir 
trend. She writes: “Flint pulls the reader into the finely observed 
working-class Queens neighbourhood, where the heat shimmers on the crowded 
apartment buildings and the social surveillance of women is palpable. This is a 
place where everybody knows everybody else’s business and judgment is quick and 
brutal.”– SC

Roxane Gay is most well-known for her bestselling essay collection Bad 
Feminist, her opinion columns in the New York Times and for her writing and 
editing at the Rumpus. But those expecting to read the next Bad Feminist should 
be warned: Difficult Women is comprised not of essays, but short stories. That 
said, the subject matter is not far removed from the politics of Gay’s 
nonfiction.

Writing for the Observer, the reviewer Claire Kohda Hazelton says

 Gay’s stories are “phenomenally powerful and beautifully written,

whatever their situation, they have agency, resilience and identities away from 
stereotypes created and reinforced by men.”– SC

 – have all been in dialogue with his birth country and the geopolitics of the 
region in some way.

The Golden Legend goes back to Pakistan itself: Nargis’ husband is shot to 
death during the opening of a new library that they, both architects, have 
designed. Nargis and her surrogate daughter, Helen, a Christian, are both in 
danger.

Lara Feigel writes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/28/the-golden-legend-nadeem-aslam-review-pakistan>
 for the Guardian: “The country [Aslam] depicts is one bent on completing what 
the west has begun with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, by revealing quite 
how dark and unsafe the world can be. This is a landscape of irrational 
sectarian violence, rivalry and cruelty …

“[But] there’s a collective spirit that makes its way across the country, 
enabling a communality of the good or the sane. It’s this that makes reading 
this exquisite, painful book not merely bearable but exhilarating, as it 
counters the despair with hope.”– SC

The author of the Booker prize-winning novel G and the seminal essay Ways of 
Seeing was known for whatMichael McNay called 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-obituary> his 
“characteristic tone of sweet reasonableness”.Sally Potter argued 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/05/john-berger-at-90-ways-of-seeing-sally-potter>
 his expression was “pithy, plain language, bold – and, above all, the ideas 
themselves that he shaped with such clarity, had the startling effect of 
feeling both brand new and yet obvious, creating a feeling of recognition.”

Landscapes is a collection of essays on art history – on its UK release in 
October,Kate Kalloway called it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/30/john-berger-at-90-interview-storyteller>
 “a fascinating series of encounters with the thinkers who have mattered to 
Berger, from Brecht and Walter Benjamin to Rosa Luxemburg”.– SC
