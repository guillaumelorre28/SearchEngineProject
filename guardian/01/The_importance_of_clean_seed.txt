Converting to clean potato seed could revive Kenya's farming industry, claims 
one commercial farmer.

Charlie Dyer, senior manager of Kisima Farm, a 100,000 acre farm in Timau, 
believes clean seed can solve many of the problems smallholder farmers are 
experiencing. "Kisima seed is providing about 75% of the certified potato seed 
that's available to this country. That is only 7% of the seed that is required 
in this country. With a yield of somewhere between five and seven tonnes a 
hectare, with clean seed the farmer can expect his yield to go up to 20-30 
tonnes a hectare. So it's a very dramatic increase," Dyer says.

Clean seed is certified disease-free, and so removes much of the risk from 
using seeds from crops with a history of disease.

Despite the obvious benefits of converting to clean seed, it has still not 
become common practice. This is largely due to lack of availability to 
smallholder farmers who do not have the means of having it imported into the 
country.

Kisima Farm is attempting to make certified potato seed more accessible by 
providing 30,000 Kenyan farmers with Kisima seed, which will give them "an 
additional combined income of $6m".

Dyer, who also runs other ventures such as building schools and a local 
hospital, still has concerns about the future of Kenya if its farmers are not 
given adequate support. "We're in deep trouble because if we can't feed 
ourselves, all [the government's] grand plans of cyber cities and 2030 goals 
will mean nothing because everyone will beÂ hungry."
