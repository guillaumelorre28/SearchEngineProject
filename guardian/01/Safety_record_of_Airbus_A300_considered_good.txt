 The Airbus A300 is widely regarded as a reliable aircraft with a good safety 
record, and has had only eight officially published fatal incidents in 24 years.
At least three were due to terrorist activity, the most famous of which was at 
Entebbe in Uganda in 1976 when seven passengers were killed during a commando 
raid by Israeli armed forces to free hostages.

An Air France plane was hijacked at Algiers airport in 1994. Seven people were 
killed when the plane was stormed.

In an incident in 1988 an A300, owned by Iran Air, was shot down by the 
American navy with surface-to-air missiles, killing 290 people. The US was 
trying to protect other US ships in the area during hostilities.

The most serious accident involving human error took place seven years ago 
when a China Airlines plane crashed in Japan with the loss of 264 lives.

The aircraft stalled, hit the runway tail first and then burst into flames. 
The crew could have saved the plane - even in the final seconds - had they 
reverted to basic flying procedures and switched off the auto-pilot.

The American Airlines plane in yesterday's incident was one of three types in 
the A300 series. The company has 35 of them, all assembled in Toulouse. Their 
wings are manufactured in Broughton, near Chester.

Some 255 A300s are in service, with a typical seating capacity of around 266 
passengers.
