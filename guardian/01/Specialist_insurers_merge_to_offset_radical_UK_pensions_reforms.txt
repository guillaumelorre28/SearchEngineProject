Two specialist insurers caught up in George Osborne’s shake-up of the annuity 
market in last year’s budget have announced a merger plan to create a £1.6bn 
group.

Just Retirement and Partnership Assurance, both involved in the annuities 
market, lost half their market capitalisation last year when the chancellor 
changed the rules to giveretirees greater flexibility over pensions.

 The new rules, which came into force in the spring, give people more autonomy 
over their retirement savings.

Steve Groves, chief executive of Partnership, is leaving as part of the deal 
because the top job is going to Just Retirement’s Rodney Cook. Just Retirement 
shareholders will own 60% of the combined company. Groves is expected to sell 
his £20m-plus shareholding.

The deal was brokered by the groups’ private equity backers, Permira and 
Cinven. Both backers have had a disappointing experience since floating the 
groups in the IPO boom of 2013. Partnership, for example, issued new shares at 
385p. On Tuesday, they jumped 8% to168p. Shares in Just Retirement rose 1.6% to 
202p.

The insurers, which were presenting to analysts at Deutsche on Tuesday, say 
they will raise £150m from the issue of new shares, to give the combined 
company a market capitalisation of £1.6bn. Advisers say there are savings of 
about £40m from duplication. The private equity shareholders are tied in for 90 
days.
