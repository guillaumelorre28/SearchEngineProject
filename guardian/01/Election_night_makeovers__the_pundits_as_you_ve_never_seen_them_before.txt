If live broadcasting is your thing, as it is for this lot, then “election 
night is as exciting as it gets,” saysSky News politics veteran Adam Boulton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/adam-boulton>. “You’re in the chair from 9pm 
for perhaps 11 hours, and for much of it you genuinely don’t know what’s going 
to happen. At 9 o’clock, you know nothing. At 10 o’clock, bang, it’s the exit 
polls, and this time there will be Scottish exit polls to look at again, then 
you’ve got the slow bit up until 1am, then it starts to happen and you’re 
trying to figure out if the first results compute against the exit poll.”

And then, in the bleary dawn, the full human drama unfolds, as key seats are 
won and lost, and the nation watches politicians experience the best and worst 
moments of their careers, live on television. There is, they all agree, nothing 
like it.

What’s more, what makes an election “majestic”, the Today programme’s Justin 
Webb 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/nov/08/justin-webb-today-programme-radio-4>
 tells me, “is this sense of a political process, which is only ever one remove 
from a bare-knuckle fight. The handover of real power is a raw moment. When you 
see it done without a fight, with passion but with grace, there’s something 
glorious about that.”

The broadcasters we have gathered for Weekend’s shoot – Boulton, Webb, Jon Snow
 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/jon-snow>, Faisal Islam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/faisalislam> (Boulton’s Sky News colleague 
and, at 37, the youngest political editor on TV),Krishnan Guru-Murthy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/krishnan-guru-murthy> of Channel 4 and the 
retired-from-election-duty but iconicPeter Snow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/peter-snow> – are players in this moment of 
real-time national drama. As the bearers of good or bad news, depending on your 
point of view, they have a relationship with us, the viewers. They have a 
relationship with Westminster, too, of course; and not always a smooth one.Jon 
Snow has been accused of leftwing bias by Tory MP Philip Davies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/22/tory-mp-jon-snow-lefty-philip-davies-channel-4-krishnan-guru-murthy>
; Boulton hadan on-screen finger-jabbing spat with Alastair Campbell soon after 
the 2010 election 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/may/10/adam-boulton-alastair-campbell>
. For the record, all were a delight in person, and remarkably gracious about 
being asked to wear some pretty gaudy sportswear. (“Edgy athleisure” was the 
brief. “No suits.”) And Boulton, far from picking any fights, made me a cup of 
tea.

Such sartorial open-mindedness is impressive when they have a ringside seat on 
a world in which a good haircut or perfectly rolled shirt sleeve can deliver a 
knockout punch. For instance, whether voters can “see”Ed Miliband 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband> as PM is a long-running 
issue. “It’s one of the first things people bring up about him,” Guru-Murthy 
says, “and the Conservatives are playing image strongly in this campaign. Their 
attack is, ‘Look at Ed.’ In brackets, ‘What a plonker.’ Look at our suave, 
cool, well-educated man, who can string a sentence and eat a sandwich. Labour 
are playing image the other way: look at him, he’s posh, he’s out of touch.”

Islam, previously Channel 4’s economics editor, remembers, “when the economy 
was flat, you could not getGeorge Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> and Danny Alexander 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/danny-alexander> out of hard hats and 
hi-vis. This while they were halving investment in infrastructure. They knew 
the pictures would distract from that.”

Calibrations of image are endlessly tinkered with: Cameron, Boulton notes, 
looks “less City slicker, more retired solicitor going to the bank”, now he is 
chasing the pensioner vote. Politicians “want to be cultural icons, as well as 
decision-makers”, Islam says. “So the ultimate win in media terms is a nice, 
fluffy, mid-market tabloid analysis.” There is a degree of eye-rolling about 
in-kitchen photo ops, but Webb points out “politics is a branch of human 
behaviour. We know governing is pretty difficult, and we know politicians may 
not do the things they promised, not necessarily because they are liars, but 
because circumstances send them off course. So you instinctively choose someone 
not just because of their policies, but because you think they’d veer off 
course in a direction you would find acceptable. I don’t think people voted for
Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> because of Obamacare 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/16/obamacare-health-insurance-affordable-care-act>
. They voted for him for what felt like more deep-seated reasons.”

The “great intangible of politics”, Boulton says, “is authenticity. Boris 
Johnson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> has his Just William 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/22/just-william-richmal-crompton>
 look, and the message is he’s his own man, he doesn’t care too much about 
those kind of things.Nigel Farage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage>, in his corn-coloured 
trousers and velvet-collared coat, is semaphoring a message to small-c 
conservatives that he’s just like them. What people like about Farage is that 
they see him – rightly or wrongly – as being authentic.”

Tony Blair <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair>’s “crisp, white 
shirts and rolled-up sleeves gave him an air ofJFK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-f-kennedy> and RFK 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-kennedy>, and made people believe 
he would change things”, Boulton says. But after two slick-looking prime 
ministers (Blair and Cameron), “it could be that the anti-politics mood means 
even if people know who looks most like a prime minister, they might vote for 
someone else”, Islam notes. “Authenticity has become more valuable than polish. 
But who knows? Perhaps Boris sits at home polishing hisAlexander McQueen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexander-mcqueen> loafers, while 
cultivating scruffy bonhomie in public.”

The Conservatives are playing image strongly this time. Their attack is, ‘Look 
at Ed.’ In brackets, ‘What a plonker'

The only pundit who says he has “no feeling about what politicians wear” is 
Peter Snow <https://www.theguardian.com/media/peter-snow>. Instead he “needs to 
see an honest face”. Which, perhaps, is still judging a book by its cover, but 
giving the same process a more solid, old-fashioned name.

They are all full of energy – a requirement for all-nighters – and enthusiasm. 
Peter Snow, who arrives in a moss-green cashmere half-zip sweater from John 
Lewis, is inspiringly positive about being photographed in a different look – 
“Makeup! Why not? Great stuff. Terrific!” – and after he has had his photo 
taken happily settles down for a slice of pizza and a gossip (the BBC,the 
Guardian editorship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/22/katharine-viner-new-editor-guardian>
). “Oh, yes, I like a bit of product. You go for it, darling,” his cousin Jon 
tells the makeup artist later, as he settles into the chair. Islam wants to 
know what colour his sweatshirt is. Raspberry, I suggest, and he bursts out 
laughing.

They talk about elections the way football fans talk about Cup finals. They 
can reel off dates and statistics until the cows come home. (Boulton: “The most 
exciting are the transitional elections, 97, 2010. I go back to 83, and 83, 87, 
2001, 2005, those were quite dull as campaigns, because there was a general 
expectation of who was going to win. This election is closest to 1992 – it has 
some of that nastiness about it.”) The 1997 election is seared on to everyone’s 
memory. Guru-Murthy, who was reporting for the BBC at the time, “had a great 
job that night, going to all the parties. There was this tangible sense of 
excitement and expectation of change.”

The swingometer is the most iconic of a gallery of visuals that television has 
used to try to turn election number-crunching into theatre. At Sky News, 
Boulton recalls, “They made us sit around a giant question mark one year.” 
Colour is key in telling the story, although this election’s fragmented picture 
complicates matters. (Apparently, the Lib Dems have moved away from yellow and 
back towards orange, to differentiate themselves from the SNP.) The 
broadcasters will all wear suits and ties on the night; one fairly safe bet is 
that Jon Snow’s will be the most exuberant. (“I am a tie and socks fetishist. 
The tie will depict my mood for the day. Which is always exuberant.”)

His enthusiasm aside, most talk about onscreen clothes in terms of avoiding 
disaster rather than courting triumph. Islam, who arrives at our shoot in a 
very nice Ralph Lauren suit, once did a piece to camera at Channel 4 wearing a 
hoodie, “which I thought you couldn’t see, but you could – the hood kept 
sticking up. And that was the only thing anyone noticed. Nobody heard what I 
said.” At Sky News, he has to be “groomed to a standard I previously associated 
with weddings”.

Boulton wears formal shirts from Turnbull & Asser 
<http://www.turnbullandasser.co.uk/> with the buttons concealed (looks neater 
should your tie move) and long socks (no risk of bare flesh if a trouser leg 
rises up).Gresham Blake <http://www.greshamblake.com/> suits and ties are 
popular. Boulton has an arrow-design, multicoloured Gresham Blake tie he might 
wear on election night: “You can’t wear a single colour or someone will accuse 
you of bias.” Jon Snow loves upscale Italian brandFratelli Rossetti 
<http://www.fratellirossetti.com/>’s smart shoes in subtle colours: “I find you 
get a lot of comments on a beautiful shoe.” I glance down at his feet and he 
exclaims, “Not those – these are my cycling shoes!” Even on the radio, Webb 
says, “we dress reasonably smartly. Not formal, but generally cords or chinos, 
and a shirt. The editor is a natty dresser, I notice, often besuited. I think 
he has power lunches. If I’m working on a Saturday, it’s different. I can wear 
jeans and a jumper then, because guests’ expectations are different.”

Neither Boulton nor Islam intends to vote on 7 May – they feel making a 
personal judgment would cloud their impartiality.Jon Snow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/jon-snow> will vote “early, like I always 
do. But for the first time ever at this stage in the election [late March], I 
don’t know whom I’ll vote for.” Guru-Murthy will vote early, Webb as soon as 
Today finishes. Peter Snow is looking forward to “a stroll across the common, 
with my wife” to the polling booth.

Then the excitement starts. “If it’s a question of who has the most seats in a 
hung parliament, then, my goodness, every seat will count!” Snow exclaims. “The 
second day will be extremely exciting. A late count somewhere in the Western 
Isles could change everything.” He polishes off his pizza. “Terrific stuff!”

Most memorable political gaffe? 
Theirs or mine? The Prescott punch

Worst on-air moment? 
Losing my temper with Alastair Campbell 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkHwU4DRA8> in the aftermath of the 2010 
election: he argued it was not in the national interest for Gordon Brown to 
resign immediately. But I was right and most of the public agreed with me. They 
usually ask why I didn’t punch him.

Election night survival kit? 
Adrenaline and a strong bladder.

Most stylish politician ever? 
JFK <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-f-kennedy>. Margaret Thatcher 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher> found her own unique 
style.

Suit or tracksuit? 
Suit. Giorgio Armani or Chris Kent.

Biggest fashion faux pas? 
Brown suit. But that was at another TV channel, and both are dead.

How do you unwind after election night?

 ‘Worst on-air moment? Failing to speak for about 12 seconds in my first ever 
live report.’ 
Favourite election year? 
2015: extraordinary tale of a changing UK with plots and subplots aplenty, and 
genuine contest.

Favourite marginal seat? 
Manchester Withington. My “home” seat, which has swung between all the main 
parties in my lifetime. I don’t live there now, but it’s close to my heart.

Most memorable political gaffe? 
Gordon Brown’s slip of the tongue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/06/gordon-brown-save-world-uk>
 in parliament: “We have saved the world.” There was the kernel of something 
legitimate in what he was trying to say, but it came out wrong.

Worst on-air moment? 
Failing to speak for about 12 seconds in my first ever live report. It was so 
bad, it looked like a technical fault.

Election night survival kit? 
Spare shirt, toothbrush, mobile battery charger.

Most stylish politician ever? 
Gandhi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/mahatma-gandhi>. Through the clothes 
he wore, he conveyed a transformative message to the world, and changed history.

Suit or tracksuit? 
Tracksuit.

Biggest fashion faux pas? 
The hi-vis jackets and safety helmets you almost always have to wear when the 
chancellor wants to do an interview. The goggles are a step too far.

How do you unwind after election night? 
The results will be just the start of a gruelling few weeks. But at some point 
I’ll get to hang out with my daughter, who’s learning to speak.

staple of being northern.

 ‘Most stylish politician ever? Sadly, the days of dandy MPs such as Jeremy 
Thorpe have gone.’ 
Favourite election year? 
97: I was a roving reporter for the BBC, going to election night parties. 
Jeffrey Archer let us into his flat in time to see Tory grandees leaving, 
ashen-faced. At the Comedy Store I saw Michael Portillo lose his seat.

Favourite marginal seat? 
The three-way marginals, like Great Grimsby 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/06/grimsby-glory-days-election>
, where Labour’sAustin Mitchell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/austinmitchell> could lose to Tory or Ukip.

Most memorable political gaffe? 
It’s hard to beat Gordon Brown’s open mic moment about the “bigoted woman” – 
and thehead in the hands when it was played back to him 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3F_ly9xSqQ>.

Worst on air-moment? 
I forgot what I was about to say mid-question while interviewing David Davis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis>. It’s one of those moments 
almost everyone has in conversation, but you never see on TV. I decided just to 
admit I had forgotten. He was very gracious and babbled away while I remembered.

Election night survival kit? 
I don’t work on election night itself, so comfy sofa, bottle of wine, cake and 
bed at a reasonable time, so I can do the news on Friday, when the coalition 
horse-trading begins.

Most stylish politician ever? 
Sadly, the days of outrageous dandy MPs such as the disgraced former Liberal 
leaderJeremy Thorpe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/04/jeremy-thorpe> have gone.

Suit or tracksuit? 
A good suit is better than a tracksuit at hiding how much time I haven’t spent 
in the gym.

Biggest fashion faux pas? 
I had an Ozwald Boateng <https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/ozwald-boateng> 
suit in brown with orange stitching. The then Channel 4 news deputy editor, 
Peter Barron, told me I looked like a pimp.

How do you unwind after election night? 
I don’t. It’s about hitting the ground running afterwards.

House Of Cards <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/house-of-cards> or 
The West Wing <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-west-wing>? 
I’m a sucker for the pace and idealism of The West Wing. Everyone in House Of 
Cards is so vile.

Anchorman <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/101940/anchorman> or Network 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/>? 
Anchorman, obviously. Though I’m probably getting more like Network’s crazed 
Howard Beale by the day.

Bacon sandwich or pasty? 
Bacon sandwich – much easier to eat.

 ‘How do I unwind after election night? Sleeeeep!’ 
Favourite election year? 
79: I was leaving school and it felt suitably epoch-making.

Favourite marginal seat? 
Bath is the city I grew up in. It became a Liberal Democrat seat (don’t ask 
Chris Patten <https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chrispatten> about this), but 
this year, with the Lib Dem MP retiring, it’s genuinely up for grabs between 
the Lib Dems and the Conservatives.

Most memorable political gaffe? 
My favourite is Edmund Muskie crying in the snow in New Hampshire in 1972 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiLL8ZAXGys>, after his wife was attacked in 
the press. He said it was snow melting on his face, but no one believed him, 
and his run for the Democratic presidential candidacy was finished. It’s such a 
period piece of foolishness: him for losing the plot, and America for being 
more worried about a man crying than his wife being traduced.

Worst on-air moment? 
Asking, in a stressful moment on TV, whether David Blunkett 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidblunkett> could “see and hear” me. 
He grinned. I also introduced a piece on breakfast TV, where the stage 
instructions appeared by mistake on screen, including “councillor Joe Bloggs, 
far right”.

Election night survival kit? 
A producer.

Most stylish politician ever? 
Barack Obama <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama>.

Suit or tracksuit? 
Suit.

Biggest fashion faux pas? 
I think I once had a green suit.

How do you unwind after election night? 
Sleeeep.
