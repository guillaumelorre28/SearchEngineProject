Richard Desmond’s decision to slash the cover price of the Star titles has 
paid off, with both papers recording significant gains in circulation in 
October.

The Daily Star added almost 30,000 copies a day to increase its circulation by 
more than 7%, while theDaily Star Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/daily-star-sunday> sold an extra 20,000 
copies to register an increase of more than 8%, according to the ABC figures 
for October published on Friday.

Express Newspapers <https://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers> cut the cost 
of the weekday Daily Star from 40p to 20p, the Saturday edition from 60p to 30p 
and the Sunday edition from £1 to 50p.

Tabloid rivals the Mirror and the Sun decided not to follow Desmond into a 
price war, but the Mirror appears to have borne the brunt, losing 14,000 copies 
while the Sun managed to increase circulation slightly by 0.29%.

Outside the tabloids, the Times and the Financial TImes saw small circulation 
increases during the month, while the Express, Telegraph, Mail and the 
Independent and i all saw small falls, with the Guardian essentially flat with 
a 0.01% decline in sales.

Despite the relative stability of month-on-month figures, the broader picture 
remains bleak, with every title except the Times recording a year-on-year fall 
and the weekday market as a whole down 6.6% compared with October last year and 
the Sunday market down 8.12%.
