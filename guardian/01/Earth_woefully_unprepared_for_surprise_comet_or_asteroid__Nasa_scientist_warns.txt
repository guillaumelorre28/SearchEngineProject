Humans are woefully unprepared for a surprise asteroid or comet, a Nasa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa> scientist warned on Monday, at a 
presentation with nuclear scientists into how humans might deflect cosmic 
dangers hurtling toward Earth.

“The biggest problem, basically, is there’s not a hell of a lot we can do 
about it at the moment,” said Dr Joseph Nuth, a researcher with Nasa’s Goddard
Space <https://www.theguardian.com/science/space> Flight Center.

Speaking at the annual meeting of American Geophysical Union, Nuth noted that 
large and potentially dangerous asteroids and comets are extremely rare, 
compared to the small objects that occasionally explode in Earth’s sky or 
strike its surface. “But on the other hand they are the extinction-level 
events, things like dinosaur killers, they’re 50 to 60 million years apart, 
essentially. You could say, of course, we’re due, but it’s a random course at 
that point.”

Comets <https://www.theguardian.com/science/comets> follow distant paths from 
Earth but sometimes get knocked into the neighborhood. Nuth said that the Earth 
had “a close encounter” in 1996, when an aberrant comet flew into Jupiter, and 
then again in 2014, when a comet passed “within cosmic spitting distance of 
Mars”. That second comet was only discovered 22 months before its brush with a 
planet: not nearly enough time to launch a deflection mission, had it been on a 
course for Earth.

“If you look at the schedule for high-reliability spacecraft and launching 
them, it takes five years to launch a spacecraft. We had 22 months of total 
warning.”


Nasa recently established a planetary defense office, and Nuth has recommended 
that the agency build an interceptor rocket to keep in storage, with periodic 
testing, alongside an observer spacecraft. Nuth said that Nasa could cut that 
five-year schedule in half, but that even reducing that schedule by a quarter 
would be “basically a hail-mary pass”.

A rocket in storage and ready to launch within a year, however, “could 
mitigate the possibility of a sneaky asteroid coming in from a place that’s 
hard to observe, like from the sun”, he said.

Nuth stressed that he and his co-authors do not speak for Nasa administrators, 
and that the mission would require a request to Congress and their approval.

Nasa has discovered an estimated 90% or more of near-Earth objects larger than 
a kilometer, the size that could cause devastation on Earth. Smaller objects 
are still extremely dangerous, though, and Nasa has found 874 1km-wide 
asteroids among 1,748 “potentially hazardous asteroids 
<http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/groups.html>”. Asteroids are darker and rockier 
than icy comets, and many fly within a band that stretches between Jupiter and 
Mars.

Dr Cathy Plesko, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, said there 
were two ways humans might deflect an asteroid: a nuclear warhead or a “kinetic 
impactor, which is basically a giant cannonball”.

“Cannonball technology is actually very good technology, intercepting an 
object at high speed actually ends up being more effective than high 
explosives”.

The calculations of a cannonball deflector would take far longer to refine, 
however, than the last-resort pyrotechnics of a nuclear bomb. To “blow it to 
smithereens”, Plesko said, would have dangerous side-effects, including 
shrapnel from the blast.

“We are very carefully doing our homework before finals week,” Plesko said. 
“We don’t want to be doing our calculations before something is coming. We need 
to have this work done.”

Part of the scientists’ concern is a lack of knowledge. “We don’t have a lot 
of data about what the insides of asteroids or comets look like,” she said, 
“but based on what we know about physics and rock and ice we can guess.”

Galen Gisler, another Los Alamos scientist, said an asteroid or comet that 
escaped a deflection attempt would likely strike the ocean. But he said that 
while an asteroid smaller than 500ft in diameter would cause a spectacular 
splash, casting water thousands of feet into the sky, it would probably not 
cause a tsunami.

But a rock that explodes near a populated shoreline, above the water or when 
it crashes into it, would still be “highly dangerous”, Gisler said, citing the 
damage caused by a 60ft-wide, 7,000-ton meteoroid thattore apart over the city 
of Chelyabinsk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/06/chelyabinsk-meteor-russia>, 
Russia, in 2013. Casting a blinding fireball across the sky, the meteoroid 
shattered windows for miles, injured more than 1,000 people across 55 miles of 
the rock’s path.

For over a decade, Nasa and the National Nuclear Security Administration have 
worked <https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/mar/HQ_04096_Energy_Partners.html>
together 
<http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150803-space-nasa-asteroids-comets-nuclear-weapons-defense/>
 on studying asteroids. In October, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and 
Nasa performed asimulation exercise 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/science/nasa-and-fema-rehearse-for-the-unthinkable-an-asteroid-strike-on-los-angeles.html>
 of what might happen if a huge asteroid hit near Los Angeles. If a 330-foot 
asteroid hit southern California, they estimated, the explosion would level 
cities and kill tens of thousands.


In 1908, a massive fireball <http://

, believed to be 50-100m wide, flattened hundreds of square miles of forest in 
Siberia, near the Podkamennaya Tunguska river. Windows were blown out more than 
30 miles away, and witnessesreported

 burns on their skin and finding the charred remains of a herd of reindeer. 
Scientists calculate that the Tunguska event, as it’s called, was an explosion

stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
