This easy treat can be endlessly enhanced by varying the ingredients you use. 
Try it with thyme- or lavender-scented honey, a thick Greek yoghurt, or adjust 
the fruit according to the season – peaches, strawberries, plums, apricots or 
greengages all work well.

Serves 4

300ml low-fat yoghurt
4 nectarines
50g almonds
A knob of butter
2 tbsp acacia honey
1 vanilla pod

1. Put the almonds in a frying pan with a knob of butter and lightly toast for 
around 5 minutes. Leave to cool for another few minutes, then slice them finely.

2. While the nuts are cooling, split the vanilla pod and scrape out the seeds.

3. Mix the honey, vanilla seeds and yoghurt together in a bowl.

4. Prepare the nectarines by removing the stones and slicing them finely.

5. Serve the yoghurt in bowls with the nectarines perched on top and almonds 
scattered all over.
