The winner

Late September, rarely a robust time for UK cinemagoing, continues the 
seasonally becalmed pattern. Overall, the 27-29 September session represented 
the third worst weekend for box office in the past year. Given that the 
previous frame delivered the second worst, it's clear just how sluggish the 
market is right now.

The only film delivering a weekend gross in excess of £1m was Prisoners 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156195/prisoners>, starring Hugh 
Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Aside from the previous weekend, whenRush 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156181/rush> held on to the top spot 
with £1.34m, Prisoners' £1.37m tally is the lowest for a No 1 film sinceDredd 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149147/dredd> landed at the chart 
summit in September 2012.

It's the third leading role for Jackman so far this year, and his third chart 
topper, followingLes Misérables <http:> (debut of £8.13m) and The Wolverine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156133/wolverine> (£4.69m, including 
£939,000 in previews). Gyllenhaal was last seen inEnd of Watch 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148734/end-of-watch>, which kicked off 
with £619,000 last November.

The personal best

Plenty of smiles on faces at Warner Bros's London HQ this week, as the company 
reports thatBlue Jasmine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155586/blue-jasmine> is Woody Allen's 
biggest ever opener in the UK. With £793,000 from the Friday-Sunday period, and 
£834,000 including previews, this compares with previous bestMatch Point 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/110136/match.point>'s £752,000 debut. 
Other notable strong starts for Woody pictures includeMidnight in Paris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141834/midnight-in-paris> (£496,000) and
Vicky Cristina Barcelona 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126605/vicky.cristina.barcelona>, 
(£244,000) although the latter was launched on a small platform then expanded 
in its second weekend, when it grossed £577,000. Allen's biggest UK cumulative 
total to date is Midnight in Paris's £2.79m, so Warners will be hoping to push 
Blue Jasmine past that tally.

The director's last film, To Rome with Love 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149157/to-rome-with-love>, kicked off 
in the UK with £141,000 from 107 screens. Midnight in Paris was launched in 153 
venues, and Vicky Cristina Barcelona achieved 175 locations at its widest 
point. Blue Jasmine was rolled out at the weekend into 188 cinemas, achieving a 
sturdy average of £4,435.

The flops

Ltd/Allstar 
To nobody's real surprise, quirky US comedy Girl Most Likely 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156188/girl-most-likely> landed with a 
thump outside the top 10, with a poor £91,000 from 176 cinemas, and a £516 
average. Despite appealing lead actor Kristen Wiig, and an ensemble including 
Annette Bening, Matt Dillon and Glee's Darren Criss, the film never looked a 
likely winner. But the result is a spectacular triumph when compared to that of
Austenland <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156702/austenland>, which 
arrived with a dismal £12,400 from 94 venues, delivering a £135 average. The 
cast includes Keri Russell and Jennifer Coolidge.

In this context, the box office for glossy gambling thriller Runner Runner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156190/runner-runner>, starring Justin 
Timberlake and Ben Affleck, qualifies as merely lacklustre: £765,000 from 433 
cinemas.

September champ

Among September releases, Ron Howard's motor racing drama Rush crosses the 
finish line in first place with £6.54m, ahead of Richard Curtis'sAbout Time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155249/about-time> (£6.26m) and 
Insidious 2 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156179/insidious-2> 
(£6.02m). Rush debuted mid-September in second place, behind Insidious 2 
(£2.10m v £2.88m), rising to the chart summit a week later, and then slipping 
back a notch in its third week of play. Declines in box office are a relatively 
modest 36% and 26%. As for About Time, that's just ahead of the cumulative 
total of Curtis's previous feature,The Boat That Rocked 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/128972/boat-that-rocked>, and with a 
bit more life in it still.

The local hit

Arriving in the rest of the UK this Friday, Filth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154492/filth> has already landed in 
Scottish cinemas, where the weekend saw the Irvine Welsh adaptation achieve a 
nifty £248,000 from 38 cinemas, delivering a strong site average of £6,523. 
That's a massive improvement on the result of the last film adapted from a book 
by the Scottish author: Irvine Welsh's Ecstasy debuted in April 2012, with 
£26,500 from 56 venues. Distributor Lionsgate will be hoping for further cheer 
south of the border this weekend, but in Scotland it faces a particular 
challenge from Proclaimers musicalSunshine on Leith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/12/sunshine-on-leith-film-review>, 
albeit significantly different in audience profile and appeal.

The foreign-language hit

Despite never having cracked the box-office top 10 – or in fact the top 15 – 
on any weekend, Paolo Sorrentino'sThe Great Beauty 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154524/great-beauty> has quietly been 
mopping up the arthouse audience, providing one of 2013's rare foreign-language 
hits. The latest frame, the film's fourth, has delivered another £50,000, 
taking the cumulative total to £610,000. This is already more than five times 
the film's opening weekend gross (£117,000), and is also the third best 
non-Bollywood foreign-language result of the year so far, behind Pedro 
Almodóvar'sI'm So Excited 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154510/i-m-so-excited> (£848,000) and 
François Ozon'sIn the House 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146653/in-the-house> (£827,000). Other 
foreign-language successes this year includeWadjda 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149734/wadjda> (£387,000), No 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149896/no> (£346,000), Populaire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154532/populaire> (£343,000) and Lore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149890/lore> (£300,000), but overall it 
hasn't been a strong year for foreign films. In 2012,Untouchable 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149158/untouchable>, Headhunters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/143141/headhunters> and The Raid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145817/raid> all cleared £1m.

The Great Beauty benefited from a Sleeper award from the British Film 
Institute's Distribution Fund 
<http://www.bfi.org.uk/film-industry/lottery-funding-distribution/distribution-fund>
, a relatively recent innovation devised to help specialised titles reach a 
wider audience throughout the regions, and only bestowed after the opening 
weekend has already demonstrated proven appetite for a film. In the case of The 
Great Beauty, it has helped sustain advertising spend, as well as an expansion 
from the initial 25 sites.

The survivor

Back in the top 10 (up from number 15) in its 12th week of release, Monsters 
University <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155588/monsters-university> 
continues its solidly achieving run after a wobbly start. With £29.77m so far, 
the animated prequel has achieved a hefty 8.6 times its £3.46m opening tally – 
definitely the highest multiple for any of this summer's major releases. In the 
all-time league table for animation, Monsters University has recently overtaken
Shrek <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/88023/shrek> (£29m), A Bug's Life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/72916/bug.s.life> (£29.45m), Chicken Run
 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/83798/chicken.run> (£29.51m) and Ice 
Age 2 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/111577/ice.age.2> (£29.61m). It's 
the sixth most successful Pixar film of all time at the UK box office, behind
Toy Story 3 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140033/toy-story-3>, Toy 
Story 2 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81857/toy.story.2>, Monsters, 
Inc <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/90412/monsters.inc.>, Finding Nemo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/95989/finding.nemo> and Up 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/129187/up>.

The future

Despite the current box-office doldrums, takings are in fact only 11% down on 
the equivalent weekend from 2012, whenLooper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148727/looper> arrived at the chart 
summit with £2.43m. Now cinemas are pinning hopes on Proclaimers musical 
Sunshine on Leith, which may not be in theMamma Mia! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125168> league of massive popular 
appeal, but could well prove an effectively feelgood sleeper hit, especially 
with robust marketing support from its instinctively populist distributor 
Entertainment Films. Kevin Macdonald'sHow I Live Now 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/11/how-i-live-now-review-toronto>, 
from Meg Rosoff's young adult novel, is also hard to call, as is the full UK 
expansion of Filth. Thrown into the mix are sex-addiction comedy dramaThanks 
for Sharing <https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148765/thanks-for-sharing>, 
with Gwyneth Paltrow, and raunchy teen comedy The To Do List, with Aubrey Plaza.
