Authors including Alexander McCall Smith, Irvine Welsh, Caitlin Moran and Nina 
Stibbe have been shortlisted for the 2015Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/bollingereverymanwodehouseprize> for comic 
fiction. The six shortlisted novels are McCall Smith’s Fatty O’Leary’s Dinner 
Party, Welsh’s A Decent Ride, Joseph O’Neill’s The Dog, and three fiction 
debuts by female writers – Moran’s How To Build a Girl, Stibbe’s Man at the 
Helm and Helen Lederer’s Losing It. The winner will be announced just before 
the Hay festival, which runs from 21 to 31 May.


The 2015 Wodehouse prize shortlist was selected by a judging panel of BBC 
Radio 4’s Today programme presenter and author James Naughtie, Everyman’s 
Library publisher David Campbell, and Hay festival director and founder, Peter 
Florence.

Florence said: “There are so any different kinds of laughter here. Comedy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy> as a savage weapon, comedy as 
bleak despair, comedy as wry observation and as warm humour and affection. 
These astonishingly gifted writers can turn phrases, create characters to love, 
and rattle good yarns. There are wonders here and joys. We were delighted by 
them. Wodehouse would be proud of them.”

Previous Wodehouse prize winners include Edward St Aubyn, Howard Jacobson, 
Monica Lewycka, Ian McEwan and the late Sir Terry Pratchett.

The shortlist

Losing It by Helen Lederer (Pan Macmillan)
“In debt, divorced and desperate” runs the tagline for the comedian’s debut 
novel, in which a has-been media personality is asked to be the front woman for 
a new diet pill.


Fatty O’Leary’s Dinner Party by Alexander McCall Smith 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/alexander-mccall-smith> (Polygon)
More weight woes from the ridiculously prolific author behind the No 1 Ladies’ 
Detective Agency and the Isabel Dalhousie novels. Irish-American antiques 
dealer Fatty takes a 40th birthday celebratory trip to Ireland which goes 
farcically wrong.


How to Build a Girl by Caitlin Moran (Ebury)
A Portnoy’s Complaint for girls? The follow-up to How to Be A Woman is a 
coming-of-age novel with a similarly autobiographical flavour, as a poor but 
precocious Wolverhampton girl becomes a teenage music journalist. “It could 
make you laugh out loud with one hand tied behind its back, while wanking 
itself off to fantasies of Satan,”promised the Guardian review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/03/how-to-build-girl-caitlin-moran-review>
.


The Dog by Joseph O’Neill (4th Estate)
O’Neill was Man Booker-longlisted for this, as he was for his previous novel, 
the critical and commercial smash Netherland. Here the anonymous anti-hero is a 
New York attorney who has fled a failed relationship to work as the factotum 
for a wealthy Dubai family – part of “the new elite of international, 
plane-hopping white-collar brains servicing the planet’s affluent”,as the 
Guardian review had it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/16/dog-joseph-oneill-review-high-life-high-comedy>
.


Man at the Helm by Nina Stibbe (Viking, Penguin)
This 70s-set comic novel follows her wonderful memoir about nannying for 
London’s literati. A divorcee and her children blow into an English village, 
and try – oh how they try – to fit in. “Her ear for off-kilter dialogue is as 
brilliantly tuned as it was in Love, Nina; and she is a maestro of bathos, 
continually undercutting vivid gaiety with moments of horrible sadness,”wrote 
Alex Clark in her Guardian review 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/05/man-at-the-helm-nina-stibbe-review-novel>
.


A Decent Ride by Irvine Welsh (Jonathan Cape)
For his 10th novel, to be published in April, Irvine Welsh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/irvinewelsh> reintroduces us to “Juice” 
Terry Lawson, “top shagger, drug-dealer, gonzo-porn-star and taxi-driver”, also 
seen inGlue.
