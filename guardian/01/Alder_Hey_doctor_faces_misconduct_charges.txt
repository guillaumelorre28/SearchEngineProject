 A pathologist who secretly stockpiled the body parts of babies and children, 
including a head in a jar, is to face charges of serious professional 
misconduct, it emerged today.
Professor Dick van Velzen, who was at the centre of the Alder Hey hospital 
organs scandal, will appear before the General Medical Council (GMC) on Monday. 
If found guilty, he could be struck off.

The GMC suspended the Dutch pathologist from practising medicine in the UK 
four years ago, but that suspension expires on August 1. The fitness to 
practise hearing in Manchester is expected to last about three weeks.

The move comes just months after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided 
there was insufficient evidence to bring a criminal prosecution against him.

Prof van Velzen was criticised in the scandal which involved hundreds of 
children's organs being removed and stored at the Liverpool hospital without 
their parents' consent.

A public inquiry into the scandal found that between 1989 and 1995, the 
professor systematically ordered the "unethical and illegal stripping of every 
organ from every child who had had a postmortem".

Hundreds of distressed parents, who had been unaware they had buried their 
children with missing body parts, were forced to hold second funerals once the 
truth emerged.
