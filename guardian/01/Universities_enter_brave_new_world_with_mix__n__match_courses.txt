Alice Todd didn’t expect to find herself camping on Dorset heathland surveying 
flora and pollination when she first filled in her university application form. 
She applied to study zoology but just missed the grades, and then found a 
course in ecology and wildlife conservation through clearing.

“I’d never heard of a course in wildlife conservation until I saw it in 
clearing <https://www.theguardian.com/education/clearing>. It’s turned out much 
better because I’m really enjoying it,” says Todd, 19, who is working with the 
National Trust this summer after the first year of her BSc degree at 
Bournemouth University.

The initial disappointment has given way to relief that she has found a 
passion for a subject that will provide a lifetime interest and a rewarding 
career. It was the same for English literature applicant Ramat Tejani, who 
discovered international business at the University of Hertfordshire while 
leafing through clearing vacancies on a shopping centre bench because she 
didn’t want to go home to her parents without first having secured a university 
offer.

After Clearing: how to find student housing

“I didn’t know such courses existed, and I got to spend an incredible year in 
the United States as well,” says Tejani who now works as a marketing 
communications specialist.

Clearing <https://www.theguardian.com/education/clearing> is now far more than 
a last-chance saloon for students who missed their grades. Applicants make up 
one in eight of the UK’s full-time undergraduate admissions. A record 64,300 
students found places through clearing last year, of whom 15,000 were new 
applicants who had not previously registered with Ucas.

And the lifting of the student numbers cap last year – along with the 
introduction ofthe “adjustment” system 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/12/a-level-results-better-than-expected-adjustment>
, which allows students to trade up to a different course or university if 
their grades exceed their firm choice offer – gives more students the 
opportunity to consider new, and sometimes surprising, opportunities.

When A-level results are published on Thursday, applicants will find some 
exciting new courses and modern twists on traditional subjects on offer.

To attract students and satisfy the demands of 21st-century employers, 
universities are putting far more emphasis on student satisfaction and 
work-ready skills. Vocational subjects scorned as “Mickey Mouse” degrees less 
than a decade ago now have some of the best graduate employment rates.

Birmingham’s applied golf management BSc has 100% of its students in jobs six 
months after graduation, as does the BA Hons in animation and visual effects at 
Sheffield Hallam University. And employers are actively seeking out graduates 
from Bournemouth University’s retail degree, says Martin Birchall, managing 
director of High Fliers Research, a graduate recruitment research company.

Joint degrees are offering work-related combinations such as psychology and 
business at Aston or drama and business studies at Loughborough. And the UK’s 
first insurance degree – developed by the University of Chichester and brokers 
Be Wiser – is being launched next month.Students

starting salary of £18,000 and get time off and their fees paid to study at 
Peter Symonds College in Winchester for the BA Hons degree.

Meanwhile, many universities are moving towards cross-disciplinary courses 
with more joint honours and integrated study or work abroad.

Liberal arts and science has slipped across the Atlantic from the US and is 
springing up at universities across the UK, including Birmingham and Surrey. 
The degrees offer students the opportunity to mix and match different subjects 
rather than specialising in one or two. Students at University College London, 
for example, can take a minimum of three courses ranging from creative writing, 
qualitative thinking or law in action to engineering design, energy systems and 
methodologies of drawing.

University of Surrey student Laura Richter says she chose its liberal arts and 
science degree because she wanted to carry on with several subjects. “I liked 
psychology, languages and humanities, and I didn’t want to choose one and then 
find two years down the line it wasn’t for me,” she says. “Everyone gets 
together from the different modules, and we bring our different skills and 
approaches to problems and scenarios.” Her main subjects are psychology and 
modern languages.

Choosing your university course during Clearing: pick a passion

New subjects can often be found in clearing before they become better known 
and established. Bristol, for example, is offering places for its suite of 
four-year “innovation” integrated undergraduate and master’s degrees – which 
include computer science with innovation, film and television with innovation, 
and history with innovation – being launched this September. The innovation 
part of the degree course covers enterprise, venture creation and 
entrepreneurship.

So what do employers think about these new courses? For 70% of graduate jobs, 
it doesn’t matter, says Birchall. In fact, some employers are seeking graduates 
who follow less traditional routes. “The big law firms keep half their places 
open to people who study subjects other than law because they want people with 
diverse experience. So it may be that students stand just as good a chance, or 
even better, by doing well in a subject they really enjoy rather than one they 
think will impress employers,” he says.

The reputation of an institution is important, but some lower down the 
university rankings are respected by employers for their excellence in 
different sectors, he adds .

Richter has found employers are open-minded about her degree choice. When she 
was applying for a psychology work placement this year, she found employers did 
not know about liberal arts degrees but were “intrigued to find out more about 
them”.

Gareth Hughes, the research lead for student wellbeing at the University of 
Derby, says he sees parents who are worried when their children want to study 
subjects such as pop music or music technology – but both courses have good 
employment prospects.

Today’s universities are trying to meet employers’ needs through innovative 
courses but they are also preparing young people for jobs in the future that we 
cannot foresee, he says. “A degree isn’t a job training programme. If you 
engage with it, then a degree in any subject will give you the same set of 
skills and build you up as a person.”

The problem for universities branching out into this brave new world of 
innovative degrees is that parents and teachers – the people who teenagers turn 
to for advice – are likely to favour what they know and trust. Even Mary 
Curnock Cook, chief executive of Ucas, admits that she may have given the wrong 
advice a few years ago when her three children were applying.

“I remember just wanting my kids to choose something ‘normal’ at a university 
I recognised, so I could relax,” she says. “Now I’d tell parents to resist this 
urge and allow your children to make their choices for a 21st-century future.”
