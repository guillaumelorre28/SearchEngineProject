There is a famous photograph taken by Allen Ginsberg of "painter, archivist, 
anthropologist, film-maker and hermetic alchemist" Harry Smith "transforming 
milk into milk" in a New York hotel room in 1985. The cranky-looking figure 
with large spectacles and wispy hair and beard was never a household name; nor 
were the bulk of the figures whose work he rescued from the dusty half-light 
with his Anthology of American Folk Music in 1952. This compilation featured 
recordings from a motley assortment of pre-war characters, such as Dock Boggs 
or Floyd Ming and his Pep-Steppers. The selection seemed to be made on the 
songs' strangeness – in the later words of the critic Greil Marcus, it revealed 
"the old, weird America". Smith wrote synopses of the songs and created his own 
artwork, including an etching of a monochord taken from a mystical treatise by 
17th-century English astrologer Robert Fludd. The release became the bible of 
the Greenwich Village folk revival of the late 1950s and early 60s – feted by 
the likes of Dave Van Ronk and Dylan.
