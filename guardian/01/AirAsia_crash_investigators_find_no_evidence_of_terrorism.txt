Indonesian investigators say they have not found any evidence so far that 
terrorism was involved in the crash of an AirAsia passenger jet last month that 
killed all 162 people on board.

Andreas Hananto told Reuters on Monday that his team of 10 investigators at 
the National Transportation Safety Committee had found “no threats” in the 
cockpit voice recordings to indicate foul play duringAirAsia flight QZ8501

The Airbus A320-200 vanished from radar screens on 28 December, less than 
halfway into a two-hour flight from Surabaya, Indonesia’s second-biggest city, 
to Singapore. There were no survivors.

When asked if there was any evidence from the recording that terrorism was 
involved, Hananto said: “No. Because if there were terrorism, there would have 
been a threat of some kind.“

“In that critical situation, the recording indicates that the pilot was busy 
with the handling of the plane.”

Investigators said they had listened to the whole of the recording but 
transcribed only about half.

“We didn’t hear any voice of other persons other than the pilots,” said 
Nurcahyo Utomo, another investigator.

“We didn’t hear any sounds of gunfire or explosions. For the time being, based 
on that, we can eliminate the possibility of terrorism.”
