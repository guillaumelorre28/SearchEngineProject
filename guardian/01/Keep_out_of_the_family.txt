We travelled to Spain, to the mountains around Granada for my girlfriend's 
elder brother's wedding. I never counted on how her parents or twin brother 
would behave. Having never been on holiday with another family before I was 
expecting the worst (I'd known the family for 18 months) but at the end of the 
week, even I could not believe what had happened.

Her father ranted continually about his bad 'lot' in life and her mother was 
just plain rude. The final straw was when a particularly drunk twin brother 
called me all names under the sun for no apparent reason (aside from the drink) 
and told me he was prepared to 'do time' for me.

Girlfriend and I ended up having no time together on our own, aside from the 
odd few hours. It was the first holiday that I have been on where I looked 
forward to getting home. Since our return I have not seen the rest of the 
family and am happy about this situation. I feel sorry for my girlfriend as she 
apologised to me for their behaviour and she has no way out. We are currently 
discussing ways of moving on with our relationship based on the events of the 
last couple of weeks.

I now require another holiday and have decided to work over the Christmas and 
new year period.

 Thanks for listening.
