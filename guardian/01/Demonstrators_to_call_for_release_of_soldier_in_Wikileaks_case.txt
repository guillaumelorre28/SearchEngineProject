Rallies will be staged in 21 US cities this week calling for the release of 
Bradley Manning, the soldier accused of leaking military secrets to the public. 

Manning allegedly passed on the video known as "collateral murder" that showed 
American troops shooting civilians from a helicopter inIraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> in July 2007. The dead included two 
employees of theReuters news agency.

Though the actions depicted in the video amount to violations of the Geneva 
Conventions (aka war crimes), none of the soldiers have been prosecuted.

Manning, who faces 52 years in prison, is also being investigated for 
allegedly leaking the "Afghan war diary" documents that were posted on 
Wikileaks and reported byThe Guardian, the New York Times and Der Spiegel. 

Marjorie Cohn, a professor at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law, argues that 
if Manning did what he is accused of doing, he should be honoured as a hero for 
exposing war crimes.

In a separate development, WikiLeaks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks> founder Julian Assange has been 
told he is not obliged to remain in Sweden even though prosecutors are however 
continuing to investigate rape allegations against him.

Assange's lawyer, Bj√∂rn Hurtig, said: "I have been told that there is no 
arrest warrant against him."

Assange has said the allegations against him are part of a "smear campaign" 
aimed at discrediting his website, and that he will stay inSweden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden> to prove his innocence.
