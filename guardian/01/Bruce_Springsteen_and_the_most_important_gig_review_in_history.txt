Jon Landau was a music writer who'd failed as a producer, and who was 
wondering about his place in the world. Bruce Springsteen was on his second 
album for CBS, but far from a star. The coming together of the two was their 
making. "Last Thursday, at the Harvard Square theater, I saw rock'n'roll past 
flash before my eyes," Landau wrote in a confessional review for the Boston 
alternative free sheet the Real Paper. "And I saw something else: I saw rock 
and roll future and its name isBruce Springsteen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/springsteen>. And on a night when I needed 
to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first 
time." Landau's endorsement was critical for Springsteen's standing with CBS – 
the "rock and roll future" line became a key part of the Springsteen mythology. 
More importantly, it led Springsteen to seek out Landau as a sounding board for 
his ideas as he prepared his next album. Born to Run made Springsteen a star, 
and Landau's contribution was so great Springsteen decided he would be the man 
to guide him through his career as manager, producer,consigliere – not just his 
right-hand man, but his right hand.
