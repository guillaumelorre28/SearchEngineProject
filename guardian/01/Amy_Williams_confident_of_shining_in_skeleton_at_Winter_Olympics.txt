Amy Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/amy-williams> has emerged as a 
genuine contender for an Olympic skeleton medal after out-shining her British 
rival Shelley Rudman during training at the Whistler Sliding Centre.

Williams posted the second fastest time of the third practice run and the 
sixth fastest of the fourth, behind the favourite Mellisa Hollingsworth of 
Canada, who set an unofficial track record by cracking the 54-second barrier 
for the first time.

Rudman was back in eighth and 10th places respectively but the Turin silver 
medallist will not be unduly concerned by her times as she continues to 
experiment with the track ahead of the start of the competition tomorrow.

"I had a few questions in my mind and now I've answered them," said Rudman. "I 
use these runs to learn about how I approach the track and I've done that. I 
know what the deal is now."

For Williams, consistently one of the fastest starters on the course, her two 
training runs were vindication of her belief that she is suited to the track 
after an off-the-pace start in practice yesterday.

Her time in her first run of 54.35 was bettered only by the 54.18 of Canada's 
Amy Gough, before Hollingsworth reminded her rivals of her dominance by blazing 
down her second in 53.99. "I'm very happy with my runs," said Williams. "I 
needed a day like today to give me a boost of confidence and now I feel very 
confident. I'm actually looking forward to going down this track now."
