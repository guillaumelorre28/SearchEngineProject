In the past fortnight, winter has descended into the branches of a big sycamore

 tree. As if they were the hangers-on at a party, a scattering of leaves are 
still flying the flag, wearing ready-to-drop yellow. Liberated from the 
constrictions and crowding of their erstwhile neighbours, they are free to 
swing in the gappy canopy. As the breeze lifts, they are raised up as one into 
a rocksteady beat.

Never have the leaves looked so alive as when so close to death. The great 
pointy-edged plates are picked up wonderfully by the wind as with no other tree 
around, and seem to dance in a soundless jig.

Why are autumn leaves mostly yellow in Europe and red in North America?

There are moments when the air currents play tricks and a handful of leaves 
are whipped up to dash themselves against nothingness, while their fellows 
quiver gently. A poet might describe all this movement in verse, though, to my 
knowledge, nobody has penned a sonnet to a sycamore.

In the popular imagination, when the wind blows the leaves do fall, but that 
is not so. On a day of great gusts, the long, strong stalks were tugged taut, 
and the whole crown was shaking, but practically nothing broke from its 
moorings.

It is not the elements but the parent tree that decides, once it has robbed 
its expendable extremities of goodness, that it is time to cast them off. Two 
days after the big blow, in near stillness after frost, leaves were raining 
down â€“ 62 in one randomly counted minute.

A single leaf drops from low in the hem of the canopy, barely noticed since it 
falls fast and straight. Another is dislodged from high in the crown and begins 
its long goodbye. It caresses a cluster of crinkled leaves and is rebuffed. It 
strokes at one branch and then is glad-handed to another, but still it falls. 
It plummets to trunk level, and then, for a time-stopping moment, it is 
suspended horizontal, as if it were a parachute, before dipping and dropping 
directly to the ground. It is there somewhere, indistinguishable from the great 
mass of the fallen.
