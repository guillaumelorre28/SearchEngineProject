US telecoms giant AT&T is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Time Warner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/time-warner>, the media company whose star 
assets include HBO, Warner Brothers and CNN.

A deal could come as early as this weekend, according to the Wall Street 
Journal. Both companies declined to comment.

A merger of the two firms would come as telecoms companies have shown an 
increasing interest in media and tech takeovers. Verizon is currently in 
negotiations to buy Yahoo and has already bought AOL, owner of Huffington Post.

AT&T, the second largest wireless telecoms company in the US behind Verizon, 
owns a portfolio of mobile, broadband and satellite TV services that it 
promotes using Time Warner’s entertainment assets, among others.

But a deal to buy the Time Warner empire would rival the last major telecoms 
and media merger, Comcast’s 2011 takeover of NBCUniversal. It would also awaken 
memories of another, ill-fated, Time Warner takeover.


In 2001 AOL took over Time Warner in a deal now regarded as one of the worst 
mergers in history. It took a decade to unwind the transaction.

Time Warner’s share price rose 9% on the news while AT&T’s dipped close to 3%. 
Time Warner is valued at $73.5bn, AT&T is valued at $227bn.

Brian Wieser, lead researcher at analytics firm Pivotal, said that the deal 
was a possibility but would present the new entity with potentially 
insurmountable difficulties.

Wieser said that while the marriage of a producer and a distributor might at 
first look similar to the successful Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, an 
AT&T-Time Warner entity presented unique challenges. Other entities, he said, 
made more sense for the always-a-bridesmaid Time Warner. “DirecTV and Time 
Warner in a lot of ways is more similar than Time Warner and AT&T. It looks 
like a hedge against the commoditization of infrastructure.”

Cash rich telecoms companies like AT&T are facing a crisis as their wireless 
businesses reach maturity and fixed line income continues to erode.

“AT&T is an acquisition machine and interested in empire preservation if 
nothing else,” said Wieser. “Time Warner has always been for sale at the right 
price. It’s not a position that creates any synergies, and it does create some 
dis-synergies, like the problem of managing a global media company from Texas. 
It’s a standalone entity that gets lost when it’s part of a much bigger 
conglomerate.”


But AT&T is at a crossroads, Wieser said. “If the prospects for wireline 
growth are negative and the prospects for wireless growth are tepid, what do 
you do to make sure your business grows?”

Time Warner too faces headwinds. The trend toward “cord cutting” – where 
people get their TV needs over the internet – has eaten into the cable 
subscriptions that are vital to its networks.

Traditional media companies are also facing increased competition from players 
including Netflix, Amazon Prime and Google’s YouTube. In August Time Warner 
bought a 10% stake in Hulu, another streaming service owned by a consortium of 
established media players.

HBO, whose shows include Westworld and Game of Thrones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones>, was once one of the 
crown jewels of the cable industry. But the rapid changes in the industry 
forced Time Warner to launch a standalone digital HBO service.

A transaction is bound to attract regulatory attention. Comcast, the US’s 
largest cable company, faced intense regulatory scrutiny during its takeover of 
NBCUniversal.
