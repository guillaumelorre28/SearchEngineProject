Night time politics

I am going to wind up here.

 * Today, financial services minister Kelly O‚ÄôDwyer came under sustained 
pressure after the government mistakenly voted for a Labor amendment. In 
question time, O‚ÄôDwyer was asked a very detailed question about her portfolio, 
which she obviously could not answer. Labor then asked a series of questions, 
some of which were ruled out of order, which asked Turnbull why he wasn‚Äôt 
sacking O‚ÄôDwyer and justice minister Michael Keenan. Labor suggested the 
government lost their first vote when Keenan left parliament early and the 
second vote when Keenan was in the chamber.

 * Barnaby Joyce suggested people shouldn‚Äôt make threats when asked about 
interventions by George Christensen and Andrew Broad, suggesting they would 
take their bats home if the government allowed a free vote. But Joyce has also 
been very clear that if the plebiscite fails, it‚Äôs all over for this term of 
government.

 * Meanwhile the plebiscite bill is still in the house. Even though the bill 
was scheduled to go to be clear of the house on Tuesday and into the senate on 
Wednesday. As of close of business, there is now no chance for the plebiscite 
to go to the senate until the week of November 7 - given next week senate 
estimates. There has been a long list of speakers in the house, to the point of 
which there has been speculation as to whether there is a filibuster going on. 
This scenario would be slightly incomprehensible, unless it is a time buying 
exercise to gauge public reaction.

 * NXT senator Stirling Griff gave his first speech. The SA senator called for 
government ownership of essential utilities including electricity, water and 
gas and the national broadband network. 
 * Andrew Wilkie and Cathy McGowan have flagged their motion calling for the 
Choppergate recommendations into politicians ‚Äúentitlements‚Äù be enforced. They 
want real time disclosure of spending, better information of the purpose of 
visits and to call it by its proper names - work expenses, no less. What is the 
world coming to? 
Thanks for your company this week. Apologies for the fragmented afternoon but 
we had a little podcast to put together. Thanks toGareth Hutchens, Paul Karp, 
Katharine Murphy and Mike Bowers for their contributions. 

Tomorrow, we have Gunfight at the OK Corral, with George Brandis and Justin 
Gleeson appearing at the senate committee to explain their dispute. The 
schedule, formerly online, has been taken down. We hear Brandis is now 
appearing later at 12.30pm. Because the program is not online anymore, we don‚Äôt 
know who else is appearing.

As for politicslive, we will be back next week, for the house sitting and 
senate estimates where the job description is to keep eyes across the chamber 
and four or five different committee rooms. Plate spinning is the order of the 
day.

I leave you a message from the incomparable Matt Hatter as I shuffle off into 
the night.

Bonsoir.

If you haven‚Äôt been following the Williamtown story, it is awful. There was a 
Senate inquiry last year about it. But it is still going.

This story is just one of many, run by the ABC this week. 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-12/cba-backs-down-on-foreclosing-contaminated-homes/7925778>

The Commonwealth Bank (CBA) has backed down on threatening foreclosure on 
homes in the NSW town of Salt Ash which have beencontaminated by chemicals used 
at the nearby Williamtown defence base 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-20/resident-says-class-action-against-defence-is-only-option/7643310>
.

Property values in the area have plunged after it was declared to be in the 
‚Äòred zone‚Äô because chemicals from the RAAF base had leached into the area‚Äôs 
bore water.

Banks had threatened foreclosure, but after the matter was raised at last 
week‚Äôs parliamentary inquiry into the banking sector 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/cultural-change-in-banking-industry-expected-after-inquiry/7899378>
, CBA says its foreclosure letters were the result of an administrative error.

Rob Roseworne, a home and business owner in Salt Ash who is a CBA customer, 
said his bank had been spooked by his properties‚Äô subsequent drop in value.

‚ÄòInitially I felt that I was being harassed and bullied and threatened with 
foreclosure,‚Äô he said.

Greens senator Lee Rhiannon is speaking now, saying none of the banks will 
lend in the contaminated area. She says in spite of the government admission 
that it is fully responsible for the contamination through the defence 
department, the residents effected have not been assisted. Rhiannon said the 
Senate inquiry found the residents should be compensated and provided free 
health care.

Now National senator John Williams says he is horrified at this Williamtown 
problem which he had only heard about in the past few days due to Burston‚Äôs 
motion.

He has contacted the banks because he learned a lot of the victims of this 
contamination had had their houses devalued. The big four banks and the Bankers 
Association told Williams they would look at it.

Through no fault of their own because of where they bought near Williamtown ...

It is Gabi back again. 

I have retained some composure now. The house has adjourned but the Senate is 
still going. One Nation‚ÄôsBrian Burston has moved a motion that appears to have 
the support of Labor or at least senatorDoug Cameron. 

This is the motion.

To move ‚Äì that the Senate:

(a) supports the efforts of the Department of Defence and other commonwealth 
and state government agencies responding to environmental and health issues 
arising out of firefighting foam contamination at RAAF base Williamtown in New 
South Wales and army aviation centre Oakey in Queensland, including engaging 
the University of Newcastle family action centre (UNFAC) to develop and deliver 
mental health awareness and stress management activities in the Williamtown 
area;

(b) notes that:

(i) some landholders in the immediate vicinity of Williamtown air base and 
Oakey army aviation centre are reporting difficulties accessing equity, 
property value impacts and difficulty selling their land;

(ii) the Department of Defence has met with a number of lending institutions 
and the Australian Property Institute to discuss property lending policies and 
practices and how valuations are conducted in the Williamtown area, and

(iii) the Department of Defence has committed to review the issue of property 
acquisition once detailed environmental investigations at No. 10 13 October 
2016 9 RAAF base Williamtown and army aviation centre Oakey have been 
concluded; and

(c) calls on the government to expedite environmental investigations of the 
impact of firefighting foam contamination at Williamtown and Oakey to enable 
landholders to address the dilemma of land remediation or relocation, and move 
on with their lives and deal with issues of mental health and stress management.

In a speech out of the ‚Äúhow to win friends and influence people‚Äù bucket, 
Cameron says he thinks a lot of what One Nation talks about is total rubbish. 
But this motion, Cameron says, is a good one and if he brings more like these 
Burston will have a successful career in the Senate.

Senator Derryn Hinch on Sky News has said that he wants to bring a motion in 
the Senate on Thursday so that the new photography rules apply from the next 
sitting day, 7 November (instead of 28 November).

Hinch also said his initial view was that a plebiscite on marriage equality as 
a last resort would be a good idea.

Then I saw the cost of it. And it‚Äôs not fair. We‚Äôre not here to judge people‚Äôs

Liberal MP Craig Kelly is speaking on the plebiscite bill. 

He‚Äôs attacked Labor for sending out text messages that ‚Äúappeared to be 
official communications from Medicare‚Äù at the federal election, linking the two 
issues by arguing they both represent a disdain for democracy:

 There was no embarrassment, no apology, just a ha ha ha we tricked you. That 
is the disdain we‚Äôre seeing for the democratic process.


If false statements are made in trade or commerce they are unlawful, Kelly 
said.

It‚Äôs an interesting point but it does tend to lend weight to the concern that 
the set up of the plebiscite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/13/marriage-equality-plebiscite-campaign-ads-run-by-third-parties-wont-need-to-be-true>
 allows third-party groups to run advertisements without any restraint on the 
nature or truth of their messages.

I‚Äôm back watching the debate on the government‚Äôs plebiscite bill in the lower 
house.

Labor‚Äôs Stephen Jones referred to new research on the negative social and 
psychological impacts of the no campaign in Ireland by researchers at 
Australia‚Äôs University of Queensland and Victoria University.

As Guardian Australia reported 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/08/same-sex-marriage-irish-campaign-had-negative-effect-on-most-lgbti-people>
 the survey of more than 1,600 LGBTI campaigners found:

 * 75.5% of participants often or always felt angry when they were exposed to 
campaign messages from the no campaign before the referendum. 
 * 80% felt upset by the no campaign materials, and two-thirds felt anxious or 
distressed. Facebook

NXT senator Stirling Griff calls for public ownership of utilities

Stirling Griff is setting out an economic agenda quite at odds with the 
bipartisan consensus of economic rationalism (or neoliberalism, depending who 
you ask).

He‚Äôs just called for government ownership of essential utilities including 
electricity, water and gas and the national broadband network.

Griff also called for governments to ‚Äúbuy Australian first‚Äù, arguing the 
country is spending millions of dollars on foreign goods decreasing jobs and 
economic activity here. Even the crockery with the Australian emblem in the 
parliament dining rooms is made overseas, he says.

NXT senator Stirling Griff is delivering his first speech in the Senate.

Griff called for pre-university internships so young people consider what 
career is right for them rather than going to university just to get their 
parents off their backs.

Australia already has too many law graduates that instead of becoming 
solicitors, end up as baristas. And Nick [Xenophon] didn‚Äôt help me with that 
one.

This post has been amended as Griff was incorrectly called a One Nation 
senator. Guardian Australia apologises.

A detail I forgot to bring you from Senate question time:

One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts asked Simon Birmingham for empirical 
evidence of climate change, as Birmo was representing the environment and 
energy minister in Senate question time.

He responded:


The Turnbull government accepts the science of climate change. We take our 
advice from the chief scientist, the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and the 
departments of the environment and energy as well as leading world science 
organisations.

Birmingham then gives some of that empirical evidence, including:

 * That 2015 was the warmest on record for the globe 
 * In Australia, the climate has warmed 1 degree since 1910 
 * 8 of 10 warmest years on record occurred since 2002 
That‚Äôs the evidence: it‚Äôs getting hot in here.

Manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, is giving a press conference to 
suggest thatMalcolm Turnbull did not defend his colleagues George Brandis, 
Sussan Ley, Kelly O‚ÄôDwyer and Chris Pyne in question time when asked if they 
were up to their jobs.

 He can‚Äôt back them in because it‚Äôs too humiliating ... but nor can he 
discipline them, because the instability in the government is extraordinary and 
he can‚Äôt have a former minister joining a former prime minister on the back 
bench.

I am going to wind up here.

 * Today, financial services minister Kelly O‚ÄôDwyer came under sustained 
pressure after the government mistakenly voted for a Labor amendment. In 
question time, O‚ÄôDwyer was asked a very detailed question about her portfolio, 
which she obviously could not answer. Labor then asked a series of questions, 
some of which were ruled out of order, which asked Turnbull why he wasn‚Äôt 
sacking O‚ÄôDwyer and justice minister Michael Keenan. Labor suggested the 
government lost their first vote when Keenan left parliament early and the 
second vote when Keenan was in the chamber.

 * Barnaby Joyce suggested people shouldn‚Äôt make threats when asked about 
interventions by George Christensen and Andrew Broad, suggesting they would 
take their bats home if the government allowed a free vote. But Joyce has also 
been very clear that if the plebiscite fails, it‚Äôs all over for this term of 
government.

 * Meanwhile the plebiscite bill is still in the house. Even though the bill 
was scheduled to go to be clear of the house on Tuesday and into the senate on 
Wednesday. As of close of business, there is now no chance for the plebiscite 
to go to the senate until the week of November 7 - given next week senate 
estimates. There has been a long list of speakers in the house, to the point of 
which there has been speculation as to whether there is a filibuster going on. 
This scenario would be slightly incomprehensible, unless it is a time buying 
exercise to gauge public reaction.

 * NXT senator Stirling Griff gave his first speech. The SA senator called for 
government ownership of essential utilities including electricity, water and 
gas and the national broadband network. 
 * Andrew Wilkie and Cathy McGowan have flagged their motion calling for the 
Choppergate recommendations into politicians ‚Äúentitlements‚Äù be enforced. They 
want real time disclosure of spending, better information of the purpose of 
visits and to call it by its proper names - work expenses, no less. What is the 
world coming to? 
Thanks for your company this week. Apologies for the fragmented afternoon but 
we had a little podcast to put together. Thanks toGareth Hutchens, Paul Karp, 
Katharine Murphy and Mike Bowers for their contributions. 

Tomorrow, we have Gunfight at the OK Corral, with George Brandis and Justin 
Gleeson appearing at the senate committee to explain their dispute. The 
schedule, formerly online, has been taken down. We hear Brandis is now 
appearing later at 12.30pm. Because the program is not online anymore, we don‚Äôt 
know who else is appearing.

As for politicslive, we will be back next week, for the house sitting and 
senate estimates where the job description is to keep eyes across the chamber 
and four or five different committee rooms. Plate spinning is the order of the 
day.

I leave you a message from the incomparable Matt Hatter as I shuffle off into

If you haven‚Äôt been following the Williamtown story, it is awful. There was a 
Senate inquiry last year about it. But it is still going.

This story is just one of many, run by the ABC this week. 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-12/cba-backs-down-on-foreclosing-contaminated-homes/7925778>

The Commonwealth Bank (CBA) has backed down on threatening foreclosure on 
homes in the NSW town of Salt Ash which have beencontaminated by chemicals used 
at the nearby Williamtown defence base 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-20/resident-says-class-action-against-defence-is-only-option/7643310>
.

Property values in the area have plunged after it was declared to be in the 
‚Äòred zone‚Äô because chemicals from the RAAF base had leached into the area‚Äôs 
bore water.

Banks had threatened foreclosure, but after the matter was raised at last 
week‚Äôs parliamentary inquiry into the banking sector 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/cultural-change-in-banking-industry-expected-after-inquiry/7899378>
, CBA says its foreclosure letters were the result of an administrative error.

Rob Roseworne, a home and business owner in Salt Ash who is a CBA customer, 
said his bank had been spooked by his properties‚Äô subsequent drop in value.

‚ÄòInitially I felt that I was being harassed and bullied and threatened with 
foreclosure,‚Äô he said.

Greens senator Lee Rhiannon is speaking now, saying none of the banks will 
lend in the contaminated area. She says in spite of the government admission 
that it is fully responsible for the contamination through the defence 
department, the residents effected have not been assisted. Rhiannon said the 
Senate inquiry found the residents should be compensated and provided free 
health care.
 
Now National senator John Williams says he is horrified at this Williamtown 
problem which he had only heard about in the past few days due to Burston‚Äôs 
motion.

He has contacted the banks because he learned a lot of the victims of this 
contamination had had their houses devalued. The big four banks and the Bankers 
Association told Williams they would look at it.

Through no fault of their own because of where they bought near Williamtown ...
 
It is Gabi back again. 

I have retained some composure now. The house has adjourned but the Senate is 
still going. One Nation‚ÄôsBrian Burston has moved a motion that appears to have 
the support of Labor or at least senatorDoug Cameron. 

This is the motion.

To move ‚Äì that the Senate:

(a) supports the efforts of the Department of Defence and other commonwealth 
and state government agencies responding to environmental and health issues 
arising out of firefighting foam contamination at RAAF base Williamtown in New 
South Wales and army aviation centre Oakey in Queensland, including engaging 
the University of Newcastle family action centre (UNFAC) to develop and deliver 
mental health awareness and stress management activities in the Williamtown 
area;

(b) notes that:

(i) some landholders in the immediate vicinity of Williamtown air base and 
Oakey army aviation centre are reporting difficulties accessing equity, 
property value impacts and difficulty selling their land;

(ii) the Department of Defence has met with a number of lending institutions 
and the Australian Property Institute to discuss property lending policies and 
practices and how valuations are conducted in the Williamtown area, and

(iii) the Department of Defence has committed to review the issue of property 
acquisition once detailed environmental investigations at No. 10 13 October 
2016 9 RAAF base Williamtown and army aviation centre Oakey have been 
concluded; and

(c) calls on the government to expedite environmental investigations of the 
impact of firefighting foam contamination at Williamtown and Oakey to enable 
landholders to address the dilemma of land remediation or relocation, and move 
on with their lives and deal with issues of mental health and stress management.

In a speech out of the ‚Äúhow to win friends and influence people‚Äù bucket, 
Cameron says he thinks a lot of what One Nation talks about is total rubbish. 
But this motion, Cameron says, is a good one and if he brings more like these 
Burston will have a successful career in the Senate.
 
Why hello again! I am back for the adjournment debate. Thanks to Paul Karp for 
stepping into thebreach. 

Arrghhhh I‚Äôm losing it. 
 
Senator Derryn Hinch on Sky News has said that he wants to bring a motion in 
the Senate on Thursday so that the new photography rules apply from the next 
sitting day, 7 November (instead of 28 November).

Hinch also said his initial view was that a plebiscite on marriage equality as 
a last resort would be a good idea.

Then I saw the cost of it. And it‚Äôs not fair. We‚Äôre not here to judge people‚Äôs 
lives and who loves who. It‚Äôs not our call.
 
Liberal MP Craig Kelly is speaking on the plebiscite bill. 

He‚Äôs attacked Labor for sending out text messages that ‚Äúappeared to be 
official communications from Medicare‚Äù at the federal election, linking the two 
issues by arguing they both represent a disdain for democracy:

 There was no embarrassment, no apology, just a ha ha ha we tricked you. That 
is the disdain we‚Äôre seeing for the democratic process.


If false statements are made in trade or commerce they are unlawful, Kelly 
said.

It‚Äôs an interesting point but it does tend to lend weight to the concern that 
the set up of the plebiscite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/13/marriage-equality-plebiscite-campaign-ads-run-by-third-parties-wont-need-to-be-true>
 allows third-party groups to run advertisements without any restraint on the 
nature or truth of their messages.
 
I‚Äôm back watching the debate on the government‚Äôs plebiscite bill in the lower 
house.

Labor‚Äôs Stephen Jones referred to new research on the negative social and 
psychological impacts of the no campaign in Ireland by researchers at 
Australia‚Äôs University of Queensland and Victoria University.

As Guardian Australia reported 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/08/same-sex-marriage-irish-campaign-had-negative-effect-on-most-lgbti-people>
 the survey of more than 1,600 LGBTI campaigners found:

 * 75.5% of participants often or always felt angry when they were exposed to 
campaign messages from the no campaign before the referendum. 
 * 80% felt upset by the no campaign materials, and two-thirds felt anxious or 
distressed.  
Stirling Griff is setting out an economic agenda quite at odds with the 
bipartisan consensus of economic rationalism (or neoliberalism, depending who 
you ask).

He‚Äôs just called for government ownership of essential utilities including 
electricity, water and gas and the national broadband network.

Griff also called for governments to ‚Äúbuy Australian first‚Äù, arguing the 
country is spending millions of dollars on foreign goods decreasing jobs and 
economic activity here. Even the crockery with the Australian emblem in the 
parliament dining rooms is made overseas, he says.
 
NXT senator Stirling Griff is delivering his first speech in the Senate.

Griff called for pre-university internships so young people consider what 
career is right for them rather than going to university just to get their 
parents off their backs.

Australia already has too many law graduates that instead of becoming 
solicitors, end up as baristas. And Nick [Xenophon] didn‚Äôt help me with that 
one.

This post has been amended as Griff was incorrectly called a One Nation 
senator. Guardian Australia apologises.
 
A detail I forgot to bring you from Senate question time:

One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts asked Simon Birmingham for empirical 
evidence of climate change, as Birmo was representing the environment and 
energy minister in Senate question time.

He responded:


The Turnbull government accepts the science of climate change. We take our 
advice from the chief scientist, the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and the 
departments of the environment and energy as well as leading world science
