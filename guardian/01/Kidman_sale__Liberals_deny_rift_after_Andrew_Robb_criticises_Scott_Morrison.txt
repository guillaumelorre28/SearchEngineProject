Robb told Fairfax treasurer Scott Morrison’s call to not sell Australia’s 
largest private land owner to an overseas buyer on national interest grounds 
was “political”.

But Scott Ryan said on Saturday the story was “blown out of proportion”.

“Andrew’s made very clear that he has complete faith in Scott having made the 
decision in the national interest,” he told Sky News.

“He was observing on the sensitivities of foreign investment in agriculture 
which he knows require a degree of political consensus across the community.”

Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite said Robb was clearly “having a shot” at 
Morrison’s decision.

He suggested the “embarrassment” around the leasing of Darwin’s port to a 
Chinese company affected the treasurer’s judgment.
