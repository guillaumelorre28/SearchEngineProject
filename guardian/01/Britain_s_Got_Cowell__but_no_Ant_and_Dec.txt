Anticipation is building ahead of the launch of Britain's Got Talent on 
Thursday afternoon, where Simon Cowell will presumably be telling us exactly 
why the new judging panel, including David Walliams and Alesha Dixon, is the 
best ever. What chance he might also mention BBC1'sThe Voice – with which it 
will do battle in the Saturday night schedules – do you think? Alas the 
programme's presenters Ant and Dec will not be in attendance; apparently they 
are on holiday. Not like them to miss a programme launch,very possibly an 
unfortunate consequence of moving a show earlier in the schedules than 
previously planned
