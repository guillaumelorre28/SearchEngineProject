1. Oresteia
Almeida, London

Some may have thought that adapter and director Robert Icke was taking a 
sledgehammer to Aeschylus’s epic trilogy. No way. This revelatory and always 
enthralling evening was more delicate than that and painstakingly chiselled 
something new and utterly contemporary out of the ancient. Blowing away the 
cobwebs in decisive fashion, Icke’s brilliant staging of a 2,500-year-old 
tragedy made it sing. We knew these people squabbling around the dinner table, 
every single one of them.

How to do the right thing in a morally slippery world was the question at the 
heart of a production that, like so much of the best theatre this year, 
explored the nature of the stories that have been handed down to us. Women got 
a chance to take centre stage, and there was a prequel to the drama with a 
modern domestic setting that made it all the more heartbreaking. Never before 
has Agamemnon’s decision to sacrifice his own daughter been explored with such 
clarity, nor have the consequences of that act unravelled with such a careering 
sense of tragedy.

Played out against Hildegard Bechtler’s brilliant sliding door design, where 
what is revealed and what is hidden is under constant investigation, this was a 
production so artfully understated that, when the explosions of grief and rage 
came, they were all the more unbearable. There are scenes here I’ll never 
forget, from Angus Wright’s Agamemnon tenderly holding his daughter while she 
is clinically dispatched, to Lia Williams’s Klytemnestra, felled by grief like 
a tree in a storm. At times it felt as if we were watching bleached ghosts, 
doomed to restlessly repeat these tragic events over and over again.Read the

 ‘Worming inside your head’ … Simon McBurney. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the 
Guardian 
Lots of theatre claims to be immersive, but Simon McBurney delivered the real 
thing. A deceptively simple solo storytelling show about a photographer lost in 
the Amazon jungle, it used binaural technology and headphones to make it feel 
as if it was worming its way right inside your head. The show’s reliance on 
technology was contrasted with storytelling as an ancient form, in a work that 
fell somewhere between the unabashed intimacy of a bedtime story and the 
dislocating quality of a dream.Read the full review

for the Guardian 
All best-of-the-year lists are defined as much by what you haven’t managed to 
see as what you have. Ivo van Hove’s mighty dust-down of Arthur Miller’s play 
made a number of best-ofs last year, but although I came late to the party, the 
West End transfer didn’t disappoint. Mark Strong deservedly won awards for his 
performance as longshoreman Eddie Carbone, obsessed by his niece, while Van 
Hove’s bleached-bone aesthetic magnified the play and gave it the reverberant, 
universal quality of a Greek tragedy.Read the full review

 ‘Despairing beauty’ … Viktoria Vizin and Jack Farthing in Carmen Disruption at 
the Almeida. Photograph: Marc Brenner 
If I were picking a theatre of the year, it would undoubtedly be the Almeida, 
with one compelling show after another in Oresteia, Medea and then this radical 
reimagining of Bizet’s Carmen, in which Carmen is both a rent boy and a 
globetrotting opera singer who only feels real when she’s onstage. Messy, 
compelling and touched by a despairing, desperate beauty, Simon Stephens and 
Michael Longhurst’s production was a fruitful act of cultural vandalism that 
excavated our lonely, fractured lives and dared British theatre to think again 
about how it handles familiar stories.Read more

 Maxine Peake in The Skriker by Caryl Churchill. Photograph: Tristram Kenton 
for the Guardian 
Sarah Frankcom and Maxine Peake are shaping up as a significant collaborative 
partnership, and just how potent the two can be was demonstrated in this rare 
revival of Caryl Churchill’s wild and dark fairytale, which now looks like a 
prescient warning about environmental catastrophe. Lizzie Clachan’s 
extraordinary design transformed the Royal Exchange into a place that felt as 
if it was on the faultline between our world and something more magical and 
ancient. An evening that was weird, unsettling but also magnetic, with Peake 
utterly mesmerising as a shape-shifting malevolent fairy with a streak of 
vulnerability.Read the full review

Who says that theatre for the very young

me, and certainly not Theatre-Rites, who have been creating shows as good as 
anything made for adult audiences for more than 20 years. Designed for the very 
youngest members of the family, this gorgeous, inventive show delved with 
psychological acuity and playfulness into the disruptions wrought by the 
arrival of a new baby. The puppetry was terrific and it was a multilayered show 
with something to offer the under-fives but also parents and grandparents.Read

 ‘Utterly fascinating’ … Victor by Campo, starring the young Viktor Caudron and 
Steven Michel. Photograph: Phile Deprez 
What do we see when we gaze at a man and a teenage boy being physically close? 
The brilliance of this duet created by theatre-maker Peter Seynaeve and 
choreographer Jan Martens for the Belgian companyCampo <http://www.campo.nu/en> 
was that you never knew quite what you were witnessing. It’s a piece in which 
muscle and tenderness, maturity and innocence meet and melt into each other 
with mesmerising intimacy. Is it a father and son? A grown man meeting his 
childhood self, or the child confronting the man he will become? It’s the 
ambiguities that made this so endlessly unsettling and utterly fascinating.

 ‘Vibrant energy’ … Phil Dunster in Pink Mist at Bristol Old Vic. 
Sometimes a piece of theatre is so emotionally raw that it’s hard to endure. 
That was the case with Owen Sheers’s brawny dramatic poem about three raw army 
recruits who are sent to Afghanistan, and the mothers, wives and girlfriends 
they leave behind. The show began life on Radio 4, but you wouldn’t know it 
from John Retallack and George Mann’s spare production. Text, movement and 
sound came together with vibrant energy. This will deservedly be seen at 
Bristol Old Vic and London’s Bush theatre early next year.Read the full review

 ‘Good and bad girls’ … Imogen Sage and Tristan Sturrock in Rebecca. 
Photograph: Steve Tanner 
Emma Rice and Kneehigh went deep into the unconscious for the adaptation of 
Daphne du Maurier’s study in jealousy: a brilliant piece of popular theatre 
that worried away at the dreamy dark heart of the novel, but also took impish 
comic delight in the 1930s setting. On one hand, it was all smoky gothic 
romance, and on the other an investigation into good and bad girls, in which 
the second Mrs de Winter became a mouse who roars with real passion.Read the

 ‘Shimmering truth’ … Katie West in Lela & Co. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for 
the Guardian 
There are some stories that seem so overfamiliar that we have our ears and 
eyes wide shut to them. Lela’s brutal narrative of how she was sold into abuse, 
her body a battlefield over which men fought and bartered, could be one of 
those stories. But Cordelia Lynn’s text and Jude Christian’s production worked 
so slyly together, that even as the production plunged us into complete 
blackout, it made us see the truth shimmering in the darkness, and confront our 
own complicity.Read the full review
