Given that this is A Taste Of Honey's 5Oth anniversary, it's no surprise that 
this is the second production of Shelagh Delaney's play to appear this autumn. 
But whereas the first was in genteel Salisbury, this one brings this 
Salford-based story rather closer to home. About a girl named Jo who gets cast 
aside when her fly-by-night single mum, Helen, falls for a new man, Delaney's 
gritty, tell-it-as-it-is tale dealing with teenage pregnancy within a 
dysfunctional family was considered a shocker back when it was premiered by 
Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop company. The shock now is more in the fact 
that so few women playwrights have had their works produced on main stages in 
the intervening 50 years.Royal Exchange

directs this production featuring a live DJ soundtrack and starring Jodie McNee 
as Jo and former Coronation Street barmaid Sally Lindsay as her mum.
