The Sun has suffered its first fall in web traffic since moving to relax its 
paywall 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jul/08/the-sun-lowers-its-paywall-allowing-free-access-to-many-stories>
 as its site saw average daily visitors fall by 14% to 1.1 million in September.

News UK’s website, which decided to relax its paywall and resume official 
traffic measurement in July 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/17/sun-records-website-boost-relax-paywall>
, has now slipped back behind Express.co.uk which fell by just 0.03% month on 
month to 1.2 million average daily visitors.

The Sun <https://www.theguardian.com/media/sun> is likely to have been a 
victim of the annual slump that hits many national titles following the end of 
the traffic surge in August surrounding the football transfer window.

Worst hit were the Daily Star, which saw average daily visitors fall 35%, and 
Metro, which dropped 33.9%.

The Mirror saw daily traffic to its national websites fall by almost 9% to 
3,894,176.

“A month-on-month drop from August to September was expected at end of the 
football transfer window, which is always one of our busiest times,” said Pete 
Picton, editorial director for Mirror Online.

There was good news for The Guardian (up 11.28%) and the Independent (up 
10.32%), fuelled by interest in stories such as the discovery ofrunning water 
on Mars <https://www.theguardian.com/science/mars> and the super blood moon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/moon>.

“September’s record digital ABC figures mark another fantastic milestone for 
the Guardian,” said David Pemsel, chief executive of Guardian Media Group.
