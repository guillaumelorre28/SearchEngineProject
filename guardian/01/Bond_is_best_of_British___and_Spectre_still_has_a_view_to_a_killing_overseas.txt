The blockbuster

In 2012, Skyfall <https://www.theguardian.com/film/skyfall> was a gamechanger 
for Bond.No prior 007 film had taken more than $600m worldwide 
<http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=jamesbond.htm>; Skyfall took 
$1.1bn, the series’ dramatic credentials strengthened by director Sam Mendes 
and patriotic broodings in perfect left-hand counterpoint to Britain’s Olympics 
and the Queen’s diamond jubilee year. Mendes is still on deck for the followup 
Spectre, as is Daniel Craig. But the lack of real-world hookup this time leaves 
some doubt about whether it can match its predecessor’s record-breaking gross. 
The return of a certain nefarious crime syndicate, meanwhile, is not currently 
bringing Spectre the same critical unanimity enjoyed by Skyfall.


But we know Bond is never really in any danger. Having kicked off with an 
early, Monday release in the UK, its $63.8m seven-day take is a record here – 
beating Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban’s $42.9m. More promisingly for 
the franchise, the weekend take has just edged out Skyfall’s: $31.2m to $31m. 
Apart from a slight drop in the Netherlands, the five other debuting markets 
this weekend were all improvements, or on par: Finland (Sky: $1.4m; Spec: 
$2.6m), Norway (Sky: $2.8m; Spec: $2.8m), Denmark (Sky: $2.6m; Spec: $4.2m), 
Sweden (Sky: $2.8m; Spec: $2.9m).

 Spectre - video review 
Proper pontification on the reasons for Spectre’s success can wait until next 
week, when it will open in 45 more countries, and any progress or otherwise 
will be clearer. But, for now, it’s worth noting that the franchise has a 
surprising amount of potential for growth.

All through the Daniel Craig era and immediately before, the UK, Germany and 
France have consistently been Bond’s top three markets outside the US. 
Australia, Japan and, increasingly,China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> usually figure in the top five. But 
Bond’s sway in emerging territories is still uncertain; in recent memory, 
Mexico, Brazil and Russia have displayed $10-20m performances that are some way 
off what, for instance, Marvel’s biggest movies do in those places. Spectre’s 
bravura Mexico City sequence is surely a direct come-on to that country.

If it can shake and stir other historically non-plussed territories, continue 
to build in China (where it opens on 17 November) and keep a steady hand in its 
European heartlands, $1.1bn could be an underestimate.

 Steven Spielberg on Bridge of Spies 
Hollywood’s king of the castle, Steven Spielberg, has been in subdued mode for 
some time – since 2011’sThe Adventures of Tintin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/16/tintin-adventures-secret-of-unicorn>
. AfterWar Horse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/12/war-horse-spielberg-film-review> 
andLincoln <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/24/lincoln-review>, 
Bridge of Spies is his third consecutive drama, and seems to be flying further 
beneath the radar than the others.Subtly constructivist poster art 
<http://www.rotoscopers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BRIDGE-OF-SPIES-Poster-e1433542435366-677x400.jpg>
 – conveying Bridge of Spies’ cold war setting but hardly differentiating it 
from a zillion other thrillerish forays into Russkieland – has been very much 
the style of a low-key publicity campaign.

The US opening has passed with little fuss, though with $15.3m it was actually 
one of Spielberg’s strongest on the serious side of his ledger (only Lincoln, 
with $21m, has taken more). Falling in step with Lincoln, the film is a 
rallying cry to liberal American values – Tom Hanks’s lawyer lionising the 
right to fair trial. And indeed it is doing decently in the States, holding 
strongly with less than 30% falls in the last two weekends to a $45.2m total, 
putting the $40m film – one of Spielberg’s cheapest – well on the way to profit.


But Spielberg’s dramatic work has generally gone over better overseas, apart 
from (for obvious reasons) Lincoln. The two significant markets to open so far, 
Brazil and Australia, are down on the Daniel Day-Lewis film (fractionally so in 
the latter’s case), but there are plenty more major openings to come. A star of 
Hanks’s stature should buoy up Bridge of Spies’ international progress, though, 
apart from 2007’sCharlie Wilson’s War 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/11/drama.tomhanks>, he has little 
track record in more substantial material; he is more usually deployed as a 
middleweight anchor for more frivolous enterprises. Bridge of Spies will 
probably surpassMunich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/15/reel-history-spielberg-munich>, 
Spielberg’s other pure political thriller ($130.4m worldwide), and in terms of 
his other classier efforts has a shot at War Horse ($177.6m). Lincoln ($275.3m) 
andSchindler’s List 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,530821,00.html>
 ($321.3m) look too lofty.


The bomb squad

Two car-crash weekends at the US box office, and an awful lot of casualties: 
Our Brand Is Crisis, Burnt, Steve Jobs and, further back,Crimson Peak 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/14/crimson-peak-review-psychosexually-rich-soil-of-horror-guillermo-del-toro-mia-wasikowska>
 andThe Walk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/01/the-walk-review-imax-twin-towers-tightrope>
. What unites them is that they’re all mid-range budget-wise, somewhere between 
sub-$10m indie thrift and $100m-plus blockbuster swank. So it’s tempting to 
read the last few weeks as the culmination of industry trends of the last few 
years: the death of the mid-range, adult-focused film in the face of coarsening 
fiscal influences dictating that studios these days place their bets either 
very high or very low. But what aboutFifty Shades of Grey

 Crimson Peak - video review 
If there’s anything to conclude, it’s that the hits don’t rely on star power – 
a diminished force these days – to dig them out of a hole. Even the ones with 
stars (Black Mass, American Sniper) were already innately genre-focused, as 
opposed to the comedy-drama pootling favoured by Our Brand Is Crisis and Burnt. 
Those two films aren’t biopics, but they share the insidery, involuted 
interests of Steve Jobs; the biopics in the “hit” camp (Compton, Black Mass, 
The Imitation Game and American Sniper) are all much beefier, externalised 
affairs playing obviously to mass audiences, with even The Imitation Game 
trying its hardest to be an espionage thriller. Clearly, mid-range can still 
work in the right circumstances.

Recent films also seem to have made accidents of positioning and timing. The 
highly praised Steve Jobs lacks The Social Network’s dynamite marketing 
presence, so looks like just another biopic cash-in. The Walk’s 3D flair seems 
to have paled, because of a lesser publicity spend, beside The Martian’s and
Everest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/17/everest-review-jake-gyllenhaal>
’s. Crimson Peak is a conundrum yet to be solved.

Beyond Hollywood 

Chinese crime thriller The Witness 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icsBgAOdIDE> burst into the global chart in 
fifth place with a handy $18.7m. Director Ahn Sang-hoon’s remake ofhis own 2011 
film <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_%282011_film%29> about a blinded 
police cadet on the trail of a murderer, it’s added some local celebrity heft 
in the shape of Yang Mi, from the high-riding Tiny Times franchise, and K-pop 
singer Lu Han.

Lower down, in 15th position, China’s Hot Tub Time Machine, Goodbye Mr Loser 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwx31XWno54>, is now up to $219.2m and 
indisputably the country’s outsider hit of the year. Lost in Hong Kong, the 
country’s locked-down comedy blockbuster, looks after its record-breaking debut 
to be winding up with around $260m - impressive, but nowhere near enough to 
challenge the domestic champion for 2015, Monster Hunt ($381.8m).

The future

Away from Spectre, the first Charlie Brown film in 35 years, The Peanuts Movie 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVR4E6Q6u5g>, gets a simultaneous US-Chinese 
release, as well as heading out in eight more, mostly eastern European 
territories. The trailers are casting this down the line in US smalltown teen 
coming-of-age territory, withDJ Khaled 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGXzlRoNtHU> screaming “contemporary” on the 
soundtrack. So we’ll see if Fox and animation studio Blue Sky (Ice Age; Rio) 
can handle a delicate balancing act that can not only coax Charles Schultz’s 
poised in-profile line art into 3D CGI, but also preserve his tiny ironies from 
a steamrollering in the name of developing “the brand”.

Let’s hope they’ve seen what StudioCanal did with Paddington – though, with a 
$100m budget, there’s considerably more pressure on here.
