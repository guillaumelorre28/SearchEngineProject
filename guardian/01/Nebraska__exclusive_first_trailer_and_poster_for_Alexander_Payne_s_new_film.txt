Alexander Payne's fifth feature is one of two black-and-white road trips made 
by veteran American indie directors feted at Cannes this year. While Inside 
Llewyn Davis had the Coens riffing on the New York 60s folk scene,Nebraska 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/nebraska> is the tale of a father, played by 
Bruce Dern, who takes his estranged son (Will Forte) along for the ride when he 
travels cross country to pick up his lottery winnings.

The film took best actor for Dern in Cannes, and marked a return to the 
lower-fi for Payne, who won an Oscar for The Descendants in 2011, his family 
drama starring George Clooney.

At Cannes, Peter Bradshaw praised  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155224/nebraska>the film's script, 
performances and cinematography - "almost Amish austerity in monochrome, which 
gives a wintry, end-of-the-world drear to that homely roadside Americana that 
Payne loves to pick out with his camera".

Andrew Pulver interviewed Payne and Dern

, andXan Brooks chimed in with the praise too

. So we're excited ahead of the film's premiere at the London film festival, 
before nationwide release on 6 December.

Hence our launching this exclusive trailer and poster … both of which we're 
really liking. What do you make of them?
