MAN OF THE DAY

Paolo Di Canio: kept himself in the headlines with some textbook early-season 
referee goading. "I told the ref to complete a perfect job and send me off. So 
he did."

MEME OF THE DAY

Ashley Young as Tom Daley kept Twitter busy. Young's yellow card for diving – 
his third in the top-flight – followed last year's much-quoted pledge: "I'm not 
a cheat, I'm not a diver. I play football fairly."

BREAKTHROUGH OF THE DAY

West Brom: managed their first league goal in what was the 360th minute of 
their season so far. It relieved them of a statistical burden: up to then they 
were the only team in the top five European leagues still to net.

GAFFE OF THE DAY

Tranmere hit a dramatic 90th-minute equaliser to make it 3-3 at home to 
Brentford, and congratulated themselves on a salvage job well done. Then they 
gave away a penalty and lost 4-3.

GOAL OF THE DAY

Kevin Lisbie scored in the 88th minute to keep Leyton Orient on course for an 
invincible season: their win over Port Vale making it six wins in six as their 
best start in 131 years roars on.

CAMEO OF THE DAY

Amy Fearn – ran the line at Molineux, then took up the whistle for the last 60 
seconds after the referee limped off.

FALSE DAWN OF THE DAY

Beleaguered Millwall manager Steve Lomas went into their home game against 
Derby tipping it as a turning point: "We're heading in the right direction. 
We're at home, and we're up for it." They lost 5-1.
