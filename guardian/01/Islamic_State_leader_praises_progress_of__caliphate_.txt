Islamic State has released a new message purportedly from its reclusive 
leader, claiming his self-styledcaliphate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/30/isis-caliphate-revival> is doing 
well despite an unprecedented alliance against it.

In the 24-minute audio posted Saturday, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi> says airstrikes by the 
international coalition only increase Isis’s determination and resolve. He also 
mocks a recently announced Saudi-led Islamic alliance against terrorism and 
warns Israel “we are getting closer to you every day”. He says Israeli Jews 
“will hide behind trees and stones” from Isis.

Al-Baghdadi urges Muslims worldwide to join the fight, saying it is their 
Islamic duty to rise up everywhere.

The authenticity of the audio could not be independently confirmed, but it was 
posted on Isis-affiliated websites and Twitter – as have previous messages from 
the group.
