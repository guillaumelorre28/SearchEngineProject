A week-long strike by Air France <https://www.theguardian.com/world/france> 
flight crews that starts on Wednesday will see the carrier scrap 30% of 
domestic and medium-haul flights at the height of the busy holiday period, the 
carrier has said.

About 35% of flight attendants, who account for 13,600 of Air France’s 
workforce of 50,000, are expected to join a stoppage which the airline said 
would affect 10% of long-haul flights.

Unions representing about half of the strikers said last Friday the stoppage 
would go ahead after lengthy talks failed to bring a breakthrough on renewing a 
collective labour accord on rules, pay and promotions which expires in October.
