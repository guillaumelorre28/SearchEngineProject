Dundee United's Europa League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league> play-off, second-leg 
tie against AEK Athens will take place in Greece tomorrow night, and Uefa are 
due to issue confirmation of exactly where the game will be held later this 
afternoon.

The buildup to the game has been farcical, and it was suggested this morning 
that AEK could even be kicked out of the competition. Their home ground, the 
Olympic Stadium in Athens, was deemed unsuitable for the match on Monday after 
a problem with sprinklers.

The Greek side then attempted to move the tie to the home of their local 
rivals Panionios but supporters of that team broke the goalposts and ripped up 
the turf last night in an apparent attempt to scupper AEK's plans. AEK were 
handed a deadline of 2pm today (British time) either to find another ground 
with adequate security guarantees, or repair the damage caused by the vandalism.

Uefa confirmed this deadline has been met and that tomorrow's game will go 
ahead, with the home of Olympiakos now the favourite to host the visit of the 
Scottish team. It may yet be the case, though, that no AEK supporters will be 
allowed entry to the ground, which would potentially bring its own security 
problems.

United, who trail 1-0 from the first leg last week, are taking around 600 fans 
to Greece. The club have already said they will make an official complaint to 
Uefa about the disruption surrounding the choice of stadium.
