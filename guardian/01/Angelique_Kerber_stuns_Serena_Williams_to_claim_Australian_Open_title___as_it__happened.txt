And some final thoughts from me. An extraordinary performance from Kerber, a 
popular first-time grand slam champion, who got off to such a strong start and 
refused to be intimidated by the world No1 even when the match moved to its 
climax. Yes, Williams’s play was patchy, her serve was off and her tactic to 
come to the net didn’t work, but Kerber took full advantage and remained 
consistent throughout, showing tremendous defence and pulling off some stunning 
passing shots. Perhaps Kerber’s win can serve as inspiration for Andy Murray 
tomorrow against Novak Djokovic. Do join us then for live coverage; in the 
meantime I’ll leave you withKevin Mitchell’s match report from Melbourne

Trophy time. Williams comes up first to collect the runners-up plate, and 
manages to keep a smile on her face throughout her speech:

Thank you for tonight guys, it was a great match. Angie congratulations, you 
did do well, you really deserved it, I really hope you enjoy this moment. I 
would like to thank my team and of course the crowd. I really enjoyed myself 
this whole time so thank you very much.

Then comes the champion, as Kerber holds aloft the Daphne Akhurst Memorial 
Cup. She can barely breathe when she comes to speak:

Serena, you are an inspiration, an unbelievable great person, so congrats for 
everything you did already. In the first round I was match point down so I was 
already one leg on the plane to Germany. I got a second chance and I take my 
chance. To win it, my dream came true tonight. My whole life I was working 
really hard, now I’m here and I can say I’m a grand slam champion. I have the 
best family, the best team in the world. I really enjoy this moment. Thank you 
so much. The best two weeks of my life, my career. I had goosebumps when I was 
playing. See you next year.

Apparently Kerber said she’d jump in the Yarra River a la Jim Courier if she 
won the title. She’s already welling up though as she finishes her speech and 
holds court on Rod Laver with the trophy.

Wow. That was only Williams’s fifth defeat in a grand slam final. She’d won 21 
out of 25 before today. It’s the first time she’s lost the final set in a major 
final. Kerber had never even been in a grand slam final before today. Kerber 
has confounded the stats by playing the match of her life on the biggest stage 
of her life.

Gracious from Williams, who comes straight over to Kerber’s side of the court 
to congratulate the victor. The pair embrace, Williams has some warm words for 
the German, who then resumes her celebrations by going to her players’ box. 
Williams can’t watch as she sits slumped in her chair. It was Roberta Vinci who 
ended Williams’s hopes of matching Graf’s grand slam record at the US Open; now 
it’s Kerber who has put history on hold in Australia.Unglaublich. I’m sure a 
certain German is watching in Las Vegas with a smile on her face.

Kerber wins the Australian Open title 6-4, 3-6, 6-4!

Kerber’s face has the expression of a woman who thinks her moment has passed. 
She needs to shake that off, because if she were to win this game, she would 
still be the Australian Open champion. She manages to quickly get herself out 
of the funk by taking the first point. And the second! 0-30. Williams opts for 
her go-to serve down the T. Ace. 15-30. Williams goes for a rocket of a serve 
out wide but misses. The second serve lands in, the pair engage in a lengthy 
duel from the back of the court, Kerber, perhaps waiting for Williams to miss 
rather than going for a winner herself, retreats well beyond the baseline and 
is eventually beaten. 30-all. Will it be game point or will it be match point? 
Game point, when Williams sets the point up with a gutsy forehand down the line 
and then goes t’other way for the winner. 40-30. Now Kerber is behind in the 
game, she finds it within herself to attack. Deuce. Kerber goes toe-to-toe with 
Williams in a breathtaking cross-court exchange and brings up championship 
point! Williams comes to the net but inexplicably misses the volley which loops 
long! I can’t believe I’m writing this butAngelique Kerber is the Australian 
Open champion! Yes, Angelique Kerber is theAustralian Open

Third set: *Williams 4-6, 6-3, 4-5 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Kerber held to love when she served out the first set. That’s not going to 
happen here. Williams forges 0-15 ahead. How heavy must Kerber’s racket be 
feeling now? Serving for a first grand slam title at the age of 28 having never 
even been in a major final before. It probably weighs about 500kg. Make that 
750kg as Williams gets to 0-30. Kerber comes back to 15-30 but Williams is 
undeterred.15-40, two break-back points. Williams’s return clips and net and 
trickles back on to her side of the court! 30-40. The match clock ticks to 
exactly two hours as Williams breaks! What guts and determination.

Third set: Williams 4-6, 6-3, 3-5 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

So after an hour and 53 minutes Williams must hold serve to stay in the final. 
The most inauspicious of starts at Williams double faults. 0-15. Williams sends 
another serve into the net on the next point but lands her second, a lengthy 
rally plays out, Williams bides her time, before putting away the winner. 
15-all. Williams crashes away a smash to get to 30-15. Williams is staying back 
here, not coming into the net like she has for much of the match, perhaps she’s 
wisened up to Kerber and doesn’t want to be passed. But Kerber wins the 
baseline exchange, 30-all. What a big point this is. Williams’s serve comes to 
her rescue, 40-30. Game. Williams has forced Kerber to serve this out.

Third set: *Williams 4-6, 6-3, 2-5 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Often Williams, when broken, is at her most dangerous. But Kerber is refusing 
to be intimidated. The German moves 30-0 ahead, make that 40-0. Make that game 
as Williams sends a wayward shot wide. A love game to back up the break and 
Kerber is only a game away from stunning Serena Williams and winning the
Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> title!

Third set: Williams 4-6, 6-3, 2-4 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

A late and loose shot from Williams, 0-15. A cross-court rally ensues before 
Williams decides to mix things up by going down the line. 15-all. Williams 
thinks she’s hit an ace to get to 30-all but misses by a fraction. And then it’s
15-40, two break points! Williams is in command as Kerber scrambles left and 
right and left and right and left and right – the longest rally of the final at 
19 strokes – the crowd are oooohing and aaaaahing and finally Williams deals 
the killer blow. 30-40. Ace, deuce. Williams hasn’t been able to rely on her 
serve in this match but it got her out of a hole there. Deuce.

But Williams finds herself in another one when Kerber comes up with a forehand 
pass. Williams just isn’t winning enough points at the net.Another break point, 
advantage Kerber. Williams’s backhand looks like it may whistle just wide but 
it lands in for a winner. Deuce No2. Advantage Williams. A feathery drop-shot 
from Kerber, deuce No3. This game has been going for nearly eight minutes now. 
Could it be decisive? Perhaps, as a fourth double fault from Williams of the 
day brings up afourth break point of the game. Kerber, uncharacteristically, 
looks hesitant, and backs off a few feet beyond the baseline before netting. 
Deuce No4. Advantage Williams. Another Kerber drop-shot! It’s deuce No5. 
Another Williams double fault!Break point No5. Williams unleashes some bombs 
from the back of the court but then self implodes as she goes long!Kerber has 
the break!

Third set: *Williams 4-6, 6-3, 2-3 Kerber (*denotes next server)

A wonderful winner from Williams on the third point, which brings up 15-30. 
Another beautiful strike and it’s 30-all. If she can do this consistently in 
this set surely the title will be hers. But then she’s all at sea on the next 
point. It’s so hit and miss today. 40-30. And Kerber holds to regain the 
advantage.

Third set: Williams 4-6, 6-3, 2-2 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

Kerber pulls off a passing shot to get to 0-15. Williams, one minute looking 
so calm, the next so exasperated, hauls herself to 15-all and then unleashes 
one of her biggest “COME ONNNNNNNNNNNNNNS” of the day. I think she made herself 
a little hoarse there because the “COME ON” that follows the next point is a 
little squeaky. So, 30-15. A backhand winner deep to Kerber’s backhand wing 
makes it 40-15. And it’s soon game.

Third set: *Williams 4-6, 6-3, 1-2 Kerber (*denotes next server)

A wounded Williams gets to 0-30. And then 15-40. Two break-back points. 
Perhaps that break almost came too soon in the set for Kerber. Williams goes 
for too much on the first break point, and flashes high and wide. 30-40. A 
second-serve chance for Williams on the second break point, there’s nowhere 
near enough on it from Kerber, giving Williams the chance to tee up the 
cross-court backhand. Kerber isn’t getting that back into play. We’re back on 
serve.

Third set: Williams 4-6, 6-3, 0-2 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

Williams has never lost the third set in a grand slam final. But she’s in 
danger of going a break down in this one. 0-30. Kerber is scrambling around all 
over the shop, moving back and forth and this way and thataway as she 
withstands the Williams assault and then somehow pulls off a winner! Even 
Williams applauds while simultaneously wincing.0-40, three break points. Kerber 
sets the point up with a strong backhand, Williams gets it back but Kerber 
sends another backhand down the line – this one a winner – and Kerber breaks! 
That’s eight out of nine points in this set.
 Serena Williams reacts as she struggles at the beginning of the final set.

Third set: *Williams 4-6, 6-3, 0-1 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Both players are back on court after a quick break, and Kerber opens play in 
this decider. I’m sure the German will be pleased she’s serving first, given 
the way she’s been serving today. She rattles off a quick first point, and a 
speedy second too. 30-0. An ace out wide – the German has displayed such 
variety on serve today – and it’s 40-0. The pair go at each other cross-court, 
Williams on her forehand, Kerber on her backhand, before they switch positions 
and Williams’s backhand trades blows with Kerber’s forehand. Williams takes the 
point but doesn’t win the wider war as Kerber calmly takes the game by 
threading a forehand down the line with Williams stranded at the net.

So who do you have in this final set? Of course Williams is the favourite from 
here on in, but can she ignore the weight of history on her racket to get over 
the line? Kerber has showed enough about her in this final to suggest if 
Williams wobbles, she will take advantage.

Williams wins the second set 6-3!

At 15-all, Williams flashes an ace down the T. She’s now level in the ace 
charts, 3-3. And she’s ahead in the game; 30-15. Which soon becomes40-15. Two 
set points. Williams again goes down the middle on the serve but it skids long. 
She makes the second serve, is pushing and probing from the back of the court, 
and Kerber nets! This final is going to a deciding set ...
Patrick McEnroe (@PatrickMcEnroe) 
2nd set Serena 16 winners 5 unforced. 

And there you have it.

Second set: *Williams 4-6, 5-3 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Kerber falls 0-30 down. Williams would surely like to break here, not only to 
finish this set but because it would mean she’d be serving first in the 
deciding set. But Kerber rattles off four points on the spin and Williams will 
have to serve this out.

Second set: Williams 4-6, 5-2 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

Williams holds to 30, finishing things off with a volley which she just about 
manages to skew over the net and into the service box for a winner. The crowd 
gasp. They’ve been fairly balanced in their support for both players, by the 
way. I’m sure they’d like to see Williams equal some history but Kerber is 
getting plenty of backing as the underdog. Kerber must hold serve to stay in 
this set.

Second set: *Williams 4-6, 4-2 Kerber (*denotes next server)

The movement from Williams appears more assured, the racket is moving more 
fluently, and she takes the first point of the game to move 0-15 ahead. Kerber 
then nudges 30-15 up with the help of Hawk-Eye. Williams comes back to 30-all. 
Kerber responds to get to 40-30. And the seventh seed takes the game with a 
piercing backhand down the line. Cue a celebratory fist pump and “COME ON!” (or 
“KOMM SCHON!”).

Second set: Williams 4-6, 4-1 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

The answer would appear to be no when Williams slips 0-30 down. But a first 
ace of the day for Williams helps her recover to 40-30. She then whistles away 
a forehand winner to bring up the game. The break is consolidated. Is she 
starting to make her move?

Second set: *Williams 4-6, 3-1 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Kerber’s first loose service game: two double faults and an error and it’s 
0-40, three break points. Kerber opens the court out in some style, before 
planting the winner. 15-40, but there are still another two break points to 
come. Williams gets it all wrong and it’s 30-40. Two down, one to go. Kerber 
misses her first serve, she slides a weak second serve to Williams’s backhand, 
Kerber does well to get it back and return to almost level terms in the point, 
but Williams prevails. She has the break but that was as much to do with a drop 
in her opponent’s play as it was with anything she did; can Williams find some 
consistency and take the initiative?

Second set: Williams 4-6, 2-1 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

From 30-all, Williams holds. But it’s not straightforward. At least her 
forehand shows up to give her the game.

Second set: *Williams 4-6, 1-1 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Much credit must go to Kerber for her consistency and the way in which she is 
chasing everything down. But as is almost always the case in Williams’s 
matches, this is still on the world No1’s racket. You feel Williams, with her 
erratic forehand and fumbling footwork, is playing not only Kerber but also 
history and that Graf record. Kerber holds, sending down her second ace of the 
day in the process. And here’s a surprising stat: the ace count currently reads 
2-0 in Kerber’s favour. Williams, the best server in the women’s game, isn’t 
even on the board.

Kerber wins the first set 6-4!

Williams, her feet planted too firmly in the ground, slips 15-0 down. Some 
tremendous defence from Kerber, Williams is at the net, but the world No1 can’t 
dig the ball out from the ground. 30-0. Kerber is potentially two points away 
from a one-set lead. Make that one point away because it’s 40-0. Williams looks 
to have the initiative on set point when Kerber throws in a short ball, but 
Kerber again scrambles so well to get back into the rally, and eventually 
Williams prods into the net! Well, well. Kerber moves a set ahead and it’s the 
first Williams has dropped in this tournament!

First set: Williams 4-5 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

Another drive volley chance for Williams and another miss. She’s almost trying 
too hard, forcing the issue, rather than playing instinctively. An angry 
Williams batters the ball away for a winner to level at 15-all. Williams is now 
roaring herself on during the points, screaming after unleashing her shots, and 
Kerber is looking at the umpire as if to say: “is this legal?” Williams, 
remember, did get penalised during her 2011 US Open final defeat to Sam Stosur 
for celebrating before a point had finished. Williams holds to 30. Kerber will 
serve for the first set.

First set: *Williams 3-5 Kerber (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Williams misses another gimme down the line on the forehand side. 
At the moment the pressure of attempting to equal Steffi Graf’s Open era record 
of 22 grand slam titles seems to be telling more on Williams than the pressure 
of appearing in a first major final is on Kerber. Has Williams started having 
flashbacks of the Roberta Vinci US Open match yet? Her mother, Oracene, winces 
in the stands as Kerber consolidates the break to force Williams to serve to 
stay in this set.

First set: Williams 3-4 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

While I was perusing Twitter, Williams goes from a position of relative 
comfort to break point down. Gah! I’m not entirely sure how that happened, but 
having looked more at ease in that previous game, she seems a little edgy 
again, and her footwork lets her down. 30-40. Williams drills long on the drive 
volley – what a miss – and Kerber once again nudges a break ahead!

Unless Serena blasts a return winner, of course. 3-3, back on serve. #AusOpen

First set: *Williams 3-3 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Kerber’s slider second serve is not much of a weapon. You feel if Williams 
gets enough opportunities on that she can cause some damage. But the forehand 
isn’t quite firing yet. Then just to disprove my point, Williams wallops a 
forehand winner. Thanks Serena. 30-all. She has a chance to bring up break 
point, the ball drops short and Williams looks almost certain to put away the 
forehand winner, but she nets. Her family and coach groan in the stands. A 
terrific point at deuce, the pair go at each other from the back of the court 
and then Kerber blinks first.Advantage Williams, her first break point of this 
final. She treats a second serve with absolute disdain and thumps away a winner 
down the line. There’s the break back and there’s another fist pump and “COME 
ON!!!!!!” Williams looks to be in business.

First set: Williams 2-3 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

Two points into Williams’s service game and there’s already a sniff of another 
break at 0-30. Williams lets out some frustration by punishing the short ball 
and screaming her first “COME ON” of the proceedings. She wins the next point 
and roars another “COME ON” for good measure. 30-all. And there’s a third 
successive point for Williams and a third successive “COME ON”. Williams, so 
quiet for the first few games, is fired up. But then perhaps she lets the 
adrenaline get the better of her as she miscues. Deuce. Williams then 
bamboozles Kerber with a well-disguised drop-shot. Kerber didn’t even move. 
Advantage Williams. Game. The world No1 keeps her arrears to the single break.

First set: *Williams 1-3 Kerber (*denotes next server)

So what response from Williams? She dispatches a lethal cross-court forehand 
to get to 15-all. But from the sublime to the ridiculous as she gets her 
footwork all wrong and loops long. 30-15 to Kerber. Williams slaps into the net 
and Kerber has two game points. Williams takes aim at a toothless second serve 
and pierces Kerber with a return winner down the line. 40-30. Williams gets a 
reprieve in the following point when her shot clips the net and trickles over, 
but Kerber chases it down before sending down a smash. The break is 
consolidated. You wouldn’t know this is Kerber’s first grand slam final.

First set: Williams 1-2 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Kerber whistles a backhand cross-court winner past Williams with a 
nonchalant flick of the wrist. Even Williams applauds. 15-30. And look here, 
it’s15-40. The first break points go to Kerber. What can she do? The pair trade 
blows from the back of the court, and then Williams goes a fraction long! 
There’s the first break of the final and it’s not gone to Williams. Game on.

First set: *Williams 1-1 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Kerber takes the first point of the game and her first of the match. The crowd 
breathe a sigh of relief. But Williams, prowling inside the baseline on the 
second serve, is already looking dangerous on the return. 15-30. Williams then 
bludgeons a backhand well into the tramlines and Kerber sends down a first ace; 
it wasn’t the fastest but Williams got nowhere near it. 40-30 then turns into 
game. Composed from Kerber; she’ll be happy with that service start.

First set: Williams 1-0 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

So here comes Serena. She looks less than assured as she steps up to the plate 
to serve, dropping the ball and having to chase after it, but it’s all a front. 
Williams sends a strong serve out wide which gives her the initiative in the 
point; she then comes into the net to finish things off. 15-0, make that 30-0. 
Which turns into 40-0 when Kerber clonks long after a baseline rally. An 
unreturned serve from Williams and that’s the game.

A pre-match email. “Morning Katy,” chirps Simon McMahon. “As someone once 
said, now is not the time for sound bites, but I feel the hand of history on 
our shoulder. There’s no way Serena will not win today. Is there?”

Tik, tok, tikity, tok, the players are warming up, Williams once again wearing 
bright yellow, Kerber clad in a coral/red number. Kerber won the toss and has 
opted to receive. A sign of nerves on the German’s part that she doesn’t want 
to serve? It’s a fairly breezy evening in Melbourne, so that could make 
Williams’s serve slightly less of a weapon than usual. There again, Williams 
could probably play in a hurricane and still blow her opponent off court.

And here come the players, waiting patiently outside the locker room before 
navigating their way through the bowels of the Rod Laver Arena. Kerber, head 
bowed, walks a few steps ahead of Williams before being announced to the 
capacity crowd. Then comes Williams. Not sure who edged the cheers there; it 
was fairly even I’d say.

 Williams says:

I would say this is probably the best slam I’ve played in a year, and I’ve won 
a lot in a year. I know my practices are better. Hopefully I’m playing better. 
So I definitely can play more consistent and more mentally stable, so to say.

I’m the favourite. I was the favourite in New York. I feel like I could have 
done better in New York but that was a learning experience. So I’m going to 
hopefully take that to the court for not only this tournament but for the rest 
of these slams.

I thought [Kerber] played unbelievable in that match [in Cincinnati in 2012]. 
That’s something that I’ll never forget. I just remember her serving really 
well, her moving well, her being determined to win that. I think from then on 
out I’ve been really focused that she’s someone that I, and everyone, really 
has to take very seriously.

Kerber says:

I have actually nothing to lose. I can go out there and try to play like I’m 
playing, without pressure, without nothing. I think when you ask a lot of 
people, I think most will say: ‘OK, Serena will win.’ But this is the challenge 
I can take.

I don’t have so much pressure like she has. I know I can lose the match. 
That’s why I’m going out there to try to win it.

 I think I grow in the last few years to be a top-10 player. Now I’m back in 
the top five [off the back of her run in Melbourne]. I think I showed everybody 
that I deserve it. That’s a good feeling.

Preamble

Hello and welcome to coverage of the Australian Open women’s final between 
Serena Williams and Johanna Konta  sorry Angelique Kerber.

Williams, devastated after falling two wins short of a calendar grand slam at 
last September’s US Open, did not raise a racket in anger for the rest of the 
year. Speculation was swirling about a loss of motivation and chronic knee 
problems, and those concerns continued earlier this month when she failed to 
finish a match at the Hopman Cup. Some posed the question: was it asking too 
much of the 34-year-old to regain the incredible intensity she showed for most 
of 2015 for another assault on the slams in 2016?

More fool those doubters. While Williams has watched inconsistency take grip 
of the women’s game below her this fortnight, natural order appears to have 
been restored at the top. After a slightly tentative start in the first round, 
the world No1 has got stronger and stronger. She is yet to drop a set and 
dismissed Maria Sharapova and Agnieszka Radwanska in the quarter and 
semi-finals respectively for the loss of only nine games in total, saying after 
the Radwanska match that she is playing even better than she did last season. 
Win today and she’ll draw level with Steffi Graf’s Open era record of 22 grand 
slam titles; no doubt victory would also reopen the debate about the 
possibility of a calendar slam. From the devastation of the US Open to possible 
domination in Australia and beyond. What a difference four months makes.

So what of Kerber? Seeded seventh, Konta’s semi-final conqueror is appearing 
in her first grand slam final at the age of 28, reward for a consistent career 
that has seen her be a regular in the world’s top 10 over the past five years. 
The left-hander is a solid baseliner, who has beaten Williams only once in six 
previous meetings – a 6-4, 6-4 upset in Cincinnati in 2012. Kerber saw off the 
much-fancied Victoria Azarenka in the quarter-finals before victory over Konta, 
which drew a congratulatory text from her childhood idol and occasional mentor 
Graf. No doubt Graf will be hoping her fellow German can do her a favour today 
by ensuring her grand slam haul remains unequalled.

The players are due on court at: 8.30am GMT, 7.30pm in Melbourne. Don’t be 
late, wherever you are.

Katy will be with you shortly. Whilst you wait, have a read of Simon Cambers’ 
preview, asSerena Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> 
aims for her 22nd grand slam, and Angelique Kerber goes after her first major 
title.

It was while she was discussing the achievement of reaching her first grand 
slam final that Angelique Kerber pulled out her phone to check her messages. 
Among them was a text from Steffi Graf, congratulating her on her effort and 
wishing her luck for Saturday’s Australian Open final againstSerena Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams>. On all available evidence, 
she will need more than luck.

Whether Graf offered her advice on how she might do it, Kerber did not say, 
but receiving any message from her idol will at least fill the 28-year-old with 
confidence, even if the odds are very much against her. Kerber turned to Graf 
last March when her confidence had dipped. A reminder from the former world No1 
that she was a good player and doing the right things put her back on track and 
she is now firmly established back in the top 10.

Should Kerber somehow pull off a massive upset, it will keep Graf one ahead of 
Williams in the all-time list of grand slam singles winners, with 22 to 21. 
Beating Williams will surely require something extra special. After a few 
months off at the end of last year, the American has breezed through the 
tournament without dropping a set, with onlyItaly’s Camila Giorgi, in round 
one, taking more than four games in a set 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/18/serena-williams-australian-open-knee-injury-camila-giorgi>
. Kerber has beaten her once, in Cincinnati in 2012, but has not won a set in 
their five other meetings. Throw in the fact that it is her first grand slam 
final and the inevitable nerves and the scale of her task is clear.

Graf provides inspiration for Kerber and a target for Williams in Australian 
Open final

And some final thoughts from me. An extraordinary performance from Kerber, a 
popular first-time grand slam champion, who got off to such a strong start and 
refused to be intimidated by the world No1 even when the match moved to its 
climax. Yes, Williams’s play was patchy, her serve was off and her tactic to 
come to the net didn’t work, but Kerber took full advantage and remained 
consistent throughout, showing tremendous defence and pulling off some stunning 
passing shots. Perhaps Kerber’s win can serve as inspiration for Andy Murray 
tomorrow against Novak Djokovic. Do join us then for live coverage; in the 
meantime I’ll leave you withKevin Mitchell’s match report from Melbourne

getting under way. Thanks for reading. Bye!

Trophy time. Williams comes up first to collect the runners-up plate, and 
manages to keep a smile on her face throughout her speech:

Thank you for tonight guys, it was a great match. Angie congratulations, you 
did do well, you really deserved it, I really hope you enjoy this moment. I 
would like to thank my team and of course the crowd. I really enjoyed myself 
this whole time so thank you very much.

Then comes the champion, as Kerber holds aloft the Daphne Akhurst Memorial 
Cup. She can barely breathe when she comes to speak:

Serena, you are an inspiration, an unbelievable great person, so congrats for 
everything you did already. In the first round I was match point down so I was 
already one leg on the plane to Germany. I got a second chance and I take my 
chance. To win it, my dream came true tonight. My whole life I was working 
really hard, now I’m here and I can say I’m a grand slam champion. I have the 
best family, the best team in the world. I really enjoy this moment. Thank you 
so much. The best two weeks of my life, my career. I had goosebumps when I was 
playing. See you next year.

Apparently Kerber said she’d jump in the Yarra River a la Jim Courier if she 
won the title. She’s already welling up though as she finishes her speech and 
holds court on Rod Laver with the trophy.
 
Wow. That was only Williams’s fifth defeat in a grand slam final. She’d won 21 
out of 25 before today. It’s the first time she’s lost the final set in a major 
final. Kerber had never even been in a grand slam final before today. Kerber 
has confounded the stats by playing the match of her life on the biggest stage 
of her life.
 
Gracious from Williams, who comes straight over to Kerber’s side of the court 
to congratulate the victor. The pair embrace, Williams has some warm words for 
the German, who then resumes her celebrations by going to her players’ box. 
Williams can’t watch as she sits slumped in her chair. It was Roberta Vinci who 
ended Williams’s hopes of matching Graf’s grand slam record at the US Open; now 
it’s Kerber who has put history on hold in Australia.Unglaublich. I’m sure a 
certain German is watching in Las Vegas with a smile on her face.

Kerber’s face has the expression of a woman who thinks her moment has passed. 
She needs to shake that off, because if she were to win this game, she would 
still be the Australian Open champion. She manages to quickly get herself out 
of the funk by taking the first point. And the second! 0-30. Williams opts for 
her go-to serve down the T. Ace. 15-30. Williams goes for a rocket of a serve 
out wide but misses. The second serve lands in, the pair engage in a lengthy 
duel from the back of the court, Kerber, perhaps waiting for Williams to miss 
rather than going for a winner herself, retreats well beyond the baseline and 
is eventually beaten. 30-all. Will it be game point or will it be match point? 
Game point, when Williams sets the point up with a gutsy forehand down the line 
and then goes t’other way for the winner. 40-30. Now Kerber is behind in the 
game, she finds it within herself to attack. Deuce. Kerber goes toe-to-toe with 
Williams in a breathtaking cross-court exchange and brings up championship 
point! Williams comes to the net but inexplicably misses the volley which loops 
long! I can’t believe I’m writing this butAngelique Kerber is the Australian 
Open champion! Yes, Angelique Kerber is theAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> champion!

Third set: *Williams 4-6, 6-3, 4-5 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Kerber held to love when she served out the first set. That’s not going to 
happen here. Williams forges 0-15 ahead. How heavy must Kerber’s racket be 
feeling now? Serving for a first grand slam title at the age of 28 having never 
even been in a major final before. It probably weighs about 500kg. Make that 
750kg as Williams gets to 0-30. Kerber comes back to 15-30 but Williams is 
undeterred.15-40, two break-back points. Williams’s return clips and net and 
trickles back on to her side of the court! 30-40. The match clock ticks to 
exactly two hours as Williams breaks! What guts and determination.

Third set: Williams 4-6, 6-3, 3-5 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

So after an hour and 53 minutes Williams must hold serve to stay in the final. 
The most inauspicious of starts at Williams double faults. 0-15. Williams sends 
another serve into the net on the next point but lands her second, a lengthy 
rally plays out, Williams bides her time, before putting away the winner. 
15-all. Williams crashes away a smash to get to 30-15. Williams is staying back 
here, not coming into the net like she has for much of the match, perhaps she’s 
wisened up to Kerber and doesn’t want to be passed. But Kerber wins the 
baseline exchange, 30-all. What a big point this is. Williams’s serve comes to 
her rescue, 40-30. Game. Williams has forced Kerber to serve this out.
 
Third set: *Williams 4-6, 6-3, 2-5 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Often Williams, when broken, is at her most dangerous. But Kerber is refusing 
to be intimidated. The German moves 30-0 ahead, make that 40-0. Make that game 
as Williams sends a wayward shot wide. A love game to back up the break and 
Kerber is only a game away from stunning Serena Williams and winning the
Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> title!

Third set: Williams 4-6, 6-3, 2-4 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

A late and loose shot from Williams, 0-15. A cross-court rally ensues before 
Williams decides to mix things up by going down the line. 15-all. Williams 
thinks she’s hit an ace to get to 30-all but misses by a fraction. And then it’s
15-40, two break points! Williams is in command as Kerber scrambles left and 
right and left and right and left and right – the longest rally of the final at 
19 strokes – the crowd are oooohing and aaaaahing and finally Williams deals 
the killer blow. 30-40. Ace, deuce. Williams hasn’t been able to rely on her 
serve in this match but it got her out of a hole there. Deuce.

But Williams finds herself in another one when Kerber comes up with a forehand 
pass. Williams just isn’t winning enough points at the net.Another break point, 
advantage Kerber. Williams’s backhand looks like it may whistle just wide but 
it lands in for a winner. Deuce No2. Advantage Williams. A feathery drop-shot 
from Kerber, deuce No3. This game has been going for nearly eight minutes now. 
Could it be decisive? Perhaps, as a fourth double fault from Williams of the 
day brings up afourth break point of the game. Kerber, uncharacteristically, 
looks hesitant, and backs off a few feet beyond the baseline before netting. 
Deuce No4. Advantage Williams. Another Kerber drop-shot! It’s deuce No5. 
Another Williams double fault!Break point No5. Williams unleashes some bombs 
from the back of the court but then self implodes as she goes long!Kerber has 
the break!
 
Third set: *Williams 4-6, 6-3, 2-3 Kerber (*denotes next server)

A wonderful winner from Williams on the third point, which brings up 15-30. 
Another beautiful strike and it’s 30-all. If she can do this consistently in 
this set surely the title will be hers. But then she’s all at sea on the next 
point. It’s so hit and miss today. 40-30. And Kerber holds to regain the 
advantage.

Third set: Williams 4-6, 6-3, 2-2 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

Kerber pulls off a passing shot to get to 0-15. Williams, one minute looking 
so calm, the next so exasperated, hauls herself to 15-all and then unleashes 
one of her biggest “COME ONNNNNNNNNNNNNNS” of the day. I think she made herself 
a little hoarse there because the “COME ON” that follows the next point is a 
little squeaky. So, 30-15. A backhand winner deep to Kerber’s backhand wing 
makes it 40-15. And it’s soon game.
 
Third set: *Williams 4-6, 6-3, 1-2 Kerber (*denotes next server)

A wounded Williams gets to 0-30. And then 15-40. Two break-back points. 
Perhaps that break almost came too soon in the set for Kerber. Williams goes 
for too much on the first break point, and flashes high and wide. 30-40. A 
second-serve chance for Williams on the second break point, there’s nowhere 
near enough on it from Kerber, giving Williams the chance to tee up the 
cross-court backhand. Kerber isn’t getting that back into play. We’re back on 
serve.
 
Third set: Williams 4-6, 6-3, 0-2 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

Williams has never lost the third set in a grand slam final. But she’s in 
danger of going a break down in this one. 0-30. Kerber is scrambling around all 
over the shop, moving back and forth and this way and thataway as she 
withstands the Williams assault and then somehow pulls off a winner! Even 
Williams applauds while simultaneously wincing.0-40, three break points. Kerber 
sets the point up with a strong backhand, Williams gets it back but Kerber 
sends another backhand down the line – this one a winner – and Kerber breaks! 
That’s eight out of nine points in this set.

Third set: *Williams 4-6, 6-3, 0-1 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Both players are back on court after a quick break, and Kerber opens play in 
this decider. I’m sure the German will be pleased she’s serving first, given 
the way she’s been serving today. She rattles off a quick first point, and a 
speedy second too. 30-0. An ace out wide – the German has displayed such 
variety on serve today – and it’s 40-0. The pair go at each other cross-court, 
Williams on her forehand, Kerber on her backhand, before they switch positions 
and Williams’s backhand trades blows with Kerber’s forehand. Williams takes the 
point but doesn’t win the wider war as Kerber calmly takes the game by 
threading a forehand down the line with Williams stranded at the net.

So who do you have in this final set? Of course Williams is the favourite from 
here on in, but can she ignore the weight of history on her racket to get over 
the line? Kerber has showed enough about her in this final to suggest if 
Williams wobbles, she will take advantage.

Second set: *Williams 4-6, 5-3 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Kerber falls 0-30 down. Williams would surely like to break here, not only to 
finish this set but because it would mean she’d be serving first in the 
deciding set. But Kerber rattles off four points on the spin and Williams will 
have to serve this out.
 
Second set: Williams 4-6, 5-2 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

Williams holds to 30, finishing things off with a volley which she just about 
manages to skew over the net and into the service box for a winner. The crowd 
gasp. They’ve been fairly balanced in their support for both players, by the 
way. I’m sure they’d like to see Williams equal some history but Kerber is 
getting plenty of backing as the underdog. Kerber must hold serve to stay in 
this set.

Second set: *Williams 4-6, 4-2 Kerber (*denotes next server)

The movement from Williams appears more assured, the racket is moving more 
fluently, and she takes the first point of the game to move 0-15 ahead. Kerber 
then nudges 30-15 up with the help of Hawk-Eye. Williams comes back to 30-all. 
Kerber responds to get to 40-30. And the seventh seed takes the game with a 
piercing backhand down the line. Cue a celebratory fist pump and “COME ON!” (or 
“KOMM SCHON!”).
 
Second set: Williams 4-6, 4-1 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

The answer would appear to be no when Williams slips 0-30 down. But a first 
ace of the day for Williams helps her recover to 40-30. She then whistles away 
a forehand winner to bring up the game. The break is consolidated. Is she 
starting to make her move?
 
Second set: *Williams 4-6, 3-1 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Kerber’s first loose service game: two double faults and an error and it’s 
0-40, three break points. Kerber opens the court out in some style, before 
planting the winner. 15-40, but there are still another two break points to 
come. Williams gets it all wrong and it’s 30-40. Two down, one to go. Kerber 
misses her first serve, she slides a weak second serve to Williams’s backhand, 
Kerber does well to get it back and return to almost level terms in the point, 
but Williams prevails. She has the break but that was as much to do with a drop 
in her opponent’s play as it was with anything she did; can Williams find some 
consistency and take the initiative?
 
Second set: Williams 4-6, 2-1 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

From 30-all, Williams holds. But it’s not straightforward. At least her 
forehand shows up to give her the game.
 
Second set: *Williams 4-6, 1-1 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Much credit must go to Kerber for her consistency and the way in which she is 
chasing everything down. But as is almost always the case in Williams’s 
matches, this is still on the world No1’s racket. You feel Williams, with her 
erratic forehand and fumbling footwork, is playing not only Kerber but also 
history and that Graf record. Kerber holds, sending down her second ace of the 
day in the process. And here’s a surprising stat: the ace count currently reads 
2-0 in Kerber’s favour. Williams, the best server in the women’s game, isn’t 
even on the board.

Williams, her feet planted too firmly in the ground, slips 15-0 down. Some 
tremendous defence from Kerber, Williams is at the net, but the world No1 can’t 
dig the ball out from the ground. 30-0. Kerber is potentially two points away 
from a one-set lead. Make that one point away because it’s 40-0. Williams looks 
to have the initiative on set point when Kerber throws in a short ball, but 
Kerber again scrambles so well to get back into the rally, and eventually 
Williams prods into the net! Well, well. Kerber moves a set ahead and it’s the 
first Williams has dropped in this tournament!

First set: Williams 4-5 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

Another drive volley chance for Williams and another miss. She’s almost trying 
too hard, forcing the issue, rather than playing instinctively. An angry 
Williams batters the ball away for a winner to level at 15-all. Williams is now 
roaring herself on during the points, screaming after unleashing her shots, and 
Kerber is looking at the umpire as if to say: “is this legal?” Williams, 
remember, did get penalised during her 2011 US Open final defeat to Sam Stosur 
for celebrating before a point had finished. Williams holds to 30. Kerber will 
serve for the first set.
 
First set: *Williams 3-5 Kerber (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Williams misses another gimme down the line on the forehand side. 
At the moment the pressure of attempting to equal Steffi Graf’s Open era record 
of 22 grand slam titles seems to be telling more on Williams than the pressure 
of appearing in a first major final is on Kerber. Has Williams started having 
flashbacks of the Roberta Vinci US Open match yet? Her mother, Oracene, winces 
in the stands as Kerber consolidates the break to force Williams to serve to 
stay in this set.

First set: Williams 3-4 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

While I was perusing Twitter, Williams goes from a position of relative 
comfort to break point down. Gah! I’m not entirely sure how that happened, but 
having looked more at ease in that previous game, she seems a little edgy 
again, and her footwork lets her down. 30-40. Williams drills long on the drive 
volley – what a miss – and Kerber once again nudges a break ahead!

First set: *Williams 3-3 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Kerber’s slider second serve is not much of a weapon. You feel if Williams 
gets enough opportunities on that she can cause some damage. But the forehand 
isn’t quite firing yet. Then just to disprove my point, Williams wallops a 
forehand winner. Thanks Serena. 30-all. She has a chance to bring up break 
point, the ball drops short and Williams looks almost certain to put away the 
forehand winner, but she nets. Her family and coach groan in the stands. A 
terrific point at deuce, the pair go at each other from the back of the court 
and then Kerber blinks first.Advantage Williams, her first break point of this 
final. She treats a second serve with absolute disdain and thumps away a winner 
down the line. There’s the break back and there’s another fist pump and “COME 
ON!!!!!!” Williams looks to be in business.
 
First set: Williams 2-3 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

Two points into Williams’s service game and there’s already a sniff of another 
break at 0-30. Williams lets out some frustration by punishing the short ball 
and screaming her first “COME ON” of the proceedings. She wins the next point 
and roars another “COME ON” for good measure. 30-all. And there’s a third 
successive point for Williams and a third successive “COME ON”. Williams, so 
quiet for the first few games, is fired up. But then perhaps she lets the 
adrenaline get the better of her as she miscues. Deuce. Williams then 
bamboozles Kerber with a well-disguised drop-shot. Kerber didn’t even move. 
Advantage Williams. Game. The world No1 keeps her arrears to the single break.

First set: *Williams 1-3 Kerber (*denotes next server)

So what response from Williams? She dispatches a lethal cross-court forehand 
to get to 15-all. But from the sublime to the ridiculous as she gets her 
footwork all wrong and loops long. 30-15 to Kerber. Williams slaps into the net 
and Kerber has two game points. Williams takes aim at a toothless second serve 
and pierces Kerber with a return winner down the line. 40-30. Williams gets a 
reprieve in the following point when her shot clips the net and trickles over, 
but Kerber chases it down before sending down a smash. The break is 
consolidated. You wouldn’t know this is Kerber’s first grand slam final.

First set: Williams 1-2 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Kerber whistles a backhand cross-court winner past Williams with a 
nonchalant flick of the wrist. Even Williams applauds. 15-30. And look here, 
it’s15-40. The first break points go to Kerber. What can she do? The pair trade 
blows from the back of the court, and then Williams goes a fraction long! 
There’s the first break of the final and it’s not gone to Williams. Game on.

First set: *Williams 1-1 Kerber (*denotes next server)

Kerber takes the first point of the game and her first of the match. The crowd 
breathe a sigh of relief. But Williams, prowling inside the baseline on the 
second serve, is already looking dangerous on the return. 15-30. Williams then 
bludgeons a backhand well into the tramlines and Kerber sends down a first ace; 
it wasn’t the fastest but Williams got nowhere near it. 40-30 then turns into 
game. Composed from Kerber; she’ll be happy with that service start.
 
First set: Williams 1-0 Kerber* (*denotes next server)

So here comes Serena. She looks less than assured as she steps up to the plate 
to serve, dropping the ball and having to chase after it, but it’s all a front. 
Williams sends a strong serve out wide which gives her the initiative in the 
point; she then comes into the net to finish things off. 15-0, make that 30-0. 
Which turns into 40-0 when Kerber clonks long after a baseline rally. An 
unreturned serve from Williams and that’s the game.
 
A pre-match email. “Morning Katy,” chirps Simon McMahon. “As someone once 
said, now is not the time for sound bites, but I feel the hand of history on 
our shoulder. There’s no way Serena will not win today. Is there?”
 
Tik, tok, tikity, tok, the players are warming up, Williams once again wearing 
bright yellow, Kerber clad in a coral/red number. Kerber won the toss and has 
opted to receive. A sign of nerves on the German’s part that she doesn’t want 
to serve? It’s a fairly breezy evening in Melbourne, so that could make 
Williams’s serve slightly less of a weapon than usual. There again, Williams 
could probably play in a hurricane and still blow her opponent off court.

And here come the players, waiting patiently outside the locker room before 
navigating their way through the bowels of the Rod Laver Arena. Kerber, head 
bowed, walks a few steps ahead of Williams before being announced to the 
capacity crowd. Then comes Williams. Not sure who edged the cheers there; it 
was fairly even I’d say.
 
 Williams says:

I would say this is probably the best slam I’ve played in a year, and I’ve won 
a lot in a year. I know my practices are better. Hopefully I’m playing better. 
So I definitely can play more consistent and more mentally stable, so to say.

I’m the favourite. I was the favourite in New York. I feel like I could have 
done better in New York but that was a learning experience. So I’m going to 
hopefully take that to the court for not only this tournament but for the rest 
of these slams.

I thought [Kerber] played unbelievable in that match [in Cincinnati in 2012]. 
That’s something that I’ll never forget. I just remember her serving really 
well, her moving well, her being determined to win that. I think from then on 
out I’ve been really focused that she’s someone that I, and everyone, really 
has to take very seriously.

Kerber says:

I have actually nothing to lose. I can go out there and try to play like I’m 
playing, without pressure, without nothing. I think when you ask a lot of 
people, I think most will say: ‘OK, Serena will win.’ But this is the challenge 
I can take.

I don’t have so much pressure like she has. I know I can lose the match. 
That’s why I’m going out there to try to win it.

 I think I grow in the last few years to be a top-10 player. Now I’m back in 
the top five [off the back of her run in Melbourne]. I think I showed everybody 
that I deserve it. That’s a good feeling.

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/britains-gordon-reid-wins-australian-open-wheelchair-title> 
Hello and welcome to coverage of the Australian Open women’s final between 
Serena Williams and Johanna Konta  sorry Angelique Kerber.

Williams, devastated after falling two wins short of a calendar grand slam at 
last September’s US Open, did not raise a racket in anger for the rest of the 
year. Speculation was swirling about a loss of motivation and chronic knee 
problems, and those concerns continued earlier this month when she failed to 
finish a match at the Hopman Cup. Some posed the question: was it asking too 
much of the 34-year-old to regain the incredible intensity she showed for most 
of 2015 for another assault on the slams in 2016?

More fool those doubters. While Williams has watched inconsistency take grip 
of the women’s game below her this fortnight, natural order appears to have 
been restored at the top. After a slightly tentative start in the first round, 
the world No1 has got stronger and stronger. She is yet to drop a set and 
dismissed Maria Sharapova and Agnieszka Radwanska in the quarter and 
semi-finals respectively for the loss of only nine games in total, saying after 
the Radwanska match that she is playing even better than she did last season. 
Win today and she’ll draw level with Steffi Graf’s Open era record of 22 grand 
slam titles; no doubt victory would also reopen the debate about the 
possibility of a calendar slam. From the devastation of the US Open to possible 
domination in Australia and beyond. What a difference four months makes.

So what of Kerber? Seeded seventh, Konta’s semi-final conqueror is appearing 
in her first grand slam final at the age of 28, reward for a consistent career 
that has seen her be a regular in the world’s top 10 over the past five years. 
The left-hander is a solid baseliner, who has beaten Williams only once in six 
previous meetings – a 6-4, 6-4 upset in Cincinnati in 2012. Kerber saw off the 
much-fancied Victoria Azarenka in the quarter-finals before victory over Konta, 
which drew a congratulatory text from her childhood idol and occasional mentor 
Graf. No doubt Graf will be hoping her fellow German can do her a favour today 
by ensuring her grand slam haul remains unequalled.

The players are due on court at: 8.30am GMT, 7.30pm in Melbourne. Don’t be 
late, wherever you are.
 
Katy will be with you shortly. Whilst you wait, have a read of Simon Cambers’ 
preview, asSerena Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> 
aims for her 22nd grand slam, and Angelique Kerber goes after her first major 
title.

It was while she was discussing the achievement of reaching her first grand 
slam final that Angelique Kerber pulled out her phone to check her messages. 
Among them was a text from Steffi Graf, congratulating her on her effort and 
wishing her luck for Saturday’s Australian Open final againstSerena Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams>. On all available evidence, 
she will need more than luck.

Whether Graf offered her advice on how she might do it, Kerber did not say, 
but receiving any message from her idol will at least fill the 28-year-old with 
confidence, even if the odds are very much against her. Kerber turned to Graf 
last March when her confidence had dipped. A reminder from the former world No1 
that she was a good player and doing the right things put her back on track and 
she is now firmly established back in the top 10.

Should Kerber somehow pull off a massive upset, it will keep Graf one ahead of 
Williams in the all-time list of grand slam singles winners, with 22 to 21. 
Beating Williams will surely require something extra special. After a few 
months off at the end of last year, the American has breezed through the
