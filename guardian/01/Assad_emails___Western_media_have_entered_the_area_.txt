A trusted source who met with leaders of groups in Baba Amr today said that a 
big shipment of weapons is coming from Libya and will arrive at the shores of 
one of the neighbouring states within three days, to be smuggled toSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>.

It was indicated that they were advanced weapons and the shipment is highly 
likely [to be sent from] one of Tripoli's illegal ports.

[XXXXXXXXXXXX] was able to get into Baba Amr and he has told me that many 
western media delegations have entered the area by crossing the Lebanese 
borders illegally, one of them was a French and a German media delegation and 
that fighters are touring the streets specially those who are calling 
themselves Khalid Ibn al-Walid brigades.

I suggest the formation of a special operation room to supervise the 
barricades and give the authority to move them and transform them in light of 
the circumstances and to monitor their performance ...

This will enable us to oversee operations to get out of the problem of each 
body throwing its responsibility on another body.
