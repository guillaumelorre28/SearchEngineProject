Unlike many disputes between labels and artists, the argument between Berry 
Gordy Jr and his brother-in-lawMarvin Gaye 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/marvin-gaye> over What's Going On doesn't 
easily reduce to philistine versus visionary. Gordy's instincts had been the 
sharpest for a decade, and under him Motown was the highest-quality production 
line in pop's history. His objections weren't that Gaye's new music was too 
radical, but that it sounded "jazzy" and "old". Equally, Gaye hadn't simply 
been singing callow nonsense before presenting his boss with a meditation on 
the state of the world then threatening to retire if he couldn't release it. 
After all, pop doesn't strike much deeper than I Heard it Through the 
Grapevine'.

Gaye simply understood that the angry, confused feelings of the early 70s 
needed a different kind of music. Even if the questing drift of What's Going On 
didn't sound like a hit, it would resonate.

The song leaked, was a smash, and its parent album remains a masterpiece. The 
record helped kick off a golden era â€“ a half-decade when soul was the most 
sophisticated and emotionally wide-ranging pop music in the world.
