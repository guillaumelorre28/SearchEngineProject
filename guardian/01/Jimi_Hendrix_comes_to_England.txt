If Eric Clapton created the cult of the guitar hero, Jimi Hendrix was to 
supplant him. Hendrix already had years on the US touring circuit as a backing 
musician when the former Animal, Chas Chandler, brought him to London, set him 
up with a band, theJimi Hendrix <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jimi-hendrix>
 Experience, and let him loose on the world. Hendrix transformed guitar 
playing, both in technique and showmanship. And, along the way, he wrote some 
pretty decent songs.
