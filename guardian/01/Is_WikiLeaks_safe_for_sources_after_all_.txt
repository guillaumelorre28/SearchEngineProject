A Swedish newspaper has claimed that WikiLeaks <http://wikileaks.org/> is not 
fully protected by Swedish law and so it could be vulnerable to demands to 
reveal its sources.

According to an article in Sydsvenskan, there are doubts about the validity of 
WikiLeaks' belief in the protections offered under Swedish legislation.

The paper quotes HÃ¥kan Rustand, deputy to the acting chancellor of justice, as 
saying: "It is too simple to claim that allWikiLeaks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks> sources are totally protected in 
Sweden."

The website has no licence to publish material in Sweden, and therefore 
placing the server inSweden <https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden> does not 
give WikiLeaks automatic protection.

Rustand says: "If the constitutional laws are non-applicable, ordinary 
liability laws take effect. This means a source could be brought to court by a 
common prosecutor."

While I'm on the subject, all those who have not read yesterday's Open Door 
piece byChris Elliott 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/aug/09/afghanistan-war-logs-readers-editor>
 should do so now. It is full of explanatory material about the precautions 
taken before publishing the Afghan Logs.
