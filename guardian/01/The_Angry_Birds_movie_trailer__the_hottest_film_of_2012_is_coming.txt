Angry Birds <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/angry-birds> is the 
red-hot iPhone app of the moment. It’s literally a one-in-a-million sensation. 
Your friends can’t stop playing it. The world’s edgiest comedians can’t stop 
referencing it – and now it’s heading to the big screen! What sort of blockbus… 
oh, hang on, my fault, sorry. I thought it was 2012. Let me start again.

Angry Birds is that iPhone game that people used to play a lot three years ago 
but don’t any more. And now it’s going to be a film. And there’s a trailer for 
it. There, that’s better. Still, while we’re here, let’s give the Angry Birds 
trailer a closer look.

We open with a shot of the character we’re most likely to remember from the 
last time we played Angry Birds several years ago – Nameless Red Bird. Here’s 
Nameless Red Bird eating a sandwich. So far, this is a film about a cartoon 
bird eating a sandwich.

Also present, three sexy birds. At least I assume they’re supposed to be sexy. 
God, I hope they are, otherwise I’ve just projecting a horrific amount of 
sexual availability onto three relatively gender-free cartoon birds. Not this 
week, Heritage. Don’t do this while nebulous almost-bestiality is such a 
hot-button issue. Get it together.

Oh, phew, they were supposed to be sexy after all. And they were aiming all 
their red-hot sexuality at that hunky sort-of blueish bird. I hope the red 
bird’s OK, and didn’t mistakenly think the other birds were actually coming on 
to him.

Ah. He did. And by the look of it he hasn’t taken the rejection well. In fact, 
I suppose you could say that he’s now a fairlyangry bird. See what I did there? 
That was clever of me wasn’t it?

So angry is Nameless Red Bird, in fact, that he appears to have enrolled in 
some sort of anger management programme, along with an annoying yellow bird 
played by the annoying man who played the annoying snowman in Frozen. 
Typecasting issues aside, though, this literally seems like it’s going to be a 
film about some angry birds. That’s literally what this film is.

The black blowy-up up bird is also angry, because he’s just blown up. Wow, 
these people have really grabbed the whole Angry Birds idea by its most literal 
end and run with it, haven’t they?

But it’s OK, because here’s a pig, which you might remember is the mortal 
enemy of the Angry Birds. Pretty soon these pigs will be constructing 
dangerously ramshackle homes for themselves, and the birds will kamikaze into 
them as revenge. If my memory is correct, the birds all die as soon as they’ve 
been catapulted at the pigs, which makes me think that the Angry Birds movie 
will actually turn up to be a sorrowful meditation on the futility of war.

Oh, wrong again. It’s just going to be about some angry birds. The Angry Birds 
movie is literally just going to be about some birds who get angry sometimes. 
Hopefully clear flaws will all be addressed addressed and ironed out by the 
time they make a film about your second-favourite iPhone app, Google Maps.
