I have always been a fan of one-pot wonders. This take on a biryani is 
actually quite light – and it's perfect served cold.

(Serves 4)
200g basmati rice
4 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, chopped finely
1 garlic clove, crushed
½ tsp cumin seeds, crushed
2 cloves
2 cardamoms
1 whole chicken, in eight joints
Pinch of salt
Pinch cumin powder
50g chopped almonds

Rinse the rice through a sieve several times and drain. Heat some oil in a 
large pot, add the onions, garlic and cumin seeds, fry for two minutes, until 
golden, then set aside.

Add the rice, cloves and cardamoms to the same pot and cover with cold water 
to around 2cm above the rice. Boil, reduce the heat to as low as possible, 
cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed.

Meanwhile, season the chicken joints and scatter with cumin powder. Add the 
remaining oil to a pan and cook the joints on medium heat for 20 minutes, 
turning on all sides.

Put the cooked rice to the side and combine with the sauteed onion mix.

Check the chicken is cooked through, remove from the pan and place on top of 
the rice. Check the seasoning and serve, finished with the chopped almonds.
