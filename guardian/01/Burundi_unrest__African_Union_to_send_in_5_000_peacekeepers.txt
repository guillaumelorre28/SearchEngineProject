An “African prevention and protection mission” will be deployed to Burundi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/burundi> for at least six months and the 
mission can be extended, the group’s peace and security council said.

The force’s mandate will include protecting civilians under imminent threat in 
the central African nation and helping to create conditions for holding 
inter-Burundian dialogue.

Violence in Burundi has been escalating since Nkurunziza was re-elected

 in July for a third term. The move was opposed by many Burundians and the 
international community, who said it violated the country’s constitution, which 
sets a two-term limit.

Eighty-seven people were killed

last week when unidentified attackers struck at three military installations. 
Human rights groups have accused Burundi’s security forces of unjustified 
killings of people in a counter-insurgency crackdown following the attack. 
Burundi’s government has insisted its troops acted professionally.

At least 400 people have been killed since 26 April, when the ruling party 
announced Nkurunziza’s decision to run again. Nearly 3,500 people have been 
arrested in the political crisis and 220,000 people have fled the country.

Nkurunziza has argued that his first term in office did not count because he 
was elected by parliament and not by the people.

Burundi’s constitutional court voted in favour of Nkurunziza’s bid for a third 
term in office but the deputy president of the court fled to Rwanda and said 
the court’s decision was due to coercion.
