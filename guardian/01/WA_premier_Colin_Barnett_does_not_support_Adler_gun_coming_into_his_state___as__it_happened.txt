Nighttime politics

 * The gun debate dominated another day, pushing Malcolm Turnbull’s chosen 
agenda of industrial relations off the front pages.

 * Tony Abbott reiterated the point he made to Katharine Murphy last night – 
that the reason he put a sunset clause on the Adler import ban was due to 
“internal pressure” rather than Leyonhjelm.

 * Treasury secretary John Fraser acknowledged the growing intergenerational 
inequality gap otherwise known as the avocado scandal.

 * Bill Shorten had to tidy up some loose remarks about loving only some of 
his team.

 * And estimates continue ...

I will leave it there for the day. Thanks to Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and 
Katharine Murphy.


But I cannot close without revealing the reason for Kate Ellis and Richard 
Marles’s fit of the giggles in the parliament (see earlier post). 

It was Samantha Maiden of the Sunday Telegraph. To Richard Marles, we are 
laughing with you, not at you.

Night.

Last week Mel Davey reported on this 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/norfolk-islanders-hope-pauline-hanson-will-take-up-some-of-their-grievances>
:

The One Nation leader, senator Pauline Hanson, will visit Norfolk Island next 
week on a four-day fact-finding mission on the invitation ofNorfolk Island 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/norfolk-island> People for 
Democracy, a group opposed to the Australian government’s revoking of the 
island’s autonomy.


Hanson’s visit on Tuesday will mark the first time a crossbench or opposition 
senator or MP has been to the island following the Australian parliament’s 
decision last May to abolish its system of self-governance.

Now Hanson wants to dismiss the island’s administrator, Gary Hargrave, a 
former Howard minister, on the grounds of “serious misconduct”.

Just a couple more things on the Adler.

By putting the gun thing back on the table, David Leyonjhelm has opened up a 
further issue forMalcolm Turnbull with his Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> partner, Barnaby Joyce. 
Not that Joyce has disagreed with Turnbull’s messages. But his National MPs 
have tried to remind everyone that this is a matter of categorisation of the 
gun - not the import. Because a number of the shotguns are already in the 
country. It looks like a Lib-Nat split.

Tony Abbott’s revelation that the sunset clause on the import ban was a result 
of internal pressure from theNational party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party> and presumably some 
Libs, rather than Leyonhjelm, reinforces the “split” story for the PM. 
Nationals have confirmed they did push back on Abbott. Whether Keenan plus 
Dutton independently used the agreed sunset clause to barter with Leyonhjelm 
(given it was going to happen anyway) or whether Abbott gave permission to do 
so, we don’t know.

So if the import ban is lifted – as at least some of the Nats would like – it 
will be painted as a watering down of the gun laws. Even though strictly 
speaking, it is not. It will also be painted as a win for the Nats over 
Turnbull.

Enter WA premier Colin Barnett. He has said this:


I’m far from being an expert on guns, but as a matter of policy, I do not 
support that gun. I saw some footage on television of it being fired; it’s 
obviously got a rapid-fire capacity. Australia has put in policies to contain 
gun ownership and use, and I do not support allowing a weapon like that into 
this state.

If Barnett is going to be a hold-out on the Adler, it may be the best 
political outcome for Turnbull. It could both fix the wider political issue and 
his issue with the Nats.

If the states cannot decide on the category – as they are required to do under 
the National Firearms Agreement – the import ban stays for the time being. This 
would solve the wider political problem by kicking it off into the long grass. 
The PM can tell the Nats his hands are tied by the states indecision – that is 
the condition of the Howard laws.

As an aside, shooters who favour the import of the Adler are privately pretty 
ropable with Leyonjhelm. He has put the Adler squarely in the middle of a wider 
political debate, ensuring it will not be discussed in any sort of rational 
way. But Leyonjhelm wins either way. If the shotgun is permanently banned, he 
fought the good fight for shooters. If the ban is lifted, it was all because of 
him.

The art of politics.

Wayne Swan v BHP: Part four - the dummy spit

You may remember last week Wayne Swan tore strips off BHP regarding their tax 
affairs last week.

From our friends at AAP:

Former treasurer Wayne Swan has accused BHP Billiton of a “dummy spit” over 
criticism of its tax affairs.
The mining giant’s chief executive Andrew Mackenzie told a function in London 
on Monday the “continual questioning of our economic and social contribution” 
in Australia was “chilling” when compared to countries such as Chile.
Mackenzie said the president of Chile, where BHP owns 57.5% of the Escondida 
copper mine, had recently praised the company’s economic and social 
contribution.


But in our home country of Australia where we have contributed hugely to 
employment, and through taxes and royalties, we still find ourselves blamed for 
problems that we didn’t cause and the target, if you like, of people who assume 
that we are the ones trying to avoid tax.

Swan told parliament on Wednesday BHP could not claim to be transparent over 
its tax affairs “given their failure to clearly outline numerous back payments 
to the Australian taxation office as a result of tax audits over a decade”.


BHP are like that guest at the hotel. They have rented the penthouse, they 
have had full room service, but then they run off and leave a bill because they 
only paid for a standard room.

The dummy spit by BHP executives in London last night is yet another example 
of how out of touch corporates are with ordinary people and why, around the 
world, many corporates are held in such low regard.

Scott Morrison will not buy into Xenophon’s amendments to the ABCC bill, such 
as nationally consistent payment rules for subcontractors.

We are back to the CFMEU.

While he does not confirm the government will amend for Xenophon, it sounds 
like it will.

Given NXT voted for the bill, no doubt some deal has been done.

Morrison also refuses to say – following Xenophon’s rejection of the one month 
wait for the dole for young people – whether the government will take the 
savings out of the budget.

There will be a point at which those decisions will be taken.

He says if the savings are not found with this cut, other cuts will need to be 
made.

Scott Morrison is speaking to David Speers on Sky. Nick Xenophon has indicated 
he will not support tax cuts for companies with turnovers above $10m. You may 
remember in this year’s budget the government’s enterprise tax plans cut 
company tax for big businesses as part of a 10-year plan.

Morrison does not say whether the government will break up elements of the 
package to get the tax cuts through for those businesses under $10m.

 * The gun debate dominated another day, pushing Malcolm Turnbull’s chosen 
agenda of industrial relations off the front pages.

 * Tony Abbott reiterated the point he made to Katharine Murphy last night – 
that the reason he put a sunset clause on the Adler import ban was due to 
“internal pressure” rather than Leyonhjelm.

 * Treasury secretary John Fraser acknowledged the growing intergenerational 
inequality gap otherwise known as the avocado scandal.

 * Bill Shorten had to tidy up some loose remarks about loving only some of 
his team.

 * And estimates continue ...

I will leave it there for the day. Thanks to Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and 
Katharine Murphy.

Marles’s fit of the giggles in the parliament (see earlier post).

Last week Mel Davey reported on this 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/norfolk-islanders-hope-pauline-hanson-will-take-up-some-of-their-grievances>
:

The One Nation leader, senator Pauline Hanson, will visit Norfolk Island next 
week on a four-day fact-finding mission on the invitation ofNorfolk Island 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/norfolk-island> People for 
Democracy, a group opposed to the Australian government’s revoking of the 
island’s autonomy.


Hanson’s visit on Tuesday will mark the first time a crossbench or opposition 
senator or MP has been to the island following the Australian parliament’s 
decision last May to abolish its system of self-governance.

Now Hanson wants to dismiss the island’s administrator, Gary Hargrave, a 
former Howard minister, on the grounds of “serious misconduct”.

Just a couple more things on the Adler.

By putting the gun thing back on the table, David Leyonjhelm has opened up a 
further issue forMalcolm Turnbull with his Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> partner, Barnaby Joyce. 
Not that Joyce has disagreed with Turnbull’s messages. But his National MPs 
have tried to remind everyone that this is a matter of categorisation of the 
gun - not the import. Because a number of the shotguns are already in the 
country. It looks like a Lib-Nat split.

Tony Abbott’s revelation that the sunset clause on the import ban was a result 
of internal pressure from theNational party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/national-party> and presumably some 
Libs, rather than Leyonhjelm, reinforces the “split” story for the PM. 
Nationals have confirmed they did push back on Abbott. Whether Keenan plus 
Dutton independently used the agreed sunset clause to barter with Leyonhjelm 
(given it was going to happen anyway) or whether Abbott gave permission to do 
so, we don’t know.

So if the import ban is lifted – as at least some of the Nats would like – it 
will be painted as a watering down of the gun laws. Even though strictly 
speaking, it is not. It will also be painted as a win for the Nats over 
Turnbull.

Enter WA premier Colin Barnett. He has said this:


I’m far from being an expert on guns, but as a matter of policy, I do not 
support that gun. I saw some footage on television of it being fired; it’s 
obviously got a rapid-fire capacity. Australia has put in policies to contain 
gun ownership and use, and I do not support allowing a weapon like that into 
this state.

If Barnett is going to be a hold-out on the Adler, it may be the best 
political outcome for Turnbull. It could both fix the wider political issue and 
his issue with the Nats.

If the states cannot decide on the category – as they are required to do under 
the National Firearms Agreement – the import ban stays for the time being. This 
would solve the wider political problem by kicking it off into the long grass. 
The PM can tell the Nats his hands are tied by the states indecision – that is 
the condition of the Howard laws.

As an aside, shooters who favour the import of the Adler are privately pretty 
ropable with Leyonjhelm. He has put the Adler squarely in the middle of a wider 
political debate, ensuring it will not be discussed in any sort of rational 
way. But Leyonjhelm wins either way. If the shotgun is permanently banned, he 
fought the good fight for shooters. If the ban is lifted, it was all because of 
him.

In an attempt to rein-in rising private health insurance premiums, the health 
minister,Sussan Ley, has announced reforms aimed at cutting the costs of 
medical devices and prostheses,writes Mel Davey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/19/cutting-medical-device-and-prostheses-costs-should-lower-health-premiums-says-minister>
.

The high cost prostheses, which includes devices like pacemakers and 
replacement hips and knees, are currently being passed on to private patients 
through rising insurance premiums.
 
You may remember last week Wayne Swan tore strips off BHP regarding their tax 
affairs last week.

From our friends at AAP:

Former treasurer Wayne Swan has accused BHP Billiton of a “dummy spit” over 
criticism of its tax affairs.
The mining giant’s chief executive Andrew Mackenzie told a function in London 
on Monday the “continual questioning of our economic and social contribution” 
in Australia was “chilling” when compared to countries such as Chile.
Mackenzie said the president of Chile, where BHP owns 57.5% of the Escondida 
copper mine, had recently praised the company’s economic and social 
contribution.


But in our home country of Australia where we have contributed hugely to 
employment, and through taxes and royalties, we still find ourselves blamed for 
problems that we didn’t cause and the target, if you like, of people who assume 
that we are the ones trying to avoid tax.

Swan told parliament on Wednesday BHP could not claim to be transparent over 
its tax affairs “given their failure to clearly outline numerous back payments 
to the Australian taxation office as a result of tax audits over a decade”.


BHP are like that guest at the hotel. They have rented the penthouse, they 
have had full room service, but then they run off and leave a bill because they 
only paid for a standard room.

The dummy spit by BHP executives in London last night is yet another example 
of how out of touch corporates are with ordinary people and why, around the 
world, many corporates are held in such low regard.

Scott Morrison will not buy into Xenophon’s amendments to the ABCC bill, such 
as nationally consistent payment rules for subcontractors.

We are back to the CFMEU.

While he does not confirm the government will amend for Xenophon, it sounds 
like it will.

Given NXT voted for the bill, no doubt some deal has been done. 
 
Morrison also refuses to say – following Xenophon’s rejection of the one month 
wait for the dole for young people – whether the government will take the 
savings out of the budget.

There will be a point at which those decisions will be taken.

He says if the savings are not found with this cut, other cuts will need to be 
made.
 
Scott Morrison is speaking to David Speers on Sky. Nick Xenophon has indicated 
he will not support tax cuts for companies with turnovers above $10m. You may 
remember in this year’s budget the government’s enterprise tax plans cut 
company tax for big businesses as part of a 10-year plan.

Morrison does not say whether the government will break up elements of the 
package to get the tax cuts through for those businesses under $10m.
