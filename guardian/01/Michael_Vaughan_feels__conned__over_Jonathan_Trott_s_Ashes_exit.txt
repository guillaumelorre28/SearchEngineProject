Michael Vaughan <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-vaughan> has 
criticised Jonathan Trott’s departure from England’s disastrous Ashes tour due 
to a stress-related illness.

“I feel a little bit conned we were told Jonathan Trott’s problems in 
Australia were a stress-related illness he had suffered for years,”wrote the 
former England captain in the Daily Telegraph

. “We were allowed to believe he was struggling with a serious mental health 
issue and treated him with sensitivity and sympathy. He was obviously not in a 
great place but he was struggling for cricketing reasons and not mental, and 
there is a massive difference.”

Vaughan was also unhappy with some of the language Trott used in a recent 
interview with Sky Sports,during which the batsman admitted to “guilt” over his 
exit from the Ashes tour

. “[Trott] completely disrespected anybody who has gone through depression and 
mental illness by using words such as ‘nutcase’ or ‘crazy,’” added Vaughan. “We 
have all said things we regret in the media but I find it staggering he is so 
ill-informed that he used those words.”

Vaughan admitted that he “broke down” while suffering from poor form during 
his own England career and said that Trott may have benefitted from playing 
through his problems. “What Trott will have to accept is that players in his 
own dressing room and in the opposition will look at him and think at the 
toughest of times he did a runner. He did not fight and got on a plane and went 
home. It is harsh but that is the reality.”
