Leon Johnson and Marlon Samuels steadied the ship for West Indies

of their third Test withSouth Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/south-africa-cricket-team> in Cape Town.

After AB de Villiers hit a masterful 148 to give the hosts, who lead the 
three-Test series 1-0,

 a 92-run first-innings lead, West Indies looked in trouble at 27 for two.

They lost Kraigg Brathwaite for 16 and Devon Smith for seven and South Africa 
would have fancied making further inroads before the close.

But Johnson (37) and Samuels (26) stood firm and put on 61 to reduce the 
deficit to four going into Monday, with their side on 88 for two.

Brathwaite was cleaned up by Simon Harmer and Smith gloved Morne Morkel behind.

Resuming on 227 for three earlier, South Africa lost Hashim Amla 27 runs 
later, with the captain disappointed not to have made more of his overnight 55.

He got to 63 but edged Jason Holder behind. Temba Bavuma

 stayed for only 15 runs before being bowled by Shannon Gabriel, playing across 
the line. And West Indies had a real chance with the home side on 288 for five 
but a 96-run stand between De Villiers and Stiaan van Zyl put the game back in 
South Africa’s control.

Van Zyl added 33 of them, before being trapped leg-before by Samuels while at 
the other end De Villiers ticked over to his 21st Test hundred off 144 balls.

With only the tail to keep him company it was a matter of racking up as many 
runs as possible but the tourists made sure they were unable to cut loose.

Holder threw down Vernon Philander’s stumps for a duck, while the debutant 
Harmer made 10 before he padded up to Jerome Taylor.

Johnson then ran Dale Steyn out for four, leaving De Villiers with next to no 
company and he scored 13 more before holing out to long-off, giving Samuels his 
second wicket and South Africa a total of 421.
