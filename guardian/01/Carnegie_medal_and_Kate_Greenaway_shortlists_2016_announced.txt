This year’s CILIP Carnegie medal shortlist is teen fiction heavy and 
preoccupied with uncovering secrets and lies. Previous winner, Patrick Ness, 
aspires to be the first ever author to win the Carnegie medal three times with 
his bold novel The Rest of Us Just Live Here. Also, in the running is Costa 
Book of the Year 2016 winner Frances Hardinge with The Lie Tree (also
shortlisted for the Guardian children’s fiction prize 2015 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/oct/31/the-guardian-childrens-fiction-prize-shortlist-2015>
) which tells the story of a young Victorian girl who uses lies to unearth the 
truth of her father’s murder. Lying is also at the heart of Robin Talley’s 
debut, Lies We Tell Ourselves, where two girls fall in love across the race 
divide in 1950s America.

Mystery surrounds the death of Faith’s father and when she searches through 
his belongings for clues she uncovers a strange tree. The tree has an enticing 
and dangerous secret – it only grows healthy when you whisper a lie, and when 
you eat the fruit of the tree you will possess a hidden truth. The more people 
who believe the lie, the bigger truth the person will unearth. Faith, who 
discovers she is very good at lying, hopes the tree will reveal the truth of 
her father’s murder. But as Faith lies, she starts to lose control.

Shelby lives a safe, sheltered life with her mother Shaylene, but when she is 
knocked down by a car, her world is turned upside down. Like two criminals on 
the run, Thelma and Louise or Bonnie and Clyde, her mother picks her up and 
drives into the night. Everywhere she looks someone is watching, telling her 
not to believe. Who can she trust?

Patrick Ness puts you in the shoes of regular down-to-earth Mikey who just 
wants to graduate, go to prom and maybe pluck up the courage to ask Henna out. 
But then someone blows up the high school and someone needs to fight the 
zombies or the soul-eating ghosts (or whatever this thing is with blue lights 
and death). A novel that asks you to find the extraordinary in ordinary life.

Since the beginning of time, when a girl walks through the forest with moist 
green air clinging to her skin, the spiral has always existed. It is there 
centuries later hiding the treacherous Golden Beck waters that take Anna, who 
they call a witch. And it is there on the other side of the world, where a mad 
poet watches the dangerous waves and knows its secrets, to the far future as 
Keir Bowman realises his fate. Each take their next steps on a journey of 
survival and discovery.

It’s 1959 in the thick of the battle for civil rights. Sarah has her first day 
of school as one of the first black students at the previous all-white 
Jefferson High. No one wants her there, not the teachers or the students, and 
especially not Linda, the daughter of the town’s most passionate 
segregationist. But as they spend time together, an unlikely friendship 
blossoms and they realise they feel something they are determined to ignore. 
Can they stand up to the unjust world and what they feel in their own secret 
hearts? Against the backdrop of prejudice and racism, this is a compelling 
story of first loves and sexual awakenings.

father, Ernest, reaches the end of his life before she has even met him. Her 
best friend, Thurston, is somewhere on the other side of the world, and her 
mother is determined to get her hands on Ernest’s priceless art collection. But 
Ernest wants to cast light on some issues for Iris before he’s gone and the 
truth has more than one way of surfacing.

The Kate Greenaway shortlist

Traditional picture books make a return to the Kate Greenaway shortlist after 
2015’s more sombre list. It is a face-off between three illustrators each of 
whom have two medals already under their belts. Helen Oxenbury first won nearly 
half a century ago, in 1969, while former Children’s Laureate Anthony Browne 
first won in 1983 and current Children’s Laureate Chris Riddell first won in 
2001.

Here is the full list of the eight authors in the running:

budge. But pesky Bear gets up when Mouse disappears – only what’s that? Is that 
Mouse in Bear’s house?

Winner of CBI book of the year, this picture book is a collection of 26 short 
stories. Each letter of the alphabet has its very own story with a cast of new 
characters (and a few familiar faces). Edmund the astronaut with an awkward 
fear of heights and dynamic new investigative duo of the Owl and the Octopus 
bring the alphabet to life.

A little girl collects wild flowers, each of which she gathers becomes a gift 
for a person or animal, while her distracted father pays little attention. It 
is a story about the giver and recipient of the gift and how they are 
transformed by their encounter. It is a small but powerful testament about how 
we should take more notice of the small things and people in life. And it 
recognises how children can find a treasure and a joy in ordinary things.

The winners of the CILIP Carnegie and the CILIP Kate Greenaway medals 2016 
will be announced on Monday 20 June 2016. Each winner will receive £500 worth 
of books to donate to their local library and of course the medal itself! For 
the first time this year, one title from each shortlist will receive the 
Amnesty CIILIP honour as the book that most distinctively illuminates, upholds 
or celebrates freedoms.

The Guardian’s children’s book site will be reporting on the winners – so 
watch this space! Meanwhile keep your reviews of the shortlisted books coming
