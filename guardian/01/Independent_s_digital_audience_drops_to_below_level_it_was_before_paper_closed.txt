The Independentâ€™s digital audience has fallen back below the level it 
commanded before going digital only in March.

Total daily unique browsers were down more than 7% to 3,048,377, below the 
3,082,936 average daily browsers it attracted in March, according to the latest 
monthly figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations.

The title, which closed its Sunday and daily print editions at the end of 
March to pursue a digital-only future, had posted a 6% increase in daily online 
readers to almost 3.3 million in April.

The only other titles to record digital audience declines were the two largest,
Mail Online <https://www.theguardian.com/media/mail-online> and 
theguardian.com, which were down 0.6% and 4.4% respectively.

The biggest risers were the Richard Desmond-owned Daily Express and Daily Star 
sites, both up over 10%.

The Telegraph was also up by more than 5%. However, the Sun, which only 
dropped its paywall late last year, has seen its growth slow to below 1%. The 
News UK-owned site was redesigned earlier this month to encourage traffic.
