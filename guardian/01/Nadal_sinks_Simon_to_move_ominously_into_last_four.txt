Rafael Nadal moved ominously into the semi-finals of the Australian Open

victory over the Frenchman Gilles Simon.

The Spanish world No1, who earlier had seen Fernando Verdasco seal his place 
in the last four

 with a four-set win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, was at his impressive best in the 
first set, which he won at a canter, 6-2. The 24-year-old Frenchman, however, 
refused to give up and pushed Nadal hard in the second and third sets.

Ultimately, though, Nadal's greater experience told as he reached the 
semi-finals in Melbourne for the second year running. He now faces Verdasco and 
will hope to do better than last year's semi-final,when he failed to win a set 
against Tsonga

The Australian Open is one of the two grand slams the 22-year-old Spaniard has 
yet to win with the US Open being the other.

Roger Federer takes on Andy Roddick in the other semi-final.
