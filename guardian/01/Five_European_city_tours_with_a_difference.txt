Up on the roof in Stockholm


“Are you scared of heights?” my guide Veerle, a Belgian transplant who has 
been running tours in Stockholm since 2007, asks as she double-checks my safety 
harness. I meet her eyes with a smile and before I answer, she responds: “I can 
tell you’re not”.

Helmets fastened, we climb out of an attic-like hatch onto narrow mesh metal 
rails. We clip on our carabiners which are roped to a 250-metre metal wire 
track running along the base of those rails. We drag our ropes alongside us as 
we begin our 43-metre high walk across the 19th century rooftops of the Old 
Parliament House (Gamla riksdagshuset) on Riddarholmen island in Stockholm.

The Old Parliament opened in 1833 and served as the seat of Sweden’s 
government until 1905. Its iconic national romantic style waterfront facade of 
burnt orange and pale green towers was added in 1911. Today, it serves as a 
courthouse.

Stockholm is spread across 14 islands interlinked by 57 bridges, waterways, 
and pedestrian paths, and seeing it from the vantage of a rooftop gives a real 
sense of its maritime geography. From my starting spot high above Riddarholmen, 
I watch Baltic cruise ships sail into the harbour next to Gamla stan 
(Stockholm’s medieval old town) to my left, and docked boat hotels bob gently 
along Lake Mälaren to my right. Mustard yellow and pale ochre buildings with 
charcoal-coloured roofs dot the islands like toy houses.

We start with what I consider the easiest stretch of the walk – short climbs 
up and down two metal ladders with south side views towards Stockholm’s hipster 
island, Södermalm.

Seven storeys up, exposed to the elements with chilly gusts of wind whipping 
around us, I begin to question my comfort with heights. At which point I have 
to tackle the most hair-raising walkway, testing my nonexistent tightrope 
walking skills. Veerle offers up some navigational advice. “Try going sideways, 
it’s easier that way.” I shuffle along the narrowest edge of the parliament 
building, side-stepping like a crab, not daring to look down.

Once across, I check my nerves and am instantly rewarded with views of 
Kungsholmen island and Stadshuset (city hall), another iconic building marked 
by a 106-metre tower where the Nobel Prize banquet takes place each year.

A few short steps up and I am now on the final stretch of the circuit, back 
towards our opening hatch, balancing with no hand support, walking down rails 
across the roof which now slopes sharply down on both sides, and 
picture-perfect views of Gamla stan ahead.

Exhilaration courses through me and I turn to Veerle with a cheesy grin across 
my face.

“I know,” she smiles back before I utter a word. “You don’t want to get off 
the roof.”

 Smell the coffee … ‘We couldn’t imagine Vienna without it now.’ Photograph:

A dozen or so people are standing silently in a park in Vienna, their eyes 
closed, concentrating on breathing deeply through their noses.

This is Smells Like Wien Spirit <http://spaceandplace.at/SmellslikeWienSpirit>
, a new tour that invites people to explore the Austrian capital “like a dog” 
by utilising one of our most under-used senses – smell.

It’s the latest attempt by culture group Space and Place to offer an 
alternative insight into a city usually associated with quiet coffeehouses and 
imperial palaces.Following on the heels of his ugly buildings tour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/02/vienna-austria-ugly-walking-tour>
, Eugene Quinn believes it’s time for olfaction to play its part in urban 
exploration.

“Why are there so many seeing tours but not smelling or touching tours?” he 
asks. “Vienna is a city of good smells. If you compare the city to 15 years 
ago, people are wearing less fragrance, cars have become much cleaner and there 
are fewer large trucks. Many buses are now electric.”

It’s not the world’s first smells tour, however; the late urban planner and 
academic Victoria Henshaw 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/oct/19/victoria-henshaw> led similar 
expeditions around cities such as Edinburgh, Seattle and Barcelona.

“When does a smell belong to a city?” Quinn asks the group on our first stop, 
a Turkish bakery. “Migration changes the way a city smells. Some people might 
not think a Turkish bakery is a Viennese smell, but I think it is. All products 
are new at first, and then become normal. Coffee was originally a Turkish 
import but we couldn’t imagine Vienna without it now.”

Vienna is more multicultural than many may think. Around 50% of residents have 
a migrant background, says Quinn, originally from Britain.

The tour also takes in two of Vienna’s famous institutions: the Ottakringer 
brewery and the Manner chocolate wafer factory. While discussing the 
significance of the smells, Quinn interjects with personal stories, including 
one about a friend who loved the smell of chocolate so much she moved, to live 
closer to the factory.

Later on, the group pauses for breath at a public toilet in Yppenplatz, the 
square near the popular Brunnenmarkt. This is one of Vienna’s “fancy” toilets, 
kitted out with bird sounds and forest wallpaper. As Quinn explains, Vienna – 
which has the most public toilets of all metropolitan cities in Europe – has a 
special fondness for its waste management department, which “brings charisma to 
neighbourhoods.”

The monthly walking tour lasts about four hours, ending at Kaffee Alt Wien in 
the city centre. Not just for tourists, it’s for the Viennese as well. “The 
tour is a complete exploration of Vienna for visitors and locals,” says Quinn. 
“Because if you spend too long in a place, you don’t notice the smells any 
more.”
