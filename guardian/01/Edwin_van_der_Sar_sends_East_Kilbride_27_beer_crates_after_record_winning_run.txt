Ajax <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ajax> helped East Kilbride 
celebrate surpassing their world record of 26 successive wins after the 
Scottish Lowland League club secured a 3-1 victory against BSC Glasgow at 
K-Park on Saturday.

An Ajax-branded van drove on to the pitch at full-time filled with 27 crates 
of beer for East Kilbride’s players and staff and a congratulatory video 
message fromEdwin van der Sar 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/edwin-van-der-sar>, who is now a 
marketing director for the Dutch club.

“Many thanks to [Ajax] and [Van der Sar] for the message of congratulations 
and the 27 crates of beer!” the club tweeted. “Touch of class!”

Their midfielder Declan Hughes opened the scoring and, with the score at 2-1 
with five minutes remaining, Hughes bent in a free-kick to make sure of the 
team’s feat.

The win surpassed Ajax’s run in the 1971-72 season led by Johan Cruyff, but 
will not be officially recognised byGuinness World Records 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinness-world-records> as East Kilbride, 
who play in the fifth tier, are not a top-level side.
