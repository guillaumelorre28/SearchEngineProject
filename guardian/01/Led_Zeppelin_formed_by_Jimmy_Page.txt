Back in 1968, Jimmy Page was a hard-nosed rhythm'n'blues session musician. 
When his then band the Yardbirds split, with a swathe of tour dates yet to 
play, Page assembled an outfit from acquaintances of acquaintances. And so 
arguably the greatest rock band of all time –Led Zeppelin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/ledzeppelin> – began as the New Yardbirds on 
a Scandinavian tour undertaken to escape lawsuits from irate promoters; with a 
bustle, rather than a bang.
