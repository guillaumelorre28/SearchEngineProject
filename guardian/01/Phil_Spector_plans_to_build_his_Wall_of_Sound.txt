The secret history of pop? That of its producers, of whom arguably the 
greatest was Phil Spector, the originator of the layered Wall of Sound 
production style and the man dubbed the "first tycoon of teen" by Tom Wolfe.

Fresh out of Fairfax high school, the nerdy 18-year-old scraped together $40 
to record a one-song demo with three friends at Gold Star studios in 
Los Angeles. The result (Don't You Worry My Little Pet) was pretty terrible but 
secured them a second session, at which Spector pulled out a song he'd been 
polishing in his bedroom – a paean to his father (who had killed himself).

Up to this point, Spector was sure he'd become a performer, but this new 
track, To Know Him is to Love Him (borrowed from the words inscribed on his 
dad's gravestone), went on to sell a million when his group, the Teddy Bears, 
released it in September 1958 – and the troubled teenager became convinced that 
his future lay behind the mixing desk. It just never quite could be said that 
Spector kept himself in the shadows.

• This article was amended on 14 June 2011. The original said the words To 
Know Him is to Love Him were inscribed on his father's gravestone. The words 
were in fact To Know Him was to Love Him, whereas the song title is To Know Him 
is to Love Him. This has been corrected.
