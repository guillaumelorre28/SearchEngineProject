Overview

Leipzig is Germany’s boom-town. Last year, the city’s population went up by 
12,000, a rise of 2% taking the number of residents over 550,000 for the first 
time since reunification. Many were newcomers arriving with dreams of a 
near-empty, artistic paradise, buzzing with a do-it-yourself entrepreneurial 
spirit. A place where almost anything is possible.

There’s plenty of room to do it. In the old western industrial quarter of 
Plagwitz, for example, rows of empty factories wait to be transformed into 
studios and exhibition spaces along the lines of the sprawlingBaumwollspinnerei 
<http://www.spinnerei.de/> gallery complex, which this summer celebrates its 
10th birthday. Western Leipzig’s latest industrial metamorphosis is the
Kunstkraftwerk <http://www.kunstkraftwerk-leipzig.com/>. Once a crumbling, 
unsafe ruin, the former power station has been revamped into a mighty 
installation space now attracting experimental artists from all over the globe.

But with all the recent buzz – referred to sardonically by locals as “hypezig” 
– some areas are struggling to keep up with the pace of change. Plagwitz, long 
plugged as the beating heart of the city’s underground art scene, is said to be 
losing some of its edge. “Plagwitz has been the in area for years, but things 
have already moved on,” says art project manager Angela Straube-Bornberg. She 
says those disillusioned with Plagwitz now look to the city’s wilder, 
undeveloped eastern district. “The students all live there now. There are 
galleries and wild parties and projects everywhere.”

Behind the boarded-up shop fronts and pop-up galleries, clubs and cafes are 
perpetually opening up, and being shut down, sometimes within a matter of weeks.

“There are a lot of empty buildings around here and rents are still cheap,” 
says Noriko Minkus, co-founder of theJapanisches Haus 
<http://djh-leipzig.de/konzept>, a “post-growth”, not-for-profit community 
project on Eisenbahnstraße, the district’s core street. “All the young people 
starting projects makes it a really interesting area. But that means it will 
soon be under threat from gentrification, too.”

Alongside art exhibitions, concerts and readings, Minkus and her friends 
organise children’s workshops and communal meals aimed at “bottom-up 
international exchange” – bringing the local students closer to the area’s 
relatively large immigrant population.

Eisenbahnstraße is not everyone’s idea of the perfect playground. The street 
is infamous in Germany as a crime hotspot, disturbing Leipzig’s otherwise 
friendly, peaceful backwater vibe. But it’s far from being dangerous compared 
with many global cities. If you visit the Japanisches Haus on a Saturday 
evening, you can join its VoKü or “people’s kitchen” and, in exchange for a 
donation, share an informal, home-cooked meal with locals.

Techno’s still a big part of Leipzig’s music scene. There are four main techno 
clubs here, including Distillery. The newest is theInstitute für Zukunft 
<http://ifz.me/>, which opened about a year ago. Then in Plagwitz, there are 
Elipamanoke <http://elipamanoke.de/verein> and the Damenhandschuhfabrik 
<http://damenhandschuhfabrik.de/anfahrt>.
 Analogsoul’s Leipzig playlist. Listen to more tunes from the city’s bands and 
DJs at #ListentoLeipzig 
The east has smaller spots like Ost Apotheke 
<http://www.ost-apotheke.net/about1.html> – a squat-cum-hostel with a club 
built in. Many clubs in the area don’t even have a rental contract. People just 
help themselves to the empty buildings and get on with it. It’s harder than it 
used to be for these places popping up, though. In the early 1990s we ran 
Distillery illegally for two and a half years in a factory we just took over. 
They’d never last that long now. If you want live music, head to Plagwitz’s 
Karl-Heine-Straße and look for the pubs, which often have bands playing.Westwerk
 <https://www.facebook.com/pages/Westwerk-Leipzig/122293637886472>, a gig venue 
in an old factory building, is a good place to try. Or down in Connewitz, 
there’sDie Nato 
<http://nato-leipzig.de/index.php?cf_session=06cd1c0278a204b7e748e35ca13e2e41> 
andConne Island <http://www.conne-island.de/> - both are cultural centres 
hosting gigs and other events.

Leipzig has a certain buzz about it right now because of the really lively 
scene. The hype means the scene is growing more international. At Distillery, 
we still have our regulars, but we also hear a lot of different languages being 
spoken now. Leipzig’s a much better place to live than it was. The city has a 
certain kind of magic about it which is hard to describe. It comes when you 
really live here and experience it for yourself.”

It’s best to jump on a bike and get out of the city centre, which is dominated 
by chain restaurants – there’s no good reason to eat factory-made food when 
there’s some little place just opened in Plagwitz making the same thing from 
scratch. One brand new place isKaiserbad 
<https://www.facebook.com/kaiserbad.leipzig> (Karl-Heine-Straße 93 
<https://www.here.com/directions/drive/mylocation/Kaiserbad:51.330479,12.33096?map=51.33048,12.33096,13,traffic&x=ep>
), a beer garden and restaurant serving traditional meals such as schnitzel, 
along with salads and burgers. It opened in mid-July in a fantastic location at 
the former Westwerk factory complex. Another new Plagwitz hotspot isChumumi 
<http://www.chumumi.de/> (Zschochersche Straße 50a 
<https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Zschochersche+Str.+50,+04229+Leipzig,+Germany/@51.335196,12.3363666,13.79z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47a6f79fcfe63db5:0x51c79f60775c2f06>
) - a little Vietnamese place with great food and lovely decor. Choose from 
traditional Vietnamese soups (pho) or a wide variety of meat and fish dishes 
flavoured with peanuts, soy, Thai basil and ginger. It also has an 
extraordinary drinks menu – try the chrysanthemum and green sencha leaf tea 
with roasted soya beans.

If you’re vegan or vegetarian like me, you’ve come to the right place. Leipzig 
was recently named Germany’s most vegan-friendly city.Zest 
<http://zest-leipzig.de/> (Bornaische Straße 54

) in the southern district of Connewitz is one of the city’s oldest 
veggie/vegan restaurants and is well-known for its wines too. Choose from 
dishes such as shiitake seitan with polenta fries and lemon mirin mayonnaise or 
chanterelle mushroom and lovage ravioli with hazelnut tarator and cognac 
shallots.

Or try the vegetarian Moroccan dishes at Salon Casablanca (no website) (
Karl-Heine-Straße 47

spaghetti with Arabic tomato, courgette and pepper sauce served with sheep’s 
cheese. If you’re craving sugar afterwards,Café Albert

places here where local people have put their hearts and souls into making it 
work.

Leipzig’s a relaxed place and there’s loads of space for creativity – things 
happen here which would be unthinkable elsewhere. Everyone’s organising their 
own cultural events, little festivals, just doing it for themselves and for 
other locals. With The Market, we wanted to bring all those kinds of people 
together in one place so they could exchange ideas. We also wanted to broaden 
Leipzigers’ culinary horizons. The stands are all run by the chefs themselves 
so they can talk directly to their customers about what they’re eating. Like 
everywhere nowadays, the trend is towards locally and sustainably sourced 
ingredients. One of our stands sells pizza made from products grown atAnnalinde 
<http://annalinde-leipzig.de/>, an urban gardening project here in Plagwitz.

Street food markets, inspired by the ones in London, are taking the whole of 
Germany by storm right now, not just Leipzig. It started last year inBerlin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/nov/03/-sp-berlin-city-guide-bars-restaurants-hotels>
 and this summer has reached Munich and Hamburg. Now they’re springing up all 
over the place. We wanted ours to be more like an event that people would hang 
around at after they’d eaten. As well as art and design stalls, we’ve got 
street artists, fire shows, DJs and bands in the evening. We’re hoping people 
realise it’s not all about shopping. They can relax and soak up the laid-back 
Leipzig atmosphere.

Head east if you’re looking for underground culture. They’re doing some 
amazing things around Eisenbahnstraße. They aren’t established galleries, but 
I’d say just go and discover, especially in the evening. There’s interesting 
nightlife going on there too. Trythis colour-coded map 
<http://www.leipziger-osten.de/content/leben-im-stadtteil/kreativ-im-leipziger-osten/>
, which will give you an idea of various art projects in the east.

In Plagwitz, visitors should go to the D21 gallery 
<http://www.d21-leipzig.de/index.php/ueber-d21.html>. It’s part of the Lindenow 
<http://www.lindenow.org/Lindenow/> artists’ network, which recently helped 
kick the far-right NPD party out of its headquarters here. Then down on 
Karl-Heine-Straße, above a junk shop, you’ll findDelikatessenhaus 
<http://delikatessenhaus.com/english.html>, a gallery showcasing the work of 
young graphic artists.

For visitors to the city in October, there’s the Designers’ Open 
<http://www.designersopen.com/>, a design fair with satellites throughout the 
city. But there aren’t many designer boutiques in Leipzig – shopping’s not 
really part of the lifestyle. At the weekend everyone’s out in the park. That’s 
confusing for tourists, though, wandering into neighbourhoods and seeing empty 
stores. It can be eerie walking down the street and finding no one’s around. 
When I first moved here, I thought it was like being in a film the whole time. 
But space means if you want to start something, there’s nothing stopping you. 
In other cities, New York say, it’s expensive, highly competitive and the 
turnover rate is high, artists have to make their mark quickly. Here, someone 
just buys an old factory, renovates it and starts planning their exhibition

At Kunstkraftwerk, I’m looking to inject some multiculturalism, which is still 
missing in the arts here. Despite all the hype, Leipzig’s still a very German 
city, with a strong classical tradition. But our factory space here dominates 
the scene. Against that, only new, bold art forms really work. Over the next 
year, we’ll be hosting installations, video, photography and large-scale 
sculpture by artists from all over the world.

Angela Merkel’s old student club
There are lots of good restaurants and bars on Barfussgässchen

 right by the Marktplatz. And nearby is the historic beer cellarAuerbachskeller 
<http://www.auerbachs-keller-leipzig.de/#panel-tab-id2>. If you’re feeling like 
going out and celebrating with local people, there are lots of places you can 
go. How about a beach party with fresh cocktails at theLa Playa beach bar 
<http://www.beach-club-leipzig.de/>? Or dancing alongside Leipzig’s beautiful 
people atClub L1 <http://www.club-l1.de/>? If you are into alternative or indie 
sounds, the right place to be would be surelyElsterartig 
<http://elsterartig.de/>, which has free admission. Visitors should also check 
out the cultural centre and former student clubMoritzbastei 
<http://www.moritzbastei.de/>, set up within historic vaults that were 
originally part of the old fortifications of Leipzig. When she was a student at 
Karl Marx university, chancellor Angela Merkel was among those who helped 
restore the structure to create a club for students.

The Bruno-Plache-Stadion (nicknamed “das Bruno”), in Probstheida, the home of 
the FC LokomotiveLeipzig <http://preview.gutools.co.uk/global/leipzig> football 
club, is a must-see for any football fan with its 93-year-old stand (kept 
almost as it was when it opened). The club was a European Cup Winner’s Cup 
finalist in 1987, losing 0-1 to Ajax, and is well known for its UEFA Cup 
matches with the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, Wolverhampton Wanderers and 
Ipswich Town. The beer and bratwurst, fair prices and fair play will appeal to 
traditional football fans.

Puppet theatre
Westflügel Lindenfels <http://www.westfluegel.de/> is located in the very arty 
west of the city at Hähnelstrasse 27, in Plagwitz.Neo Rauch 
<http://www.davidzwirner.com/artists/neo-rauch/>’s studio is just five minutes 
away and numerous galleries and cafes are dotted all over the area. The 
building houses Leipzig’s foremost puppetry theatre with plays being put on 
nearly every week by Westflügel’s own players or international ensembles. The 
building itself is full of character – it opened as a ballroom in 1900, and 
became a factory for decades thereafter and only narrowly escaped total 
desolation by being lovingly resurrected in the last 10 years. It is still 
inhabited by the character of lost places while coming to life on performance 
nights and every Friday as a cheap and cheerful bar with free concerts, impro 
theatre and great people.

We did a trip around Leipzig in a Trabant, the car that’s such a symbol of the 
former East Germany, and with it you can do a fantastic city tour – much cooler 
than with a touristic bus. Leipzig is a great city and we had a nice time 
touring through with “our” Trabi.

The Riverside Forest almost splits Leipzig in two, meaning that you can get 
from one end of the city to the other without using roads. Register with the 
public bike hire companyNextbike <http://www.nextbike.de/en/leipzig/>, get a 
map and plan a good hour to cycle through the woods to the lake Cospudener See, 
to the south of the city. The lake is good for swimming and has a cool harbour 
with restaurants. The cycle around the lake takes around 20 mins. If you are 
daring enough to get your kit off, there is the beautifulSauna im See 
<http://www.sauna-im-see.de/> on the lake next to the harbour.
