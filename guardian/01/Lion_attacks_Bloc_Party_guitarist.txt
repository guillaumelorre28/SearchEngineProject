Bloc Party's Russell Lissack ended up in hospital last month when a lion 
attacked him. The guitarist was visiting a wild animal sanctuary while on tour 
with Ash in South Africa when the animal bit him, drawing blood. During time 
off around shows in Johannesburg and Cape Town, Lissack went on a field trip 
with Ash frontman Tim Wheeler. He was playing with a cuddly little lion cub –

 over at Spinner – when it attacked.

No matter the cat's youth, there's no messing about when it comes to 
man-eating carnivores. Lissack was taken to hospital, where he received 
treatment and a tetanus booster. Within hours of the musicians' visit, the 
hospital was sealed off, according to a band spokesperson, after two men died 
of an unrelated, and unidentified, virus. To make matters worse, the band had a 
car crash on their way back to the hotel.

Happily, no one sustained further injuries and everyone is now fine, Spinner 
reports. Ash are back in the UK, preparing their second anthology of A-Z 
singles. It's not clear whether Lissack will continue playing with them; with 
Bloc Party on hiatus, he wasinvited into the group

for a string of live dates. Lissack's electronic pop side project, Pin Me Down, 
released their debut in April.
