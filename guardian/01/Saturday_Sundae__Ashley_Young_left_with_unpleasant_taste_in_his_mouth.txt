MAN OF THE DAY

What was a young, debutant defender doing so far up the pitch in open play 
during injury time? The wayEric Dier took the most dramatic of winners spoke of 
a big all-round talent.

GOAL OF THE DAY

Any shot with the whip and post-kissing satisfaction generated by Aiden 
McGeady’sat Leicester bears watching again and again.

STAT OF THE DAY

Jamie Cureton is 39 in 11 days’ time and this is his 21st season. His goal for 
Dagenham & Redbridge at Burton meant he has only failed to score in one of them.

SCORE OF THE DAY

Haywards Heath Town play at the 10th level of the pyramid, so may have 
expected to give level nine Molesey a game in the FA Cup extra preliminary 
round. They lost 11-0.

TEARGASSING OF THE DAY

Santi Cazorla didn’t expect a face full of vanishing spray as referee Jon Moss 
marked out 10 yards at the Emirates.

DOUBLE TAKE OF THE DAY

Did a bird relieve itself into Ashley Young’s mouth at Old Trafford? The clip 
went viral – an early defeat for Premier League efforts to stop people sharing 
Vines, especially with Gary Lineker tweeting it.

OVERREACTION OF THE DAY

An Upton Park pitch invader’s free-kick, saved by Adrián, was impressive – so 
much that Christian Eriksen, head in hands, seemed to think it would have 
counted.

PUNDIT WATCH

“The quality of our forwards should win it” – Paul Scholes, still adjusting to 
being neutral with BT Sport – and called it wrong, too.
