The 29-year-old Messi, a multiple trophy winner with Barcelona, has now been 
part of four final defeats with the national team, three in the Copa América 
and at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

“Messi must carry on in the national team ... because he still has a lot to 
give, because he’ll get to [the 2018 World Cup hosts] Russia with chances of 
being world champion,” Maradona told the Argentinian daily La Nación.

“He has to lean more on the lads who can help him take the team forward and 
less on those who say he should leave,” added Maradona, who played in two World 
Cup finals.

“Messi was abandoned and I don’t want to abandon him. That’s why I want to 
talk to him, to fight against all those who abandoned him,” said Maradona, who 
coached Messi andArgentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> at 
the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

A dejected Messi, who had said he would swap his five World Player of the Year 
awards for one title with Argentina, announced after the match he was leaving 
the national team.

“In the dressing room I thought that this is the end for me with the national 
team, it’s not for me,” he said. “I tried so hard to be champion with 
Argentina. Now I am leaving without having managed it,” he said after the 
defeat at the tournament hosted by the United States to mark the centenary of 
South America’s flagship competition.

There was a strong show of support for Messi when the team returned to Buenos 
Aires, with fans displaying banners at the airport saying: “Without you we’re 
nothing, don’t go Messi” and “Stay Messi, you’re the best”.

A call went out on social media for a demonstration to be held on Saturday at 
the Obelisco monument in the centre of Buenos Aires, a traditional spot for 
celebrating sporting victories, to urge Messi to reconsider.

The president Mauricio Macri, a former chairman of Boca Juniors who was 
pictured watching Sunday’s match wearing an Argentina shirt, joined in the show
