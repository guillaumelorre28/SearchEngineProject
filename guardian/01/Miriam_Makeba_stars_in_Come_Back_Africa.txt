The feisty township singer Miriam Makeba was already a star in her native 
South Africa when she played a brief cameo in a controversial US anti-apartheid 
film called Come Back, Africa. The docudrama was covertly filmed by the 
American director Lionel Rogosin under the noses of hostile authorities before 
being smuggled abroad, where it served as an early document of the iniquities 
of apartheid.

Makeba was both victim and beneficiary of this clandestine film. Furious South 
African authorities revoked her passport, forcing her to seek asylum in the US, 
where Makeba quickly became a huge celebrity. She appeared on the Steve Allen 
show in November 1959, performed for the likes of Duke Ellington and Miles 
Davis at the Village Vanguard, hobnobbed with Marlon Brando, Harry Belafonte 
and Sammy Davis Jr and was even presented to President Kennedy in 1962.

Her friends soon followed her out of the country. Makeba's on-off boyfriend 
Hugh Masekela joined her township-themed touring musical, King Kong, as did 
pianist Dollar Brand. Before long, most of SA's thriving jazz scene, including 
the Blue Notes, would all settle in Britain or the US, bringing a unique 
musical culture to the world and leading the fight against apartheid in exile.
