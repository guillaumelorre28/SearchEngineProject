Kashima Antlers in going down 2-1 in theirClub World Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/worldclubchampionship> match.

The Oceania champions were in front five minutes into the second half thanks 
to Dae Wook Kim, but Kashima’s Shuhei Akasaki levelled on 67 minutes and Mu 
Kanazaksi grabbed the winner two minutes from time in Yokohama.

“I think that we defended well. In the end we tired a bit,” Ramon Tribulietx 
said.

“Kashima made it very difficult. They were very aggressive and they made our 
lives very hard.

“Unfortunately we are on the losing side. I’m proud of how we played though. 
We came very close.”

It was difficult to travel to Japan and try to dominate the national 
champions, who played a different rhythm, Tribulietx said.

“In New Zealand <https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand> the games are a 
bit slower, but no excuses, we played a great game and in the end it didn’t 
happen for us today.”

Auckland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/auckland> will return home to 
prepare for their next domestic match, against Eastern Suburbs in Panmure.

Tribulietx also faces interest from Wellington Phoenix over the vacant head 
coach’s role following the resignation of Ernie Merrick.

The Antlers are representing hosts Japan in the seven-team tournament and next 
face the South African Sundowns in Osaka on Sunday. The winners of that tie 
meet European champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals.

The final takes place in Yokohama on December 18.

Auckland were also eliminated in the first round of the annual seven-club 
tournament last year, beaten 2-0 by Japanese club Sanfrecce Hiroshima.
