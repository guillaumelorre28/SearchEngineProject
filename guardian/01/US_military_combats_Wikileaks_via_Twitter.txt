How does the US military's public relations combat the release of 91,000 
gruesome war logs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/afghanistan-the-war-logs> from 
Afghanistan through the Wikileaks website? By opening a new front on the social 
media battleground.

Generals are often accused of fighting the last war – but not Admiral Mike 
Mullen, the most seniorUS military 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military> officer as chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff. Mullen today made his first public response to the war 
logs leak – and instead of holding a press conference or releasing a statement, 
Mullen made his views known in 140 characters through Twitter.

Posting as @thejointstaff <http://twitter.com/thejointstaff>, Mullen wrote:
 Appalled by classified docs leak to Wikileaks & decision to post. It changes 
nothing on Afghanistan strategy or our relationship w/Pakistan 
Mullen was travelling in Afghanistan when the news of the war logs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/afghanistan-the-war-logs> – carried 
in the Guardian, New York Times and Der Spiegel – first came to light. Shortly 
after tweeting his thoughts Mullen held a more conventional press conference in 
Baghdad.
Mullen's tweet came as President Obama made his first comment on the 
controversy, although Obama used the comparatively elderly format of a 
statement in the White House Rose Garden. "These documents don't reveal any 
issues that haven't already informed our public debate on Afghanistan," Obama 
said.
