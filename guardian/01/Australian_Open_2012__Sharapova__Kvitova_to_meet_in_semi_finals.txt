The former and reigning Wimbledon champions Maria Sharapova and Petra Kvitova 
will meet in theAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> semi-finals after both won 
in straight sets .

Sharapova won 6-2, 6-3 against fellow Russian Ekaterina Makarova, who knocked 
out the five-times champion Serena Williams in the previous round. Kvitova 
earlier reached the last four at Melbourne Park for the first time with a 6-4, 
6-4 win over the unseeded Italian Sara Errani.

Kvitova beat Sharapova in last year's Wimbledon final to claim her first grand 
slam title. "Obviously it was a tough one at Wimbledon," Sharapova said. "She's 
full of confidence and playing the best tennis right now. I look forward to it."

Sharapova and Kvitova also kept alive their chances of claiming the world No1 
ranking, which Caroline Wozniacki will vacate on Monday after her quarter-final 
loss to Kim Clijsters. Sharapova must repeat her 2008 Australian title win. 
Kvitova only has to match or better the run of Victoria Azarenka, the only 
other player still in the running this week for the top spot.

Sharapova has dropped one set and lost 21 games en route to her first 
Australian Open semi-final since she won the 2008 final â€“ the last of her three 
major titles. "It's been a long road back to this stage," said Sharapova, who 
spent 10 months off court with a shoulder injury that required surgery.

Kvitova was far from her best against an opponent making her debut in a grand 
slam quarter-final, and with a 0-24 record against top-10 players. The 
second-seeded Czech made 44 errors and had to come back from a break down in 
the second set.

"I was a little nervous because I knew that everybody expect it will be easy 
match," Kvitova said. "Probably I had in my head that it's a good draw."
