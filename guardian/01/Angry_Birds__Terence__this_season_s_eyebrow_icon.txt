Terence. You know Terence. He’s the guy who sped up your commute and probably 
contributed to that RSI in your index finger. He’s also this season’s eyebrow 
inspiration. While he’s not glaringly up there withCara Delevingne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/cara-delevingne> and Suki Waterhouse 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suki_Waterhouse>, he’s worth thinking about given
The Angry Birds Movie <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1985949/> is out and mega 
brows are in.

“Brows have been huge for a while now,” explains beauty writer Anita 
Bhagwandas, but, “it’s not just about Delevingne. Culturally, they represent a 
divide between that very arched, defined Kardashian-esque look where brows are 
groomed to perfection – and the more 90s-inspired tribe that focuses on a more 
natural, bare-faced beauty aesthetic.”

For evidence, look back at the past week. Take Kristen Stewart 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/kristen-stewart> at Cannes last week. It was 
her festival, really, given her 80% commitment to glam (head-to-toe Chanel), 
cleverly muted with heavy kohl, bold roots and giant brows. DittoAmal Clooney 
<http://Amal Clooney> who stayed very kempt, as per. Or Kim Kardashian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian> at the Vogue festival 
last weekend who has, apparently, gone a little more natural – save the brows, 
which remained like thick, manicured icing on her uncontoured baked (yes, 
that’s a real beauty term) face. It’s a bit brave, but if you dye your hair, go 
monochrome – comically dark brows with bleached hair. Somewhere betweenDaenerys 
Targaryen <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> and The 
Face.

Think supersize. Cartoon. If you think they’re big enough, go bigger. This 
season colours should pop, and eyebrows should stand out at 50 paces, or with a 
paparazzi lens. Unfortunately for the over-pluckers, this could be 
pie-in-the-sky thinking. Still, if you have tiny brows or sparse ones,
Illamasqua’s new Brow Build 
<http://www.illamasqua.com/shop/eyes/brows/brow-builds/> is “very good”, 
according to Bhagwandas. “It has tiny hairs in it to bulk your brows up.
Anastasia’s Dipbrow 
<https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/anastasia-beverly-hills-dipbrow-pomade.html> is 
still the best brow shaping pomade ever,” she adds. “Benefit 
<https://www.benefitcosmetics.com/uk/en-gb/brow-makeup> has tonnes of ace brow 
products. And I also love the Arch Brow Sculpting Pencil fromHourglass 
<http://www.spacenk.com/uk/en_GB/brands/h/hourglass/arch-brow-sculpting-pencil-MUS300023748.html>
 – it gives great angles for thick or thin brows.”
