Make it feel like a Caribbean summer with this refreshing concoction, laced 
with rum for a welcome shot of warmth in the winter months. Add some 
grated fresh coconut or slices of mango and pawpaw to make it even more 
tropical.

Serves 4-6

A small pineapple
4-6 tbsp honey
1 lime, rind and a squeeze of juice
1 passionfruit
50ml dark rum

1. Peel the pineapple and remove the tough core. Roughly chop the pineapple 
into bite-size pieces and put it in a large bowl with the honey and lime rind. 
Squeeze some lime juice over the top.

2. Scoop out the passionfruit and add the seeds and juice to the pineapple.

3. Pour over the rum, then put the salad in the fridge to chill 
and allow the flavours to combine.
