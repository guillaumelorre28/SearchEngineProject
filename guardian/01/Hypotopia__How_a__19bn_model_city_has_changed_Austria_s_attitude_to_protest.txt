Riots and demonstrations have gripped the continent’s capitals for the past 
five years of the eurozone crisis – but in Vienna, a group of innovative 
students are trying a different form of urban protest.


Corrupt politicians, jailed banking bosses and alleged connections to shady 
mafia groups in the Balkans – the story offailed Bavarian bank Hypo Alpe Adria 
<http://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2014/08/28/the-hypo-alpe-adria-bank-mess-at-a-glance/>
 has been anongoing catastrophe for Austria 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-17/austria-s-faymann-channels-1931-creditanstalt-crash-on-hypo-alpe.html>
. But the largely passive public reaction to the €19bn bailout of this “bad 
bank” inspired a group of architecture, civil engineering and urban planning 
students to pose the question: what could you build with €19bn?

Over four months, these students from the Technical University of Vienna 
designed and created amodel city <http://milliardenstadt.at/> for the same 
price as the bailout in one of Vienna’s main squares, Karlsplatz, as a protest 
project that has captured the attention of the country.

Named “Hypotopia”, combining the name of the failed bank with the utopia the 
students wanted to create, the model city could theoretically hold 102,574 
inhabitants – making it the sixth largest city in Austria, a country with a 
population roughly equal to London. After an unexpected nomination, Hypotopia 
is now in the running to be “Austrian word of the year”, and a social media 
campaign is rapidly gathering signatures.

The fledgling team built the city without any funding or support. They wanted 
to help the public visualise the enormous scale of the bailout. Project founder 
and civil engineering student Lukas Zeilbauer said: “Hypotopia is more than 
just an architecture project, it’s a protest in concrete.

“The online petition calling for an official inquiry didn’t get much more than 
150,000 signatures. If the public actually knew just how much money had been 
taken from us, then there’d be many, many more. Education is an important part 
of that.”

Hypotopia was built from concrete and wooden blocks donated by businesses, and 
stood on display outside Vienna’s famous Karlskirche church for three weeks in 
October. The project attracted tens of thousands of visitors. Several prominent 
figures visited, including the president Heinz Fischer and politicians from all 
important political parties. Accompanying lectures were held in the 
neighbouring technical university on a range of topics concerning the city, 
including economics, education and green cities.

The exhibition culminated in a protest on 30 October, in which more than 1,000 
Austrians marched around the Ringstraβe road around the city centre to 
parliament. Demonstrators used trolleys and wheelbarrows to carry more than 25 
tonnes of Hypotopia’s concrete blocks with them, carrying a banner with the 
words: “Wir tragen die Last der Zukunft” (We bear the burden of the future).

city. Photograph: Armin Walcher 
Matthias Strolz, founder and chairman of the liberal New Austria party, was 
one of the MPs who joined the march. “At parliament we’ve dumped the sixth 
largest city in Austria – between Klagenfurt and Innsbruck in terms of size – 
which you could build with the money of the Hypo disaster,”Strolz  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULO82oBd0Dw>said. “This is a memorial against 
political incompetence, a signal to politicians that this will go on further.”

The sentiment was echoed by many protesters, who felt the creation of 
Hypotopia had a strong impact on public perception of the scandal. “People were 
absolutely shocked by how much €19bn is,” said one organiser. “The Austrian 
people just can’t think in such dimensions.”

Hypo Alpe Adria was nationalised in 2009 to prevent its collapse after a 
series of corruption scandals. €5.5bn of tax-payers’ money was immediately 
poured in to cover outstanding loans, with a further €10-14bn projected to 
cover the rest. Public disapproval for the government’s handling of the scandal 
stands at 65% and most Austrians would have preferred to let the bank go under 
than fund its bailout. Despite this, Hypotopia’s creators felt the public were 
too willing to accept the loss of their money.

co-creator of Hypotopia. 
With an enormous theoretical budget of €19bn, Zeilbauer’s team of students had 
the freedom to think big. They meticulously designed the city to industrial 
standards, factoring in the costs of everything from soil excavations to 
education. Hypotopia contains more than 1,200 components, including rubbish 
incinerators, power plants and €2.15bn of planned transport infrastructure.

“We used real costs for everything. Every wooden and concrete block you see in 
the model is a building,” explained Zeilbauer. “We know how many people live on 
each floor, the purpose of each building, and how much it would cost per square 
metre. We’ve included everything a city needs – though you’ll find there are no 
banks here in Hypotopia.”

Although the city was disassembled for the protest march, the brains behind 
Hypotopia want its success to continue. Most of the concrete blocks are being 
recycled but a few are being retained for next year’s Vienna Biennale art 
festival to ensure the project lives on.

“Our online platforms are also still running,” said urban planner Manuel 
Oberaufner. “The fact that our exhibition and the physical model of Hypotopia 
is gone does not mean that our idea has died.”
