A 93-year-old bridge deemed “structurally deficient” proved not so weak after 
all when a demolition team tried to bring it down with powerful explosives.

Despite the charges going off on cue on the Broadway Bridge between Little 
Rock and North Little Rock, when the smoke cleared the steel arch and deck 
stood damaged but unmoved over theArkansas

People who had gathered to watch reacted with gasps as the explosives went off 
with a loud report – but then broke into murmurs and laughter as it became 
evident the bridge was not going anywhere. “Uh-oh … epic fail!” said one 
observer who caught the blast and the audible reaction on camera.

Severing the span should have taken about 30 seconds but a demolition crew had 
to spend another five hours on the job, eventually pulling it down with a cable.


Arkansas highway department spokesman Danny Straessle said the blasts weakened 
the bridge but parts of it fell against themselves and none fell into the river.


Three other implosions are planned during a six-month project to completely 
replace the old bridge. Workers meanwhile are removing steel from the water so 
barge traffic can resume.
