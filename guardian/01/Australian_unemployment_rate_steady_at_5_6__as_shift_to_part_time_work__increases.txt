Australia’s unemployment rate remained steady last month, at 5.6%.


But the growing shift away from full-time work, towards part-time employment, 
continued unabated nationally.

Bureau of Statistics data, released on Thursday, shows the number of people in 
full-time employment has fallen by 69,900 since December.

In comparison, part-time employment has increased by 132,700, with its share 
of overall employment increasing from 31.1% to 32%.

Economists have said wages are growing so slowly in Australia because the 
demand for labour, and the composition of labour, remains insufficient to make 
wages rise in a significant way.

Jacqui Jones, the program manager of the Bureau of Statistics’ labour and 
income branch, said the latest jobs data showed the shift towards part-time 
employment had been more pronounced for men than for women.

“Over the past year, part-time employment has increased from around 31% of 
employment to 32%,” Jones said. “That’s a relatively large shift, if you 
consider that it was around 29% 10 years ago.”

The trend monthly hours worked increased by 3.2m hours (0.2%), with increases 
in total hours worked by both full-time and part-time workers.
