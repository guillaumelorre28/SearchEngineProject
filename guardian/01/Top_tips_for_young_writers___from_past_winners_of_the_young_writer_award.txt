 ‘The best novels are written with passion, not calculation’ ... the writer 
Sarah Waters. Photograph: Murdo Macleod 
1. While you’re writing, read like mad – but read analytically. You will never 
be able to put a book together without an understanding of how other books 
work. I suspect that this is more a matter of instinct than anything else – but 
you can nurture that instinct by looking at other texts and thinking, ‘What’s 
successful here? What’s failing? And why?’


2. Don’t write for the market. Clue yourself up about what’s out there and 
what sells – and then forget it. The best novels are written with passion, not 
calculation. Your writing has to come from your heart, not from your desire to 
the Next Big Thing.

3. When you submit to an agent, be professional about it. Do your research: 
there’s a lot of advice available online, for example, about writing synopses 
and covering letters. Approach agents whose lists are a good match with your 
work. And don’t be squeamish or apologetic! Agents need books to survive, as do 
publishers. There is no reason why they shouldn’t want yours.

 ‘You are already a writer. It’s important not to forget that’ ... the writer 
Ross Raisin. Photograph: Angus Muir/PR 
1. Make sure that you know why it is that you want to break into publication. 
And not to ask yourself this until after you have finished your book. 
Publication does not turn you, as if by magic, into a writer. You are already a 
writer. It’s important not to forget that.

2. Finish your book. This is the main piece of advice any author will give 
you. Whatever is your writing process, ensure that you have got to the very end 
of it – and are satisfied that you have honed each single word – before you 
begin to think about the whole other process of publication.

3. An agent who is prepared to represent you does not necessarily equate to 
the right agent. Even if only one shows any interest, the relationship has to 
be right for you, so make sure that you speak and meet with them until you are 
sure. And if you have an instinct that you do not fully trust their ability or 
desire to wholeheartedly invest their time and expertise in you and your book, 
then go back to point 1) and ask yourself again what it is that you are wanting 
to gain from publication. 

Adam Foulds – winner in 2008 for The Truth About These Strange Times
 ‘It helps to have the sensation that you are writing a book that doesn’t 
exist and that you, as a reader, would like to exist’ ... the writer Adam 
Foulds. Photograph: Richard Saker 
1. Think only about the work, about writing a book as good as you can make it. 
It helps to have the sensation that you are writing a book that doesn’t exist 
and that you, as a reader, would like to exist.

2. Surround yourself with kind and supportive people. Be kind and supportive 
to yourself.

3. Know your prerogatives as writer. Here’s a lovely sentence from AN Wilson’s 
biography of Tolstoy to remind you: “Tolstoy, like all true writers, carried 
his life about with him, created the very cocoon of observant detachment, 
indolence and sensuality in which a creative mind flourishes.”

(and 4. Once the work is done, look for an agent. There are plenty of guides 
to doing that online.)

1. Believe in your talent, if you have it.

2. Ignore the peripheral.

3. Find a good editor.

 ‘Expect it to be hard’ ... the writer Andrew Cowan. Photograph: Martin 
Figura/PR 
1. There’s no point in advising you to read because you wouldn’t be a writer 
unless you were already a reader, would you? Just don’t go reading the latest 
prizewinners and bestsellers in the hope of discovering what publishers are 
looking for. By the time your book is written, they’ll be looking for something 
else.

2. Expect it to be hard. Expect the achievement to fall short of the ambition, 
but stay true to your ambition: be dogged, keep going.

3. Join a reputable MA programme. You’ll not only find a community of readers 
– which is, as Bernard Malamud said, a miraculous thing – but access to agents 
and publishers, who are actively looking to recruit new writers from the best 
courses.

 ‘Get used to your own company’ ... the writer Helen Simpson. Photograph: Linda 
Nylind/Guardian 
1. Be brave, be honest and only write what you want to write, not what you 
think you ought to write.

2. Get used to your own company and to working on your own.

3. Keep at it!
