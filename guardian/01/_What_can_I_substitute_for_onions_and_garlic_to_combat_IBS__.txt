I have recently put been on a low Fodmap diet to combat IBS. As a result, I 
need to omit onion, shallots and garlic from my diet. Could you please provide 
suggestions for any substitutions?

Try to see your new diet as an opportunity to explore different flavours and 
ingredients. When looking at a base for, say, a stew or meat dish, then some 
finely diced celery, fresh fennel (no more than about 45g for both), carrot and 
the green part of spring onions sweated in olive oil will intensify the 
flavours. Another vegetable that I love is sweet potato – it can add that soft 
texture that onions give to dishes. Remember it does not take long to cook, so 
dice it and add to your base. Alternatively, cook it separately with a little 
thyme and ginger and add to dishes towards the end of cooking.

A couple of easy-to-prepare ideas with loads of flavour are gremolata and 
rocket pesto. For the gremolata, exchange the garlic for chives. Finely chop 
parsley, lemon zest and the chives and sprinkle on to fish and gluten-free 
pasta dishes. Make a big batch and I'm sure you'll find yourself using it on 
everything from gluten-free sandwiches to boiled eggs.

Rocket pesto is a cinch to make and can be used to bump up the flavour of 
soups, stir fries and roast lamb or pork. Just put a small bag of rocket in the 
food processor with a tbsp of toasted pine nuts and 60g grated parmesan. Blitz 
with a steady stream of good olive oil until thick and season to taste.

You can also experiment with herbs, spices and flavoured oils. I recently 
tried a cumin flavoured oil, which was delicious – though I have to admit that 
a really good quality lemon-infused olive oil is hard to beat.
