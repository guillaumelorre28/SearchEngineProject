I started out working as a restaurant kitchen-hand when I was a teenager, 
before getting trained up as a chef on the job. So by the time I arrived at 
uni, I had a score of recipes in my back pocket.

My flatmates would generally rip into me for doing slightly cheffy things, 
such as cooking salmon with fresh parsley – but they’d change their tune when 
they wanted a Christmas dinner.

If you’re a bit ropey in the kitchen, it’s worth practising before you have 
too much coursework, so here are a few tips guaranteed to keep you alive until 
your January exams:

Keep it simple

Let’s face it, you’ll never use a slow cooker. Or a hand blender. Or an 
electric whisk. Dispense with gizmos the weight of pavement slabs; they’re all 
pointless for the average undergrad. As Megan Webb, who studies teaching at 
Bath Spa University, puts it: “The piece of kitchen equipment I used the most 
was a pair of scissors, to open all the packaging on my many new appliances.”

You’ll be better off stocking up on the basics, like one or two pots and pans 
– plus food staples such as tinned tomatoes, frozen veg, rice and pasta – 
rather than loads of cumbersome equipment.

Don’t bother with books

This hardly needs saying, but it’s 2016: the sensible ports of call for your 
culinary inspiration are places likeBBC Good Food <http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/>,
jamieoliver.com <http://www.jamieoliver.com/>, and Pinterest 
<https://uk.pinterest.com/>. 

Housemates, especially international housemates, can be another great source 
of interesting recipes.

The freezer is your friend

In my first year I lived with a housemate who would bulk-buy vacuum-packed 
chicken breasts on the internet at a huge discount, only to end up throwing a 
third of them away because they wouldn’t all fit in his drawer in the communal 
freezer.

It was a good idea, poorly executed – but I was inspired. Thinking forward in 
chunks of a week to 10 days is the best way to ensure you don’t waste food and 
money.

Amy Donaghy, a psychology student at York, can testify to that. “After a long 
day of lectures, the last thing I ever wanted to do was start cooking from 
scratch. You’ll be thankful for those extra portions you froze last week,” she 
says.

Vitamins aren’t expensive

It’s true that you can live very cheaply on a diet of processed, orangey-beige 
food. But it’s equally easy to keep costs low and have a more nutritional diet. 
Rachel Coué, who studies sociology at the University of Chester, says: 
“Cinnamon rolls might be £2 but bananas are £1.70. Eating healthy keeps your 
mum and your bank account happy – which is a double bonus if they’re the same 
thing.”

Think about which ingredients will go a long way. A punnet of mushrooms or a 
bag of red peppers might seem like a bit of a waste of your money and time when 
you can choose from aisles of two-for-one ready meals, but if you make healthy 
ingredients go far – a bolognese becomes a chilli, a fajita filling tomorrow’s 
curry – the cost levels out.

Experiment and enjoy

Want to try making an authentic chicken fried rice in the early hours? 
No-one’s going to stop you, except maybe the person whose room backs on to the 
extractor fan. But ignore them. Trying new tastes while cooking for yourself is 
the best way to stop your meals becoming a chore.

Washing-up in a shared kitchen is, on the other hand, less fun. Wash up as you 
go along, and cook using as few pans as possible.

This vegetarian curry couldn’t get much simpler, and it’s full of healthy 
ingredients that make for a flavoursome and balanced meal. You can cook it in 
15 minutes, in two pans with two or three utensils – so there’s minimal 
washing-up.


The following measurements make two portions of curry:

sultanas 200g

apples 2

chickpeas 1 tin

tikka masala curry paste 3 tbsp

coconut milk 1 tin

basmati rice 75g

Salt and pepper to taste – plus any other herbs and spices you might fancy

 * Heat a little oil in a saucepan and fry the curry paste gently for two 
minutes. 
 * Put the rice in a separate pan of cold water with a little bit of salt, 
bring to the boil, and simmer for 10 minutes. 
 * When the paste is fried off and your rice is coming to the boil, add all 
the chickpeas and coconut milk, and any additional seasoning you might fancy, 
like fresh coriander. 
 * Simmer the curry on a medium to low heat for 5-6 minutes and keep stirring. 
 * Add cubed apple and the sultanas, and simmer for a further 2-3 minutes. 
 * Serve up.

You could add in potato (stick in cold water and boil for ten minutes, then 
add to the chickpeas); or chicken (brown in a little oil, add paste, simmer the 
whole lot for five minutes longer). If you don’t like the dish the first time 
round, think of it as a template for further experiments.
