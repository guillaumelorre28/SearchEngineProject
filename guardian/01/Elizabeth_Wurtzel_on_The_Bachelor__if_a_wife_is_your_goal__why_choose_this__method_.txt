The Bachelor <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-bachelor> is its 
own universe, with a code of conduct that is alien to anyone who lives outside 
of it. Now in its 20th season, the 1-2-3 marriage show continues to celebrate 
the fool for love, the one who will fly all the way from here to there to find 
his one and only. Over time, the premise hasn’t changed, but episodes have 
grown in length – each is now two hours long, a weekly movie of poolside 
cocktails while the dating maypole winds around.


This season, the fool is Ben Higgins, an all-American mensch, with the old 
fashioned charm of a vacuum cleaner salesman (except, of course, he works in 
tech). You would immediately open your door to him. He’s charming. He’sgood. 
After he met his suitors on Monday night’s premiere, he called his parents. He 
was a quarterback in high school.

On the last season of the show, Ben had his heart broken by bachelorette 
Kaitlyn <http://www.people.com/article/bachelor-ben-higgins-kaitlyn-bristowe>, 
the “former dance instructor” – which is what exactly? A step above an 
unemployed dancer? I suppose it now means social media star. Now, as the new 
Bachelor, ABC is promoting him as a guy who feels unlovable.

I wonder about Ben, as I wonder about all of them: if a wife is your goal, why 
did you choose this method? It’s a broom in the age of a Roomba – or maybe it’s 
making a mess of your room altogether.

To be fair, The Bachelor and The Bachelorette have had five marriages out of 
30 seasons, which is a 16% success rate. That is not very high, but what are 
the odds when it comes to love? From what I could tell from Monday night’s 
premiere, I’d say Ben’s are pretty iffy.

There’s Tiara, the “chicken enthusiast”. She is upset about being separated 
from her chickens.

There are the 22-year-old identical twins from Las Vegas who do everything 
together. They’re like a circus act. They might just be one. Perhaps they will 
end up in Playboy when this is all over. Does that still happen?

There is also Lace the real estate agent from Denver, who wore black lace the 
first night – is her name really Lace?

There are four Laurens, because there is always a multiple of something – 
usually it’s a pair of Ashleys.

There is a Lauren from Marina Del Rey, who is a flight attendant, but she 
really is a stewardess – if she weren’t she would live somewhere besides the 
Marina. She is a classic.

Finally, there is Olivia, the anchorwoman from Austin, who quit her job to 
find true love. So far, she is my pick. It could have been the screwy dentist 
from Portland. And I wonder about Jubilee the Afghan war veteran, who seems 
tough as anyone who has seen combat.

I wonder about all the women of The Bachelor. They all believe they are in it 
for love because that is what you think at age 25. But it’s a competition. The 
women know they have to do something to win over Ben; they just don’t believe 
it’s being themselves.

Is the prize worth it? Maybe. All prizes are pretty dumb. It all feels empty 
and meaningless not long after the “win”. Whatever it was you wanted, you can’t 
remember why you did. It doesn’t matter if it was a man or a job or a 
professional reward.
