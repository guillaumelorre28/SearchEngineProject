Lawyers for the Arctic 30 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/arctic-30-protesters>, a group of 
Greenpeace <http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/> activists and 
freelance journalists who were detained in Russia last year, have applied to the
European court of human rights <http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home> 
for damages from Moscow.

They are also seeking a declaration Russian authorities broke international 
and Russian law when they seized aGreenpeace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace> ship and arrested the 
group protesting against oil drilling in the Arctic.

Lawyer Sergey Golubok said: "We think the Arctic 30 were apprehended and 
detained in flagrant violation of applicable international and Russian laws."

"The reaction of the Russian authorities was completely disproportionate to 
the peaceful protest that took place. These activists tried to shine a light on 
the risks of Arctic oil drilling, and yet they were met with a response that 
bore no relation to their actions," he added.

Six Britons – Philip Ball, Alexandra Harris, Frank Hewetson, Anthony Perrett, 
Iain Rogers and freelance videographer Keiron Bryan – were among the group, who 
were finally allowed to leave the country at the end of December. Harris said 
at the time she thought the Russian government wanted to avoid criticism in the 
runup to the Winter Olympics in Sochi.

According to the complaint, Russia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> 
breached the group's right to freedom of expression by taking "grossly 
excessive" measures against a peaceful protest, and by boarding the Greenpeace 
ship Arctic Sunrise before detaining the crew first at sea and then in Russian 
jails for over two months. They were later granted amnesty.

Lawyers for Greenpeace argue that all 30 men and women were unlawfully 
deprived of their liberty for more than two months – from 18 – 19 September 
until they were released on bail between 20 – 28 November.

They are seeking compensation for the damages for being unlawfully detained 
and costs and expenses associated with defending their cases in Russia and 
bringing their case to the European court.

The Arctic 30 were originally held for protesting at on offshore oil rig owned 
by Russian gas giant Gazprom. and initially charged with piracy. Their ship – 
the Arctic Sunrise was towed to the Russian port of Murmansk where it is still 
held. Last week, a court in Saint Petersburg denied a formal petition from 
Greenpeace to gain access to the ship to determine whether it had been properly 
maintained during its seizure and the subsequent investigation.
