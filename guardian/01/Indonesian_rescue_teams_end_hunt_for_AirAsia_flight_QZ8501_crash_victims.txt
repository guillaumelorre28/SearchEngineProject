Indonesian search and rescue teams have ended the hunt for victims from last 
year’s AirAsia plane crash, with 56 people still unaccounted for.

Flight QZ8501 went down in stormy weather during what was supposed to be a 
short trip from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore on 28 December, 
killing all 162 people on board.

The crash of the Airbus A320-200 into the Java Sea sparked a huge 
international hunt, with ships and aircraft from several nations scouring the 
sea for the plane wreckage and the victims.

The search has been scaled back dramatically in recent weeks, with foreign 
vessels withdrawing as well as the Indonesian military, which had provided the 
bulk of personnel and equipment.

Indonesia’s civilian search and rescue agency had continued the hunt, but on a 
smaller scale, and its teams were only occasionally finding more bodies.

SB Supriyadi, the search agency official coordinating the effort, said the 
number of victims found stood at 106. Search teams last found more bodies on 
Saturday, when three were discovered under some wreckage.

The Indonesian national transportation safety committee has so far shed little 
light on what caused the flight to crash, or what occurred in the moments 
before the tragedy.

It has reported that the plane climbed rapidly in an area of towering storm 
clouds before crashing, and that the co-pilot was at the controls, rather than 
the more experienced pilot, in the moments before the accident.

The plane’s black box flight data recorders have been recovered, which will 
provide vital clues to investigators.Indonesia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/indonesia> will release the final report 
into the crash by August, the transport minister said last month.
