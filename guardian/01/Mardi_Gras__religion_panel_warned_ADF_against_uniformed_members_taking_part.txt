The religious advisory committee to the Australian defence force 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-military> (ADF) wrote to 
the chief of the military in 2014 saying it was “deeply concerned” that defence 
force members were being allowed to march in uniform in Sydney’s annual gay and 
lesbian Mardi Gras, internal defence documents reveal.

The committee, an advisory group then made up of senior members of the Jewish 
and Christian faiths,asked the defence force chief 
<http://www.defence.gov.au/FOI/Docs/Disclosures/102_1516_Document.pdf> to 
clarify the ADF’s policy on uniformed members participating “in events which 
are political in nature and are also harmful or insulting to many religious 
members of the defence force”.

Rabbi Ralph Genende, the chair of the religious advisory group, wrote that its 
members “fully accept the right of individual ADF members to participate in the 
Mardi Gras”.

 “[But] it is deeply concerned about the decision to allow ADF members to 
march in uniform in an event which patently allows participants to mock and 
vilify religious faith, and which also has a political agenda,” he wrote.

Genende said the committee had not been consulted when the army permitted 
members to march in the Mardi Gras in uniform for the first time in 2013.

The documents were obtained under a freedom of information request lodged by 
theconservative activist Bernard Gaynor

, a former soldier and Senate candidate for the far-right Australian Liberty 
Alliance.

The Liberal member for Canning and former SAS soldier, Andrew Hastie, was 
sacked from the army

 reserves on Thursday after refusing to take down billboards showing him in 
uniform.

On Friday Labor’s candidate for the seat of Brisbane, Pat O’Neill, said he 
would remove billboards 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-10/pat-oneill-to-remove-billboards-showing-him-in-army-uniform/7500032>
 in his electorate showing him in army uniform to comply with a request from 
the ADF.

O’Neill said it was important that people knew his history as an army officer, 
but he had left an 18-year career in the forces to talk about health and 
education, not billboards.

“That’s why we are taking the billboards down.”

But Labor’s candidate in Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly, said he had resigned from 
the ADF reserve after requests to remove campaign images of him in uniform.

ADF regulations prohibit members from participating in any political activity 
in uniform, unless they are pre-approved to do so, to ensure the organisation 
remains apolitical.

The executive director of the Australia Defence Association, Neil James, 
agreed with the decision to punish Hastie but said the same standard should be 
applied to the Mardi Gras.

“The Mardi Gras is a highly ­political event – all of the floats are bagging 
the conservative side of politics ... we’d be saying the same thing if ADF 
officers were in uniform at an anti-abortion rally or an ­Australian Patriots 
Alliance march,” he said.

“You just can’t allow people to improperly use their ADF status for a 
political event.”

In June last year, the government appointed the first Muslim cleric

members are the Reverends Gary Lock, Allan Harman and Murray Earl, Monsignor 
Peter O’Keefe and Bishop Ian Lambert.

The Department of Defence has been contacted for comment.
