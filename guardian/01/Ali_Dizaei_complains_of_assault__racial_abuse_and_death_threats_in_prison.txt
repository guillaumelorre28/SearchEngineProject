Police are investigating claims of death threats made against the family of 
the jailed former senior officerAli Dizaei 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ali-dizaei>, after a clash with another 
prisoner was followed by someone getting into his cell and daubing abusive 
messages on pictures of his children and wife.

Dizaei, a former Scotland Yard commander, was convicted and jailed in February 
for attempting to frame a man in a dispute about money.

His solicitors say the 47-year-old is considering suing the prison service for 
racism and failing to protect him from racist bullying at an open prison, HMP 
Prescoed in Monmouthshire, South Wales.

Last night, his wife said the death threats had left her "scared" and police 
had visited her on Thursday to put in place special protective measures and 
reassure her they are taking the matter seriously.

In June, Dizaei claimed an inmate had racially abused him. An investigation 
upheld the complaint and also said the former top officer was not to blame.

On Sunday, Dizaei was involved in a clash with another inmate, with both 
claiming the other attacked them.

Dizaei's wife, Shahameh Yekta, said someone had subsequently got into her 
husband's locked prison cell and daubed death threats on family pictures.

She said: "I'm so scared, this guy is threatening Ali and us."

She said the prison had failed to take sufficient action to protect Dizaei, 
despite his lawyers writing a letter about threats to his safety a month ago.

Dizaei has been transferred to another open prison, Leyhill in south 
Gloucestershire, while police investigate.

A spokesman for Dizaei's solicitors said: "Dizaei maintains he was assaulted 
on Sunday 1 August. He was taken to hospital and treated for his injuries."

A Prison Service spokesman said: "Two prisoners at HMP Prescoed claim they 
were the victim of an assault by the other on 1 August. Neither prisoner 
required treatment in hospital."
