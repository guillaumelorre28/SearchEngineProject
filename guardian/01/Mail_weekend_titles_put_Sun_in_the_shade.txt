The obvious default position for newspapers, especially in an election month, 
was rightwing versus left, as though politics defined everything. But it didn’t 
– and doesn’t. Look at May’s ABC sales figures and a different battle emerges, 
one for weekend hegemony: the SaturdayMail and Mail on Sunday versus Mr 
Murdoch’s twin Buns.

The Mail on Sunday was the biggest sabbath seller at last: nearly 29,000 ahead 
of a flaggingSun on Sunday. Saturday’s Mail, at an average of 2,289,000, led 
Saturday’sSun by 119,000. Add in some statistics from the National Readership 
Survey showingMail titles with a monthly print-plus-digital UK reach of 30.3 
million and you can see why Rupert may have cause to curse in his cornflakes.

Of course this battle doesn’t disguise generalised decline (7% year-on-year) 
across print sales. But Geordie Greig at theMoS is allowed his moment – and 
those who see Fleet Street eventually evolving into a weekend print clash 
featuring Saturday and Sunday editions alone have a new equation to reckon with.

Whatever paywalls are doing for Rupert’s Times titles, they don’t seem to be 
helping the reach of his belovedSun; and politics, too, seems a peripheral 
factor as one big Tory champion bashes another. Indeed, there look to be a lot 
of readers who buy their papers irrespective of Cam, Ed, Nick and the whole 
damn show.
