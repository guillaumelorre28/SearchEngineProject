With a possible criminal indictment looming over him, the embattled 
billionaire Sir Allen Stanford is on a public relations kick. He has givena 
flurry of colourful interviews to media outlets including the Houston Chronicle 
<http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/biz/6382454.html>, the New York 
Times, CNBC and Bloomberg News.

The financier and cricket impresario has been accused of an $8bn fraud by the 
SEC and admits that he is expecting charges shortly from the US department of 
justice. His defence strategy is becoming clear – and it's none too subtle.

As far as he was aware, Stanford maintains, his Stanford International empire 
was straight.He told Bloomberg 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aWQKSPu575js&refer=home>: 
"I'm not a damn swindler."

If anything was wrong, it wasn't his fault because he was chairman, rather 
than running operations on a day-to-day basis.

"I don't run the bank, I'm the chairman. I have nothing to do with the 
day-to-day operations of the bank," he told CNBC, pointing out that he controls 
42 entities around the world. "It's impossible for me to macro, much less 
micro, manage, this. I depend on people to do their jobs."

Among those responsible for the nitty-gritty, says the billionaire, is 
Stanford International Bank's chief financial officer James Davis – who was 
also named in the SEC's lawsuit and is co-operating with the authorities.

"If bad things were happening, he [Davis] never brought them to my attention," 
Stanford told the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/business/21stanford.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&src=twt&twt=nytimesbusiness>
. "He did his job, and I stayed out of his hair."

Stanford argues that after a series of high-profile regulatory mishaps, the US 
authorities simply want an attention-grabbing trophy in bringing down a 
flamboyant, wealthy Texan. Oh, and it's just possible that he might be secret 
agent for the US government.

An exchange with CNBC's Scott Cohn was intriguing. Referring to outlandish 
rumours that Stanford might have worked for theCIA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cia>, Cohn put it to the billionaire that 
he rubbed shoulders with prominent people in many regions – Latin America, 
Europe, Africa and the Caribbean.

Cohn: "Somebody in your position would be useful to the authorities in the US 
trying to find out what was going on in places like Venezuela. Can you tell me 
about any sort of role you played that way – were you helpful to the 
authorities in the US?"

Stanford: "Are you talking about the CIA?"

Cohn: "Well, you tell me."

Stanford: "I'm not going to talk about that."

Cohn: "Why not?"

Stanford: "I'm just not going to talk about that."

Cohn: "Well, is my premise correct that someone in your position would be 
helpful to those who wanted to know what was going on?"

Stanford: "Er … I really don't have anything to add to that that would be of 
any value."

Say what you like about the 59-year-old financier, he's an international man 
of mystery.
