It's been announced Alanis Morrissette is working on a musical 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/nov/11/alanis-morissette-jagged-little-pill-musical>
 based on her 1995 best selling album, Jagged Little Pill. Plans are for all 13 
tracks to feature in the performance with some additional original material. 
The storyline is still being worked on, but the album sold over 33m copies – 
meaning that Morrissette could well be on to a winner.

It's the latest in a long line of so-called "jukebox" musicals, assembled from 
the scraps of music albums with varying degrees of artistic credibility. The 
mega-popularAbba-inspired Mamma Mia! <http://www.mamma-mia.com/london.asp> was 
one of the first, swiftly followed by such highly profitable pearls as theQueen 
musical We Will Rock You <http://www.wewillrockyou.co.uk/> and Jersey Boys 
<http://www.jerseyboyslondon.com/jerseyboys_music.asp> – but more successful 
adaptations have been created, notablyGreen Day's American Idiot 
<http://www.americanidiotthemusical.com/>. 

Which begs the question: which albums would make a good musical? Consulting the
official album charts <http://www.officialcharts.com/albums-chart/> today, how 
about Bowie's The Next Day? Or the current number one album, The Marshal 
Mathers LP 2? Bangerz by Miley Cyrus? (Perhaps not that last one.) Anyway, tell 
us your candidates in the thread below.
