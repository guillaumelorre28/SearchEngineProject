I have a cupboard full of spices, and every now and again I force myself to 
try different combinations. Roast chicken is great with lemon and rosemary, but 
for a change, try it with cumin – it's really delicious. Toast the seeds first 
and add a touch of star anise if you fancy extra spice.

(serves 3-4)
3 tbsp olive oil
4 chicken thighs
4 chicken drumsticks
Pinch of rock salt and pepper
Large pinch of cumin seeds, crushed
300ml vegetable stock, or water
250g chestnut mushrooms, cleaned
2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped

Heat the oil on medium in a large lidded pan, season the chicken with salt and 
pepper and colour, uncovered, on both sides for about five minutes (you may 
need to do this in two batches).

When all of the chicken is browned, add the cumin seeds and toast in the pan.

Add the stock – or water – cover the pan and cook for 20 minutes.

Roughly chop the mushrooms and add them to the pan about five minutes before 
the chicken is cooked, and replace the lid.

Serve the chicken garnished with the parsley and with steamed cabbage or a 
green salad.
