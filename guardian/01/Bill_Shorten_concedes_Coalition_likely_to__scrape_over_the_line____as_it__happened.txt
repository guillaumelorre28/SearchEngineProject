Politically, the day is winding down with flags nailed to masts and whispers 
of concession in the way Labor MPs spoke and tentative (or in the case of
Christopher Pyne outright) declarations of victory on the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> side.

 * Bill Shorten has conceded the Coalition is likely to “scrape through” but 
has predicted a return to the polls within a year. Shorten was re-elected 
leader of the Labor party unopposed in a spill which is required after an 
election under the party’s rules. Anthony Albanese was the one who moved a 
motion of confidence in him and it was passed unanimously.

 * Cathy McGowan stayed consistent in her approach and after a meeting with 
Malcolm Turnbull said she would guarantee confidence and supply to the 
government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/08/cathy-mcgowan-offers-to-support-coalition-after-meeting-with-malcolm-turnbull>
 of the day but would deal with legislation on a case by case basis 
As an independent, I stand by my principles of no deals. And a deal is when 
you agree to do something in exchange for something else.

 * Malcolm Turnbull appeared in a brief streetwalk and made a statement to 
media after his meeting with McGowan in which he again attacked Labor’s 
Medicare campaign 
Clearly there were swings against us, there was a swing against us nationally 
but swings against us in a number of seats, obviously we’ve lost a number of 
seats. We are heeding that. I do have to say again, that, and I don’t think any 
of you would argue with this, theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> ran a shockingly 
dishonest campaign on Medicare.

 * Before all this though Christopher Pyne had already declared victory 
telling Channel Nine the Liberal Party was“an election winning machine” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/08/christopher-pyne-declares-coalition-victory-as-count-nears-possible-majority>
. 
The take out is that unless something drastic happens over the weekend the 
Coalition are well on track to retain government. They have Independents who 
have guaranteed them supply and confidence and asAndrew Wilkie said it is “not 
conceivable” Shorten will become prime minister.

It is, however, conceivable that the blog rest for a while, perhaps for the 
entire weekend depending on how events unfold. Until next time political nerds 
and nerdettes.

The drawn-out count is not just a drag for politicians and pundits alike, it’s 
actually affecting work on the international stage. The defence minister,Marise 
Payne, missing a Nato meeting in Poland today because of the uncertainty, 
Fairfax Media reports 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/defence-minister-to-miss-nato-meeting-amid-election-uncertainty-with-afghanistan-back-in-the-spotlight-20160707-gq17m9.html>
.

Engagement in Afghanistan was discussed at the meeting and the Australian 
government announced troops will remain until at least next year.

Senator Payne’s spokesman confirmed that she had planned to attend the Warsaw 
meeting, subject to the election outcome and caretaker provisions, and in 
consultation with Prime MinisterMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> and Foreign

A Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> victory is 
very likely,Malcolm Turnbull is saying it, key independents are saying it, even 
Bill Shorten is saying it.

So what exactly has Turnbull got himself in for? Kristina Keneally and I 
recorded a podcast discussing the result and who could end up as the Speaker, 
which will be an important question in a hung parliament or slim majority 
government.

You can listen below or find it in iTunes.

Malcolm Turnbull has given a brief press conference, answering just one 
question after giving a statement on the “thoroughly independent”Cathy McGowan.

We’ve known each other for a long time. We’ve always had a good relationship 
... she recognises the importance of a stable parliament and she can provide 
support, consistent with what she’s done in the past by supporting the 
government.That’s my government, on matters of supply and confidence.

Turnbull is asked why the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> did quite well in 
Victoria and uses the opportunity to attack the Medicare campaign.

I won’t run a commentary on it other than to say clearly there were swings 
against us in – there was a swing against us nationally but swings against us 
in a number of seats, obviously we’ve lost a number of seats. We are heeding 
that. I do have to say again, that, and I don’t think any of you would argue 
with this, theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> ran a shockingly 
dishonest campaign on Medicare.

There are lessons to be learned for all concerned. We are taking very careful 
note of the outcome, we respect the judgment of the people. This election is 
not really about Michael or me or any of the members and candidates. It’s about 
the Australian people. We are determined to bring people together to ensure the 
45th parliament is stable, productive and governing and legislating in the 
national interest.

Cathy McGowan will guarantee supply and confidence

Independent Cathy McGowan has met with Malcolm Turnbull this morning and in an 
announcement consistent with her previous position she says she will guarantee 
supply and confidence to whichever party forms government.

She will vote on legislation on a case-by-case basis.

I appreciate how important it is for this current situation to be resolved in 
a timely manner. The country wants stable and settled government to enable 
everybody to get on with their lives and business.As an Independent, I stand by 
my principles of no deals. And a deal is when you agree to do something in 
exchange for something else.

I will continue to work with the government of the day and I will continue to 
consider each piece of legislation on merits, both according to my conscience 
and the needs of my electorate and the country.

She calls her discussion with Turnbull “solid” and said her preference is not 
to go back to an election.

We talked about professionalism in politics and how important it is for people 
to be able to trust each other and that’s certainly what I bring as an 
Independent, an open, trusting willingness to work with the government of the 
day to do the business of the country that needs to be done.

Bill Shorten also used his pre-Labor caucus meeting speech to defend the 
campaign on Medicare, a key platform. He callsMalcolm Turnbull’s election night 
speech an “extraordinary outburst” and the Liberals are blaming the Australian 
people for their “disastrous” campaign.

The Liberals think that a massive swing against them was a matter of 
perception alone, that somehow there weren’t enough negative Liberal TV ads and 
everything would have been right. They think it’s a problem with their message, 
their image.

Mr Turnbull is not a person of substance. For him it is always just a matter 
of style. But Saturday cannot be put down by our opponents to a failure of 
communication alone. It wasn’t that the Liberals didn’t talk about Medicare, it 
was what they were doing to Medicare.

Freezing the GP rebate so that 14.5 million Australians will have to pay more 
to see their doctor. Raising the price of medicine by cutting the PBS, imposing 
new up front fees and charges for blood tests, mammograms, x-rays, diagnostic 
imaging. At every turn, undermining and hollowing out Medicare as we know it, 
pushing the price of healthcare back on to families and individuals.

And then when these fresh offences added to their 40-year history of attacking 
and undermining Medicare, we know when the Liberal Party set up a taskforce to 
investigate privatising parts of Medicare, then we are entitled to query their 
motive, to question the outcome and to stand up for Australians.

Bill Shorten: Coalition will likely win

It’s likely in coming days that the Liberals will scrape over the line but the 
combination of a PM with no authority, a Government with no direction and a
Liberal party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> at war 
with itself, will see Australians back at the polls within the year.

We will fight for our positive plans in the 45th Parliament, we will respect 
the judgement of the people and be true to our policies and propositions upon 
which we sought the support, which we received. But we will be campaign-ready 
from this day onwards.

Shorten speaks to issues of diversity and division, and acknowledges that 
there are swathes of voters not supporting either major party.

Grappling with the uncertainty of a transforming economy, a society where old 
norms and institutions seem less permanent than they once did and undoubtedly 
there are Australians who do feel left out, excluded, alienated from a 
political process which does not seem to speak to the issues in their lives. In 
such a climate, it’s easy for the extremists, for the people with the simple 
solutions to emerge and thrive, to foster division, to blame minorities, to 
demonise difference to appeal to the dark angels of our national character. 
This is not the Labor way.

He seems among other things to be making reference to the election of Pauline

Bill Shorten addresses caucus

Unlike our opponents we fought this election as team the results of your hard 
work and there for all to see.

Bill Shorten gives the media a nudge before talking about an election fought 
on “Labor issues”.

Our wise friends in the media told us we were wasting out time talking about 
Labor issues. We should be proud standing up for jobs, education, health and 
schools are considered Labor issues.

We should be proud that standing up for Australian jobs and apprenticeships is 
considered a Labor issue. We should be proud that education, schools, 
university and TAFE is considered a Labor issue.

We should be proud building a first class fibre NBN, taking real action on 
climate change, a royal commission into the banks and delivering marriage 
equality that these are considered Labor issues.

Then to big cheers:

I’m particularly proud that saving Medicare is seen as a Labor issue.

Bill Shorten is making public remarks at a caucus meeting where the leadership 
will be spilled (as party rules dictate).

He is going through key seats that were won acknowledging the new, and in some 
cases returned, MPs to cheers. As noted beside me it is kind of like a school 
awards ceremony where a whole roll of names have to be clapped and the 
enthusiasm starts to flag halfway through.

When Anne Aly is mentioned, who ran in the Western Australia seat of Cowan 
where counting is still going, it gets a big cheer. He goes through formalities 
of thanking the leadership group.

What we’ve accomplished we’ve accomplished together.

Politically, the day is winding down with flags nailed to masts and whispers 
of concession in the way Labor MPs spoke and tentative (or in the case of
Christopher Pyne outright) declarations of victory on the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> side.

 * Bill Shorten has conceded the Coalition is likely to “scrape through” but 
has predicted a return to the polls within a year. Shorten was re-elected 
leader of the Labor party unopposed in a spill which is required after an 
election under the party’s rules. Anthony Albanese was the one who moved a 
motion of confidence in him and it was passed unanimously.

 * Cathy McGowan stayed consistent in her approach and after a meeting with 
Malcolm Turnbull said she would guarantee confidence and supply to the 
government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/08/cathy-mcgowan-offers-to-support-coalition-after-meeting-with-malcolm-turnbull>
 of the day but would deal with legislation on a case by case basis 
As an independent, I stand by my principles of no deals. And a deal is when 
you agree to do something in exchange for something else.

 * Malcolm Turnbull appeared in a brief streetwalk and made a statement to 
media after his meeting with McGowan in which he again attacked Labor’s 
Medicare campaign 
Clearly there were swings against us, there was a swing against us nationally 
but swings against us in a number of seats, obviously we’ve lost a number of 
seats. We are heeding that. I do have to say again, that, and I don’t think any 
of you would argue with this, theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> ran a shockingly 
dishonest campaign on Medicare.

 * Before all this though Christopher Pyne had already declared victory 
telling Channel Nine the Liberal Party was“an election winning machine” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/08/christopher-pyne-declares-coalition-victory-as-count-nears-possible-majority>
. 
The take out is that unless something drastic happens over the weekend the 
Coalition are well on track to retain government. They have Independents who 
have guaranteed them supply and confidence and asAndrew Wilkie said it is “not 
conceivable” Shorten will become prime minister.

It is, however, conceivable that the blog rest for a while, perhaps for the 
entire weekend depending on how events unfold. Until next time political nerds 
and nerdettes.
 
The drawn-out count is not just a drag for politicians and pundits alike, it’s 
actually affecting work on the international stage. The defence minister,Marise 
Payne, missing a Nato meeting in Poland today because of the uncertainty, 
Fairfax Media reports 
<http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/defence-minister-to-miss-nato-meeting-amid-election-uncertainty-with-afghanistan-back-in-the-spotlight-20160707-gq17m9.html>
.

Engagement in Afghanistan was discussed at the meeting and the Australian 
government announced troops will remain until at least next year.

Senator Payne’s spokesman confirmed that she had planned to attend the Warsaw 
meeting, subject to the election outcome and caretaker provisions, and in 
consultation with Prime MinisterMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> and Foreign 
Minister Julie Bishop.

Nick Xenophon is talking on Sky at the moment. He says Christopher Pyne’s

Bill Shorten is saying it.

So what exactly has Turnbull got himself in for? Kristina Keneally and I 
recorded a podcast discussing the result and who could end up as the Speaker, 
which will be an important question in a hung parliament or slim majority 
government.

Malcolm Turnbull has given a brief press conference, answering just one 
question after giving a statement on the “thoroughly independent”Cathy McGowan.

We’ve known each other for a long time. We’ve always had a good relationship 
... she recognises the importance of a stable parliament and she can provide 
support, consistent with what she’s done in the past by supporting the 
government.That’s my government, on matters of supply and confidence.

Turnbull is asked why the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> did quite well in 
Victoria and uses the opportunity to attack the Medicare campaign.

I won’t run a commentary on it other than to say clearly there were swings 
against us in – there was a swing against us nationally but swings against us 
in a number of seats, obviously we’ve lost a number of seats. We are heeding 
that. I do have to say again, that, and I don’t think any of you would argue 
with this, theLabor party 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party> ran a shockingly 
dishonest campaign on Medicare.

There are lessons to be learned for all concerned. We are taking very careful 
note of the outcome, we respect the judgment of the people. This election is 
not really about Michael or me or any of the members and candidates. It’s about 
the Australian people. We are determined to bring people together to ensure the 
45th parliament is stable, productive and governing and legislating in the 
national interest.
 
We have a photo from the meeting between Cathy McGowan and Malcolm Turnbull 
earlier today.

Independent Cathy McGowan has met with Malcolm Turnbull this morning and in an 
announcement consistent with her previous position she says she will guarantee 
supply and confidence to whichever party forms government.

She will vote on legislation on a case-by-case basis.

I appreciate how important it is for this current situation to be resolved in 
a timely manner. The country wants stable and settled government to enable 
everybody to get on with their lives and business.As an Independent, I stand by 
my principles of no deals. And a deal is when you agree to do something in 
exchange for something else.

I will continue to work with the government of the day and I will continue to 
consider each piece of legislation on merits, both according to my conscience 
and the needs of my electorate and the country.

She calls her discussion with Turnbull “solid” and said her preference is not 
to go back to an election.

We talked about professionalism in politics and how important it is for people 
to be able to trust each other and that’s certainly what I bring as an 
Independent, an open, trusting willingness to work with the government of the 
day to do the business of the country that needs to be done.
 
Bill Shorten also used his pre-Labor caucus meeting speech to defend the 
campaign on Medicare, a key platform. He callsMalcolm Turnbull’s election night 
speech an “extraordinary outburst” and the Liberals are blaming the Australian 
people for their “disastrous” campaign.

The Liberals think that a massive swing against them was a matter of 
perception alone, that somehow there weren’t enough negative Liberal TV ads and 
everything would have been right. They think it’s a problem with their message, 
their image.

Mr Turnbull is not a person of substance. For him it is always just a matter 
of style. But Saturday cannot be put down by our opponents to a failure of 
communication alone. It wasn’t that the Liberals didn’t talk about Medicare, it 
was what they were doing to Medicare.

Freezing the GP rebate so that 14.5 million Australians will have to pay more 
to see their doctor. Raising the price of medicine by cutting the PBS, imposing 
new up front fees and charges for blood tests, mammograms, x-rays, diagnostic 
imaging. At every turn, undermining and hollowing out Medicare as we know it, 
pushing the price of healthcare back on to families and individuals.

And then when these fresh offences added to their 40-year history of attacking 
and undermining Medicare, we know when the Liberal Party set up a taskforce to 
investigate privatising parts of Medicare, then we are entitled to query their 
motive, to question the outcome and to stand up for Australians.
 
It’s likely in coming days that the Liberals will scrape over the line but the 
combination of a PM with no authority, a Government with no direction and a
Liberal party <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party> at war 
with itself, will see Australians back at the polls within the year.

We will fight for our positive plans in the 45th Parliament, we will respect 
the judgement of the people and be true to our policies and propositions upon 
which we sought the support, which we received. But we will be campaign-ready 
from this day onwards.
 
Shorten speaks to issues of diversity and division, and acknowledges that 
there are swathes of voters not supporting either major party.

Grappling with the uncertainty of a transforming economy, a society where old 
norms and institutions seem less permanent than they once did and undoubtedly 
there are Australians who do feel left out, excluded, alienated from a 
political process which does not seem to speak to the issues in their lives. In 
such a climate, it’s easy for the extremists, for the people with the simple 
solutions to emerge and thrive, to foster division, to blame minorities, to 
demonise difference to appeal to the dark angels of our national character. 
This is not the Labor way.

He seems among other things to be making reference to the election of Pauline 
Hanson and ensuing debate of how to handle her.
 
Unlike our opponents we fought this election as team the results of your hard 
work and there for all to see.

Bill Shorten gives the media a nudge before talking about an election fought 
on “Labor issues”.
