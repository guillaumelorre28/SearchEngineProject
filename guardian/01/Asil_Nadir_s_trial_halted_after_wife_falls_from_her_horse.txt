Business tycoon Asil Nadir's trial has been abandoned for the day at the Old 
Bailey to allow him to rush to his wife's bedside.

The judge explained to the jury that Nadir, 70, was too distressed to continue 
with the case.

Nur Nadir, 27, was taken to a central London hospital on Wednesday after being 
thrown from her horse in Hyde Park.

Earlier in the day, she had been at court to support Nadir who is accused of 
siphoning off £150m from his Polly Peck business empire before it collapsed in 
1991.

Nadir, of Mayfair, central London, denies 13 specimen counts of theft 
amounting to £34m between 1987 and 1990.

He was arrested and was due to stand trial in 1993 but left Britain for 
Northern Cyprus, only to return in August 2010.

The couple married in Northern Cyprus when university graduate Nur was 21. It 
was Nadir's second marriage.

She has been by his side for most of the trial, which began two months ago.

A shaken looking Nadir turned up at court on Thursday but left soon afterwards.

Mr Justice Holroyde later told the jury: "Unfortunately, Mr Nadir's wife had 
an accident yesterday and as a result of which she has been admitted to 
hospital.

"Mr Nadir is so distressed and anxious about his wife's condition that it 
simply would not be sensible to expect him to play a part in the proceedings 
today.

"I have given him permission to be absent."

The judge explained that it would not be possible to go on with the evidence 
of administrator Christopher Morris.

The trial was adjourned until Friday after 40 minutes during which other 
evidence was read.
