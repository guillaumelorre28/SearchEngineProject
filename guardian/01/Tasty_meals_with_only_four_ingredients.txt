I'd love some ideas for really tasty, healthy, quick recipes that only need 
four ingredients.

With so few ingredients (I'll assume items such as seasoning, oil and stock 
don't count), it's vital the flavours are clean, subtle and seasonal. Spinach 
is good at the moment so let's start there. Have some (not-so-healthy) 
ready-rolled puff pastry in the freezer as it's ideal for quick and easy 
cooking. Wilt a big bag of spinach and give it a squeeze, chop and season. Chop 
a box of mushrooms and cook in a hot pan so they release their liquid. Strain 
and reserve the liquid. Boil the liquid with a splash of cream until it 
thickens. Add the mushrooms and spinach, check the seasoning and allow to cool. 
Meanwhile, cut two circles of pastry – the top slightly bigger than the bottom 
– spread some filling on the base and cover with the top. Seal, brush with egg 
and bake at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 until golden brown.

Pork can be the basis of a quick, healthy meal: pick a lean steak and seal it 
in a pan with a little butter, remove and keep warm. In the same pan, brown 
some fresh breadcrumbs, leave to cool then add small cubes of gruyere and 
chopped flat-leaf parsley. Spoon the mixture onto the pork and finish cooking 
in the oven. Serve with fresh broad beans.

Filleted fish is quick and easy. I love monkfish, but mackerel or salmon work 
just as well here. Cook 4-5 jersey potatoes per person, cool slightly and toss 
with cooked, diced beetroot in a little oil and vinegar. Brown the seasoned 
fish in a hot pan, top the fish with creamed horseradish and serve with the 
potatoes and beetroot.
