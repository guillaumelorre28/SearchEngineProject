1. You are pouring organic milk in to your Fairtrade coffee, listening to 
Radiohead's Bodysnatchers on your iPhone. It's 2008 - geddit?! Suddenly, bam! A 
frying pan dangling from yourNigella 
<http://lifeandhealth.theguardian.com/food/story/0,,1613783,00.html>-style rack 
of kitchen utensils renders you unconscious, transporting you back to 1981. How 
unlucky can you get?

2. The reflection in your state-of-the-art, coffin-sized, 1981 microwave 
<http://blog.modernmechanix.com/mags/qf/c/PopularScience/5-1968/med_microwave.jpg>
 reveals that you aresporting an extravagant mullet 
<http://www.mulletjunky.com/webimages/fatkidonbike.jpg>, an Olivia Neutron Bomb 
headband, a black leather suit with the sleeves rolled up and rollerblades. 
Wired for sound, baby!

3. Next, to save time (or thought), simply repeat the recipe from last year's 
creation, Life On Mars.

4. For starters, knock up a quick car chase. Leap into the Audi Quattro, Gary 
Numan's Cars subtly underlining the scene on yourWalkman 
<http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/radio_communication/1992-996.aspx>. 
Toss in catchphrases such as: "You are surrounded by armed bass-tards!" and 
"Fan-dabby-bleeding-dozy!" Overtake several children ostentatiously ridingBMX 
<http://bmxmuseum.com/bikes/1981-1983/> bikes and a new romantic in a Sinclair 
C5 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDKw5I-RwUY>.

5. Stop off to stock up on Space Dust 
<http://www.aquarterof.co.uk/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=space+dust&x=0&y=0>
,Shake 'n' Vac <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHV6goK2rqA> and several cans of 
Tab <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vz2nxdM0qc> - "Suddenly everything is 
clear!" How ironic!

6. Back home, the nemesis stalking your, um, psyche is driving a bulldozer 
around the back garden, singing: "Ashes to ashes/Fun to funky/We know Major 
Tom's a junkie."

7. Have heartbreaking conversation with daughter back in 2008 via a talking 
toy - any Smurf, Cabbage Patch Kid or My Little Pony will do. Resist the 
temptation to retch.

8. Wake up and realise it was all a (very) bad dream.
