In 1972, pop fans perhaps still dimly remembered David Bowie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie> from his 1969 hit Space Oddity, 
but his star had since dimmed, and it took the creation of his alter ego Ziggy 
Stardust to reignite his career and, in particular, an appearance on Top of the 
Pops singing Starman. The song told the story of Ziggy bringing a message of 
hope to earth's youth through the radio: "Let all the children boogie!" 
(Speaking to William Burroughs a year later, Bowie clarified that Ziggy himself 
was not the Starman but merely his earthly messenger.)

The song had been trundling along in the charts, and John Peel called it "a 
gem", but this performance accelerated its rise to No 10, and set Ziggy on his 
way. More than that, at the start of the year, Bowie had claimed to 
Melody Maker that he was gay, and now he was on the nation's TV screens dressed 
in a technicoloured jumpsuit, letting an equally resplendently costumed Mick 
Ronson lean in suspiciously close to the microphone with him. For a generation 
and more, here was a signal of a very particular kind.
