There has been a lot of debate among supporters of a certain bus ad campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/religion-advertising> 
about the precise wording used to carry the atheist message to millions. Some 
felt that "probably" didn't go far enough.

On the opposite side of the debate, a few were so offended by the exercise 
that they devised their own,rather more uncompromising

 versions.

Lots of people, of course, weren't happy with either slogan. 

Well, their time has come. It has been brought to our attention that there 
exists out there in the wilds of the internet a nifty littlebus-ad slogan 
generator <http://ruletheweb.co.uk/b3ta/bus/>. We've had fun playing around 
with it and are sure you will too.

It's worth pointing out (given that some of the user-generated slogans have 
already been mistaken for real pics of real buses) that the generator has 
nothing to do with the Atheist Bus Campaign or the British Humanist 
Association. They've asked us to remind people that the only slogan they've 
ever run or ever will is: "There's probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy 
your life".

The question is, can you do any better? Have a go, and on Monday we'll be 
picking out and displaying a few of the very best.
