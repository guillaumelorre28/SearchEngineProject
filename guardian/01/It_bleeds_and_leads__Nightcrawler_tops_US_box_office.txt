Jake Gyllenhaal crime thriller Nightcrawler tied for first place with last 
week’s No 1 Ouija at the US box office this weekend, both movies taking an 
estimated $10.9m (£6.81m)

.
Dan Gilroy’s directorial debut about a jobless sociopath who stumbles upon a 
living selling footage of LA car wrecks made the joint top spot in its first 
week of release following excellent reviews. Analysts said it might fall just 
behind Ouija, the horror film based on Hasbro’s board game, when final counts 
are in, but would likely boast a higher take on average per cinema.

The latter film had been expected to land in second place in its second week 
of release but benefited from the Halloween weekend and a lack of competition 
from other new horror films.
The top five was rounded out by David Ayers second world war tank drama Fury 
in third, with $9.1m in its third week of release, David Fincher crime drama 
Gone Girl in fourth with $8.8m in its fifth week of release, and animationThe 
Book of Life <https://www.theguardian.com/film/book-of-life> in fifth, with 
$8.3m in its third week of release.

There were no other new films in the top 10, but the British sci-fi thriller 
Before I Go to Sleep debuted outside with a near-catastrophic total of just 
$2m, a figure which marked a new career low total for stars Nicole Kidman and 
Colin Firth. Meanwhile, Bill Murray comedySt Vincent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/st-vincent> boasted the year’s best second 
week staying power in seventh, taking $7.8m for the second week running.
