Millicent Mabisela is one of 10 homecare workers sitting on damp wooden 
benches in a small tin-shack "office". Huddled together under ragged blankets, 
they contemplate their patients for the day. "So many of them are not taking 
their ARV medication properly," she says, referring to the free antiretroviral 
therapy given to those infected with HIV. "They don't have money to buy food 
and without a healthy diet the side-effects of the medication can be 
insufferable."

Thirty-one-year-old Mabisela does not know how she contracted HIV, but went to 
get tested after her boyfriend, who is also HIV positive, became very ill. "I 
too used to suffer with severe side-effects such as cramp, sickness, migraines 
and tremors, and would sometimes default [from the treatment]. At least now I 
am a carer IÂ can get food with my stipend."

"The government should help its people," says Meryl Arries, in support of her 
friend, "[with] food parcels for those desperately ill and employment 
opportunities for others who can work."

NGOs offer food to people too sick or vulnerable to work, but sometimes the 
funds are simply not there. Sejo, a highly nutritious, sorghum-based porridge 
is a cheap and readily available alternative to a varied diet, which helps the 
ARVs work.

"If funding levels allowed us to offer Sejo to our patients," says Mabisela, 
"it would make such a difference and undoubtedly save lives."
