Menacing dark bodies have been seen swooping around in the air with a 
deafening loud hum, leaving many onlookers terrified. These are swarms of bees, 
sometimes up to 20,000 strong and desperate to find a new home to settle in.

These bees are fairly harmless and the hot sunny weather has been ideal, as 
swarms only have a brief flying time before they run out of energy and collapse.

Bees <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bees> had a wretched time in the 
cold, wet and windy weather earlier this spring that left them stuck in hives 
and hungry.

The lack of midges, gnats and moths this spring was also bad for feeding bats. 
But the recent fine weather came just in time for the females to give birth and 
feed their young. The mothers gather together in maternity roosts, often in 
huge numbers â€“ in Scotland, pipistrelle bats can roost together in their 
thousands. All through the night the mothers fly off in relays to feed, always 
leaving some females behind to look after the young. And bats have voracious 
appetites, eating round 3,000 midges each night, which is why bats have 
suffered in recent wet summers, many of them found exhausted on the ground 
without enough food. To find out how bats are faring, the Bat Conservation 
Trust is asking people to report the numbers of bats seen at sunrise or sunset. 
The survey starts this weekend and lasts through the summer.
