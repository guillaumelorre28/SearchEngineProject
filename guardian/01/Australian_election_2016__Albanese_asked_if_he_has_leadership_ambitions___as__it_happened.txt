And so we bring today to an end. It sure was something. If you’ve been 
nostalgic for campaigns past, the Daily Telegraph was here to help, with a 
front page about boats. The revelation? An asylum seeker vessel was intercepted 
three weeks ago. People smugglers are clearly readying themselves. Because 
Labor. I think.

Here’s a brief summary of today’s key points.

 * Peter Dutton couldn’t explain why the government was suddenly talking about 
on water matters, other than a new found respect for transparency coinciding 
with an election.

 * It was scare campaign versus scare campaign as Labor continued its line on 
Medicare privatisation under a Coalition government. Deputy leader Tanya 
Plibersek later walked back from it a little,acknowledging Turnbull’s repeated 
denial, but said the Coalition still wanted a user pays system.

 * The Australian Medical Association criticised the Labor Medicare campaign, 
and said outsourcing the payment system “in no way” amounts to privatisation. 
 * Bill Shorten renewed calls for a Royal Commission on the banking industry. 
 * Anthony Albanese said he doesn’t want to be Labor leader (right at this 
moment). 
 * Scott Morrison faces bigotry and hate speech too, the treasurer said in 
response to Labor’s fears (shared by many in the LGBTQI community) that a 
plebiscite will bring awful, soul crushing, and youth endangering hate speech 
and attacks to the fore. 
 * The Greens announced a 20% tax on sugary drinks which they claim could 
raise $500m a year to reinvest in health, and would reduce consumption by 12%. 
 * Deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce announced $83m to reduce the period 
students need to be employed under the self-supporting criteria from 18 months 
to 14 months under youth allowance and Abstudy. 
 * Joyce also announced $44.7m to increase assistance for the isolated 
children additional boarding allowance, and $100m for upgrades to the Outback 
Way. 
 * A Liberal candidate, Ben Willis, who said people who use the term “Invasion 
Day” should be hit in the face with a chairwill not be disendorsed after 
offering an unreserved apology. 
And that’s it. What a day. What a bunch of players. But, no rest for the 
wicked, there’s hump day drinks to be mixed.

See you all early tomorrow.

Albo for PM?

Albanese is asked if he has leadership ambitions. 

“I want to win the election. I want to be a minister in Bill Shorten’s 
government and that is the only focus I have.”

You could think that and still say you don’t want to be leader, Epstein 
counters.

“People talk absolutely nonsense on those questions all the time...

“I ran for leader, I think anyone who runs for leaders has indicated the are 
interested in the position. That was my position in 2013.”

It has changed since then, Albanese says, but to voice the sentence that he 
“doesn’t want to lead the Labor party” would be a “word game”.

Anthony Albanese is on ABC Radio in Melbourne.

Prompted by a caller asking Albanese if taxpayers will have to cover “these 
people’s” sex-change operations under a Labor government, host Rafael Epstein 
asks his view on a plebiscite.

Why doesn’t Labor want one?

“Some of the debate that goes on on social media is unacceptable and it leads 
to hatred and it can lead to real tragic consequences. We don’t have a 
plebiscite on whether we go to war, on what taxes people pay, on issues that 
impact all Australians,” Albanese responds.


“It is a conscience issue where by the people who are opposed to marriage 
equality say the plebiscite won’t impact their vote. We’ll still have the same 
vote at the end of it.”

“It’s a plebiscite in which young people in my electorate who are coming to 
terms with their sexuality will prob not be aversely affected - it’s a tolerant 
community,” he continues.

But if you were in an “adverse situation” with vilification and the sort of 
comments made by Corey Bernardi “then I reckon that will have an impact on 
people’s mental health.”

My Canberra based colleague, Paul Karp, has taken a look at the developing 
stoush betweenMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> and his 
conservative backbencher Corey Bernardi.

Bernardi is furious that Turnbull gave “implicit support” to claims that he 
and other conservative MPs are homophobic.

A questioner on Monday night’s Q&A presented “no evidence” of homophobia in 
the ranks, and misrepresented his “previous statements that redefining marriage 
to include same-sex couples will only lead to further calls for other changes* 
down the track.”

(*polygamy and beastiality 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-19/controversy-over-cory-bernardi-bestiality-comments/4269604>
)

Karp reports:

Q&A host Tony Jones, asked whether Turnbull had said the same to Bernardi.

He replied: “I have said – yes, I have had firm discussions with a number of 
colleagues. Yes.”

In his blog post, Bernardi said: 
<http://www.corybernardi.com/orwellian_influence_in_public_discourse> “By 
saying he’d had firm discussions with a number of colleagues, Turnbull gave 
implicit support to the claim that myself and other Coalition MPs are 
homophobic and implied that he’d had a conversation with me about homophobia.

“For the record I have never had such a conversation with any of my colleagues 
because they know that any such claims cannot be backed with facts.”

The federal government sacked a vet who gave evidence of cruelty and poor 
conditions on live export ships to a federal government steering company after 
her report was inadvertently made public,the ABC has reported. 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-22/live-export-vet-removed-after-revealing-conditions-on-ships/7501428>

Dr Lynn Simpson was hired by the department of agriculture in 2012 after the 
Four Corners report on live export cruelty led to a temporary ban on the trade.

The ABC reports claims it has documents which show her report - which found 
cruel conditions and treatment of the animals on board ships as well as poor 
processes - was supposed to be internal but was accidentally published online. 
She then became “persona non grata” and was removed from her role.

media on the Gold Coast, with an incredibly loud group of protesters on the 
other side of the road, and the press conference came to an abrupt end with 
just one question.

He was asked if he would disendorse the Liberal candidate in the safe Labor 
seat of Gellibrand, Ben Willis.

Willis had posted on social media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/22/liberal-candidate-apologises-for-facebook-post-about-invasion-day>
 that people who said “Invasion Day” instead of Australia Day deserved “a high 
five. In the face. With a chair.”

Turnbull said he understood Willis had made “a comprehensive apology”.

My colleague Ben Doherty has some details and context on the 21 Vietnamese 
asylum seekers at the centre of much of today’s campaign debate. The boat was 
intercepted earlier this month and its passengers processed at sea and returned 
to their country.

There have rightly been questions today about why we are finding out about it 
now, and why – if the government now appears to talk about on-water matters – 
we didn’t when it happened.

From Doherty: 

Asylum seekers previously forcibly returned to Vietnam have been jailed 
despite assurances from the Australian and Vietnamese governments that they 
would not be prosecuted, persecuted or punished for attempting to reach 
Australia.

At least eight people have been jailed for organising boat journeys and trying 
to reach Australia.

The immigration and border protection department has not commented on whether 
assurances were sought or received that people returned to Vietnam from the 
latest boat would not face persecution or prosecution.

The boat is the 28th known to have been turned back since the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> took office in 2013, and 
the first to arrive since the start of this election campaign. A boat of Sri 
Lankan Tamil asylum seekers reached the Cocos Islands, Australian territory, on 
2 May, just days before the election was called.

That was the last boat to make landfall in Australia. The prime minister’s 
claim that his government had “had over 600 days without any unauthorised 
arrivals 
<https://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/visiting-the-australian-border-force-with-natasha-griggs-mp-in-darwin>
” is not correct.

But the announcement of another intercept immediately became an election issue.

ABC News reckons it has caught Labor and Liberal campaign trucks chasing each 
other through inner Sydney. We can at least say that the banner truck promoting 
Liberal MP for Reid, Craig Laundy, was indeed driving very closely behind that 
spruiking his Labor challenger, Angelo Tsirekas.

Guardian photographer-at-large, Mike Bowers, has been travelling with Bill 
Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> in Sydney 
today, where the opposition leader sat down at the commonwealth parliament 
offices with some of the people who fell victim to dodgy financial advice.

He’s pictured here with Teghan Couper and her child, Hype.

AAP was also there, and it reports one victim, Mark Hadley, a tradie from 
Sydney’s Blacktown, invested $200,000 through his tax agent who was also a 
financial adviser.


He lost the lot, which left him unable to pay his mortgage and created 
marriage difficulties and trouble with alcohol.


“It all come up stump,” Hadley told Shorten.

Shorten again pushed for a royal commission into the banking industry.

The Coalition <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> has 
released a little more detail about thatregional investment corporation, 
announced by the deputy PM, Barnaby Joyce, at the Canberra Press Club today.

Commonwealth financing and the processing of concessional loans will be 
streamlined under the proposed scheme. It would, the release says,enable new 
dams to be financed quickly and ensure fast approval of drought loans.


The corporation will administer funds relating to existing loans under the 
drought, drought recovery and farm finance concessional loan schemes, as well 
as the $2bn water infrastructure loan facility.

It will be fully funded through interested payments on commonwealth loan 
schemes, Joyce said.

He said the government has in the past had to “barter” with states to process 
drought and dairy concessional loans, and this would bring that to an end.

And so we bring today to an end. It sure was something. If you’ve been 
nostalgic for campaigns past, the Daily Telegraph was here to help, with a 
front page about boats. The revelation? An asylum seeker vessel was intercepted 
three weeks ago. People smugglers are clearly readying themselves. Because 
Labor. I think.

Here’s a brief summary of today’s key points.

 * Peter Dutton couldn’t explain why the government was suddenly talking about 
on water matters, other than a new found respect for transparency coinciding 
with an election.

 * It was scare campaign versus scare campaign as Labor continued its line on 
Medicare privatisation under a Coalition government. Deputy leader Tanya 
Plibersek later walked back from it a little,acknowledging Turnbull’s repeated 
denial, but said the Coalition still wanted a user pays system.

 * The Australian Medical Association criticised the Labor Medicare campaign, 
and said outsourcing the payment system “in no way” amounts to privatisation. 
 * Bill Shorten renewed calls for a Royal Commission on the banking industry. 
 * Anthony Albanese said he doesn’t want to be Labor leader (right at this 
moment). 
 * Scott Morrison faces bigotry and hate speech too, the treasurer said in 
response to Labor’s fears (shared by many in the LGBTQI community) that a 
plebiscite will bring awful, soul crushing, and youth endangering hate speech 
and attacks to the fore. 
 * The Greens announced a 20% tax on sugary drinks which they claim could 
raise $500m a year to reinvest in health, and would reduce consumption by 12%. 
 * Deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce announced $83m to reduce the period 
students need to be employed under the self-supporting criteria from 18 months 
to 14 months under youth allowance and Abstudy. 
 * Joyce also announced $44.7m to increase assistance for the isolated 
children additional boarding allowance, and $100m for upgrades to the Outback 
Way. 
 * A Liberal candidate, Ben Willis, who said people who use the term “Invasion 
Day” should be hit in the face with a chairwill not be disendorsed after 
offering an unreserved apology. 
And that’s it. What a day. What a bunch of players. But, no rest for the 
wicked, there’s hump day drinks to be mixed.

See you all early tomorrow.
 
Albanese is asked if he has leadership ambitions. 

“I want to win the election. I want to be a minister in Bill Shorten’s 
government and that is the only focus I have.”

You could think that and still say you don’t want to be leader, Epstein 
counters.

“People talk absolutely nonsense on those questions all the time...

“I ran for leader, I think anyone who runs for leaders has indicated the are 
interested in the position. That was my position in 2013.”

It has changed since then, Albanese says, but to voice the sentence that he 
“doesn’t want to lead the Labor party” would be a “word game”.
 
Anthony Albanese is on ABC Radio in Melbourne.

Prompted by a caller asking Albanese if taxpayers will have to cover “these 
people’s” sex-change operations under a Labor government, host Rafael Epstein 
asks his view on a plebiscite.

Why doesn’t Labor want one?

“Some of the debate that goes on on social media is unacceptable and it leads 
to hatred and it can lead to real tragic consequences. We don’t have a 
plebiscite on whether we go to war, on what taxes people pay, on issues that 
impact all Australians,” Albanese responds.


“It is a conscience issue where by the people who are opposed to marriage 
equality say the plebiscite won’t impact their vote. We’ll still have the same 
vote at the end of it.”

“It’s a plebiscite in which young people in my electorate who are coming to 
terms with their sexuality will prob not be aversely affected - it’s a tolerant 
community,” he continues.

But if you were in an “adverse situation” with vilification and the sort of 
comments made by Corey Bernardi “then I reckon that will have an impact on 
people’s mental health.”
 
My Canberra based colleague, Paul Karp, has taken a look at the developing 
stoush betweenMalcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> and his 
conservative backbencher Corey Bernardi.

Bernardi is furious that Turnbull gave “implicit support” to claims that he 
and other conservative MPs are homophobic.

A questioner on Monday night’s Q&A presented “no evidence” of homophobia in 
the ranks, and misrepresented his “previous statements that redefining marriage 
to include same-sex couples will only lead to further calls for other changes* 
down the track.”

(*polygamy and beastiality 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-19/controversy-over-cory-bernardi-bestiality-comments/4269604>
)

Karp reports:

Q&A host Tony Jones, asked whether Turnbull had said the same to Bernardi.

He replied: “I have said – yes, I have had firm discussions with a number of 
colleagues. Yes.”

In his blog post, Bernardi said: 
<http://www.corybernardi.com/orwellian_influence_in_public_discourse> “By 
saying he’d had firm discussions with a number of colleagues, Turnbull gave 
implicit support to the claim that myself and other Coalition MPs are 
homophobic and implied that he’d had a conversation with me about homophobia.

“For the record I have never had such a conversation with any of my colleagues 
because they know that any such claims cannot be backed with facts.”

The federal government sacked a vet who gave evidence of cruelty and poor 
conditions on live export ships to a federal government steering company after 
her report was inadvertently made public,the ABC has reported. 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-22/live-export-vet-removed-after-revealing-conditions-on-ships/7501428>

Dr Lynn Simpson was hired by the department of agriculture in 2012 after the 
Four Corners report on live export cruelty led to a temporary ban on the trade.

The ABC reports claims it has documents which show her report - which found 
cruel conditions and treatment of the animals on board ships as well as poor 
processes - was supposed to be internal but was accidentally published online. 
She then became “persona non grata” and was removed from her role.
 
A short time ago Malcolm Turnbull 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull> was addressing 
media on the Gold Coast, with an incredibly loud group of protesters on the 
other side of the road, and the press conference came to an abrupt end with 
just one question.

He was asked if he would disendorse the Liberal candidate in the safe Labor 
seat of Gellibrand, Ben Willis.

Willis had posted on social media 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/22/liberal-candidate-apologises-for-facebook-post-about-invasion-day>
 that people who said “Invasion Day” instead of Australia Day deserved “a high 
five. In the face. With a chair.”

Turnbull said he understood Willis had made “a comprehensive apology”.

My colleague Ben Doherty has some details and context on the 21 Vietnamese 
asylum seekers at the centre of much of today’s campaign debate. The boat was 
intercepted earlier this month and its passengers processed at sea and returned 
to their country.

There have rightly been questions today about why we are finding out about it 
now, and why – if the government now appears to talk about on-water matters – 
we didn’t when it happened.

From Doherty: 

Asylum seekers previously forcibly returned to Vietnam have been jailed 
despite assurances from the Australian and Vietnamese governments that they 
would not be prosecuted, persecuted or punished for attempting to reach 
Australia.

At least eight people have been jailed for organising boat journeys and trying 
to reach Australia.

The immigration and border protection department has not commented on whether 
assurances were sought or received that people returned to Vietnam from the 
latest boat would not face persecution or prosecution.

The boat is the 28th known to have been turned back since the Coalition 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition> took office in 2013, and 
the first to arrive since the start of this election campaign. A boat of Sri 
Lankan Tamil asylum seekers reached the Cocos Islands, Australian territory, on 
2 May, just days before the election was called.

That was the last boat to make landfall in Australia. The prime minister’s 
claim that his government had “had over 600 days without any unauthorised 
arrivals 
<https://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/visiting-the-australian-border-force-with-natasha-griggs-mp-in-darwin>
” is not correct.

But the announcement of another intercept immediately became an election issue.

Guardian photographer-at-large, Mike Bowers, has been travelling with Bill 
Shorten <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten> in Sydney 
today, where the opposition leader sat down at the commonwealth parliament 
offices with some of the people who fell victim to dodgy financial advice.

He’s pictured here with Teghan Couper and her child, Hype.

AAP was also there, and it reports one victim, Mark Hadley, a tradie from 
Sydney’s Blacktown, invested $200,000 through his tax agent who was also a 
financial adviser.


He lost the lot, which left him unable to pay his mortgage and created 
marriage difficulties and trouble with alcohol.


“It all come up stump,” Hadley told Shorten.

Shorten again pushed for a royal commission into the banking industry.
