The NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> is being transformed into 
the “national hangover service” as binge drinking diverts vital resources, the 
head of the health service in England said. Simon Stevens condemned “selfish” 
partygoers in a stark warning as the nation gears up for one of the most 
alcohol-steeped nights of the year.

The chief executive of NHS England added that the health service was already 
facing considerable strain from the annual spike in winter emergencies.

Millions of revellers are expected to pack bars, pubs and clubs across the UK 
to celebrate the arrival of 2017 on Saturday night. Figures from the health 
service show that admissions for alcohol-related incidents rocket on the first 
day of the new year.

How far can the NHS go to support addicts who won't help themselves?

Stevens told the Daily Telegraph: “At a time of year when hospitals are always 
under pressure, caring for a spike in winter emergencies, it’s really selfish 
to get so blotto that you end up in an ambulance or A&E. More than a third of 
A&E attendances at peak times are caused by drunkenness. Casualty nurses and 
doctors are understandably frustrated about the NHS being used as a national 
hangover service.

“In our towns and cities this Christmas and new year, the paramedic called to 
a drunk partygoer passed out on the pavement is an ambulance crew obviously not 
then available for a genuine medical emergency.”
