The celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/antonyworrallthompson> has blamed his 
bank after putting his restaurant chain into administration last Friday.

Sixty staff lost their jobs after four of Worrall Thompson's restaurants 
stopped trading. The chef has used his own savings to keep two more outlets 
running, and has criticised Lloyds Banking Group for refusing him a £200,000 
overdraft to help the business through the next few months.

"We needed looking after for the first four months of the year and the banks 
just didn't want to play, not without me giving horrendous personal guarantees 
that I wasn't prepared to do," said Worrall Thompson.

Worrall Thompson said sales at the restaurant chain began falling last autumn, 
when the financial crisis intensified.

"There was a recession – we knew that was coming, we were ready for it – but 
we didn't realise it was going into a depression almost. And, wham, October 
really hit us," he told BBC Breakfast today.

Worrall Thompson said Lloyds had asked him to put up his own house as 
security, a risk he declined to take.

The four restaurants that have closed are the Notting Grill in west London, 
the Lamb Inn and the Greyhound, both near Henley-on-Thames, and the Barnes 
Grill in south-west London.

Restaurant chains have been heavily hit by the recession, with many people no 
longer eating out or trading down to cheaper restaurants to save money. In 
JanuaryFishworks, an upmarket seafood chain, went into administration

Meanwhile, the pizza delivery chain Domino's has reported strong sales and 
McDonalds is creating thousands of apprenticeships.

Worrall Thompson, who will keep running the Kew Grill in south-west London and 
the Windsor Grill in Berkshire, warned that small businesses would continue to 
suffer through the downturn unless banks lent more readily.
