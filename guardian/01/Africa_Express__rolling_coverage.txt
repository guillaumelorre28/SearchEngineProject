Caspar Llewellyn Smith Welcome back to our ongoing coverage of the Africa 
Express <https://www.theguardian.com/music/africa-express> tour around the UK. 
The train is in Glasgow right now, with a pop-up show about to take place at 
The Platform Community Centre in Easterhouse, following the gig proper at the 
Arches last night.

There's some reaction here from the Twittesphere, and later we're anticipating 
a fuller report from our own Tim Jonze, although his own Tweet suggests it 
might not come too soon ....

After Glasgow, the train heads to Manchester, where I'll be joining them 
before their show at the Ritz tonight. Here's the likely lineup:

Afel Bocoum, Afrikan Boy, Amadou & Mariam, Baaba Maal, Bashy, Bassekou 
Kouyate, The Bots, Carl Barât, Cubain Kabeya,Damon Albarn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/damon-albarn>, Diabel Cissokho, E.L, Express 
horns (brass section), Fode Lassana, Jack Steadman (Bombay Bicycle Club), Jesse 
Hackett, Jon McClure (Reverend & The Makers), Jupiter & Okwess International, 
Kano, Kareem Rush (Arabian Knightz), Krar Collective, Kyla La Grange, Lucy 
Rose, M1 (Dead Prez), M3NSA, M.anifest, Mehdi Haddab, Mim Suleiman, Nick Zinner 
(Yeah Yeah Yeahs), Pauli (“the PSM”), Rae Morris, Reeps One, Remi Kabaka, 
Richard Russell (XL), Rokia Traoré, Romeo Stodart (Magic Numbers), Rye Rye, 
Spoek Mathambo, Seye, Temper Trap, Terri Walker, Thandiswa, Tony Allen, The 
Very Best (soundsystem)

But! First, en route they'll by stopping at Carlisle station for a free pop-up 
show - be there at 14:16 (if this timetable is accurate ...).

And here's another guest contribution - from Jordan (Stephens) of Rizzle Kicks 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/nov/18/british-rap-pack-dizzee-tinie-tinchy>
!

We missed the train from London so we ended up turning up in Leeds at the 
rehearsal studios. We walked in and there were 70 musicians in rehearsal rooms 
and you don't really know where to start. Then you start noticing musicians you 
know a bit or have heard of.

I made my first move into a room with a beatboxer and within 10 minutes you've 
gone from “I'm just gonna sit back and watch things” to “I'm actually making 
music”. Which is a pretty amazing feeling. The songs come about in all kind of 
ways. We did Down With The Trumpets because we tried it at a pop-up 
spontaneously the other day and it worked. Once you start playing people just 
join in when they get the vibe. I was doing the same – I ended up rapping on 
Hip Hop with M1 from Dead Prez! I wasn't supposed to be on that one but the 
vibe was there so fuck it, why not?

To be on a moving train with a rehearsal studio on it … it's hard to take in 
really. We are doing things over this week where there's nerves and 
anticipation and excitement but what it amounts to is this weird feeling of 
relaxation – because at the end of the day all we have to think about here is 
the music and that doesn't happen all that often.

What else am I looking forward to? I've not done so much with the African 
musicians here so far so maybe I will get involved with that. As a rapper I 
want to get involved with as much stuff as possible. I grew up with loads of 
African music in the house so who knows what might happen ... I might just come 
on stage and dance withBaaba Maal <https://www.theguardian.com/music/baaba-maal>
 tonight.
Rizzle Kicks (@RizzleKicks) 
Honestly, @africaexpress <https://twitter.com/africaexpress> is something 
else. Amazing

4.23pm BST 

As promised ... the brilliant author Richard Milward (read Apples and Ten 
Storey Love Song, and look out for his new novel from Faber...) has snuck 
aboard the train, and here are some thoughts from him:

George Stephenson would be twisting and shouting in his grave. When the Father 
of the Railways devised the Stockton to Darlington rail line in the early 
1800s, it's doubtful he would've imagined it accommodating the rollicking stock 
that rolled onto Teesside yesterday afternoon.

The Africa Express came to the Boro touting its trance-inducing, joy-inducing 
wares: rattling the replanted ayresome gates of Middlesbrough FC with 
drumsticks, shaking the bookshelves of the centenary-celebrating central 
library, before taking to the town hall for an evening of kaleido-cultural 
wonder.

Being the first stop on this magical multi-rhythmical tour, chance would argue 
the opening event at the town hall might be a ramshackle affair - a hell for 
leather bulldozing of musical and cultural boundaries. However, what we got was 
a surprisingly cohesive blast of beautifully rendered abandon. Part of the 
thrill for me was the hypnotic rhythms – drum daydreams at times evoking 
Spacemen 3, Steve Reich, Amon Düül II, staking claim on your senses with 
mesmeric mallet wielding. Saying that, this is not just Mark E Smith's 
puritanical three rs - repetition, repetition, repetition - the onslaught is 
interspersed with moments of quiet ascension: we have Melancholy Hill and 
plenty of acappella splendour.

But best of all is the train itself - Poirot would be well out of his depth. 
It's surely more exotic and obscure than the Orient Express: on the journey 
from Boro to Glasgow, it's a heady feeling blasting past the sun-dazzled north 
east coast while Damon and co blast the drums and amps next door in the 
rehearsal carriage.

Certain carriages are peppered with sleepers and somnambulists, others are 
alive with creative carnage. We got a tribal drum fanfare leaving Middlesbrough 
and a bagpipe march through the carriages on entering Scotland. Who knows what 
awaits us, but it's bound to be another heady, hypnotic, heavenly buzz. The 
Africa Express is an anomaly in any trainspotter's notebook; a multicolour 
reel-to-reel tape on wheels; an inter-city pleasure.

12.12pm BST 

Tim Jonze I'm not sure what happened to the ramshackle, unstructured, 
just-testing-the-water opening show I promised you all in a previous post. 
Because last night's Africa Express show wasn't just a triumph but a remarkably 
slick one too considering the circumstances.

After another manic day which once again feels more like a month (brass bands 
in Hebdon Bridge! IncredibleBaaba Maal 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/26/baaba-maal-africa-express-interview>
 jam in the Rave Carriage!Jupiter & Okwess International 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/26/jupiter-bokondji-africa-express-congo>
 playing in front of Middlesbrough FC's stadium and turning the railings into 
makeshift percussion!), it seems improbable that there was any energy left for 
the main event. Yet somehow there was. Middlesbrough Town Hall was packed and 
nobody could argue that they didn't get their money's worth – the musicians 
started around half seven and didn't wind down until just before midnight.

During this time we were treated to Carl Barat 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/carl-barat> leading a bongo-heavy band through 
a funky reworking of the Libertines' Don't Look Back Into The Sun,Dead Prez's 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/apr/04/popandrock5?INTCMP=SRCH> M1 
tearing through Hip Hop withRye Rye <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye_Rye> and 
M.anifest 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/26/manifest-african-express-ghanaian-rapper>
 and aRokia Traoré 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/26/rokia-traore-barbican-review> song 
we saw being rehearsed last night. “That song turned into something else 
halfway through,” grins Traoré's charming bassist Ruth backstage after her 
spot, a look of mock-panic on her face. “But we just went with it anyway...” 
That seems to be the spirit of things.

At the back of the venue I bump into brilliant Middlesbrough author Richard 
Milward 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/feb/15/richard-milward-apples-intervoew-ten-storey-love-song>
 (you should really read his debut novel Apples, and go from there). He's 
loving the repetitive grooves being worked up onstage. “It's like Spaceman 3 in 
a way, really psychedelic,” he says, from his trance-like state.

Things wig-out further as the night progresses. One song turns into a ska 
meltdown, with theBots 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/27/new-band-bots>, Maximo Park 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/maximopark> and Rizzle Kicks  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/rizzle-kicks>rubbing up against Tamar Osborn 
<http://tamarosborn.com/>'s saxophone. Before you can blink there's an entirely 
different bunch of musicians onstage (I counted 18) with Baaba Maal singing at 
the front and a video of our train hurtling through England up on the 
projector. Other highlights include a version of DRC Music's Hallo and a dubby 
encore featuring Baaba Maal and theTemper Trap 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/may/17/the-temper-trap-review>.

Backstage the drinks and good vibes are flowing and there's the realisation 
that we're not going to get much sleep before Glasgow, or possibly at any point 
over the next week. Richard Milward joins us for drinks until gone 1am which is 
fine for him because he doesn't have to get up early the next day. Then, at 
8.30am I get a text from him: “Class crack last night … can I come on the train 
today?” He's onboard now, as I type, wrapped up in the mania of Africa Express 
and wondering how he's ever going to get all the work done he was supposed to 
do today before sacking it off to hitch a ride to Glasgow and take in some 
Congolese electro-funk in the Rave Carriage.

Sadly, the ability to get on this train has evaded some. Jon McLure's 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jonmcclure> just got off the phone to a 
certain Mr Carl Barat. “Shit!” he shouts across the carriage. “I knew this 
would happen … he's still in his hotel room.” Will tonight's show live up to 
last night's emphatic opener? How many musicians will still be left standing by 
the time we get back to London? And if a former Libertine sings but nobody's 
there to hear him, does it make a sound? These are the deep philosophical 
questions unearthed by Africa Express, along with: Will there be table tennis 
backstage at Glasgow so I can finally show Damon Albarn who's boss? And can a 
single human liver really process any more red wine. By the end of today we 
will at least know the answer to that last question.

Africa Express paid a surprise visit to Bradford on the first full day of 
their UK-wide tour, on the way to their first gig.

The pop-up gigs they did here were at Culture Fusion (the YMCA), City Park, 
Bradford Royal Infirmary and the University of Bradford.

In City Park the band used the Yorkshire Solar Sounds solar-powered PA system 
kindly lent to them for the morning.

Next up: @africaexpress <https://twitter.com/africaexpress> Middlesbrough pop 
up shows. We'll be visiting: My Place Youth Centre and Ye Olde Young Tea House 
around 5pm today

2012 <https://twitter.com/africaexpress/status/242633895663763456> 
3.28pm BST 

Tim Jonze Back onboard the Africa Express and The Rave Carriage(tm) seems a 
touch quieter today. Perhaps the previous night's exertions have taken their 
toll on the musicians – it certainly feels like we've been on tour for several 
months despite the fact that, according to our watches, it's barely 24-hours 
since we left Euston.

Not that people have been slacking off. By 9.30am almost every artist had 
congregated outside the Bewley's Hotel in Leeds for yet more pop-up shows. And 
just to make matters more complicated (because scattering a bunch of African 
musicians around a city and expecting them to be on Platform 12 by 1pm is just 
too easy, right?) it's decided that most of the morning's venues will be out of 
town. So whileRokia Traoré 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/26/rokia-traore-barbican-review> and 
his band head off to the city'sJumbo Records <https://twitter.com/JumboRecords> 
for a gig, most of the other musicians jump on a coach to Bradford where 
they'll play in the city square, a hospital and at a community centre (Rizzle 
Kicks <http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/rizzle-kicks>, Maximo Park 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/maximopark?INTCMP=SRCH>, Spoek Mathambo 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/feb/25/spoek-mathambo-control-new-music>
 andAmadou's  <http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/amadou-and-mariam>percussionist 
are among the line-up). I, on the other hand, head to Hebdon Bridge Trades Club 
withAfrikan Boy <http://afrikanboy.com/>, Krar Collective 
<http://www.facebook.com/KrarCollective> and Reeps One 
<http://www.facebook.com/reepsone> where they're putting on a bizarre sounding 
20 minute show in collaboration with the Hebdon Bridge Junior Brass Band 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/gallery/2008/mar/10/brass.band>. Can this 
really work? A bunch of kids playing euphoniums while Reeps One attempts to 
beatbox over the top of it?

I'm predicting sonic meltdown, but when the brass band start working up the 
ska riff to A Message To You Rudy and the individual members start chipping in 
– Tamar Osborn's stabs of saxophone, Afrikan Boy's party-inciting verses – it 
all makes a wonderful kind of sense. The locals love it, their spirits not even 
dampened by the fact that, as this is happening before midday on a Monday 
morning, the bar is only serving orange juice. In fact, the reception is so 
rapturous that Afrikan Boy announces they'll stay and play an extra song. “Make 
it a short one," winces Africa Express director Stephen Budd from the side of 
the stage: "We've got a train to catch!". Fair enough – for every minute we 
pull out of a station late on this tour we'll apparently be fined £300.

Of course, the fact that these artists can just turn up and make a show out of 
nothing shouldn't be too surprising. It's virtually what's happening at the 
first official gig tonight in Middlesbrough, only this time there will be 
around 80 people onstage hoping to push their musical ideas into the mix. 
According to Damon, the point is to gradually improve the show until it hits a 
spectacular peak by the time the train rolls back into London. Does this mean 
Middlesbrough get the short end of the stick, with what will surely be the most 
ramshackle show of the tour? I'd say not. Part of what makes Africa Express so 
thrilling is not the slick end product but watching the ideas percolate, always 
on the brink of collapse, always likely to shoot off into unchartered 
territory. If this means we occasionally get a meandering passage or two along 
the way then the energetic, adventurous spirit on display should more than make 
up for it.

Right, we're approaching Middlesbrough now where (I think) I'm off to watch 
some bands (no idea who!) do a pop up show at the football stadium (possibly, 
one of the charming things about this is nobody knows where or what is coming 
next). Oh, and by the time I've finished writing this update, the Rave Carriage 
is back in full swing. I should never have doubted it.

Tim Jonze Spare a thought for Ken, manning the Africa Express refreshments 
carriage. He was supposed to be heading out for a trip around Torquay this week 
before a last minute scheduling change saw him relocated to this madhouse. 
Instead of tending to OAP holiday makers he is instead having to navigate 
carriages where the speakers threaten to topple over and kill someone every 
time we go around a corner.

“I can't say I'm a music fanatic,” he confides, when the coach becomes quiet. 
“But I've liked what I've heard and I'm told these are supposedly some of the 
best African musicians around.”

“What do you mean supposedly?” asks M.anifest  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/26/manifest-african-express-ghanaian-rapper>
who's been lurking around the corner, before grinning, reaching over the 
counter and helping himself to a couple of free beers.

Ken might not be au fait with the latest developments in Senegalese funk but 
he's definitely embracing the spirit of proceedings. "I like that they've been 
going to schools and teaching them about the music," he says. "Sharing things 
from different cultures is what this is all about at the end of the day." Even 
if he wasn't the man responsible for keeping us in free beer, we'd struggle to 
disagree with that.

11.33pm BST 

Tim Jonze Well, that was some opening day. You last heard from me as we left 
Milton Keynes, with Jupiter Bokondji and a bunch of others inciting a musical 
riot in what shall henceforth be referred to as the rave carriage. Since then 
we've hit Stoke-on-Trent where the assortment of 100-odd musicians dispersed 
across the city to play in the town centre, perform at a bandstand and – 
perhaps most implausibly – deliver an impromptu Malian jam at Stoke-on-Trent 
sixth form college. Which certainly beats further maths.

I head to the college to watch Amadou Bagayoko and Bassekou Kouyate represent 
Mali with some grinding desert blues, with music from the tour's Congolese 
contingent to follow – including a great version of Hallo from last year's DRC 
Music – Kinshasa One Two album. The musicianship, it has to be said, is 
stunning and some of the western artists traveling have admitted to feeling 
somewhat intimidated by the African artists who are happy to just turn up on 
stage with no plans and jam for an hour or so.

On the way back to the train, Gorillaz Soundsystem man Remi Kabaka explains 
why the tour has kicked off with such a bang. “There's a lot of testerone on 
the train,” he reveals. “We had to take that out on the cowbells. If we hadn't 
... who knows what might have happened? We'd have probably had to make love to 
each other by now.”

It's quite strange to see “Africa Express: Chartered Train” on the Departures 
board when we hit Stoke's platform two, but perhaps not as strange as the fact 
two separate gigs have broken out on the concourse. As Damon Albarn tells me 
when we finally arrive in Leeds around 6pm: “It's been bizarre. We've been able 
to turn up in random places and act like lunatics and … nobody seems to mind!” 
He goes on to say that he needs to pace himself “on every level” to make sure 
the whole thing continues without a hitch, but I'm not sure all that much 
pacing is in the equation when we hit the rehearsal rooms in Leeds and the 
beers/red wine flows in abundance. Impromptu games of table tennis break out 
and it's at this point that your correspondent realises through a drunken haze 
that he's far better than he thought and really was wasted on music journalism 
(tomorrow's sobriety may dispute this fact).

Watching the bands get to know each other in one of the eight rehearsal rooms 
is arguably the highlight of the night. In one room The Bots are rocking out 
with Martina Topley-Bird, while next door Carl Barat tests the water in a 
tentative jam with Jupiter's gang. Perhaps the liveliest room, though, is 
upstairs where rappers M.anifest, Afrikan Boy and Kareem Rush take turns to 
spit bars over Jon McClure's melodica blasts (now there's a sentence we never 
thought we'd write).

After that everyone's off to carry on drinking, but not for too long if 
they've got any sense. Tomorrow morning it's a 10am start for a series of 
pop-up shows in Leeds, Bradford and Hebdon Bridges before the train rolls on to 
Middlesbrough. That's where the opening gig is scheduled for and the mayhem 
really starts …

10.17pm BST 

Jupiter Bokondji We had problems getting here because our visa was refused by 
the British Embassy in Nairobi. We’re from the Congo and some Congolese 
athletes attending the Olympics disappeared recently, so we were caught up in 
that embargo. Luckily Africa Express is so dynamic and effective that they 
managed to sort it out. And then when we arrived in Brussels, the immigration 
officer didn’t believe we were just passing through on our way to England, 
because so many Congolese people disappear out there. So I just told him to go 
and look up my name on Google and when he saw all the pages that came up, he 
let us through. When we arrived in England, it was cool.

We’re living something immense. Africa Express has allowed me to get to know 
some of the big names of African music, that I’ve always heard about but never 
seen. People like Amadou, like Baaba Maal, like Rokia Traore. We’ve been 
improvising with Damon on the train, just trying to work a few things out. But 
I think we’re getting there. The contact is really very positive and it’s a 
really great experience for me.

When I saw the train this morning in the station, I thought it was incredible. 
All those flags of all the countries taking part… and a train just for us for 
seven days … it’s immense! The landscapes that I saw through the window 
inspired me. It was a big discovery. Even if none of us live for ever, because 
man has his limits, Africa Express has no limits. It’ll go on forever!

10.15pm BST 

Caspar Llewellyn Smith I'll post some thoughts on the trip so far from Jupiter 
Bokondji (with thanks to Andy Morgan for the translation). 

Jupiter and his band were one of the hits of Womad this year 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/jul/29/womad-2012-day-three-live>
, and he also spoke to the Observer New Review for their recentNew Africa 
special <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/series/new-africa>(which is very much 
worth checking out).

Tim Jonze So, arriving at Platform 18 it didn't take long to realise that this 
isn't the usual Virgin service to Stoke. For one thing, the platform and train 
were decorated with multicoloured bunting. For another, Jupiter Bokondji and 
his Okwess International band were unleashing joyous rhythms with an impromptu 
gig outside the first class coach (delightfully old school private 
compartments). Loitering around were Damon Albarn, Tony Allen, Romeo from the 
Magic Numbers, Rokia Traore and Jarvis Cocker (not getting on the train sadly).

Inside things were already equally hectic. "A free bar!" shouted Jon McClure 
as he chatted to Terri Walker at the refreshments carriage. "Oh dear, the 
toilets are leaking," muttered a rather confused looking train manager. Then, 
just as the train was about to leave – on the dot of 11.30am - rapper Rye Rye 
came legging it down the platform to be pulled on board with seconds to spare. 

While all this was going on Damon and XL's Richard Russell were jamming in one 
of the carriages. And now? Jupiter is making a thrilling racket with rapper 
Kareem Rush and a whole load of other musicians. What the innocent people of 
Milton Keynes (where we've just pulled in for a break) make of it all is 
anyone's guess. Although I can confirm there is much dancing on the platform ...

Caspar Llewellyn Smith I've just been down to Euston, to wave Tim and the 
train off. I'll be joining it myself on Wednesday, in Manchester, but will post 
pictures, videos, tweets and more reports from Tim and artists on the train as 
it rolls along on this blog.

And among those others waving it goodbye? That Jarvis Cocker.

Tim Jonze Well, so much for trying to book tickets in the quiet coach. Over 
the next week the Guardian music team are getting onboard the Africa Express 
train, which aims to transport around 80 African and Western musicians across 
Britain for a series of concerts, stopping everywhere from Glasgow to Bristol 
via Stoke, Carlisle and Cardiff along the way.

Joining us on the train will be an incredible array of artists: Damon Albarn, 
Amadou & Mariam, Baaba Maal, Carl Barat,Fatoumata Diawara 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/fatoumata-diawara>, Lucy Rose, Kano, Nico 
Jaar, Tony Allen, Rizzle Kicks and Spoek Mathambo to name just a few. They’ll 
be getting to know each other as we travel across the country and will 
(hopefully) be exchanging musical ideas along the way – on our specially 
chartered train there are even rehearsal carriages for the musicians to jam in. 

Musical activity won’t just be confined to the night’s gigs. The tour promises 
a selection of pop up performances and workshops in “shopping centres, 
factories and homes”. So if you were wondering why a Congolese funk troupe have 
invaded your kitchen, now you know.

You can read more about the project here 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/26/africa-express-bound-for-glory?intcmp=239>
, as well as interviews withAlbarn

,Fatou 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/26/fatoumata-diawara-africa-express-interview>
 andmore <http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/africa-express> (plus Rio Ferdinand 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/26/rio-ferdinand-africa-express-interview>
, the footballer, who's been roped into the action, too).

Anyway, I'm just off to Euston Station to meet up with everyone on the 
platform before we leave later this morning for the first leg up to Stoke On 
Trent. Now I need to rush hop aboard …
