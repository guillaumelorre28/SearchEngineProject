Amid unrest and confusion over who will succeed Mullah Omar as leader of the 
Taliban <https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban>, one group stands to win no 
matter who is chosen: Isis.


The Taliban has been in turmoil since it confirmed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/30/taliban-officially-announces-death-of-mullah-omar>
 11 days ago that Omar, long hidden from the public eye, was dead.

Soon after the announcement, a statement on the Taliban’s website designated 
Omar’s deputy, Mullah Mohammad Akhtar Mansoor, as its new leader. But that 
succession has since been contested, including by members of Omar’s family.

With Omar gone there is no obvious challenger in the global Islamist movement 
to the Islamic State leader,Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi>, and the Taliban’s 
repeated rebukes of its rival have lost their authority.

“The death of Mullah Omar takes away the main centre of gravity in the jihadi 
movement that competes withIslamic State 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis>,” said JM Berger, co-author of Isis: 
The State of Terror. “There’s not really another figure that can compare to 
Mullah Omar. This undercuts that side of the equation in a major way.”

The long-delayed announcement of Omar’s death, which Afghan intelligence 
claims happened more than two years ago, has put the Taliban’s new leader in an 
awkward position.

As Omar’s deputy since 2010, Mansoor was part of a tiny clique with direct 
access to the reclusive leader, and was responsible for putting out messages in 
Omar’s name. Most recently, on 15 July, the Taliban’s websitereleased a 
statement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/15/taliban-peace-talks-afghan-government-endorsed-mullah-omar>
, in which Omar purportedly endorsed recent peace talks with the Afghan 
government.

“The question is when he died. If the Taliban 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban> have been sending out messages in 
his name after his death, it’s a huge credibility problem for them,” said 
Berger.

The people who swore allegiance to Mullah Omar are not obligated to swear 
allegiance to his successor

In an apparent attempt to portray unity, and to show that the jihad against 
government forces and their foreign backers continues despite internal chaos, 
the Taliban carried out at least two remarkably vicious attacks in Kabul on 
Friday. The insurgents claimed responsibility for an assault on an Afghan 
police academy and a US military base, and are suspected of detonating a truck 
bomb in a residential area, all within 24 hours. At least 50 people were killed 
and several hundred wounded in what amounts to the bloodiest day for Afghan 
civilians in many years.


As the capital was on high alert, a car bomb exploded near the entrance to 
Kabul airport on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/10/car-bomb-explodes-near-kabul-airport-afghanistan>
, killing four.

Isis is thriving off the visible disarray in the Taliban, with supporters 
taking to social media, jubilantly denouncing Mansoor as a liar.

“The reason Taliban wanted to hide Mullah Omar’s death was to stop Muslims 
from pledging allegiance to Islamic State,” one Isis devoteetweeted 
<http://the%20reason%20taliban%20wanted%20to%20hide%20mullah%20omar%27s%20death%20was%20to%20stop%20muslims%20from%20pledging%20allegiance%20to%20islamic%20state./>
.

Others spread unsubstantiated rumours that Mansoor had poisoned Omar and 
dumped his body in a river.


The Taliban have sought to counter Isis’s growing influence within 
Afghanistan. In an open letter in June, Mansoor warned Baghdadi not to 
interfere inAfghanistan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan>. The 
July message in Omar’s name was also seen as a thinly veiled threat to Isis.


However, if Omar really died in April 2013, he was not alive to criticise 
Isis’s declaration of a caliphate, which was made in 2014.

Borhan Osman, a Kabul-based analyst with the Afghanistan Analysts Network, 
said Omar’s demise leaves Isis with a rhetorical opening: “They showed some 
caution in describing the Taliban as a deviant group because of the huge 
importance of Mullah Omar as a symbolic jihadist godfather,” he said. “They are 
now talking about the new leader in very harsh language.”

In January, a self-proclaimed Isis commander declared a new province in 
Afghanistan and Pakistan called Wilayat-Khorasan. Since then, small pockets of 
Taliban fighters have pledged allegiance to Isis. Those groups can now grow.

“The people who swore allegiance to Mullah Omar are not obligated to swear 
allegiance to his successor,” Berger said. Omar’s death leaves a vacuum, just 
as the killing of Ahmed Abdi Godane, leader of the Somali Islamist outfit 
al-Shabaab, did in that group in 2014. “And Isis has been working on al-Shabaab 
pretty hard for a while,” Berger said.

Yet, there are significant ideological differences between the Taliban and 
Isis, which are likely to limit defections. Osman described the Taliban 
fighters prone to joining Isis as “a very small segment”. However, he added, it 
is difficult to gauge why people join certain militant groups.

“If we look at who has so far joined Islamic State, they have not done so only 
out of ideology,” Osman said. Equally important factors have been opportunism, 
crime, grievances against the Taliban, or simple attraction to the Isis brand, 
he said.

Omar’s death is also likely to have ramifications beyond the Taliban. A win of 
this sort for Isis is also a loss for its other major rivalal-Qaida 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/al-qaida>. In September 2014, Ayman 
al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaida, renewed hisbayah – oath – to Omar, 
implying that if anyone should be caliph of the Islamic world, it should be the 
Taliban leader, not Baghdadi.

With the coverup of Omar’s death, Zawahiri’s credibility is now strained, too. 
Either he was embarrassingly uninformed about a man he pledged allegiance to, 
or implicit in the lies, said Berger. Either way, Zawahiri, who has been 
publicly silent since September, “has to make an appearance and come up with a 
plan. If not, al-Qaida will continue to lose ground”, Berger added.
