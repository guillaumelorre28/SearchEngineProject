The Grove Hill hotel, halfway between Darwin and Katherine, is more of a shed 
than a hotel. A collection of corrugated iron lean-tos, cobbled together over 
more than 80 years, it’s a living museum exhibit full of dust and history.

Shelves and tables are filled with old equipment and furniture and whatever 
else people have found in the surrounding bush, leftover from the old goldfield 
settlements of the late 19th and early 20th century, and the war which followed.

The race that stops the territory: crocodiles, cane toads and a lightning 
strike

Stan Heausler is shutting the doors after owning the place for almost 20 
years. The octogenarian had tried to sell it but there weren’t any buyers for a 
pub with no town, 40 minutes from anywhere. So he’s closing up, and the monthly 
country music nights with a free feed and camping are ending.

At the final party, hundreds of people are crammed into the beer garden and 
the campsite and the bar with its wall of barely distinguishable dusty beer 
bottles.

The music is loud and the mood is friendly, despite the Wolf Creek-ish 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/18/wolf-creek-classic-australian-films>
 drive up the dirt road, in the dark. Hacking smokers’ coughs, glass clinks and 
a thousand affectionate “youse cunts” punctuate the air.

Someone calls last drinks for Heausler, and there’s a pause while an old bloke 
sings a capella Slim Dusty,We’ve Done Us Proud.

Sitting on a bar stool under the looming water tower, a blues singer tears at 
her harmonica like this is the last time she’ll have an audience. Which it 
might be.

“There’s a lot of faces I see tonight who I can tell have probably never been 
here,” she says.

“The last 12 years, you guys have missed such an occasion. Thank you for 
letting me come here and be able to sing and share my songs as a country music 
artist in theNorthern Territory 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory>.”

A procession of well-wishers take to the microphone. Some speak of their love 
for the pub, their love of Heausler. One woman offers to buy the place, and 
another just tells a stream of filthy jokes.

Look at everybody. If half of these people showed up at Rorke’s in Darwin, 
they wouldn’t be allowed in

Standing in the queue for food, I talk to two women who have come up from Pine 
Creek to say goodbye to the place.

Grove Hill is “the roots and guts of the Territory”, says Kat.

“It’s not about whether you’ve got millions of dollars or you’re in the best 
dressed clothes, or you’re in a pair of shorts you fought someone at Vinnies 
for, it’s not about that here. It doesn’t matter here.

“If I came in here tomorrow and said I didn’t have food on my table, I promise 
you by the end of the day I’d have food on my table.”

Katie jumps in. “It’s old Territorian. How the Territory used to be 
everywhere. It still has that. It’s hot, everybody’s hot, you can have a beer 
and listen to some music,” she says.

“It’s hard to describe the feeling. Look at everybody. If half of these people 
showed up at Rorke’s in Darwin, they wouldn’t be allowed in.”

Kat grabs the arm of her friend in front. He’s wearing a blue singlet, a 
well-worn Akubra and an eye patch. His dusty beard parts for a smile.

“I mean look at this guy. If that’s not Territorian then what is?” says Kat.

Later on inside the bar, Derek Dixon, a 76-year-old prospector, is introduced 
as Goldfinger.

I ask why he’s called that.

“Fucked if I know,” says Dixon, but it’s not true and his friends jump in with 
a handful of different backstories.

After the lyrical waxing of Kat, I want to hear from this old-timer, this 
beating heart of the Northern Territory, the face of its dwindling rough and 
leathered identity. What does this pub mean to him?

“A place to get drunk,” he chortles.

I’m introduced to another legend, Jenny. She’s an “apprentice” prospector, has 
sunk boats, swum through crocodile-infested waters, been struck by lightning. 
True.

She says Dixon finds more gold than any person “probably in Australia”.

“He has been working this land, which is harsh. We were out there two Tuesdays 
ago, it was 47 degrees. He’s 76.”

Everyone in this group has known each other for years. 

“We could tell you some stories,” says one man.

I love stories, I say.

“No, no, no, no,” says Dixon, shutting it down.

I plead. Dixon goes back to his beer.

“We were in Victoria dredging for gold, me and Derek, and there was a total 
eclipse,” says the storyteller.

“We were in the Beechworth pub, I was only 17 … He drank everyone’s beer in 
the bar while they were out looking at the eclipse. I had an old 350 twin 
motorbike and we got half a carton under each arm, but going up the hill he 
fell off the back. For weeks later we were picking cans off the road, picking 
them up every time we went into town.”

A couple of people in the bar fall over, cackling.

“Let’s get back on track, I want you blokes to tell me why this pub is so 
great,” I attempt.

“It’s not a great little pub,” declares Darwin restaurant owner Lars, knocking 
my phone on the ground.

“It’s just been here for so fucking long, no one really gives a shit. It’s 
just been here.”

We take photos, and there’s a conversation about how women can be like Donald 
Trump, marrying often and stealing everyone’s money. Or something. I’m not 
sure. Someone starts singing Johnny Cash. Fireworks, or maybe a rifle goes off 
outside where the open-mic is starting up again.

It might be the first time Grove Hill has heard Lady Gaga, but not the 
audience, and a dozen beer-bellied blokes in singlets give their best Poker 
Face. Taylor Swift is “brought back to her country roots”, but that’s as modern 
as it gets and then we return to Chisel.Khe Sanh

 of course.

The night goes on and on and it’s hot and sweaty and dusty but the concrete 
dancefloor doesn’t stop, and there’s only so many times you can hear Hotel 
California so people escape for a few hours’ shuteye while it’s cool enough to 
sleep. I’m woken up when a woman thinks my tent is her tent, and then again by 
the hail Marys of the outback. Forty-seven swears before breakfast.

Everyone’s dusty, in both senses of the word, and those who can drive leave 
before the heat sets in.

Grove Hill isn’t the last of the outback pubs, and might yet live on – there 
was a drunken declaration on stage by a woman who said she’d buy it.

I think back to Kat’s love of the place, of the Territory’s “roots and guts”, 
and hope the buyer comes through. For some the Territory isn’t changing, but 
there’s one less place to drink.
