Supernatural horror Ouija topped the US box office at the weekend with a haul 
of $20m as the latest action thriller from Keanu Reeves proved a surprise hit 
in second place.
Ouija, based on the Hasbro board game, cost just $5m to make and is being 
hailed as another low budget triumph for Jason Blum, the producer of the 
similarly pitched Paranormal Activity series of movies. It centres on a group 
of friends who begin experimenting with a Ouija board after one of their number 
dies in mysterious circumstances following a session.

John Wick <https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-wick>, the well-reviewed 
action movie starring Keanu Reeves as a widowed hitman who comes into conflict 
with Russian mobsters, pulled in $14.2m in second place. Analysts had been 
expecting around half that figure, so the news represents something of a 
triumph for the erstwhile star of Point Break and The Matrix.

Reeves, 50, has been experiencing a difficult period in his career following 
disappointing box office returns for directing debut Man of Tai Chi and martial 
arts fantasy 47 Ronin.

However, the Canadian actor’s decision to go public 
<http://www.indiewire.com/article/keanu-reeves-on-not-receiving-more-offers-from-hollywood-it-sucks-20141021>
 with his disappointment over the lack of studio roles being offered to him in 
recent times – along with positive reviews for John Wick – may have helped the 
new movie find its audience thanks to social media buzz.

“Moviegoers and people in general appreciate his candour,” analyst Paul 
Dergarabedian told Variety. “Major stars don’t say things like that. They’re 
too worried about their image. But his honesty resonated and audiences respect 
a star who is willing to talk that way.”
