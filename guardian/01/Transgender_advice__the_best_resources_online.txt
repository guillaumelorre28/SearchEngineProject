Here is a selection of online resources for trans and gender-variant people, 
their families and friends. I've limited my selection to trans-specific 
websites rather than those serving the wider LGBT or queer communities – I hope 
you find them worthwhile. As trans men are often under-represented in the 
media, online communities and elsewhere, I have included a separate section for 
FtM (female-to-male) links to complement the wider trans resources, some of 
which are geared more towards trans women. Please feel free to add anything 
else that may be useful, including your own sites, in the comments section 
below.
