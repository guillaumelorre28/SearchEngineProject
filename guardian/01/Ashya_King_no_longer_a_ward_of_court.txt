Ashya King <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ashya-king>, the five-year-old 
boy flown to Prague to be treated for a brain tumour, has been freed from all 
legal controls by the high court in London.

Formally ending wardship proceedings, the judge, Mr Justice Baker, said it was 
now up to Ashya's parents to decide which of the treatments on offer he should 
receive â€“ conventional radio therapy from a hospital in Southampton or the 
proton therapy available in theCzech Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/czech-republic>.

The judge's decision was announced following confirmation that the Motol 
hospital in Prague had admitted Ashya for treatment.

Baker said: "Responsibility about a child rests with his parents. In most 
cases the parents are the best people to make decisions about a child.

"The state has no business in interfering in the parental responsibility 
unless the child is suffering or is likely to suffer considerable harm."

But the judge said that given what the local authority knew at the time about 
Ashya's removal fromSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/southampton> hospital to Spain, it had 
"acted entirely correctly in applying to the high court and Judge Arthur was 
right in making Ashya a ward of court."

The decision to obtain a European arrest warrant, implied, was less justified. 
"I merely observe," the judge said, "that as a consequence Ashya was left alone 
for several days."

The judge added: "Having heard the evidence I conclude that there was no 
reason to stand in the way of the parents' proposal".

Both treatment options were reasonable, he said. "It is no business of this 
court or any other public authority to interfere in [the parents'] decision."

The judge concluded: "It only remains for me to express my hope that Ashya 
makes a good recovery. We send all our best wishes to Ashya and his loving 
parents."
