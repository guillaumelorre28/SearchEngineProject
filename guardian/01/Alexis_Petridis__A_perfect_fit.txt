I had no idea how desperate men were for help regarding fashion until I 
started writing this column. Afterwards, I became acutely aware, because they 
started asking me for advice. I know: I made that kind of face, too. Is there 
a greater symbol of men's stylistic hopelessness than the notion of them 
looking at the pictures that accompany this column and thinking, "I know, I'll 
ask him what to do"?

They ask me most about suits, which are the one area of fashion that 
heterosexual men are supposed to understand. But they don't. Perhaps they did 
years ago, before the advent of streetwear as the primary male mode of dress, 
or when more men wore them for work.

Which is where a company called A Suit That Fits 
<http://www.asuitthatfits.com/shop/index.php> comes in, offering a fear-free, 
low-cost bespoke suit. You either design your own online or, probably better, 
visit one of their studios to be measured up. The guy who measured me was a 
font of suggestions regarding cut and detail, and information (not all of the 
last welcome: apparently my waist is four inches larger than I thought, because 
jeans manufacturers have been deceiving to flatter for years). They ping your 
details to Nepal, where every tailor who works for them gets a decent, ethical 
deal (5% of their profits also fund a local school). Eight weeks later, you get 
your suit. The cheapest start at £200, which for a bespoke suit is frankly 
insane. The whole process was a breeze, the end product great. In the 
admittedly improbable scenario that you want my advice, you could do 
substantially worse.
