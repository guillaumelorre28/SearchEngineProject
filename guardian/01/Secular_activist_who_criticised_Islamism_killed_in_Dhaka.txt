Hundreds of protesters have taken to the streets of Dhaka to demand the 
capture and punishment of those responsible for the murder of a law student who 
criticised Islamism on his Facebook page.

About 350 activists from the secular campaigning network Ganajagaran Mancha 
took part in the demonstration on Thursday after the killing of Nazimuddin 
Samad in the Bangladeshi capital on Wednesday night.

Samad, 28, had been on a hit list of 84 atheist bloggers

 that a group of radical Islamists drew up and sent to the Bangladesh interior 
ministry. His murder was the latest in a series of killings of secular 
activists and bloggers in the country.

Syed Nurul Islam, the deputy commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan police, 
told Agence France-Presse: “At least four assailants hacked Nazimuddin Samad’s 
head with a machete on Wednesday night. As he fell, one of them shot him with a 
pistol from close range. He died on the spot.


“It is a case of targeted killing. But no group has claimed responsibility.” 
He said police were looking into whether Samad was murdered for his writing.

The Dhaka Tribune said the assailants shouted Allahu Akbar (God is greatest) 
as they attacked Samad on a busy road near Jagannath University, where he was a 
law student.

On Thursday, the protesters urged the Bangladeshi authorities to take the 
killing seriously, accusing them of having fostered a culture of impunity in 
the past.

Last year, suspected militants hacked to death at least four atheist bloggers

 and a secular publisher in one of a series of targeted killings in the 
Muslim-majority country.


Police arrested members of a banned group called Ansarullah Bangla Team over 
those murders, but none has yet been prosecuted.

law. Police said he had spent two months in Dhaka. Photograph: Facebook 
Maruf Rosul, one of the Ganajagaran Mancha activists, told the Guardian: “The 
government is creating impunity to all the offences by not bringing the 
perpetrators to book.

“Instead of pointing blame at different outfits, the government should 
identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice.”

Samad was known to have been critical of state religion in the Bangladeshi 
constitution. In the first two linesdetailing his religious views 
<https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001090271428&sk=about&section=contact-info&pnref=about>
 on Facebook, he said: “Evolution is a scientific truth. Religion and race are 
[an] invention of the savage and uncivil people.”


Wafi Chowdhury, a schoolfriend of Samad, said: “Nazim had lived in hostels 
since grade six and later moved to a shared room after he joined university.”

Samad had deactivated his Facebook account about a month ago at the request of 
his family, but Chowdhury added: “I remember him telling me he would come back 
on Facebook soon with a grin.”


Shamir Chandra Sutradhar, an investigations officer at Sutrapur police in 
Dhaka, told the Guardian: “His stay in Dhaka has been only two months. He lived 
in Sylhet and most of his family members are in London.”

Tapan Chandra Saha, a police officer in charge of the Sutrapur area, said: “We 
have not been able to identify any suspect. Nazim was both hacked and shot. We 
have recovered bullet shells from the spot. He has been hacked on the right 
side of his head.”

 Samad was described by friends as ‘a loud voice against any social injustice’.

Imran Sarker, who leads Bangladesh’s largest online secular activist group and 
is the head of the Bangladeshi bloggers association, said Samad had joined 
nationwide protests in 2013 against top Islamist leaders accused of committing 
war crimes during the country’s war of independence.

“He was a secular online activist and a loud voice against any social 
injustice. He was against Islamic fundamentalism,” Sarker said.

Amnesty International <https://www.amnesty.org/en/> said the killing was a 
reminder that authorities in Bangladesh are failing to protect people 
exercising their right to freedom of expression.

“There can be no justification for the brutal killing of Nazimuddin Samad, who 
has apparently paid with his life for nothing but being brave enough to speak 
his mind,” said Champa Patel, Amnesty’s South Asia director. “This is not just 
a senseless murder, it is a blatant attack on the right to freedom of 
expression. The Bangladeshi authorities must categorically condemn these 
killings and take serious steps to end this horrific cycle of violence. Those 
responsible for the killings of secular activists must be held to account.”

Mustakur Rahman, 26, became friends with Samad after meeting him at college in 
Sylhet in 2007. Speaking on the phone from Birmingham, where he now lives, 
Rahman described his shock and disbelief at Samad’s death. “Everybody was very 
close [at college]. Suddenly we have lost a very close classmate and it is 
shocking. I can’t believe it just happened. It’s a loss for us. We lost our 
friend. His mum lost her child,” he said.

“I will remember him forever. He was my friend. I grew up with him. I had so 
many memories with him. He used to laugh very nicely. He was a very smiley guy. 
I’ve been remembering his smile.”

Rahman spoke of how Samad inspired him and his classmates to join the 
Bangladesh National Cadet Corps <http://www.bncc.gov.bd/>. Samad had been an 
active member, rising to the position of lance corporal.

Rahman said he had warned Samad about his social media posts, which were 
critical of Islamism and religion. “Whatever he posted, I would see as fun. But 
people are taking it seriously and taking revenge,” he said. “As a friend, I 
warned him about the posts, I don’t want anyone to die early. But he said he 
can’t change his opinion against any religion.

“He didn’t kill anyone. To me, he’s a good person. He didn’t do anything 
wrong. He wrote something about a particular religion. I’m a believer, but he 
wasn’t a believer and maybe he was trying to express what he thinks about 
religion. It is a free world, why should he be killed?

“So I’m very, very shocked. But in Bangladesh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/bangladesh> it is a common issue nowadays. 
So many atheists are being killed … For every single occasion, there is 
protest. But after there is nothing. There will be protest, we protest, we 
write on Facebook. But that’s it. No justice is coming out.”
