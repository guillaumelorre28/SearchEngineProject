A high court challenge against a plan to redevelop the Victorian house where 
SirArthur Conan Doyle <https://www.theguardian.com/books/arthurconandoyle> 
wrote The Hound of the Baskervilles has failed.

Author John Gibson, founder of the Undershaw Preservation Trust, attacked a 
decision made by the local planning authority to give the go-ahead for the 
Grade II-listed building in Surrey to beredeveloped for use as a school

. But his case against Waverley council has been rejected by a judge in London.

Gibson challenged the decisions of the council in March to grant planning 
permission and listed building consent for the redevelopment of Conan Doyle’s 
former home, Undershaw. The building had been used as a hotel since the 1920s 
butwas left empty in 2005

.

Mr Justice Foskett rejected the argument that the council had “failed 
adequately to consider other viable uses”. There was a history of consideration 
of other uses, he said, “none of which had ever been achieved or realised in 
practice”.
