Poppy McPherson’s article (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/no-muslims-allowed-how-nationalism-is-rising-in-aung-san-suu-kyis-myanmar>
, 24 May) paints a vivid picture of the growing persecution faced by Rohingyas. 
A developing national pride in Myanmar seems to be going hand in hand with 
greater threats towards marginalised minorities. And the recent dispute between 
the US ambassador and Aung San Suu Kyi over using the term Rohingya has drawn 
attention to their easy dismissal in Myanmar, where they are seen as foreigners.

Over recent years, the Equal Rights Trust <http://www.equalrightstrust.org/> 
has advocated for Rohingya rights in Myanmar and neighbouring countries, 
arguing in particular for these governments to do more for their protection. 
The opportunity for Daw Suu Kyi to provide a protective force for Rohingya and 
other persecuted groups is lessening by the day. Maybe she has a longer-term 
strategy. Maybe she must first gain the trust of the military. But as McPherson 
and others have pointed out, the more time that passes, the more powerfully 
will extremism take hold and divisions form. Perhaps worse still, her party, 
the NDL, established to promote democracy, will find itself too far down the 
road taken by its predecessors to find a route back.
