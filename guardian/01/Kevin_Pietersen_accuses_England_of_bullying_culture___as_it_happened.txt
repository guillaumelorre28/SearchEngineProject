A round-up

And that’s probably enough for now. A quick review of the day...


 * Pietersen claims there was a ‘bullying culture’ in the England dressing room
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/06/kevin-pietersen-england-bullying-culture>
, and that wicketkeeper Matt Prior was a ‘negative influence’ on the team. 
 * Prior says he will respond, but the time is not right now. 
 * Pietersen says England captain Alastair Cook was ‘paralysed’ by the 
post-Ashes meeting at which the batsman was sacked. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/06/kevin-pietersen-alastair-cook-paralysed-ashes-row>
 * Pietersen claims he hasn’t given up hope of playing for England again. 
 * Pietersen denies passing on tactical information to the South African team 
in 2012, simply that an unnamed player called Andrew Strauss a ‘doos’ (slang 
for ‘an idiot’) and he didn’t disagree. Pietersen claims he apologised to 
Strauss in person. 
 * We will have more details, a review of Pietersen’s book and full analysis 
of his claims later <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen>.

Ah, I’ve just been handed a copy of Matt Prior’s 2013 autobiography ‘The 
Gloves Are Off’, and it features the following explanation: 

My nickname is ‘the Cheese’, or just ‘Cheese’. It’s a terrible nickname, but 
complaining about nicknames is never a wise policy. You just hope they go away. 
Unfortunately this one hasn’t, and most of the England team still call me by 
it, especially Stuart Broad, who absolutely delights in calling me by it. 
Swanny and Jimmy Anderson quite like it too, as you can imagine.Andy Flower 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-flower>? He just calls me Matt...

‘The Cheese’ stems from my early days at Sussex. I can’t even remember who 
first called me by it, but, as I say, it has certainly stuck. Basically, with 
the blonde tips and highlights in my hair (believe it or not, I did have hair 
once) and my stud earring, I used to strut around a bit in those days. I didn’t 
think I was ‘the Big Cheese’, but other obviously did believe that was how I 
saw myself.

So that’s that solved, then. Also, there’s a bonus bit about ol’ KP:

There are many players in the game who have a bit of a strut, but they often 
put it on. For others it is just the way they are. TakeKevin Pietersen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen>. He walks around any 
cricket field on which he is playing as if he owns the place. But that is what 
makes him the player that he is. It is not at all forced. That’s the way he is. 
It’s the aura that he holds.

If you’ll allow me to return to the Cheese issue, do you reckon it caught on? 
Prior may have referred to himself as the Big Cheese, but did anyone else? Or 
did it go a little something like this?

Jamie Fewery makes a good point: “Couple of things to note so far. I do think 
KP can be a prize eejit. But I think that most of the claims in this book are 
true. For one, because the publisher’s lawyers will have been through it about 
100 times. For two, it seems consistent with many spectators’ impressions of 
the team dynamic over the past 2 years. And for three, because ghostwriter 
David Walsh knows a thing or two about spotting lying sportsmen.”

Excellent cricket journalist Peter Miller 
<http://www.twitter.com/thecricketgeek> (no relation, as far as we know) has 
been speed-reading the book, and his initial reactions include the following:

“As far as revelations are concerned far and away the most interesting is the 
ones surrounding KPGenius. He says that his team mates were tweeting from the 
account. This seems like a much bigger breach of trust than having a text 
conversation with players from the other team. One is private, the other is 
not. As KP says, sports (and any job) is filled with people bitching about each 
other. Doing it in private seems a much smaller crime than mocking a team mate 
in public.

“It says a huge amount about how bad things had become that KP felt closer to 
the opposition than his own side.”

Here’s Pietersen on the land of his birth...


One big mistake was not respecting South Africa and what it stands for. Not 
respecting South Africa and what the country gave me in terms of living there 
for 19 happy years ... I realise too that South Africa was my first home and my 
real home.

When Pietersen was young and a little more foolish, after being named the ICC 
One Day Player of the Year in 2005, Mark Nicholas made reference to him coming 
‘home’ for the ODI series in South Africa in which he made his international 
name. “Comingback to South Africa, not home,” was the rapid retort from 
Pietersen.

Tim Sanders has a theory about the KP story being an allegory, referring to a 
tale that is an allegory itself. Ooooh, meta.


“The stuff about the three top bowlers allegedly ruling the roost to the 
extent of bullying, has an Orwellian ring to it. The downtrodden workers of the 
team – traditionally the Players rather than the Gentlemen – rise up in revolt, 
only to turn into a ruling class even more dictatorial than the capitalists 
used to be. I’m not saying Pietersen is right, I know nothing – but as a story, 
it’s a remake of “Animal Farm”.

We promise this is a coincidence, but on the same day that a cricketer who 
thinks plenty of himself is all over the place,Donald McRae has been talking to 
Zlatan Ibrahimovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/06/zlatan-ibrahimovic-trash-talking-sweden-record-golascorer>
.

So how did this punk from Rosengard get all the way to where I am now?” he 
asks. “Nobody believed I could do it. Everybody was trash-talking. They thought 
I will go away because I have a big mouth. They thought this guy’s vision is 
crazy. It will not happen. But I had these dreams of where I would end up. And 
now here I am.”

Ibrahimovic pauses to draw breath but the 33 birthday candles can wait. He has 
so many words to blow out before then. “Let’s go back 15 years and all I saw 
then has come true. Everybody who was trash-talking me? Now they are eating 
their words. This is my real trophy.

A confirmed zing here, in reference to him not passing on tactical information 
about Andrew Stra...sorry, ‘Straussy’ to the South Africans, on the basis that 
there would be no point:


 “There were retired second-string club cricketers in Bradford who would have 
known how to get Andrew Strauss out. Bowl around the wicket.”

Here’s a bit more on the ‘bullying culture’ Pietersen alluded to in the 
Telegraph interview:

They (the batsmen) would just take the abuse on a daily basis: Move! F***, 
come on, for f***’s sake! What the f*** are you doing? But then, in a Test 
match against Bangladesh, Trott...just cracked. He started swearing right back 
at Prior and Swann. Just shouting, ‘Will you f*** off? Who the f*** do you 
think you are?’ I’d been wanting to ask that question for some time.

It was hinted at earlier, but the bits about Matt Prior 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/matt-prior> and the cheese are utterly 
magnificent....

He is dominating the place, and has taken to referring to himself as the Big 
Cheese (or, informally, Cheese). As in, the Big Cheese is pleased with how he 
played today. The Big Cheese has earned some beer tonight. Cheese went out last 
night. Cheese went to bat today. Who does that? I don’t know how he got the 
name, but he’d started using it a lot...

I hear the way the Big Cheese and the little Baby Cheeses talk in the dressing 
room, the way they go about their business and the stuff they say to other 
players both on and off the field, and I realise how little the media know 
about what goes on inside a team.

A quick summary of the 'events' of today...

 * Kevin Pietersen has written a book. 

 * It isn’t called ‘My Big Book Of Grievances’ or ‘Everyone’s Awful, Apart 
From Me’, but it could be.

 * Pietersen claims there was/is a ‘bullying culture’ within the England 
dressing room 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/06/kevin-pietersen-england-bullying-culture>
, largely led by a clique of bowlers and wicketkeeper Matt Prior. 
 * He called Prior a ‘negative influence’ on the dressing room.

 * Pietersen claims Prior insisted that he was referred to as ‘the Big Cheese.’
 * Prior says he will respond to the accusations, but not yet.

 * Coach Peter Moores is described as being like a ‘woodpecker’ who was 
“tapping on our heads, all day every day.” 
 * Pietersen says he hasn’t given up hope of playing for England again. 
 * Former coach Andy Flower is described as ‘Contagiously sour. Infectiously 
dour.’ 
 * He asked Piers Morgan to lay off criticism of Alastair Cook, who is 
described as ‘a decent guy’. 
 * Pietersen denies passing on tactical information to the South African team 
in 2012, simply that an unnamed player called Andrew Strauss a ‘doos’ (slang 
for ‘an idiot’) and he didn’t disagree. Pietersen claims he apologised to 
Strauss in person.

Here he is on Andrew Strauss and the whole nonsense with the text messages (or 
BBMs, if you want to be pernickety). It speaks to just how entrenched the 
standard sportsman’s nickname of simply adding a ‘y’ to the end of names is 
that even in this context, Pietersen continues to call the former skipper 
‘Straussy.’


The next day Strauss called me on his own and we had a fine, big dingdong. He 
accused me of having done it. I admitted I had been in communication with the 
South Africans, but it was nothing bad. ’These guys are friends. You guys have 
been treating me like sh** for three years. You’ve been acting like a d*** to 
me’. I went through example after example. The only thing I was guilty of was 
not defending my captain.


Then Straussy, the elder statesman, gave his view. Banter in private messages 
= huge issue. Bullying in the dressing room princess-and-the-pea nonsense. They 
didn’t want me to speak to the South Africans - some of my closest friends. The 
Andys were very big on that. It was a typicalAndy Flower 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-flower> tick-box exercise: no 
fraternising. Straussy, the enforcer, pulled me away from South African friends 
on a couple of occasions - embarrassing me.

It’s also interesting that Pietersen doesn’t refer to the South African player 
in question - widely assumed to be Graeme Smith - by name:

It was just chatter. He [the South Africa player] said that Strauss was 
carrying on like an idiot, and that was it. It was nothing that I wouldn’t 
actually say to Straussy myself, at the time or now. I have never and would 
never give any tactical information about any of my England team-mates to 
anyone on the opposing side. It goes right to the heart of me as a professional 
and me as a human being.

And here he is on Peter Moores...

I wanted Moores to sit in the back seat. To facilitiate. In hindsight, I don’t 
think he is actually capable of doing that. Moores told everybody that 
everything between us was great, that KP would be his own man, but he never 
took his hands off the steering wheel for a moment. Whatever dial is in Peter 
Moores’ head, it can’t be turned down to ‘chill.’ The man can’t relax.


I could never relax when he was around. He was always around. I couldn’t act 
effectively as captain with the woodpecker on my shoulder, and the players were 
getting fed up with Moores’ coaching. We had been kings of the world in 2005. 
Under Moores, we had played 22 Tests and won only eight.
I told [ECB chairman Giles] Clarke I no longer wanted to captain England, 
because of the relationship with Peter Moores. I gave it to him straight: this 
can’t carry on, so let me step down if you want this guy to coach. He’s putting 
too much pressure on us, he’s killing our spirits. I told Clarke that I 
couldn’t captain with this Moores; I’d rather just go back into the ranks and 
bat. That was it. I didn’t say it’s him or me. No chance. Never.

A few bits on Cook, now, starting with the skipper’s reaction to/handling off 
Pietersen’s sacking:


I was disappointed. I had gone out of my way to support him on the Ashes 
tour,. The next time I saw Cooky he was staring at his shoes while I was being 
told I would not be included in the England squads in the Caribbean or in the 
World T20.

I was disappointed in him then. I thought the way he behaved called into 
question his qualifications to be captain. But I know too that he is a decent 
guy and that he was paralysed by how uncomfortable it all was.

And on the meeting in which he was told, along with ECB managing director Paul 
Downton:

Alastair Cook knows that on the Ashes tour there were absolutely no problems 
with me in the dressing room. Alastair Cook knows that I scored the most runs 
for England on that tour.Alastair Cook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alastair-cook> knows that I had his back 100 
per cent.

Any advice I could give, I did. I opened the door and said to him, listen, I 
am here to help you. I want you to be successful. I told him that again and 
again. If he needed me at any time, I would be there. I know, though, that 
while Cooky is a nice man, he is also a company man. A safe pair of hands; he 
won’t rock the boat...

I think Cooky felt a hell of a lot of pressure at that time. It wasn’t going 
to happen, but he would have thought ‘f****** hell, KP as vice-captain? KP 
wants Prior gone? Where would that leave me if everyone’s saying that I should 
go too?’
I think that process probably made it quite easy for him when he was given the 
option of getting rid of me. I think the thought of me becoming vice-captain 
probably scared him.

 And on Downton, with a splendidly subtle put-down in the second clause...

I didn’t mind that Paul Downton, according to Google, was a middle-order 
batsman with a Test average of under 20. But I did mind that as an 
administrative employee of the ECB he felt free to critique the performances of

KP claims he told Piers Morgan to lay off Cook in his tweets. I don't think he 
did but KP says he asked him to.

Just as Pietersen seems to be a figure that divides opinion, Morgan is surely

And that’s probably enough for now. A quick review of the day...


 * Pietersen claims there was a ‘bullying culture’ in the England dressing room
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/06/kevin-pietersen-england-bullying-culture>
, and that wicketkeeper Matt Prior was a ‘negative influence’ on the team. 
 * Prior says he will respond, but the time is not right now. 
 * Pietersen says England captain Alastair Cook was ‘paralysed’ by the 
post-Ashes meeting at which the batsman was sacked. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/06/kevin-pietersen-alastair-cook-paralysed-ashes-row>
 * Pietersen claims he hasn’t given up hope of playing for England again. 
 * Pietersen denies passing on tactical information to the South African team 
in 2012, simply that an unnamed player called Andrew Strauss a ‘doos’ (slang 
for ‘an idiot’) and he didn’t disagree. Pietersen claims he apologised to 
Strauss in person. 
 * We will have more details, a review of Pietersen’s book and full analysis 
of his claims later <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen>.
 
Ah, I’ve just been handed a copy of Matt Prior’s 2013 autobiography ‘The 
Gloves Are Off’, and it features the following explanation: 

My nickname is ‘the Cheese’, or just ‘Cheese’. It’s a terrible nickname, but 
complaining about nicknames is never a wise policy. You just hope they go away. 
Unfortunately this one hasn’t, and most of the England team still call me by 
it, especially Stuart Broad, who absolutely delights in calling me by it. 
Swanny and Jimmy Anderson quite like it too, as you can imagine.Andy Flower 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-flower>? He just calls me Matt...

‘The Cheese’ stems from my early days at Sussex. I can’t even remember who 
first called me by it, but, as I say, it has certainly stuck. Basically, with 
the blonde tips and highlights in my hair (believe it or not, I did have hair 
once) and my stud earring, I used to strut around a bit in those days. I didn’t 
think I was ‘the Big Cheese’, but other obviously did believe that was how I 
saw myself.

So that’s that solved, then. Also, there’s a bonus bit about ol’ KP:

There are many players in the game who have a bit of a strut, but they often 
put it on. For others it is just the way they are. TakeKevin Pietersen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen>. He walks around any 
cricket field on which he is playing as if he owns the place. But that is what 
makes him the player that he is. It is not at all forced. That’s the way he is. 
It’s the aura that he holds.

 
If you’ll allow me to return to the Cheese issue, do you reckon it caught on? 
Prior may have referred to himself as the Big Cheese, but did anyone else? Or 
did it go a little something like this?

Jamie Fewery makes a good point: “Couple of things to note so far. I do think 
KP can be a prize eejit. But I think that most of the claims in this book are 
true. For one, because the publisher’s lawyers will have been through it about 
100 times. For two, it seems consistent with many spectators’ impressions of 
the team dynamic over the past 2 years. And for three, because ghostwriter 
David Walsh knows a thing or two about spotting lying sportsmen.”
 
Excellent cricket journalist Peter Miller 
<http://www.twitter.com/thecricketgeek> (no relation, as far as we know) has 
been speed-reading the book, and his initial reactions include the following:

“As far as revelations are concerned far and away the most interesting is the 
ones surrounding KPGenius. He says that his team mates were tweeting from the 
account. This seems like a much bigger breach of trust than having a text 
conversation with players from the other team. One is private, the other is 
not. As KP says, sports (and any job) is filled with people bitching about each 
other. Doing it in private seems a much smaller crime than mocking a team mate 
in public.

“It says a huge amount about how bad things had become that KP felt closer to 
the opposition than his own side.”
 
Possible business idea...

Here’s Pietersen on the land of his birth...


One big mistake was not respecting South Africa and what it stands for. Not 
respecting South Africa and what the country gave me in terms of living there 
for 19 happy years ... I realise too that South Africa was my first home and my 
real home.

When Pietersen was young and a little more foolish, after being named the ICC 
One Day Player of the Year in 2005, Mark Nicholas made reference to him coming 
‘home’ for the ODI series in South Africa in which he made his international 
name. “Comingback to South Africa, not home,” was the rapid retort from 
Pietersen.

“Who knew that (alleged) bullying in the workplace could be so amusing?” 
chuckles Clive Wilshin. Quite so, Clive.

 
Tim Sanders has a theory about the KP story being an allegory, referring to a 
tale that is an allegory itself. Ooooh, meta.


“The stuff about the three top bowlers allegedly ruling the roost to the 
extent of bullying, has an Orwellian ring to it. The downtrodden workers of the 
team – traditionally the Players rather than the Gentlemen – rise up in revolt, 
only to turn into a ruling class even more dictatorial than the capitalists 
used to be. I’m not saying Pietersen is right, I know nothing – but as a story, 
it’s a remake of “Animal Farm”.
 
“There’s always two sides to the coin,” says Mike Gatting, a man who is no 
stranger to cheese himself. “I just hope everyone enjoys reading it and moves 
on.”

 
In the mood for some cheese, for some reason.

We promise this is a coincidence, but on the same day that a cricketer who 
thinks plenty of himself is all over the place,Donald McRae has been talking to 
Zlatan Ibrahimovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/06/zlatan-ibrahimovic-trash-talking-sweden-record-golascorer>
.

So how did this punk from Rosengard get all the way to where I am now?” he 
asks. “Nobody believed I could do it. Everybody was trash-talking. They thought 
I will go away because I have a big mouth. They thought this guy’s vision is 
crazy. It will not happen. But I had these dreams of where I would end up. And 
now here I am.”

Ibrahimovic pauses to draw breath but the 33 birthday candles can wait. He has 
so many words to blow out before then. “Let’s go back 15 years and all I saw 
then has come true. Everybody who was trash-talking me? Now they are eating 
their words. This is my real trophy.

A confirmed zing here, in reference to him not passing on tactical information 
about Andrew Stra...sorry, ‘Straussy’ to the South Africans, on the basis that 
there would be no point:


 “There were retired second-string club cricketers in Bradford who would have 
known how to get Andrew Strauss out. Bowl around the wicket.”

Here’s a bit more on the ‘bullying culture’ Pietersen alluded to in the 
Telegraph interview:

They (the batsmen) would just take the abuse on a daily basis: Move! F***, 
come on, for f***’s sake! What the f*** are you doing? But then, in a Test 
match against Bangladesh, Trott...just cracked. He started swearing right back 
at Prior and Swann. Just shouting, ‘Will you f*** off? Who the f*** do you 
think you are?’ I’d been wanting to ask that question for some time.
 
And the ghostwriter speaks. I think he’s talking about us, here...

It was hinted at earlier, but the bits about Matt Prior 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/matt-prior> and the cheese are utterly 
magnificent....

He is dominating the place, and has taken to referring to himself as the Big 
Cheese (or, informally, Cheese). As in, the Big Cheese is pleased with how he 
played today. The Big Cheese has earned some beer tonight. Cheese went out last 
night. Cheese went to bat today. Who does that? I don’t know how he got the 
name, but he’d started using it a lot...

I hear the way the Big Cheese and the little Baby Cheeses talk in the dressing 
room, the way they go about their business and the stuff they say to other 
players both on and off the field, and I realise how little the media know 
about what goes on inside a team.

<https://twitter.com/barneyronay/status/519094497939296256>  
Here he is on Andrew Strauss and the whole nonsense with the text messages (or 
BBMs, if you want to be pernickety). It speaks to just how entrenched the 
standard sportsman’s nickname of simply adding a ‘y’ to the end of names is 
that even in this context, Pietersen continues to call the former skipper 
‘Straussy.’


The next day Strauss called me on his own and we had a fine, big dingdong. He 
accused me of having done it. I admitted I had been in communication with the 
South Africans, but it was nothing bad. ’These guys are friends. You guys have 
been treating me like sh** for three years. You’ve been acting like a d*** to 
me’. I went through example after example. The only thing I was guilty of was 
not defending my captain.


Then Straussy, the elder statesman, gave his view. Banter in private messages 
= huge issue. Bullying in the dressing room princess-and-the-pea nonsense. They 
didn’t want me to speak to the South Africans - some of my closest friends. The 
Andys were very big on that. It was a typicalAndy Flower 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andy-flower> tick-box exercise: no 
fraternising. Straussy, the enforcer, pulled me away from South African friends 
on a couple of occasions - embarrassing me.
 Straussy and Pieterseny. Photograph: INDRANIL MUKHERJEE/AFP/Getty Images 
It’s also interesting that Pietersen doesn’t refer to the South African player 
in question - widely assumed to be Graeme Smith - by name:

It was just chatter. He [the South Africa player] said that Strauss was 
carrying on like an idiot, and that was it. It was nothing that I wouldn’t 
actually say to Straussy myself, at the time or now. I have never and would 
never give any tactical information about any of my England team-mates to 
anyone on the opposing side. It goes right to the heart of me as a professional 
and me as a human being.

And here he is on Peter Moores...

I wanted Moores to sit in the back seat. To facilitiate. In hindsight, I don’t 
think he is actually capable of doing that. Moores told everybody that 
everything between us was great, that KP would be his own man, but he never 
took his hands off the steering wheel for a moment. Whatever dial is in Peter 
Moores’ head, it can’t be turned down to ‘chill.’ The man can’t relax.


I could never relax when he was around. He was always around. I couldn’t act 
effectively as captain with the woodpecker on my shoulder, and the players were 
getting fed up with Moores’ coaching. We had been kings of the world in 2005. 
Under Moores, we had played 22 Tests and won only eight.
I told [ECB chairman Giles] Clarke I no longer wanted to captain England, 
because of the relationship with Peter Moores. I gave it to him straight: this 
can’t carry on, so let me step down if you want this guy to coach. He’s putting 
too much pressure on us, he’s killing our spirits. I told Clarke that I 
couldn’t captain with this Moores; I’d rather just go back into the ranks and 
bat. That was it. I didn’t say it’s him or me. No chance. Never.

A few bits on Cook, now, starting with the skipper’s reaction to/handling off 
Pietersen’s sacking:


I was disappointed. I had gone out of my way to support him on the Ashes 
tour,. The next time I saw Cooky he was staring at his shoes while I was being 
told I would not be included in the England squads in the Caribbean or in the 
World T20.

I was disappointed in him then. I thought the way he behaved called into 
question his qualifications to be captain. But I know too that he is a decent 
guy and that he was paralysed by how uncomfortable it all was.

And on the meeting in which he was told, along with ECB managing director Paul 
Downton:

Alastair Cook knows that on the Ashes tour there were absolutely no problems 
with me in the dressing room. Alastair Cook knows that I scored the most runs 
for England on that tour.Alastair Cook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/alastair-cook> knows that I had his back 100 
per cent.

Any advice I could give, I did. I opened the door and said to him, listen, I 
am here to help you. I want you to be successful. I told him that again and 
again. If he needed me at any time, I would be there. I know, though, that 
while Cooky is a nice man, he is also a company man. A safe pair of hands; he 
won’t rock the boat...

I think Cooky felt a hell of a lot of pressure at that time. It wasn’t going 
to happen, but he would have thought ‘f****** hell, KP as vice-captain? KP 
wants Prior gone? Where would that leave me if everyone’s saying that I should 
go too?’
I think that process probably made it quite easy for him when he was given the 
option of getting rid of me. I think the thought of me becoming vice-captain 
probably scared him.

 And on Downton, with a splendidly subtle put-down in the second clause...

I didn’t mind that Paul Downton, according to Google, was a middle-order 
batsman with a Test average of under 20. But I did mind that as an 
administrative employee of the ECB he felt free to critique the performances of 
players, indeed that he had the right to do so.

KP claims he told Piers Morgan to lay off Cook in his tweets. I don't think he 
did but KP says he asked him to.

Just as Pietersen seems to be a figure that divides opinion, Morgan is surely 
one that unites everybody.
