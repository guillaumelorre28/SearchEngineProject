Spicy stewed pears and prunes in a warming, light lemon syrup. A succulent and 
simple pud, perfect for a cold night in.

Serves 6

4 pears, cut into quarters and cored
10 dried prunes
10 dried apricots
100ml honey
200ml water
1 cinnamon stick
2 cloves
1 lemon, rind and juice
A tub of low-fat creme fraiche or fromage frais

1. Bring the honey and water to the boil until the honey has dissolved, then 
add the cinnamon stick, cloves, and lemon rind. Cut the lemon in half and 
squeeze all the juice into the sauce.

2. Submerge the pieces of fruit in the lemony sauce, then bring to the boil 
for about 15 minutes until the fruit is lightly poached. If there's not enough 
sauce to cover all the fruit, add a touch more water.

3. Serve straight away with a dollop of creme fraiche or fromage frais.
