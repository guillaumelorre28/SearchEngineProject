He is a young British graphic designer who always wanted to work in the film 
industry, but even in his wildest dreams Henry Hobson never imagined making his 
directorial debut with his boyhood hero –Arnold Schwarzenegger

, was an unlikely choice for Schwarzenegger. The film, which will be released 
in UK cinemas this month, was written by a first-time screenwriter and directed 
by Hobson, who has spent the last 15 years designing title and credit sequences 
for other people’s films. It had a budget of $1.4m (£900,000) the director said.

Yet Schwarzenegger came on board as both actor and producer after reading the 
script, playing against type as a protective father who fights to save his 
adolescent daughter when she becomes infected with a walking-dead virus. It is 
both a zombie thriller and a human story about the impact of illness.

Hobson, 34, born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, has no film connections in his 
family. His father is a university lecturer, his mother a radiographer. He 
could barely believe it as he watched the footage produced during the film’s 
25-day shoot. Schwarzenegger is in almost every scene.

“[I thought] this isn’t quite normal. This is someone I’ve grown up with 
seeing on screen … a pinch-yourself moment,” he said.

Schwarzenegger became intrigued by the script – written by John Scott, a Nasa 
engineer – after it appeared on the industry’s “black list”, for the best 
unproduced screenplays.

“When I read it, I knew I had to do it,” the actor recalls in the production 
notes. “It is more vulnerable than any role I have played, more real, more 
emotional. You’re used to seeing me play theubermensch, the action hero bullets 
can’t seem to hit.

“In Maggie, I am the everyman … dealing with the most basic concerns – 
protecting his family.”

After training at the Royal College of Art – inspired by another former 
student, Sir Ridley Scott, who went on to become an Oscar-winning director – 
Hobson designed the title, end and credit sequences for films such as Robin 
Hood and Sherlock Holmes.

There is a “community of ardent graphic design fans”, but audiences are 
generally more interested in their popcorn or in grabbing their coats when the 
credits roll: “You’ll see the film, watch your work come on – and then you see 
all these faces turning [away from the screen],” Hobson said.

He used his skills as a visual artist to woo Schwarzenegger, producing 
storyboard images that were so intricate and extensive, they spanned some 200 
pages. They detailed “my thoughts behind each scene”, he said. “[Schwarzenegger 
had] never seen that before … It put him in my headspace.”

Hobson produced similar images for the rest of his cast, including Abigail 
Breslin, Oscar-nominated for Little Miss Sunshine, and Joely Richardson, whose 
recent films include Endless Love.

Despite taking a break from movies to become California’s governor from 2003 
to 2011, his popularity remains high. Having struggled to interest financiers, 
Maggie’s budget was found as soon as Schwarzenegger was attached to the project.

“He was such a dedicated actor,” said Hobson. “I felt I was able to get an 
untapped gem with Arnold. He’s such an amiable personality. He puts everyone at 
ease.”

The film will be released on 24 July. It premiered at the Tribeca film 
festival in April to mixed reviews.

Rupert Preston, managing director of Vertigo, the film’s UK distributor, said: 
“For a first-time director on a fairly low-budget, very independent movie, to 
attach one of the biggest stars in the world is extraordinary.”
