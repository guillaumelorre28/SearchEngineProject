The Malawi Interfaith Aids Association (MIAA) is an umbrella organisation of 
interfaith networks that co-ordinates a faith-based response to HIV/Aids in the 
country.

Robert Ngaiyaye, the charismatic executive director, emphasises the power 
religious leaders have to influence the HIV agenda.

"A bishop disclosed one day that he was HIV positive," he says. "Two hundred 
people at that prayer meeting then came forward to disclose their positive 
status too." That's 200 people in one room who had previously been too afraid 
or intimidated to speak out. That translates to very many people across the 
whole of Malawi. "With such power, religious leaders must be held accountable," 
he concludes. "They must learn to own their decisions."

Beyond encouraging faith leaders to engage with the HIV agenda, MIAA is trying 
to give hope back to those who are HIV positive.

"With the 'theology of hope', we try to install hope in people living with 
HIV. Before, there was hopelessness," Ngaiyaye says. "Faith leaders need to 
give the message that just because you are HIV positive this does not mean the 
end of your life."

The high-profile International Aids Conference is taking place in Washington 
this year. With more than 70% of global HIV/Aids cases occurring in Africa, 
Ngaiyaye has introduced a complementary summit, taking place in Lilongwe, the 
capital of Malawi. 

Ngaiyaye hopes this conference can spread the information gathered from the 
international conference to the entire region. "I want to create a forum … an 
open dialogue so we can learn from each other. In the past we have responded, 
but without direction. After this conference I hope we can all face the same 
way."
