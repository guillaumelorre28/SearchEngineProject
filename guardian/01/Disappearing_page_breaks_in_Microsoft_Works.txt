Having transferred files from Works Suite 2000 to Works 7.0 I have encountered 
a problem. In the Works 7.0 spreadsheet, when I save and close the files then 
reopen them, all the page breaks have disappeared. I have tried to solve this 
even, in desperation, by starting completely new spreadsheets, but all to no 
avail. I find it very frustrating. What's the solution?" Mary Pebble

Any suggestions?
