<http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-cruises-mission-impossible-rogue-812612>
 with an impressive $56m, just short of a record bow for the fifth instalment 
in the two-decade-old saga inspired by Bruce Geller’s 1960s TV show.

As far as the film series goes, only John Woo’s Mission: Impossible II debuted 
to higher figures, taking $57.8m in 2000. Brad Bird’s Mission: Impossible – 
Ghost Protocol, which is widely considered to have revived audiences’ interest 
in the saga, made just $29m on its first weekend on wide-release on its way to 
a series-best $694m worldwide four years ago.

Christopher McQuarrie’s film has been well-received by critics and boasts a 
93% “fresh” rating on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, making it one 
of the year’s best-reviewed blockbusters. Studio Paramount has nowconfirmed 
<http://variety.com/2015/film/news/mission-impossible-6-tom-cruise-paramount-1201555090/>
 a sixth instalment is heading into production.

Outside the US, where 53-year-old Cruise is a bigger star, the film did even 
better. It opened to $121m globally despite not having bowed in the planet’s 
second and third largest box office territories, China and Japan. The UK led 
the way with $8.7m.

There was less positive news for Vacation, a successor to the much-loved 1983 
Chevy Chase comedy National Lampoon’s Vacation and its many sequels, which 
opened in second place with a disappointing $14.8m. The film sees The 
Hangover’s Ed Helms as Rusty Griswold, the grown-up son of Chase’s hapless 
Clark who attempts a last-minute family cross-country excursion to infamous 
theme park Walley World with his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and their 
two sons. Critics have not been kind to the new version, which features cameos 
from Chase and Beverly D’Angelo as the original Griswolds.

The top five was rounded out by Marvel’s Ant-Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/ant-man>, with another $12.6m in third place 
for a three-week total of $132.1m; animated sequelMinions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/minions>, with another $12.1m in fourth for a 
four-week total of $287.3m; and Adam Sandler CGI romp Pixels, with $10.4m in 
fifth for a two-week total of $45.6m. Down in ninth spot, acclaimed Pixar 
animation Inside Out crossed the $600m mark worldwide after posting another 
$4.5m in North America this time out.

There were no other new films in the top 10 but James Ponsoldt’s The End of 
the Tour, starring Jason Segel as the late writer David Foster Wallace, did 
well on limited release. The Sundance hit, also starring Jesse Eisenberg, 
scored $126,459 from four cinemas in New York and Los Angeles for a decent 
location average of $31,615.
