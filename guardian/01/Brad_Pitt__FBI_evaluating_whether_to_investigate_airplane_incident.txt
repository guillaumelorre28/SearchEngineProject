<http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/brad-pitt-fbi-child-airplane-incident-angelina-jolie-1201868536/>
 on Thursday it was “continuing to gather facts” and would evaluate whether an 
investigation at the federal level would be pursued.

The LA Times 
<http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-brad-pitt-child-abuse-allegations-20160922-snap-story.html>
 reported that the Bureau had been informed of “a child welfare incident” 
involving Pitt on an international flight last week by a law enforcement source 
who was not authorised to discuss the matter. It said that the incident 
involved “unruly behaviour” and that the Los Angeles county department of 
children and family services was conducting an investigation.

The Los Angeles police department denied

 that it was conducting an investigation into Pitt, and said that to the best 
of its knowledge, no allegations had been made against him.

 against Pitt on Tuesday, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple married 
in 2014, having been together for a decade. They have six children.

Later that day, Pitt issued a statement to People, saying: “I am very saddened 
by this, but what matters most now is the wellbeing of our kids. I kindly ask 
the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time.”
