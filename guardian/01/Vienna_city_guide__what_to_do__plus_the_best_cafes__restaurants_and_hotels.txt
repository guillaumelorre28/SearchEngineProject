For a perfect winter break, you need more than just a schmaltzy Christmas 
market. With its atmospheric coffee shops, opulent museums and galleries, food 
markets and a revitalised underground music scene, Vienna is a city that comes 
into its own in the colder months.

Until 1918 it was capital of that oddball confection, the Austro-Hungarian 
Empire, ruled over by the Habsburgs who spent centuries collecting palaces, 
horses and paintings. The modern visitor gets one of the world’s greatest 
concentrations of artefacts and art, spread across several museums, but there’s 
a lot more besides. Vienna was always a city on the edge – Metternich quipped: 
“The East begins at the Landstrasse,” the city’s south-east side. Perhaps that 
edgy vibe helped Freud develop his theories of human psychology, it was also 
where spies like Philby learned their trade in the 1930s. The cold war cemented 
the city’s reputation as a shadowy outpost, but local youth and an influx of 
people from overseas has added vitality to the old city.

What to do and see

Kunsthistorisches Museum
The gigantic, sprawling crown jewel of Viennese art galleries and the fruit of 
Habsburg kleptomania, this building is a fabulous attraction in itself, right 
on the Ringstrasse, Emperor Franz Josef’s grandiose piece of town planning. The 
collection is a list of triumphs: Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Velazquez, Vermeer, 
Rubens and, most memorably, Brueghel. On top of that you get idiosyncratic 
delights such asArcimboldo’s portraits of faces made from vegetables, flowers 
and fish

A morning is enough to catch the highlights, but a full day is best.

Viennese State Opera
Opera in Vienna can be extremely grand, and while the music is always 
fabulous, not everyone’s in jewels and furs, and you can get a standing ticket 
for €3 or €4. A special box office on Operngasse opens 80 minutes before 
performances, though for popular productions you’ll need to be in the queue 
much earlier. Once inside, make a beeline for the best position (right at the 
front, of course).

Whatever you think about horses being made to behave like Strictly Come 
Dancing participants, the Habsburg riding school is special. Unless you are a 
total fanatic, go to watch the 10am “training” session: you get fine views of 
the elegant 18th-century indoor riding school in the palace complex, and the 
Lipizzaner horses do many of their tricks. You can’t be sure what will be 
practised, but you might witness the courbette, a scarcely credible leap from a 
begging posture. Even Craig Revel Horwood would be impressed.

 Franz Ferdinand’s car in Vienna’s Military Museum. Photograph: Kevin Rushby 
One exhibit draws the crowds here: Franz Ferdinand’s 1911 Gräf & Stift 
phaeton, the very vehicle in which he was shot dead. You also get various other 
bits of realia: Duchess Sophie von Hohenberg’s blood-stained hanky and Gavrilo 
Princip’s pistol. Best of all is a tremendous walk-through Great War exhibition 
that, for the British visitor, reorients the conflict away from the trenches of 
Flanders to the horrors of central and eastern Europe.

Christmas markets
Late in the year almost every square seems packed with stalls, each with its 
own character and specialities. The most famous, and most expensive, is in 
front of the Rathaus; Karlsplatz is more about handicrafts – hats, bags, 
jewellery – and really good for presents; the Spittelberg market is devoted to 
artisanal foodstuffs. As you might expect, many of the markets are 
child-oriented: Riesenradplatz, for example, has fairground rides and musical 
shows, and carries on until 6 January. A slightly older audience head for the 
university area, where there is a lively market with games likeEisstockschiessen
, a type of curling.


Hidden gem: the world’s first purpose-built madhouse

collection of mostly 19th century exhibits offering a glimpse of life without 
antibiotics

Justice Ministry Canteen
Every Viennese bureaucrat, student and government employee knows about the 
delights of the works canteen – many of which are open to the public. Don’t 
think sticky Formica tables; these places can be rather grand. The Justice 
Ministry’s canteen, for example, is on the fifth floor overlooking parliament, 
where bronze chariots charge across the rooftops. It’s very handy for the 
Kunsthistorisches, and the food is good and reasonably priced. You might also 
try the arty and cheap canteen (Mensa) at the Applied Arts College (Oscar 
Kokoschka Platz, 2), or the Fine Art College (Schillerplatz 3).

Naschmarkt
At this popular mile-long market, a straggle of food stalls sell everything 
from Viennese cakes to Vietnamese dishes. You can eat in some excellent

just collect bread, olives, cheese and cakes for a picnic. On Sundays the area 
turns into an entertaining flea market.

Schnitzelwirt

 Traditional Wiener schnitzel. Photograph: Alamy 

Traditional Viennese cuisine really requires you to burn 10,000 calories a day 
or face the consequences, and there is no dish more Viennese than wiener 
schnitzel, a boneless cut of veal, doused in egg and rolled in breadcrumbs 
before being fried. If you are going to go for it, go for the best: 
Schnitzelwirt on Neubaugasse (from €6.80). There are plenty of other meaty 
delights: roasted pig’s lung with gorgonzola (€12.40), anyone? Or try the €13
Bauernschmaus, or farmer’s feast, a barnstorming collection of pork, sauerkraut 
and other things. Delicious.

Werkzeug-H 
This bar/restaurant on Schönbrunner Strasse is full of sofas, armchairs and 
students. There’s a pleasant outside seating area and the music is never too 
loud for conversation. The food is nothing fancy – chilli con carne (€6.50), 
pasta, salads and so on – but well-priced with some local specialities. Best of 
all, food’s free on Friday nights: grab a bowl and join the queue.

 Cafe Hawelka. Photograph: Alamy 
Café Hawelka 
Hawelka’s dark atmospheric interior made it one of Vienna’s most famous cafes 
in the late 1930s, when it was a regular artists’ haunt. On narrow, historic 
Dorotheergasse, in the Innere Stadt district, it still offers a cosy retreat 
from winter’s chill, where you can watch locals enjoying amelange, (half 
coffee, half milk) and a cake and perusing the newspapers. The city does do a 
lot of high-art patisserie that looks impressive, but these cakes taste good, 
too.

Café Benno 
Large student and immigrant populations have restored vibrancy to Vienna’s 
cafe culture. Café Benno, just inside the ring road on Alser Strasse, is a 
convivial games cafe where you can eat, drink and play board games – an 
incredible variety are stacked up on the walls. Noisy and lots of fun, it opens 
at 4.30pm and goes on till 2am.
• cafebenno.at <http://www.cafebenno.at/>

Café Central

You do get a bit of the block-booked tourist nonsense here on Herrengrasse, 
but it’s so expansive and grand that Central – once frequented by painters such 
as Klimt, Egon Schiele and Adolf Loos – manages to cope, under its gorgeous 
arched ceiling. Try a Viennese breakfast, which is a soft-boiled egg, rolls and 
coffee.
• palaisevents.at <http://www.palaisevents.at/cafecentral.html>

Café Brot und Spiele
Another lively place popular with students, the Brot und Spiele (bread and 
games) on Laudongasse has great buzz, food, drink at affordable prices, and 
games – Cluedo is always popular. It can get smoky – many Viennese cafe-bars 
have registered as theatres so as to be able to allow smoking so – smoker or 
not – you are on stage.
