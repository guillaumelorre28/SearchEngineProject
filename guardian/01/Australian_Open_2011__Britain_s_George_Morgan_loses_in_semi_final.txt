George Morgan's run in the boys' singles at the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> came to an end today when 
he lost 6-3, 6-4 to the top seed, Jiri Vesely, in the semi-finals.

The 17-year-old from Bolton was broken once in each set by Vesely, from the 
Czech Republic, who will go on to play the unseeded Australian Luke Saville in 
the final. Morgan's performances in Melbourne maintain his recent progress and 
he remains one of Britain's best hopes, after winning the prestigious Orange 
Bowl in Florida last year. Morgan is currently ranked 930th in the world.
