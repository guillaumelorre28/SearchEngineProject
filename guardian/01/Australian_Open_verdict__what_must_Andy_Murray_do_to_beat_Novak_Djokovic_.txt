Andy Murray has no doubt he is good enough to beat Novak Djokovic on the 
biggest stages in world tennis. Hedid it at Flushing Meadows

 to win his two major titles. Hebeat Roger Federer to win Olympic gold

. He has more to be proud of than just about any British player in the history 
of tennis, yet he has quite a lot to think about.

In the wake of a fourth defeat by Djokovic in an Australian Open final

 – to go withone against Federer six years ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/31/andy-murray-roger-federer-australian-open>
 – Murray must confront the question that will not disappear: is he as good at 
tennis as the player he has known since childhood?

His public answer has to be, yes. Otherwise there is not much point in 
carrying on. And, shot for shot, he can trade with the Serb like few others, 
even Federer, who, but for a stirring third-set fightback, fell with brutal 
inevitability under Djokovic’s bootin the semi-finals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/28/novak-djokovic-roger-federer-australian-open>
. So there will never be a press conference where Murray admits: “Let’s face 
it, guys, he’s better than me.”

Like all proud champions he will allow himself the rider of “on the night”. 
Or, as he put it after Djokovicbeat him 6-1, 7-5, 7-6 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/jan/31/novak-djokovic-v-andy-murray-australian-open-final-live>
 in a match that swung violently between dire and fascinating: “A lot has been 
going on.”

It certainly has. For several weeks he threatened to leave Australia and 
return to London the moment he had any indication that his wife, Kim, was about 
to give birth to their first child. Although the due date was believed to be 
mid-February, Murray has been on edge constantly. Then came the mysterious 
collapse of Kim’s father, the coach Nigel Sears, whoblacked out during Ana 
Ivanovic’s match 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/23/andy-murray-father-in-law-nigel-sears-collapses>
 on Rod Laver Arena on the first Saturday of the tournament – at the very 
moment Murray was playing João Sousa on the adjoining Margaret Court Arena.

It was a surreal experience for everyone concerned. It is believed there 
happened to be three doctors nearby in the stand when Sears fell heavily after 
complaining of not feeling well. Medics applied a defibrillator and he was 
rushed to a nearby hospital. He was released with a positive report after tests 
and flew back to be with his daughter on 25 January.

Before leaving to join them, Murray shared a quick analysis of his evening 
here. “I started the last couple of matches quite slowly, which was 
understandable in some respects. It’s not good to begin matches like that 
against someone like Novak but I’m proud of the way I fought and managed to get 
myself back into the match and create chances.

Drawn back to discuss the pain he had just endured on court, he said: “I don’t 
know how far off I was tonight. Most of the matches we played in slams I think 
have been competitive. Whether that looks the same from the outside or not, I 
don’t know. For a three-set match, two hours and 50 minutes, it was a tough few 
sets.

“I just saw some of the stats. He won 24 more points than me. I had 24 more 
unforced errors. I didn’t hit my forehand particularly well at the beginning of 
the match. I started to hit it better in the third set.

“I was starting to have quite a lot of opportunities in the second. I had a 
few chances there when I got the break back. That was a tough game to lose.

No doubt that I’m playing the best tennis of my life in the last 15 months. 
Everything is going well privately, as well
Novak Djokovic 
“In the third I felt like towards the end of the set, after I got the break 
back again, that I was creating a few chances.

“In the tie-break I missed two second serves by a little bit. He had served an 
ace on the T, which was in by a little bit. That was it.”

Djokovic’s view concurred, pretty much. “Executed the game plan perfectly for 
a set and a half,” he said. “I made a break in the second. I felt he was pretty 
neutral from the back of the court and was allowing me to take charge and 
control over the rallies. I had more time.

“Then he started serving better. He came back into the match. The second set 
was decided in a few points, as was the third. I thought I maybe could have 
done better in my service games when I was up a break both sets, second and 
third, but credit to him for fighting and showing why he’s one of the best in 
the world.

“He definitely made me work. There were a lot of long rallies, long exchanges. 
We were both breathing heavily towards the end of the second and third sets but 
that’s what you expect.”

As cool analyses of the numbers and some of the key moments, both of those 
takes stand up well to scrutiny – but they do not tell the whole story. That is 
a narrative written in Murray’s heart, in moments of reflection at the All 
England Club, for instance, when he will drive up from Oxshott and sit quietly 
in the seats on Centre Court to try to put everything in perspective. It will 
always be his haven.

Nevertheless the burden of losing big matches to the same player, with the 
world watching, needs addressing. What can he do to stop this mercurial genius?

He may try changing his racket or restringing it to put more beef in the 
middle rather than his current cudgel, which is designed for safe tennis.

Murray has tried to inject aggression into his play, often successfully, but 
it is considerably more difficult to attack with freedom against the best 
defensive player in the game than it isagainst Sam Groth

One is, however, dragged back time and again to Murray’s record against 
Djokovic, born exactly a week later than him in 1987 but who has pulled away 
over the past few years like a Ferrari lined up against a pram.

Ultimately they left a familiar impression: Djokovic does everything Murray 
does, only better; but when they lapsed into mistakes of their own making in a 
ragged final Murray’s 65 were more telling, more regular, more hurtful than the 
Serb’s 41.

It was Djokovic’s 11th win against him in their past 12 matches. Djokovic has 
11 majors and should overtake Rafael Nadal’s 14 within a year or so, then set 
about passing Federer’s 17. This year? The world No1 will again be in the hunt 
for a calendar grand slam. “I don’t take anything for granted,” he said, “even 
though I won the last four out of five grand slams, played five finals out of 
the last five grand slams. It’s phenomenal. I’m very proud of it, as are my 
team. We worked very hard to be in this position and we should enjoy it. We 
should cherish every moment because these are the tournaments we all value, 
that we all want to play well on.

“No doubt that I’m playing the best tennis of my life in the last 15 months. 
Everything is going well privately, as well. I became a father and husband, 
have a family, so I feel like I’m at the point in my life where everything is 
working in harmony. I’ll try to keep it that way.”

Murray, meanwhile, has racked up five losing finals at the same major 
tournament, an open era record he probably would not like to dwell on during 
the long trip home.
