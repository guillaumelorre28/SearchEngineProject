Find Nemo at the Plymouth Aquarium

You can see seals, seahorses and octopuses at Torquay's Living Coasts 
<http://www.livingcoasts.org.uk>, but the sea life exhibits at this brilliant 
coastal zoo pale in comparison to those at Plymouth's National Marine Aquarium. 
This is the UK's largest aquarium and introduces you to all sorts of species 
that inhabit the seas from Plymouth Sound to the tropics. Anemones, hermit 
crabs, sharks, turtles and jellyfish take children deep into the world of Nemo, 
and the 3D underwater film is worth splashing out an extra £2.50 to view. 
Combine the trip with a stroll along some of thePlymouth Waterfront Walkway 
<http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/walksdb/13> – an easygoing section of the 
South West Coast Path where you can gawp at the giant scallop sculpture, marvel 
at Brunel's four-foot spanner and ponder quotations from Sherlock Holmes.

Sandcastles and sea tractors at Bigbury on Sea
 Photograph: Alamy 
Even without a sea tractor ride to Burgh Island, the blue-flag beauty of 
Bigbury on Sea is a fantastic family beach, with gently shelving sands, shallow 
bathing and rock pools for rounding up marine critters. Access is easy for 
lugging boards and buggies from the car park, and there's a beachside cafe 
renowned for its organic, local food. Burgh Island, looking back across a tidal 
causeway, simply adds to this beach perfection. Famous for itsart deco hotel 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/jul/26/islands-britain-holidays> that 
inspired two Agatha Christie novels, the island is easily accessible on foot at 
low tide, but for kids it's the high-tide ride onboard the 1930s sea tractor 
that makes the destination thrilling. The hotel isn't open to non-residents, 
but the 700-year-old Pilchard Inn is a fine spot for local ales and a plate of 
oysters if you don't mind paying for the setting.

Estuary cruising from Salcombe
 Photograph: Peter Titmuss/Alamy 
All aboard at one of Devon's most sublime boating locations. Hop on an 
organised cruise or hire your own motorboat – it's simple to learn the ropes 
and you can't go far wrong with a chart detailing the best beaches, seal 
hotspots and places to moor up for food and drink. Hire a fishing rod and catch 
your tea or, as the hire shop handily doubles up as a fishmonger, you can stock 
up on fresh crab sandwiches and fish flipped straight off the local day boats. 
If you don't want to self-drive, hourly cruises putter up and down the estuary 
and two-hour evening cruises stop at theMillbrook Inn 
<http://www.millbrookinnsouthpool.co.uk> – a delightful and very popular little 
foodie boozer in the village of South Pool.

Gourmet beach fun at Blackpool Sands, near Dartmouth
 Photograph: Alamy 
A more natural seaside attraction than the famous Blackpool of the north, this 
sheltered cove is a family favourite. The shingle may be no good for 
sandcastles, but on the plus side you won't get sand in your picnic and there 
are sand boxes for bucket and spade wielding toddlers. Besides, with snorkels 
and wetsuits to hire, beach games available from the shop and all sorts of 
water sports on offer, you'll be too busy kayaking, stand-up paddle-boarding or 
learning to windsurf to build sandcastles. Although there's a grassy picnic 
area don't be too hasty to pack your own sandwiches, you might prefer to buy 
picnic boxes, paninis, burgers and ice-creams from Venus Cafe. Hot on its 
local, organic food and green credentials, its children's meals even come with 
an activity book that educates nippers about the beach environment.

A trio of attractions onboard the South Devon Railway, Buckfastleigh
 Photograph: Alamy 
"You must take the kids to the South Devon Railway," a friend once told me. 
And it was advice well heeded, not just because we spent a day chugging through 
seven miles of the verdant and magical River Dart Valley. Toddlers can hop 
aboard on special Thomas the Tank Engine days, while train enthusiasts of all 
ages can admire locomotives and see how steam engines work at the museum 
(though I was more partial to the cream teas and riverside walks). Train 
trappings aside, what makes this a full-steam day out is that you can buy a 
single ticket and get admission into two further attractions that the train 
ferries you between. Hop off at Totnes Rare Breeds farm to see hedgehogs, pygmy 
goats and squirrels; Dartmoor Otters and Buckfast Butterflies to spot otters 
underwater and walk through sub-tropical butterfly enclosures.

Dartmoor Adventures
 Photograph: John Sturrock/Alamy 
Dartmoor's rolling hills, tumbling streams and woodland valleys beckon 
families seeking outdoor adventures. For an action-packed day, the 90-acre 
River Dart Country Park (pictured) offers a full-throttle line-up, from an 
assault course, pirate ship and treehouses to the more daredevil zipwire, 
caving and kayaking. You can also wander woodland trails from here, but one of 
our favourite days out starts further along the road from New Bridge car park. 
Duck under the bridge and follow an easygoing footpath towards Spitchwick, 
winding through woods and emerging on a grassy common that nudges the perfect 
place to paddle in the River Dart. You can extend the walk into a four-mile 
loop via the Tavistock Inn at Poundsgate (tavistockinn.co.uk 
<http://www.tavistockinn.co.uk/>), using the ice-cream van in the free car park 
at your start point 
<http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&gl=uk&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&biw=1588&bih=995&q=Poundsgate&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x486cfe984b5760b5:0x9e89c389620666c,Poundsgate,+Devon&gl=uk&ei=LaGqT9apOKKt0QWex4TxBg&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=image&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q8gEwAQ>

White-knuckle rides at Woodlands Leisure Park, Totnes
 Woodlands Leisure Park, Devon 
The leafy surroundings of Woodlands Leisure Park give little hint to the 10 
fun-packed zones of theme-park attractions you are about to enter. The 
tranquillity of the countryside is left behind as you zoom down toboggan runs 
and drop slides, or take on the white-knuckle rides of the swing ship and 
Trauma Tower (which drops you from 16 metres). There's plenty for toddlers too: 
experience the Wild West in Bear City, play with sand diggers, splash in the 
paddling pool and discover meerkats, reptiles and alpacas in the Zoo-Farm. Rain 
doesn't stop play, just head for the indoor fun factory with a rocking and 
rolling tugboat, mirror maze, ferris wheel and soft play.

Play Kings and Queens at Powderham Castle, Exeter
 Photograph: Alamy 
One of England's oldest family homes, Powderham Castle, on the banks of the 
Exe estuary, packs in a lot more than just castle tours and nature trails. Hop 
on a tractor and trailer ride through the deer park, watch blacksmiths in the 
forge and meet pot-bellied pigs, goats and guinea pigs in Pets Corner. Children 
can be kings of their own castle in the wooden fort with its turrets, 
suspension bridge and zipwire. During summer, visiting birds of prey are one of 
the main attractions, with owls, falcons and hawks wowing onlookers with their 
free flying stunts. There's a series of seasonal events from teddy bears' 
picnics to live music, so it's fortunate that entry grants an extra day's 
admission too.

Drive a JCB at Diggerland, Cullompton
 Photograph: Jim Wileman/Alamy 
The concept of Diggerland is simple: a field, some mud and a range of 
digger-themed attractions. As an adult female it's not my favourite day out, 
but it's an absolute hit with the kids (and dads). After all, how many children 
wouldn't jump at the chance of getting behind the wheel of full-size 
construction machinery and doing some excavating? The fun doesn't stop at the 
controls of the tractors, dumper trucks and diggers – there are fairground 
rides including the flying bucket of the Spindizzy and the dig-a-round. Young 
drivers can hop into police cars and ride battery-powered Land Rovers and, 
while most of the rides are for children over three, there's a handful of rides 
suitable for tiny tots too.

school holidays February–October, £17pp over 90cm, under 90cm free

Strolling and cycling at Haldon Forest Park
 Photograph: Alamy 
Looking for somewhere to tire out kids and dogs? Haldon's 3,500 acres of 
woodland is the place to go. Walking trails wend deep into the forest, where 
children are encouraged to build dens, climb trees and seek out wildlife from 
butterflies to birds of prey. Of several routes the family favourite is the 
1½-mile Discovery Trail; it's easy terrain for buggies and includes fun 
features such as musical instruments carved from wood. If you want to up the 
ante simply hop on a bike (hire is available), for this is a haven for all 
levels of cyclists. Beginners can wobble along level tracks while experienced 
riders take on the technical descents of the Ridge Rides. If your group splits 
according to abilities, arrange to meet at The Ridge Café, which serves local, 
organic food adjacent to the children's play area.
