India's parliament has approved a contentious anti-corruption bill that 
empowers an independent ombudsman to investigate and prosecute cases of 
corruption by politicians and bureaucrats.

The "lokpal" or watchdog bill was passed by the lower house of parliament on 
Wednesday after the government agreed to several amendments suggested by 
opposition politicians. The bill cleared the upper house on Tuesday.

It will become a law after it is signed by the president.

The anti-corruption bill was spurred by social activist Anna Hazare 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/aug/21/profile-anna-hazare>, who 
has been on a hunger strike for the last nine days. He has said he will end his 
fast once both houses of parliament adopt the bill.

The bill had been in abeyance since 2011, when it was approved by the lower 
house, but not the upper house.

Will the Lokpal Bill really change India's corruption culture? Tell us what 
you think here
