Army bomb disposal officers were examining a car containing a suspect device 
in aNorthern Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> village 
close to the border with the Irish Republic today.

Up to 60 families in Newtownhamilton spent most of the day in a school after 
being evacuated from their homes. The SouthArmagh 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/armagh> village remained sealed off for most of 
the day as army technical officers dealt with a device in a car outside 
Newtownhamilton's police station.

The security operation began around 2am after a silver Peugeot was abandoned 
outside the base, 24 hours after dissident republicans exploded a bomb inside a 
taxi at the gates of MI5's regional headquarters in Holywood, County Down.

An SDLP assemblyman for the region, Dominic Bradley, said there were 
similarities to bombs left by dissident republicans which exploded in Newry in 
February and to that used in the MI5 attack.

There was confusion over which dissident republican group was behind 
yesterday's attack on the MI5 base. On Monday night the Real IRA issued a 
statement denying involvement. Another organisation opposed to the peace 
process, Oglaigh na hEireann, is now being blamed for the blast. ONH contains a 
number of former IRA bombmakers.
