Tens of millions of children are using tablets, but this does not yet mean a 
lucrative market for the companies making apps for these digital kids.

The most prominent independent developer of children’s apps, Swedish company 
Toca Boca, has published its financial results for 2014, revealing revenues of 
SEK 82.2m (£6.1m) for the year.

That’s up 28% on its sales the previous year, although the company’s net 
profit narrowed from SEK 13.5m in 2013 to SEK 11.5m in 2014 – £0.8m.

On the plus side, Toca Boca is making a profit from children’s apps, which is 
more than can be said for most developers in this area. The company runs a lean 
ship, ending 2014 with 23 employees, up from 16 at the end of 2013.

Its financial results are put into perspective, however, by the much greater 
turnover of mobile games like Candy Crush Saga, whoseplayers spent £865m on 
in-app purchases in 2014

 – making a year’s worth of Toca Boca sales every three days.

It’s an unfair comparison, though: while it shows the gap between the top 
children’s apps and the top all-ages freemium games, Toca Boca’s direct rivals 
are publishers like Disney, which does not break out its revenues from 
children’s apps.

Toca Boca’s apps, which focus on creative play while avoiding in-app 
purchases, have been downloaded more than 85m times on iOS and Android devices 
since 2010 – a figure that includes free downloads as well as paid apps.

Dr Panda and Outfit7 are among its larger independent rivals, while Angry 
Birds maker Rovio might also be seen as a contemporary: that firmreported 
£114.3m of revenues for 2014

, albeit with its games aimed at adults as well as children.

Toca Boca is following Rovio’s path into merchandise – it has an online store 
selling clothing and other physical products <http://tocaboca.com/shop/all/> – 
as well as online video.

In April 2015 Toca Boca created a digital video division

, hiring Sesame Street digital veteran J Milligan to run it, with an app due to 
launch in the coming months.

“We have this opportunity: once we’ve built it, we’ll have our own 
distribution platform,” he told the Guardian, describing Toca Boca’s desire to 
offer parents and children an alternative to Netflix and Amazon.

“If there’s a family iPad, there’s some point at which the kid takes control 
over it, and that’s their screen, even though there’s still a TV in the 
corner,” he said. “Toca Boca’s first screen is the tablet, and that’s what the 
video experience is like for kids already.”

Rovio’s ToonsTV network, which includes Angry Birds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/angry-birds> cartoons as well as series 
from partners in the children’s TV world, generated 4bn video views by the end 
of 2014.

Toca Boca’s new division could also make hay on YouTube, where four of the 
five most popular channels are aimed at children

. One of them, British channel Little Baby Bum, has justannounced its own 
expansion into plush toys
