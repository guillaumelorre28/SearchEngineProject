Confession time. When I shop, I am drawn like a moth to a flame to the 
prettiest, most eye-catching pieces. Yesterday, I took a short cut through Zara 
– I know, madness. Know thyself, woman! – and ended up buying a spaghetti-strap 
black lace bra-top thing, with some half-baked idea about how I was going to 
wear it over a shirt at fashion week in a sort of entry-level-Vetements 
<http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2016-ready-to-wear/vetements/slideshow/collection#4>
 way.

 Lela dress £65, Livia Firth M&S Collection. 
I will never wear it, and this is a stupid way to shop. Is February too late 
to make a New Year’s resolution? Because I want to be more like Livia Firth. 
Instead of buying jazzy, sparkly magpie nonsense, I am going to look for 
blind-spot clothes: the ones that you almost miss because they are borderline 
boring, but which make a) your life easier, b) your wardrobe more streamlined, 
and c) you a better person.

 Daria dress in emerald £79, Livia Firth M&S Collection. 
Sustainability consultant Livia Firth’s mini-collection for Marks & Spencer 
<http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/women/livia-firth/livia-firth-the-edit> is 
deliberately trend-free. The concept is clothes cut to flatter and to last, 
without the kind of frills, slogans or details that date fast. These are 
stealth-useful clothes, not shouty must-haves. And, just like a blind spot, you 
miss them at your peril.

 Gia top £49.50, Livia Firth M&S Collection. 
“I am not a trend person,” Firth told me at the launch. “I’m Italian. The way 
I was brought up was to buy beautiful things that last.” The fabrics are 
ethical – the A-line Lela dress with a greatcutaway halterneck neckline 
<http://www.elle.com/fashion/trend-reports/g26822/spring-2016-fashion-trends/?slide=3>
 is made of recycled polyester – but the most important ethical quality of the 
collection is not the fabric, but the idea that you will keep them and wear 
them for years. Exhibit A: the Daria dress, a Hepburn-ish fit-and-flare 
knee-length number that M&S boss Steve Rowe says can “remain in any woman’s 
wardrobe for ever and always feel stylish”.

 Tan leather tote £149, Livia Firth M&S Collection. 
M&S worked with a sustainable leather supply chain in the Mato Grosso region 
of Brazil to make the handbags, a tote big enough for a laptop (£149) and a 
good-sized evening clutch (£89). “A project like this can be a gamechanger,” 
says Firth. “It tells ranchers thousands of miles away that customers care 
about sustainability and major brands are prepared to invest in sustainable 
supply.” I’m going to look in my blind spot. Also, walk straight past the bra 
tops.
