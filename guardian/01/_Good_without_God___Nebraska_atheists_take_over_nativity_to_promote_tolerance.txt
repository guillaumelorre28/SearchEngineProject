no room in the inner halls of the state capitol – and no manger either.


Conservatives should blame capitalism for the 'war on Christmas' | Steven W

Instead, there will be an 8ft “happy humanist” next to a “reason tree” 
dedicated to science and “human intellectual achievement”.

In Lincoln, amid the supposed “war on Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/11/conservatives-should-blame-capitalism-war-on-christmas>
” bemoaned each year by the political right, it appears the atheists really 
have stolen Christmas.

On Friday, a classic Christian nativity scene was erected in the rotunda of 
Nebraska’s capitol building. The state’s lieutenant governor, Mike Foley, was 
scheduled to attend.

But on 18 December the nativity will have to be moved, to make way for 
exhibits organised by a coalition of atheist and humanist groups who last 
summer booked up all available exhibition space in the rotunda for the week 
around Christmas Day.

From 19 to 26 December, therefore, the capitol will host an exhibition called 
Reason this Season, organized by Lincoln Atheists, Omaha Atheists and several 
other humanist associations.


“It’s going to be a big shindig,” Chris Clements of Lincoln Atheists told the 
Guardian. “Our message is that it’s a secular government and religion has to 
stay separate from that. And it’s meant to communicate that atheists are not 
bad people – we can be good without God.”

One of the main exhibits will be a table holding a miniature church, a 
miniature mosque and symbols from other religions including Judaism and 
Buddhism, separated from a miniature White House, Statue of Liberty and US 
Capitol by a model wall – a stark reminder of the separation of church and 
state that is enshrined in the first amendment to the constitution.

separate from that

With a little more subtlety – but not much – a large pine “reason tree” will 
be decked with messages promoting free opinion and scientific and philosophical 
thought.

Other exhibits will include a seasonal scene of a snowy model village and the 
“happy humanist”, a large cutout in the shape of a person with a quote from 
Thomas Paine, a key influence on the founding fathers who vehemently argued 
against institutionalised religion.

Clements said the atheist groups were excluded from the state capitol last 
year, after the nativity scene went up.

“So this year we wanted to make sure we had the opportunity to be in,” he said.

Last year, around the US, there were a number of clashes over seasonal 
displays. A “zombie nativity” scene in Ohio was orderedremoved

; a satanic display in Florida wasvandalized

. In 2012, a live nativity in California wasdiscontinued 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/01/santa-monica-nativity-scene-atheist>
 after protests from atheist groups.

In 2014, the nativity scene in the Nebraska capitol caused much debate. It was 
sponsored by the Omaha branch of theThomas More Society 
<https://www.thomasmoresociety.org/>, a national Christianity-based, 
anti-abortion, nonprofit advocacy group which is also responsible for the 
nativity scene this year and whose website announces its mission to help “keep 
the Christ in Christmas”.

The fact that the scene is sponsored by a private group means it does not 
violate the official separation of church and state within the headquarters of 
the state government, capitol building administrator Bob Ripleytold

However, any group is only allowed one week per exhibition. So, earlier in 
2015, the atheist groups made sure they were first in line to book up Christmas 
week.

“We would have liked to have been there over Christmas,” said Christine 
Delgado, an attorney with the Thomas More Society. “But it really doesn’t 
matter what week it is.

“It would have been nice. There are four corners and if it would have been up 
to us we would have reserved one corner and left the other three open to anyone 
else. We are not particularly pleased, but we’re not upset.”

One representative of the Thomas More Society, Martin Cannon, said in a local 
report the atheist groups were “not willing” to share the space. Clements 
denied that.

Tom Gray, who recently retired as a lieutenant colonel after 23 years in the 
US army, including two tours in Afghanistan, is involved in the secular display 
on behalf of two groups, Omaha Atheists andOffutt Humanists 
<http://www.offutt.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123439757>, the latter a group for 
non-religious military members serving at the nearby Offutt air force base.

There is a pretty strong assumption here in the mid-west that everyone is 
Christian and attends church
Lt Col Tom Gray, Omaha Atheists and Offutt Humanists 
“There are a lot of religions that discourage the free exchange of ideas,” he 
said. “And vocal religious believers who seek to influence legislatures and try 
to impose religion in public schools. And there is a pretty strong assumption 
here in the mid-west that everyone is Christian and attends church and we 
wanted to say something different.

“But it’s not intended to be a poke in the eye to religion.”

Gray said that in the spirit of open-mindedness and a desire to understand all 
religions and the absence of religion, members of his group would visit the 
Islamic Center of Omaha on Saturday.

The center has been defaced 
<http://www.ketv.com/news/vandals-target-omaha-islamic-center-with-paris-peace-sign/36477480>
 three times since the summer, most recently after the terrorist attacks in 
Paris, when a mystery vandal sprayed the peace sign with a depiction of the 
Eiffel Tower.

“It’s like saying they are responsible,” said Gray. “There has been a lot of 
hate speech and there needs to be more tolerance.”
