<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amy-poehler> on Saturday Night Live and 
Parks And Recreation loves waffles. Try these.

Makes six waffles
Sift 250g plain flour, two teaspoons of baking powder, half a teaspoon of salt 
and two tablespoons of caster sugar. Separate two eggs: whisk the whites to 
soft peaks; mix the yolks with 300ml buttermilk and half a teaspoon of vanilla 
extract. Slowly whisk in 75g of melted, cooled, unsalted butter. Stir the egg 
yolk mix into the dry ingredients until just combined. Fold in the egg whites 
and 150g fresh blueberries, until just combined: over-stirring makes for tough 
waffles. If using a waffle machine, follow the instructions, or heat a waffle 
pan. Brush both sides with butter, add a couple of spoonfuls of batter to fill 
the mould, and cook for two to three minutes a side. Top with berries, maple 
syrup or sour cream.
