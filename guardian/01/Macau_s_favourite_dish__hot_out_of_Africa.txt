If there’s one dish that says everything you need to know about Macau’s 
culinary heritage, it’s African chicken, orgalinha à africana.

Thanks to the former trading routes of Macau’s Portuguese colonisers, Macanese 
cuisine combines European, Indian, African and south-east Asian influences – 
and is rarely served beyond the territory’s 29 square kilometres.

 Tender is the bite … Henri’s Galley’s take on the dish aims for succulence 
African chicken is Macau’s best-loved dish, despite the fact that nobody can 
agree where it came from or what it should taste like. Rumour has it that a 
local chef – Americo Angelo – dreamed it up in a hotel kitchen in the 1940s, 
using spices pilfered from a trip to Portuguese colonies in Africa. Others say 
the recipe has been passed down through Portuguese families for centuries.

Forget history. It’s delicious, and it’s simple: chicken, covered in a peanut, 
tomato and chilli sauce, sometimes with paprika. It’s served with bread, 
potatoes orriz à la tomate – to mop up the drips.

Come to Restaurante Litoral <http://www.restaurante-litoral.com/>, a 
Portuguese outpost under the arches of the old town’s Rua do Almirante Sérgio, 
on Saturday lunchtime. Admire the pretty, tiled floors and the pictures of old 
Macau hanging on the walls. This African chicken is one of the best in town – 
you can smell the fat half bird, swathed in a thick layer of peanut and tomato 
sauce, before it arrives.

Or head to Henri’s Galley <http://www.henrisgalley.com.mo/main_en.htm> on 
Avenida da Republica, where Raymond Vong has been cooking his father’s recipe 
in exactly the same way for the past 40 years. “We make the chicken more 
tender,” he says of his signature dish. “We grill it and cook it in the sauce 
with peanuts, chilli, butter, tomatoes and coconut. It’s one of the favourites.”
