After allegations that Cameron Crowe’s latest film Aloha presents an unfair 
racial representation ofHawaii <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hawaii>, 
Sony has released an official statement in response.

“While some have been quick to judge a movie they haven’t seen and a script 
they haven’t read, the film Aloha respectfully showcases the spirit and culture 
of the Hawaiian people,” the statement read. “Film-maker Cameron Crowe spent 
years researching this project and many months on location in Hawaii, 
cultivating relationships with leading local voices. He earned the trust of 
many Hawaiian community leaders, including Dennis ‘Bumpy’ Kanahele, who plays a 
key role in the film.”

The romantic comedy, starring Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone, is released this 
week in America and hasangered the Media Action Network for Asian Americans

 who claim it is “an insult” for going out of its way to “exclude the very 
people who live” in Hawaii.

The decision to call the film Aloha has also upset some locals, including 
native activist Walter Ritte. “If you have a romantic comedy about the military 
in Hawaii … but a title that saysAloha, I can only guess that they’ll 
bastardise the word,” he toldAP 
<http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2a4845eea26b4d31b0d2b03ebe3d848f/some-native-hawaiians-disapprove-aloha-movie-title>
. “They’re taking our sacred word … and they’re going to make a lot of money 
off of it.”

Aloha has suffered a troubled route to the big screen with rumoured reshoots, 
heavy editing and a release date change. Just two days away from release, there 
were still no reviews available.
