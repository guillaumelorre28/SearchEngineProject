David Haye

Good lateral movement for a heavyweight. With his hands down, he was hardly 
touched in 12 rounds against Nikolai Valuev last year because his much bigger 
opponent could not track him and, in the end, was so frustrated, he dropped his 
own guard and was almost stopped in the last round. Has very sharp reflexes and 
unusual punches

Main weapon

Harrison will have to be alert for the uppercut. Haye's power comes from his 
speed and eye for an opening. For a laidback guy, Haye is unusually intense in 
the ring, as if wired to the mains. He blew Enzo Maccarinelli away before he 
knew he was even in the fight. His timing and power, especially with his right 
hand, make him a threat for every second of a fight.

Weakness

A relatively small heavyweight. If Harrison connects cleanly, he will do damage

Audley Harrison

Harrison is a great analyst and will have prepared a strategy to counter 
Haye's speed, probably dragging him into clinches to drain his strength

Main weapon

Harrison boxes southpaw, an obstacle in itself, and has a very stiff and 
accurateright jab, followed by a big left cross. He knows his ring geography: 
that is, he and is hard to pin in corners or along the ropes because of his 
size and strength, frustrating a lot of opponents

Weakness

He doesn't throw enough punches due to his natural caution, a legacy of his 
amateur days. If he lets the fight slip away from him, he could get desperate 
and leave openings
