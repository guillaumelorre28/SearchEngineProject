Getto

Getto is a burger bar with a difference: each burger is named after a drag 
queen who performs there – keep an eye on the website if you're keen to catch 
an act. It describes itself as "an attitude-free zone, for gays, lesbians, bi, 
queers and straights". Relaxed and friendly, the bar staff mix great cocktails, 
and the interior has a chilled vibe. The burgers don't disappoint: try the 
Jennifer Hopelezz beef burger with guacamole and bacon, or the Dolly Bellefleur 
lamb burger with tzatziki and grilled courgette. They're served with chunky 
seasoned wedges and a mayo-heavy salad. And try the Gettopolitan – a cosmo made 
with Dutch Jenever liqueur.

Van Kerkwijk
 Van Kerkwijk 
Tucked down the Nes – what looks like a back alley running south of Dam square 
– Van Kerkwijk is unprepossessing from outside, but inside it's habitually 
packed with customers at small wooden tables. They don't take reservations, so 
get there early and have a drink while you wait. There's no menu (in the 
ink-on-paper sense) so expect your waiter to recite a list of dishes. These 
range from French and Italian classics such as steak tartare and carpaccio, 
through to north African tagines and Indonesian curries. To start, try their 
house pâté, which is coarse, gamey and full of rustic French flavour. Van 
Kerkwijk's meat is generally good, with mercifully undercooked, well-seasoned 
steaks and generous, chunky chips.

De Zotte

Don't go to de Zotte if you're teetotal. This "brown cafe" is a mecca for 
Belgian beer lovers, with several good brews on tap and scores more in bottles. 
To stop you getting too sozzled, a simple but filling menu is on offer. It's 
classic brown cafe fare: steaks with pepper, blue cheese or mushroom sauces, 
grilled lamb or chicken simply prepared. Non meat-eaters are also in for a 
treat: try De Zotte's hartige tart – essentially a deep-pan quiche. The filling 
changes, but generally involves some kind of cheese and green vegetables. It's 
huge, filling and feels like a hug on a cold day. Try it with sweet, darkbokbier
 on an autumn evening and breathe a contented sigh.

Restaurant Azmarino
 Azmarino 
East African food isn't widely represented in Amsterdam, but where it is, you 
can expect generosity and pride in the cuisine. Azmarino's decor is cosy and 
kitsch, with a convivial atmosphere to match. The food is served in giant 
sharing platters, the base of which is formed by a layer of the slightly sour, 
spongy pancakes that are typical of the region, with a further pile of the 
pancakes on the side to mop up the juices. Dishes are hot, sour, sweet and 
spicy all at the same time: marinated, juicy chicken drumsticks, slow-cooked 
lamb, and lentil-based sauces. Small piles of salad dotted around the platter 
offer welcome cool relief from the chilli.

Something of a lunch institution, Singel 404 has the best sandwiches in 
Amsterdam. Not surprisingly, a lot of locals (especially students) know this 
too, so tables are hard to come by after noon. If the sun's shining, tables 
spill out on to the pavement next to the canal, improving your chances of 
scoring a seat. Try thebroodje (a generic name for sandwiches, made with your 
choice of bread) with avocado, smoked chicken, sun-dried tomatoes and melted 
brie. If perfection took the form of bread, this would be it: salty, smoky, 
creamy, with a touch of tartness. And big enough to fill you up until late 
afternoon, when it's time to return for a coffee and a slice of cake …

With a terrace overlooking the Nieuwmarkt and all-day opening, Poco Loco is 
the kind of joint you can pop into for morning coffee, lunch, afternoon tea, 
beer and tapas after work, or dinner. At lunchtime, think pimped-up club 
sandwiches with smoked chicken, crispy bacon, Dutch cheese, salad and sauces 
with a kick. The tapas are superb, and deviate from the Spanish norm with 
Italian bruschetta and Dutch croquettes. The main courses are also 
international, with recent dishes including fajitas and a skewer of mixed 
grilled meats. Traditional Dutch white beer and glühwein are on offer till 
late, and the interior is all funky 70s oranges and browns.

Yam Yam
 Yam Yam Tartufata pizza Photograph: Alamy 
Yam Yam is the Dutch translation of "yum yum" – the sound you make when you 
try their Tartufata pizza. This house speciality involves Italian ham, rocket, 
parmesan and (most importantly) truffle sauce. The dough is thin, crisp and 
nutty with ever-so-slightly charred edges; the toppings are fresh, authentic 
and generous, and the truffle is plain addictive. There is an array of other 
pizzas, as well as bresaola, buffalo mozzarella, bruschetta and other classic 
Italian antipasti. Despite (or possibly because of) its off-the-beaten-track 
location, Yam Yam has a local, neighbourhood feel and is always busy.
• Frederik Hendrikstraat 88-90, +31 20 681 5097, yamyam.nl 
<http://www.yamyam.nl/yamyam.html>, pizzas from €11. Open Tues-Sat 6pm-11.30pm,

Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs

You must try Dutch pancakes, or pannenkoeken. Thick and filling, with savoury 
or sweet toppings, they make perfect hangover food and are reasonably priced. 
At Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, you have to climb the most vertiginous staircase 
ever. At the top, the restaurant has just four or five tables, nestled amid 
hundreds of eclectic teapots, dangling from the ceiling and on any inch of 
available space. The pancakes are not the cheapest, but they're worth it for 
the location alone. Try the pancake with bacon andstroop – like maple syrup 
without the maple. Or switch the syrup for cheese. Either way, arrive hungry 
because a dinner plate-sized pancake will leave you full all afternoon.

Sawaddee Ka

There is plenty of Thai food in Amsterdam, but Sawaddee Ka distinguishes 
itself by being consistently good and inexpensive. Located near the popular 
Leidseplein, it's an ideal option for a post-shopping or pre-clubbing dinner. 
The menu is long and features the usual Thai suspects, including curries, 
noodles, fish cakes and soups. Main dishes come in silver pots balanced on tiny 
candle-lit burners, while rice comes in large, silver urns. Try the Neua Phad 
Namman Hoi: beef in oyster sauce with broccoli, mushrooms, and spring onion – 
the savoury, umami flavours of the oyster sauce and beef make a mean mouthful 
with the freshness of the broccoli and the tang from the spring onions.

mains from €10. Open daily 4pm-11pm, last orders 10pm, Sat 10.30pm

Café Het Paleis
 Café Het Paleis apple tart 
Café Het Paleis is conveniently located just to the west of Dam square, making 
it the perfect place for a break between seeing the tourist sites of the city 
or shopping in the nearby Kalverstraat – more of a recommendation for lunch or 
an afternoon coffee than for dinner. No visitor should leave Amsterdam without 
having a slice ofappelgebak (apple tart), and Paleis's is one of the best the 
city has to offer: thick, buttery pastry, soft, cinnamon-flecked apple and a 
big helping of gloriously indulgent whipped cream. An absolute treat after a 
day's sightseeing.
