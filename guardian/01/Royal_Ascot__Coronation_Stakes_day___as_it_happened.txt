Royal Ascot: day four wrap

French trainer Jean-Claude Rouget saddled his second consecutive Coronation 
Stakes winner, sending out Qemah to win the day’s feature race in the capable 
hands of jockey Gregory Benoist, who recorded his first Royal Ascot winner. On 
a day of several surprises, perhaps the most popular result of the day came in 
the Commonwealth Cup, when one-time jump jockey justified favouritism and his 
decision to switch to Flat racing by winning the Coronation Cup on the Karl 
Burke-trained Quiet Reflection for the jubilant Ontoawinner syndicate. The 
success marked Burke’s firstRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> winner and first Group One 
success on UK soil.

In the opening Albany Stakes, Brave Anna, trained by Aidan O’Brien and ridden 
by Seamie Heffernan, held off a late run from Bletchley to land the prize in a 
photo finish. In the following race, Frankie Dettori and Sir Michael Stoute 
teamed up to win the King Edward VII Stakes with 7-1 shot Across The Stars, who 
bounced back from a disappointing run in the Derby to win it’s RoyalAscot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> equivalent.


The days penultimate race, the Duke of Edinburgh Stakes was won by Kinema and 
Fran Berry, although the horse’s connections had to suffer an agonising wait 
for a stewards inquiry after the winner blocked a potentially winning run from 
the luckless Ryan Moore on Kings Fete, who eventually finished third. Aidan 
O’Brien made it two wins on the day when 33-1 shot Sword Fighter won the 
Queen’s Vase under a wonderful front-running ride from Colm O’Donoghue.

Queen's Vase (5.35) 2m

They turn for home and Sword Fighter leads on the rails from Harbour Law ... 
Sword Fighter keeps plugging away and girmly hangs in there to win bravely from 
H|arbour Law and Twilight Payment. I’ll need to confirm those minor placings, 
but Sword Fighter wins the Queen’s Vase for jockey Colm O’Donoghue and and 
trainer Aidan O’Brien. Colin O’Donoghue gave that horse a brilliant ride.

Queen's Vase (5.35) 2m

Apologies for not bringing you the betting - technical issues and all that! 
Landofhopeandglory (4-1), Ormito (9-2) and Ebediyin (4-1) led the market. 
They’re away and running in the final race of the day, a listed race for 
three-year-olds Ormito got very agitated in the stalls under David Probert, but 
went away safely ...

That definitely looked like Ryan didn't want to say anything that might lose 
Fran the race given he wasn't going to win it.

Queen's Vase (5.35) preview

Dermot Weld, who recently trained the Derby winner, has a fine chance of 
further glory here with Ebediyin, from one of the Aga Khan’s many talented 
families and a winner at Naas last time when he appeared to relish the step up 
in distance. His mother was sister to two horses that won the Gold Cup around 
here.

Ormito is the leading British contender after plodding on behind the 
principals in Derby trials at Chester and Goodwood. Aidan O’Brien, who has a 
fine record in this race with four successes in the past nine years, saddles 
three. Landofhopeandglory is the mount of Ryan Moore and therefore appears the 
number one from Ballydoyle but hasn’t won since his maiden and looks slow.

Stewards inquiry ...

In the televised stewards inquiry, winning jockey Fran Berry says his horse 
hung into the whip and argues that the gap Ryan Moore went for was a bit too 
tight. For his part, Elite Army’s jockey James Doyle says his horse’s back end 
was knocked by Kinema. It’s Elite Army who’ll get the race if Kinema is judge 
to have caused deliberate interference.

Stewards Enquiry

A stewards’ enquiry has been called as there was clear interference on Ryan 
Moore’s mount Kings Fete, who was blocked by Kinema as he went for a gap while 
coming with a strong, strong run.

Duke of Edinburgh Handicap (5.00) 1m 4f

Hamelin takes an early lead as the horses set off on the mile-and-a-half trip, 
before A Soldier’s Life takes up the running ... A Soldier’s Life leads from 
Elite Army in a military one-two, with Hamelin bowling along in third ... on 
the turn for home A Soldier’s Life leads them around the bend but is soon taken 
on by Elite Army ... Elite Army kicks for home two furlongs out with Kinema and 
Kings Fete ... Kinema wins with a late run under Fran Berry. This one could go 
to the stewards, as Kings Fete went for a gap while travelling strongly and was 
blocked off.

Duke of Edinburgh Handicap (5.00) preview

Chris Cook

Talented but fragile, Elite Army tries for an impressive double, having won a 
differentRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> handicap 
over this distance two years ago, since when he has raced just twice. He proved 
his liking for this track when bagging a Listed race last month. His best form 
has been on a fast surface and his only attempt on soft going became one of his 
two defeats. Kings Fete is another fancied runner who hasn’t been seen much, 
running fifth of eight last month on his first try since 2014, which wouldn’t 
encourage me. Cymro and Kinema have the necessary talent but are both drawn 
very wide. First Sitting, with a new stable this year, achieved a career peak 
last time, albeit in a much smaller field.

Coronation Stakes (4.20)

French trainer Jean Claude Rouget wins his second Coronation Stakes in as many 
years, having triumphed with Ervedya 12 months ago. Ryan Moore will be cursing 
his luck as he got caught up in serious traffic problems. We can only speculate 
over the likely outcome if he’d had a clear run, but I suspect nothing would 
have beaten Qemah today.

We’re running a little behind schedule, with the horses only just gone behind 
the stalls ahead of today’s feature race. They’re loading them up and we’ll be 
off very soon.

Coronation Stakes (4.20) preview

Chris Cook

Rarely has a seven-figure payment for a horse been tested for value quite so 
quickly. Jet Setting fetched £1.3m on Monday evening after her Irish Guineas 
success last month, when she pipped the mighty Minding. Can she do it again on 
this drier surface, without a long and galloping straight to help her grind 
down her rivals? I’m betting against it but then who to choose? Could it be 
Nemoralia, a rocket that might not spark if there’s still too much juice in the 
ground? Qemah or Czabo, who will relish any moisture that remains? Marenko, who 
is growing into herself but hasn’t run on turf this year? I’ll give another 
chance to the 20-1 shot Tanaza, who seemed to need the run when tiring into 
seventh behind Jet Setting last time. She has seemed to have plenty of quality 
in the past and her stable has burst into form lately.
 Quiet Reflection comes under a beautifully timed run under Dougie Costello to

Tom Dascombe speaks ...

Looking disappointed, but sounding extremely dignified in defeat, the trainer 
of Kachy is at a loss to explain why his charge drifted across the track on to 
the stands rail only to lose by a whisker. He’s baffled by the horse’s antics, 
but says he’d rather lose the race to his good friend Karl Burke than anyone 
else. “Drop him back to five with a pair of blinkers on,” is his rueful 
suggestion as to what to do with Kachy next.

Stars align for Dettori and Stoute

Across The Stars bounced back from a disappointing run in the Derby to win the 
King Edward VII Stakes atRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. Having finished only 10th at 
Epsom behind Harzand, he perhaps did not have as hard a race as some there as 
once his chance had gone he was allowed to coast home.

Frankie Dettori was booked by Sir Michael Stoute for the colt and had him in 
the perfect position, just behind Ryan Moore who tried to make all on Beacon 
Rock. Across The Stars was keen enough in the early stages, but Dettori, riding 
full of confidence, has few peers in getting them to settle.

His mount had to be brave to get through a narrow gap between Beacon Rock and 
Choreographer and while he took a narrow lead, Beacon Rock would not give in 
lightly.
Stoute, who has an excellent record in the race, will have liked the way his 
charge stuck to his task and the 7-1 winner kept the Ballydoyle runner at bay 
by a length and a quarter.

John Gosden’s Muntahaa made eyecatching late gains from the rear to claim 
third.
“To win the ‘Ascot Derby’ is great,” said Dettori. “Michael has been hitting 
the crossbar and I’m pleased to get him a winner. He’s a master trainer and he 
had this horse well prepared for today. He didn’t come down the hill at Epsom, 
(but) he handled this track really well and we won.”

Commonwealth Cup (3.40) preview

Chris Cook

Just the second running of this top-class sprint for three-year-olds, 
featuring a lot of horses who showed talent last year but have yet to show 
they’re quite so good this summer. Illuminate was well beaten in the Guineas 
but that mile was never going to be her trip. Still, it’s starting to feel like 
a long time since she showed her best form. Waterloo Bridge won the Norfolk at
Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> last year, while 
Washington Bridge won the Windsor Castle but only Washington DC has shown a 
comparable level of form this year. Quiet Reflection is the likely favourite, 
the winner of five of her six starts, and her cannonball Group Two win at 
Haydock last time looks the best recent form on offer. Donjuan Triumphant, 
second that day, is trying to make up a four-length deficit.

King Edward VII Stakes (3.05)

That was a great ride from Frankie Dettori, who goes ahead in the leading 
jockey table with his fourth winner of the week. He won by a length from Beacon 
Rock, who’d made most of the running.

Brave by name and brave by nature

Brave Anna defied her lengthy odds to win the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> for Aidan O’Brien. O’Brien also 
supplied the 2-1 favourite for the race in Cuff but the Ryan Moore-ridden filly 
could not quicken in the final furlong.

Having missed the break Brave Anna and Seamie Heffernan had plenty of ground 
to make up on the likes of Create A Dream and Sea Of Snow, but the daughter of 
War Front knuckled down well. She had to live up to her name close home, as 
Ralph Beckett’s Bletchley and Richard Fahey’s Frankel filly Queen Kindly made 
her pull out all the stops.

The 16-1 winner crossed the line just a short head in front of Bletchley, with 
half a length back to Queen Kindly. It was a third RoyalAscot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> winner for Heffernan, who is a 
crucial part of the Ballydoyle operation.

The winner is a full-sister to the same owner’s Breeders’ Cup winner Hit It A 
Bomb.
“She’s a lovely filly and came here on the back of a good win at the Curragh,” 
said Heffernan. “It’s nice we can pitch up here on the big day and win again. 
“Aidan told me to give her a chance and hopefully she’d finish out well and 
that’s what she’s done.”

King Edward VII Stakes (3.05) preview

Chris Cook

A poor man’s Derby, this is a mile and a half Group Two for three-year-old 
males. The standout talent is rather hard to locate, suggesting this is not a 
quality renewal. Beacon Rock has some workmanlike form to his name but offers 
little prospect of progress on his eighth start. Humphrey Bogart stayed on to 
be fifth in the Derby and must be a strong contender. Perhaps Choreographer can 
improve past him, though, having had no luck in running when a fair seventh in 
the Dante on just his second start. Carntop, owned by the Prince of Wales, was 
a close second to Humphrey Bogart at Lingfield in May and should be capable of 
better, though he may still need more time to mature.

French trainer Jean-Claude Rouget saddled his second consecutive Coronation 
Stakes winner, sending out Qemah to win the day’s feature race in the capable 
hands of jockey Gregory Benoist, who recorded his first Royal Ascot winner. On 
a day of several surprises, perhaps the most popular result of the day came in 
the Commonwealth Cup, when one-time jump jockey justified favouritism and his 
decision to switch to Flat racing by winning the Coronation Cup on the Karl 
Burke-trained Quiet Reflection for the jubilant Ontoawinner syndicate. The 
success marked Burke’s firstRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> winner and first Group One 
success on UK soil.

In the opening Albany Stakes, Brave Anna, trained by Aidan O’Brien and ridden 
by Seamie Heffernan, held off a late run from Bletchley to land the prize in a 
photo finish. In the following race, Frankie Dettori and Sir Michael Stoute 
teamed up to win the King Edward VII Stakes with 7-1 shot Across The Stars, who 
bounced back from a disappointing run in the Derby to win it’s RoyalAscot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> equivalent.


The days penultimate race, the Duke of Edinburgh Stakes was won by Kinema and 
Fran Berry, although the horse’s connections had to suffer an agonising wait 
for a stewards inquiry after the winner blocked a potentially winning run from 
the luckless Ryan Moore on Kings Fete, who eventually finished third. Aidan 
O’Brien made it two wins on the day when 33-1 shot Sword Fighter won the 
Queen’s Vase under a wonderful front-running ride from Colm O’Donoghue.

Dermot Weld, who recently trained the Derby winner, has a fine chance of 
further glory here with Ebediyin, from one of the Aga Khan’s many talented 
families and a winner at Naas last time when he appeared to relish the step up 
in distance. His mother was sister to two horses that won the Gold Cup around 
here.

Ormito is the leading British contender after plodding on behind the 
principals in Derby trials at Chester and Goodwood. Aidan O’Brien, who has a 
fine record in this race with four successes in the past nine years, saddles 
three. Landofhopeandglory is the mount of Ryan Moore and therefore appears the 
number one from Ballydoyle but hasn’t won since his maiden and looks slow.

Seamie Heffernan has been handed a nine-day whip ban for his winning ride on 
Brave Anna in the Albany Stakes.
 
Talented but fragile, Elite Army tries for an impressive double, having won a 
differentRoyal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> handicap 
over this distance two years ago, since when he has raced just twice. He proved 
his liking for this track when bagging a Listed race last month. His best form 
has been on a fast surface and his only attempt on soft going became one of his 
two defeats. Kings Fete is another fancied runner who hasn’t been seen much, 
running fifth of eight last month on his first try since 2014, which wouldn’t 
encourage me. Cymro and Kinema have the necessary talent but are both drawn 
very wide. First Sitting, with a new stable this year, achieved a career peak 
last time, albeit in a much smaller field.
 
French trainer Jean Claude Rouget wins his second Coronation Stakes in as many 
years, having triumphed with Ervedya 12 months ago. Ryan Moore will be cursing 
his luck as he got caught up in serious traffic problems. We can only speculate 
over the likely outcome if he’d had a clear run, but I suspect nothing would 
have beaten Qemah today.

Rarely has a seven-figure payment for a horse been tested for value quite so 
quickly. Jet Setting fetched £1.3m on Monday evening after her Irish Guineas 
success last month, when she pipped the mighty Minding. Can she do it again on 
this drier surface, without a long and galloping straight to help her grind 
down her rivals? I’m betting against it but then who to choose? Could it be 
Nemoralia, a rocket that might not spark if there’s still too much juice in the 
ground? Qemah or Czabo, who will relish any moisture that remains? Marenko, who 
is growing into herself but hasn’t run on turf this year? I’ll give another 
chance to the 20-1 shot Tanaza, who seemed to need the run when tiring into 
seventh behind Jet Setting last time. She has seemed to have plenty of quality 
in the past and her stable has burst into form lately.

Looking disappointed, but sounding extremely dignified in defeat, the trainer 
of Kachy is at a loss to explain why his charge drifted across the track on to 
the stands rail only to lose by a whisker. He’s baffled by the horse’s antics, 
but says he’d rather lose the race to his good friend Karl Burke than anyone 
else. “Drop him back to five with a pair of blinkers on,” is his rueful 
suggestion as to what to do with Kachy next.

Across The Stars bounced back from a disappointing run in the Derby to win the 
King Edward VII Stakes atRoyal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot>. Having finished only 10th at 
Epsom behind Harzand, he perhaps did not have as hard a race as some there as 
once his chance had gone he was allowed to coast home.

Frankie Dettori was booked by Sir Michael Stoute for the colt and had him in 
the perfect position, just behind Ryan Moore who tried to make all on Beacon 
Rock. Across The Stars was keen enough in the early stages, but Dettori, riding 
full of confidence, has few peers in getting them to settle.

His mount had to be brave to get through a narrow gap between Beacon Rock and 
Choreographer and while he took a narrow lead, Beacon Rock would not give in 
lightly.
Stoute, who has an excellent record in the race, will have liked the way his 
charge stuck to his task and the 7-1 winner kept the Ballydoyle runner at bay 
by a length and a quarter.

John Gosden’s Muntahaa made eyecatching late gains from the rear to claim 
third.
“To win the ‘Ascot Derby’ is great,” said Dettori. “Michael has been hitting 
the crossbar and I’m pleased to get him a winner. He’s a master trainer and he 
had this horse well prepared for today. He didn’t come down the hill at Epsom, 
(but) he handled this track really well and we won.”

Just the second running of this top-class sprint for three-year-olds, 
featuring a lot of horses who showed talent last year but have yet to show 
they’re quite so good this summer. Illuminate was well beaten in the Guineas 
but that mile was never going to be her trip. Still, it’s starting to feel like 
a long time since she showed her best form. Waterloo Bridge won the Norfolk at
Royal Ascot <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> last year, while 
Washington Bridge won the Windsor Castle but only Washington DC has shown a 
comparable level of form this year. Quiet Reflection is the likely favourite, 
the winner of five of her six starts, and her cannonball Group Two win at 
Haydock last time looks the best recent form on offer. Donjuan Triumphant, 
second that day, is trying to make up a four-length deficit.

Brave Anna defied her lengthy odds to win the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-ascot> for Aidan O’Brien. O’Brien also 
supplied the 2-1 favourite for the race in Cuff but the Ryan Moore-ridden filly 
could not quicken in the final furlong.

Having missed the break Brave Anna and Seamie Heffernan had plenty of ground 
to make up on the likes of Create A Dream and Sea Of Snow, but the daughter of 
War Front knuckled down well. She had to live up to her name close home, as 
Ralph Beckett’s Bletchley and Richard Fahey’s Frankel filly Queen Kindly made 
her pull out all the stops.

The 16-1 winner crossed the line just a short head in front of Bletchley, with 
half a length back to Queen Kindly. It was a third RoyalAscot 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ascot> winner for Heffernan, who is a 
crucial part of the Ballydoyle operation.

The winner is a full-sister to the same owner’s Breeders’ Cup winner Hit It A 
Bomb.
“She’s a lovely filly and came here on the back of a good win at the Curragh,” 
said Heffernan. “It’s nice we can pitch up here on the big day and win again. 
“Aidan told me to give her a chance and hopefully she’d finish out well and 
that’s what she’s done.”

A poor man’s Derby, this is a mile and a half Group Two for three-year-old 
males. The standout talent is rather hard to locate, suggesting this is not a 
quality renewal. Beacon Rock has some workmanlike form to his name but offers 
little prospect of progress on his eighth start. Humphrey Bogart stayed on to 
be fifth in the Derby and must be a strong contender. Perhaps Choreographer can 
improve past him, though, having had no luck in running when a fair seventh in 
the Dante on just his second start. Carntop, owned by the Prince of Wales, was 
a close second to Humphrey Bogart at Lingfield in May and should be capable of 
better, though he may still need more time to mature.
