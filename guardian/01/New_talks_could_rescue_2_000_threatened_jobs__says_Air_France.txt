, the chief executive of its parent company said on Sunday.

 The job cuts in 2016 would be voluntary and heavier job losses in 2017 could 
be avoided if talks with unions led to an agreement on alternative savings 
measures by the beginning of 2016, said Alexandre de Juniac, chief of Air 
France-KLM. The airline earlier this month presented a programme involving job 
losses and flight cutbacks after failing to get pilots to sign up to 
productivity measures that would have involved working more hours for the same 
pay.

managers had their clothes ripped

. Some commentators said the violent scenes could potentially hurt French 
government efforts to boost investment and bring down unemployment.
