A group of amateur gardeners have lost a high court battle to prevent their 
allotments being built over, which they hoped would help protect green spaces 
across the country from development.

Gardeners at Farm Terrace allotments in Watford believed that a favourable 
ruling would save not only their own allotments but other similar sites under 
threat.

However, after Mrs Justice Lang ruled on Wednesday that Watford borough 
council and the secretary of state for communities and local government – who 
backed the local authority’s plans – were entitled to concrete over them, the 
gardeners warned that her judgment was a “developer’s charter”.

The claimants who had fought off two previous attempts by the council to 
develop the site, said in a statement: “We feel that at every stage where we 
have won the rules have been changed to make it increasingly difficult for us. 
This judgment is, in our view, a developer’s charter for development on any 
allotment site and in particular threatens urban allotments that have become 
targets for redevelopment, which makes us extremely worried about the 
ramifications of this case for all allotments.”

Despite being “bitterly disappointed”, they said that, after consultation with 
their legal team, they had decided not to appeal against the judgment, which 
will pave the way for the building of housing, a car park for the town’s 
football club and a possible future hospital development.

Watford’s elected mayor, Dorothy Thornhill, who had previously described the 
allotments as “a really hideous, derelict site”

, welcomed the decision, tweeting: “Great news for our hospital and our town.”

A year ago, the high court overturned a decision by the then communities 
secretary Eric Pickles, which would have allowed the 128 allotments to be dug 
up. But Watford council then launched aa third bid to develop the site 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/09/farm-terrace-allotment-holders-launch-campaign-to-save-nations-plots>
, giving the remaining 24 allotment holders three months notice on 4 July, with 
financial compensation of £1,000 if they were giving up their tenancy, or £750 
if they were moving to another site.


Under the 1925 Allotments <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/allotments>
 Act, councils can build on allotment sites only if stringent rules are 
followed, but the government updated guidance in 2014 granting the secretary of 
state power to allow development of allotments in “exceptional circumstances”.

At the hearing on 21 October, the gardeners had argued that those two words 
indicated a “strong presumption against the grant of consent” but that 
interpretation was rejected by Lang. The council had argued that the allotments 
needed to be removed in order to address the town’s “acute” housing crisis and 
the communities secretary highlighted the benefits of the regeneration scheme.

In a written judgment, Lang ruled that “the interference with the ... rights 
of the allotment holders was justified and proportionate because of the wider 
public benefits to be gained”.

The gardeners said after the judgment that “there is no clear benchmark for 
what is actually exceptional. We feel the term can and will be applied to close 
other allotment sites throughout the country and we are being made aware almost 
every week that a new allotment site is under threat of closure for 
development.”

In a freedom of information request 
<https://homefarmer.co.uk/save-all-allotments/>, Save All Allotments found that 
between 2007 and 2014, 194 of 198 applications to close allotments were granted 
by the secretary of state.

The number of allotment holders at Farm Terrace had dwindled in recent years 
after some people took the compensation and the 2012 closure of the waiting 
list.
