Ash <https://www.theguardian.com/music/ash> have clearly had enough time off. 
The band have announced their return from a two-year break â€“ and are to release 
26 new singles over the course of one year.

Ash's A-Z singles series marks the group's first new work since announcing in 
2007 that Twilight of the Innocents would be their "last album". "The way 
people listen to music has changed," frontman Tim Wheeler said at the time. 
"With the advent of the download the emphasis has reverted to single tracks."

With A-Z, Ash will release a new single every fortnight over one year. Each 
single will represent a letter of the alphabet, and all will be available as 
downloads, CDs and limited-edition vinyl. "There's a great Andy Warhol quote 
about how waiting for something makes it more exciting," Wheeler told NME this 
week. "I think it'll be great for our fans waiting every two weeks knowing 
they're going to get a song and wondering what it'll be like. It'll be fun."

The singles will be on sale in shops, and offered as a subscription on Ash's 
website <http://www.ash-official.com/> starting 9 June.

Most of the songs were recorded over the last year at Ash's Atomic Heart 
studio in New York City. And the band had at least one track left over, Return 
of White Rabbit, which has now been released as a free promotional download.

The first official single of the series, A, will be released in October.
