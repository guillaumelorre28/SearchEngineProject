Audioboo <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audioboo> initially launched 
for iPhone and now has a web interface, social media tools and Android app, and 
has also created a premium, professional service licence by the Open 
University, Royal Opera House and the British Library, which us the tool for 
its Soundmap project.

The tool has recorded 120,000 app downloads, with high-profile users including

Audioboo founder and chief executive Mark Rock said the deal will mean the 
firm can "rapidly experiment and develop our ideas about how audio content will 
function, feel and make money in the future".

"We are also very fortunate that Don has accepted a role as chairman. His 
experience of turning opportunities into significant businesses will be key to 
our future success." 

Audioboo has also been added as a feature on some models of Imagination 
Technologies's Pure radios. "Innovation around audio and the web has all been 
about music," said Rock. "This is an experiment to connect people who create 
audio with people who listen to traditional radio."

The deal also sees former Orange, Vodafone and One2one executive Bruce Akhurst 
join Audioboo's board after joining the firm as chief commercial officer.

AudioBoo was one of the first projects to be funded by 4ip 
<http://www.4ip.org.uk/2009/04/audioboo-the-story-so-far/>, Channel 4's 
technology innovation fund; 4ip's investment has now been converted into equity 
in the firm.

 "Audioboo has been a flagship project for us," said 4ip's digital 
commissioner Daniel Heaf. "Our remit to support new creative talent working in 
digital media helps companies like Audioboo realise their dreams of bringing an 
innovative product to market, demonstrating audience and commercial traction 
and raising investment to take the business further."
