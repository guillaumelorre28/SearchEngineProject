A lovely fresh dish that you could also serve up as a starter if you fancy 
trying something different. You can use chanterelle, cantaloupe or galia 
melons, but make sure they're perfectly ripe. This is best served really 
chilled.

Serves 6

2 melons
2 tbsp honey
Juice of 2 lemons
150ml unsweetened apple juice
½ bunch basil, finely chopped
A handful of mint leaves
A tub of lemon sorbet

1. Peel the melons, remove all the seeds and chop into small chunks. Place the 
pieces in a blender with the honey and lemon juice.

2. Blend the melon until it forms a puree, adding a little apple juice if it 
feels too thick.

3. Chill until cold, then serve the soup in bowls with a scoop of lemon sorbet 
and a sprinkling of basil and mint leaves.
