It's 50 years since the premiere of Shelagh Delaney's groundbreaking play 
about life for working-class teenager, Jo, living with her alcoholic mother in 
Salford in the 1950s and grabbing happiness wherever she can find it. Delaney 
was in her teens when she wrote A Taste Of Honey and, although she never wrote 
another play as good, this was way ahead of its time and fearless in its 
depiction of female sexuality, mother-daughter relationships, and the lack of 
choices facing its young protagonist, who finds herself unmarried and pregnant. 
The play's kitchen-sink realism may seem old hat in this era of TV soaps but it 
still has the power to shock and move, as it reminds of a time not so long ago 
when women's lives were very different and the fact that some teenagers today 
still lead lives where a lack of social and educational opportunities limits 
their choices.
