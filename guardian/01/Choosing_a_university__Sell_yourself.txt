Personal statements <https://www.theguardian.com/education/personal-statement> 
can cause endless woe for university hopefuls. Not only do you need to persuade 
a university that you are passionate, intelligent and better than other 
candidates, you only have 4,000 characters to play with.

"It's like a speed date with a university," says Anya Fellow, a second-year 
English and film studies student at Bangor University. "You get very few words 
to try and express who you are and why you're worth the risk."

If you're struggling to start, careers adviser Hannah Morton-Hedges says half 
an hour's brainstorming could help. "Think about why you are applying for your 
subject and what you have learned from your current studies.

"Admissions tutors want to see that you're genuinely interested in your 
subject. Show that you've read around your field, and be original."

It can be a good idea to include a bit of non-academic information. 
"I referred to extracurricular activities and included my plans for the 
future," says Fellows. "I want to be a teacher in media and English, so showing 
how the course would benefit my future helped."

On the whole it's best to stick to your academic interests. Hannah 
Morton-Hedges says it should be lively, but focused. "Don't just go straight 
into a list of key skills: think carefully about what you're including – and 
only include relevant extra-curricular activities."

David Henson, head of music theatre at the London College of Music also 
advises against cliche: "It's no good saying 'I've always wanted to do X ever 
since I was six' – get down to the nitty-gritty of why you are suitable and 
worthy."

And, finally don't forget to proofread your statement several times. "It's 
very easy to make spelling or grammatical errors, but to tutors this will look 
careless."
