In 1975, the Swiss ethnomusicologist Marcel Cellier released recordings of an 
obscure Bulgarian choir. For a decade it remained an academic oddity until 
Bauhaus' Peter Murphy stumbled across a cassette and recommended it to Ivo 
Watts-Russell of the indie label 4AD. Russell tracked down and licensed the 
original tapes, repackaging them in 1986 as Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares. The 
casually forthright female vocals, haunting glissandos and dissonant harmonies 
struck a chord with millions: a world tour and Grammy followed.
