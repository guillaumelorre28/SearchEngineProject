 Applications for undergraduate American studies have fallen 13% in a year, to 
barely 3,500 for this academic year.
The subject has one of the highest proportions of its graduates in low-grade 
jobs or unemployed after graduation. But there is speculation the drop has more 
to do with antipathy to the US.

Some of around 50 universities offering the subject have cut back or dropped 
it. London University this month merged itsAmerican studies

departments into an Institute for the Study of the Americas, embracing Canada 
and the Caribbean. And like Oxford's Rothermere Institute, it offers only 
postgraduate study.

James Dunkerly, a professor at the London institute, said: "It's plausible 
there has been a reaction against America. After all, there were a million 
demonstrating against the war last year ... I think it is too early to tell - 
I'd expect any serious backlash to take longer."
