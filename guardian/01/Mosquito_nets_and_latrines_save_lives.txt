The thatched hut on the fringes of the settlement doesn't look big enough to 
house five people, but appearances can be deceptive. With her mother away at 
the market Netanet Awoke, 23, bashfully takes charge, alongside brothers 
Dagnet, 18, and 13-year-old Degsera; inside, baby Tiwon, two, is fast asleep.

In poor farming communities such as Aschekeri, a kebele in Amhara region, 
northern Ethiopia, health services are often impossibly far away and it can be 
difficult to keep disease at bay. Dagnet's face falls as he remembers his 
father. "He died 10 years ago, from malaria," he says quietly.

But things in the village have improved dramatically with the arrival of two 
HEWs, who have not only introduced essential healthcare and insecticide-treated 
mosquito nets, but have also raised awareness about issues such as waste 
disposal, ventilation and personal hygiene.

Netanet happily demonstrates the facilities her household now enjoys thanks to 
the HEWs' interventions. There are designated waste disposal areas, and cooking 
takes place outside to avoid smoke filling the house and causing respiratory 
and eye problems.

There is also a basic latrine: 45% of rural Ethiopian households have no 
toilet facility, so this is especially important for women such as Netanet, who 
would previously have waited forÂ the privacy of darkness to use a nearby field.

"Before we had these facilities, there were too many flies around, which used 
to infest our food," she says. "There was also a bad smell from defecating in 
the open air. But now that's gone we have a better environment and we are very 
happy."
