Somewhere inside us all is the child who never grows. That truest part of 
ourselves, free to dream before adulthood shapes us, bends us to the will and 
ignorance and expectations of others. Before, as Wordsworth said, “the shades 
of the prison house descend on the growing boy”.

Stan Grant: I can tell you how Adam Goodes feels. Every Indigenous person has 
felt it

Away back in time in a small New South Wales town a skinny, loose-limbed, 
brown-skinned boy dreamed of playing soccer for his country. The round ball was 
never out of his hand. It had been his one constant as he trudged from town to 
town, the uncertainty of life hanging heavily over his fractured family.


He had moved with his mother and younger brothers, fleeing a marriage in 
tatters, and the ghosts of the past buried deep in the troubled racial history 
of this country.


But he had a ball; he had a place he could escape to in his mind when all else 
failed him. And he had a dream that this round ball could take him away from it 
all.


Adam Goodes <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-goodes> never did become a 
soccer player. He grew tall and strong and the ball changed shape but his dream 
never dimmed. And he realised that dream, becoming one of the greatest 
Australian Rules footballers of his generation.


It is a greatness measured, as sport gauges greatness, in numbers: twice a 
Brownlow medallist – the AFL’s player of the year; two times a premiership 
winner; four times an all-Australian; and a member of the Indigenous team of 
the century.

But these numbers tell only a part of this story. There are other numbers: 3% 
of the population yet 25% of prison inmates; 10 years – the average gap in life 
expectancy between black and white Australians; 50,000 – the estimated number 
of children who were the stolen generations.


It is these numbers that more accurately measure the life of Adam Goodes, 
these numbers that haunt him.


These numbers hint at a deeper story of sacrifice and loneliness, of 
questioning and wondering. Who am I? Where do I belong? What does it mean to be 
black in Australia?


Today Adam is a footballer no more 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/19/sydney-swans-champion-adam-goodes-announces-retirement-from-afl>
. The rhythm and routine of training, eating and sleeping will give way to new 
uncertainty. But as he closes his eyes he will see that boy with a ball still. 
He will see himself as a black man still. And he will ponder those questions 
that remain unanswered still.


Adam and I came together this year for the National Indigenous Television 
program Awaken. We were two Indigenous men who have wrestled with the 
contradictions of our country and Australia’s legacy of racism.


We bonded over a pain shared, an estrangement from our nation – separated by 
skin and history from our fellow Australians but, we had to admit, sitting 
sometimes uneasily too among our own people.


Both us have led lives on the move. My family shifted constantly; my parents 
outrunning poverty and the oppression of Aboriginal missions; staying one step 
ahead of welfare officers; looking for that new job, new town, new beginning: a 
life of constant reinvention.


Nearly 20 years separates Adam and me, but our journeys have followed similar 
paths. I heard him when he told me of his search for identity. I saw him in all 
those small towns, moving on and on with his mother and brothers: looking for 
that place to belong.


“Mum left Dad when I was about 10,” he told me. “We moved from Adelaide to 
Wallaro and sort of kept moving around. We went to about five or six different 
primary schools growing up: three different high schools. We were never sort of 
stuck in any one spot.”

Adam’s mother, Lisa-May, had been searching all her life. Yes, she was 
Aboriginal, clearly she looked black, but what did it mean?


He told me of her broken past. She was taken from her family; stolen, if you 
like. Part of those generations lost. Here was the great Australian prophecy 
that black kids, with just enough white in them, could be civilised and 
“Christianised”, saved from the predicted doomed fate of their forebears.


Assimilation was a policy that would absorb these remnants of Aboriginal 
society into the commonwealth. Absorption until there was no more sign of them.


We know of the tragic outcome of that misguided – some say well-intentioned – 
policy. These were lives crushed by an unbearable whiteness. Children raised in 
homes but too often not really part of families and lost to the families that 
first gave them their names.


In 2008 the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, apologised for his nation’s 
treatment of these children 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/13/australia>, what he called “this 
blemished chapter in our nation’s history”.


The apology helped ease pain. Just the fact of acknowledgement, just to say 
this happened and we are sorry cauterised an open wound. But the lives of 
people like Lisa-May were by then irrevocably shaped and too often damaged. 
These were people who would never get home again.

Growing up, I knew I was different. I knew I was Aboriginal. I just didn’t 
know what it meant to be Aboriginal
Adam Goodes 
Lisa-May searched and took her boys with her. One broken marriage was followed 
by another and there was violence. Adam told me of the nights of restless 
sleep, hoping the arguments would stop, of his little brothers’ fears.


“Hearing them fight all the time, it was quite annoying and I know my younger 
brothers were scared by it,” he said. “I saw it as a way to stop them fighting 
by sneaking out and calling the police.”


Adam now campaigns against family violence as an ambassador for White Ribbon 
Day.


He campaigns too for reconciliation. But it is also part of a personal quest 
to understand his mother and her pain and answer the question that has always 
gnawed at him: who am I?


“Growing up, I knew I was different,” he said. “I knew I was Aboriginal. I 
just didn’t know what it meant to be Aboriginal.”


We all find our identity in different ways. All communities are to some degree 
imagined. We meet ourselves in stories that make sense of our past and in these 
same stories we see each other.


As a boy I had a family strong in its sense of itself and parents who filled 
my imagination with the funny and sad stories of just being black. This was 
history as healing, in the words of the French writer Michel De Certeau, 
history “construed as the gesture of new beginning”.

I at least had that. Adam looked to his mother for answers she just did not 
have. “There was obviously no culture, no language, no cultural practices,” he 
told me. “Even just connection to my other Aboriginal family members was really 
hard.”

His father was white and, even though he was no longer around, it marked him 
as different among other black people. They called him “coconut” – brown on the 
outside but white on the inside.


Lisa-May did have an answer for that. She told him to ignore the taunts, stay 
in school, get an education. “You’re bettering yourself,” she said. “In 10 
years’ time you will come back here and they will still be doing the same 
thing.”


And Adam told me his mother lived by example. A woman who had been removed 
from her family would not let the welfare men get her boys.


“She made all these sacrifices and made sure we went to school and had lunch 
packed and breakfast before we left,” he said. “There was no doubt she was 
thinking that she didn’t want the government to come and take her kids away, 
and that was the one thing she was going to give us boys: a better opportunity.”


Adam spoke of a love for Lisa-May that mirrors mine for my mother. As my 
mother sacrificed for me, his took every step with him to school, took every 
kick on the footy field and, when the time came, packed his bags, drove him to 
the airport and told him to come home with a premiership.


Here was the dream of a boy with a ball. On the field everything fell away, 
all those questions receded at least just for that moment, that moment when 
instinct triumphed over intellect.


Adam knew he played his best football when he was instinctive, in the moment.

fairest player, in 2003. Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP 
The Sydney Swans <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sydney-swans> saw the 
talent and the potential and they saw the man the boy could become. But it 
wasn’t easy. Football, yes. But this was more than football.


At the Swans, talent was only part of the equation. This was a club with a 
famous “no dickheads” policy. Adam excelled on the field but he admits now to 
being lazy, not mentally tough enough, not prepared to make sacrifices for his 
gift.


After what he thought was a great season, he was left out of the club’s 
leadership group. His teammates – his peers – had voted and they didn’t include 
him.


Adam told me how that cut him. But it made him grow up. He decided to front 
the coaches and ask what he needed to do. They told him he was inconsistent; 
they wanted to hear his voice – hear him challenge other players and himself.


He didn’t need to be told twice. The next year he was voted the best player in 
the AFL: a prestigious Brownlow medallist. He made the leadership group and has 
remained there ever since.


But off the field his journey of identity continued. The questions of 
childhood remained. Adam began a diploma of Aboriginal studies, deepening his 
knowledge of history and politics.


Again, I know this path. I came to university in Sydney at an age similar to 
when Adam came to the Swans. I filled my mind with a new history, books with 
titles like Outcasts in White Australia. I filled my vocabulary with new words: 
ethnocentrism, social Darwinism, genocide.


It made me angry. It made me question how this country could do this to my 
people. It answered the question of my childhood: what put us here?


And Adam told me he grew angry too.

“That really was a sad, sad journey learning about Aboriginal history and 
massacres, and youth suicide and health problems and employment problems,” he 
said. “There was a time I was really angry at people who were not Aboriginal 
and I really had problems dealing with it.”


Adam looked to others for guidance. Michael O’Loughlin was a fellow Swans 
player and he was family. They discovered they were cousins. O’Loughlin was 
assured in his identity. He knew how to live as a black man in a white world, 
he was comfortable in his success and understood the pressures of football.

Anger can be energy and Adam now used it to motivate himself. Where his mother 
had limited opportunities, he would touch the sky.


His speed and anticipation and his ability to soar above the heads of other 
players thrilled football fans. He delivered that promised premiership to his 
mother and added another. He won a second Brownlow medal.


Adam was in every way an assimilated man. He said so. “I am mainstream 
Australia,” he said, “whether I am Indigenous or not.”


He was comfortable in his world and had come to a peace – however uneasy – 
with his skin and his history.


But Australia is never a comfortable place for Indigenous people, not really. 
My eyes, once opened, could not be closed. How could I forget the brutality of 
the Australian frontier, the injustice and discrimination that marooned my 
people at the bottom of every socioeconomic indicator?


I found liberation outside this country. I lived and worked abroad for more 
than a decade. In countries like Britain, China, Pakistan and the United Arab 
Emirates I met people just as a human being freed from the baggage of my 
history.


I returned to an Australia still fighting old battles. Still bound in old 
attitudes. Still harbouring a deep, festering racism. For all the goodwill, the 
apologies and reconciliation, the wounds of our history could tear open at any 
moment.


On 24 May 2013 Adam Goodes, assimilated Aboriginal man, came face to face with 
a bigotry rooted in the Australian imagination.


It came from a 13-year-old girl but it echoed from a darker time, in attitudes 
formed about Aboriginal people at first glance. Here were a people, to 
18th-century European eyes, barely human. My ancestors were at best deemed the 
lowest rung on civilisation’s ladder.


I am mainstream Australia, whether I am Indigenous or not
Adam Goodes 
People so primitive and savage, with more in common with brutes, could have no 
rights at law. The land was deemed empty – Terra Nullius – and seized for the 
British crown.


Now on a football field in Melbourne, Adam was branded an ape.


This was another chapter in a game with a sordid racial history. A former 
CollingwoodAFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> club president, Allan 
McAlister, once said Aboriginal people were welcome at his club as long as they 
conducted themselves like white people.

Adam’s sport had opened its doors; black footballers make up nearly 10% of AFL 
playing rosters. But attitudes like McAlister’s were embedded in the game’s 
culture.


This is the game that drove the St Kilda star Nicky Winmar in 1993 to lift his 
shirt and point to his skin in defiance of racial taunts.


Two years later the Essendon player Michael Long protested at racial taunts 
from a rival, Damian Monkhorst. His stand forced the AFL to change its rules, 
introducing an anti-vilification policy. He and Monkhorst forged a friendship 
and campaigned to change attitudes.


Goodes may have thought those battles had been fought and won. He was wrong.


He took a stand and was praised. In 2014 he was named Australian of the Year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/25/adam-goodes-wins-australian-year>
. Now, here was a platform to speak of our shared past, to work for 
reconciliation, but one that was built on a recognition of the suffering of 
people like his mother.

Adam Goodes was no longer jumper No 37, Sydney Swans footballer. This was a 
new strident, provocative man who mixed politics and sport – that oil and water 
of Australian society – and the mood turned.


Then in the winter of 2015, Australia turned to face itself. What started as a 
jeer in a corner of a stadium grew to a crescendo of boos. Week after week, 
Goodes faced this maddening chorus.


What drove it? We don’t like him, some said. He stages for penalties, he’s a 
cheat, said others. But there was something more sinister here.


There was a line between Goodes and the 13-year-old girl and the ape taunt and 
this vocal lynching. Goodes had moved beyond his station: he was a blackfella 
with a voice talking to a country that didn’t like what it heard.


Perhaps he was guilty of some poor judgment, some missteps. He was feeling his 
way through a complicated, contradictory maze of personal pain and national 
history.


But now, the man who had scaled the heights of his game – who had won every 
accolade it had to offer – now retreated, broken.


Australians could no longer look away from this mirror, what this showed to 
us. This was no longer a story of politics. The front page had moved to the 
back, the part of the newspaper so many of us read first. This was a story we 
read in the grandstands and we could no longer ignore it.


At the height of the furore I wrote cautiously and I hope tenderly about my 
country 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/30/i-can-tell-you-how-adam-goodes-feels-every-indigenous-person-has-felt-it>
. I wrote of a country that in so many ways is the envy of the world: 
prosperous, peaceful and tolerant. I wrote of a country of many faces that had 
welcomed people from many lands but still could not make peace with the history 
of the first peoples of this land.


I could not speak to what drove the booing. I could only speak to how this 
made us –Indigenous Australians 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/indigenous-australians> – feel. I 
wrote of how we heard a howl of humiliation. A howl that echoed across two 
centuries of dispossession, injustice and suffering.

Australians manned their barricades, some genuinely perplexed and saddened. 
Others outraged that this country could even be accused of racism.


Some in the media painted Adam as the villain. They twisted his words and 
accused him of humiliating the 13-year-old who vilified him. He did no such 
thing. He was a victim, they said. He played the race card. Toughen up, they 
said. Get over it.

We hear this a lot. History is in the past, bad things happened, but it is 
time to move on. But history is not past for us. It is a living thing. It is 
physical. It is in the scars on the bodies of black people like my father. It 
is in the mental wounds of people like Adam’s mother.

We can touch our history. Adam does every time he hugs Lisa-May, the woman who 
was taken from her family and who sacrificed all to raise her children in one 
small country town after another.
