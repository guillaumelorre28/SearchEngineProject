Blackfella, Whitefella.
Yellowfella, any fella.
It doesn’t matter, what your colour.
As long as you a true fella.

Rarely were words performed so convincingly and exhilaratingly as when the 
Womad New Plymouth hosted Indigenous Australian rocker George Rrurrambu in 
2005. Early Saturday morning on the festival’s most intimate stage, the former 
Warumpi Band frontman interacted bracingly with the audience, singing 
passionately about reconciliation and togetherness, always looking the audience 
square in the eye. Blackfella/Whitefella’s crisp drum intro and blistering 
guitar riffs had even a hopeless dance-phobic like myself moving.

Warumpi Band sang in Luritja of Australia’s Western Desert (although Rrurrambu 
hailed from Arnhem Land’s Elcho Island), and became the first band to perform 
rock’n’roll in an Aboriginal language. The Yolgnu lead singer was inspired by 
rock music pioneer Chuck Berry, and American rhythm and blues. The kind of 
music that went “straight from the heart to the people,” as Rrurrambu (also now 
known as George Burarrwanga or GRB) put it, in the moving 2013 documentaryBig

Rrurrambu co-wrote Blackfella/Whitefella with whitefella songwriter and 
guitarist Neil Murray, a Victorian who arrived at the Warumpi community as a 
teacher. Murray found camaraderie in the Butcher Tjapanangka brothers – bassist 
Sammy and drummer Gordon – with Rrurrambu (Sammy’s brother-in-law) rounding out 
the band lineup on lead vocals and didgeridoo.

 Warumpi Band’s first track was 1983’s Jailanguru Pakarnu (Out From Jail), 
which established their emancipatory, upbeat philosophy. Many other great songs 
followed, such as the livelyWarumpinya 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3RAPV7p-nc> or Kintorelakutu 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEMtNGUdutU>, but it was 
Blackfella/Whitefella, from debut album Big Name, No Blankets two years later, 
that would go on to leave a lasting legacy on the Australian musical landscape 
and beyond. Blackfella/Whitefella was most powerful in the band’s dynamiclive 
performances <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_DHwp5vYBI> and a second version 
of the song on third album Too Much Humbug fared better in capturing their 
stage energy.

Warumpi Band and their Powderworks labelmates Midnight Oil toured Australia 
together in 1986. Charismatic frontmen Rrurrambu and Midnight Oil’s Peter 
Garrett excelled, playing free gigs at remote Aboriginal communities, such as 
Rrurrambu’s homeland in north-east Arnhem Land. The experience became a major 
influence on the Oils’ 1987 album Diesel and Dust and its historic land rights 
anthemBeds are Burning <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejorQVy3m8E>.

And so, before John Howard refused to say sorry, long before Kevin Rudd’s 
apology, it was Blackfella/Whitefella that fired up reconciliation.

Warumpi Band never received the recognition they deserved from mainstream 
Australian culture, but did pave the way for other Aboriginal musicians such as
Yothu Yindi

 andGurrumul <https://www.theguardian.com/music/geoffrey-gurrumul-yunupingu>, 
and Christine Anu, who closed the Sydney Olympics in 2000 with acover 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSFGK9HlEto> of Warumpi Band’s My Island Home 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vEntK3fwp8>. Rrurrambu also inspired varied 
Aboriginal artists like Warwick Thornton, director of the stylish 2009 film
Samson and Delilah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/apr/11/samson-and-delilah-rewatching-classic-australian-films>
. 

It was with great sadness that Australia’s artistic community learned of 
Rrurrambu’s death, aged 50, of cancer, just two years after that memorable 
Womad performance. But not unlike Berry, who at 88 still performs monthly at St 
Louis’s Blueberry Hill, Rrurrambu’s music and his furtive cry to “stand up and 
be counted” on Blackfella/Whitefella remains rousing and timeless.
