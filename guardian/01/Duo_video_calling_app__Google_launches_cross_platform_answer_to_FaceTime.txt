Google has finally launched Duo, its super-simple video calling app for 
Android and iOS, after the company first announced itthree months ago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/19/google-io-2016-what-you-need-to-know-from-allo-to-daydream>
 at its I/O developer conference.


The app, which is only available for smartphones, is the latest in a long line 
ofGoogle <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google> services capable of 
conducting video calling, but is this time designed to simplify the process.

It is a one-to-one video chat app and Google’s direct rival to Apple’s 
FaceTime (which is built into all iPhones, iPads and Macs), rather than a more 
comprehensive video conferencing solution such as Microsoft’sSkype 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/skype> or Google’s Hangouts.

Amit Fulay, Google’s group manager for communications, said: “Users are 
reluctant to video call because they don’t know if the other person is on the 
right network, the right device or it’s a good time to call. We’ve tried to 
remove all that friction and make it feel like an invitation, not an 
interruption when someone call’s you.


“Duo is all about simplicity and quality. It’s all about video calling. There 
are no frills, no knobs or dials to adjust, it just works.”

Duo seamlessly switches between mobile broadband and Wi-Fi without dropping 
the call, provides the so-called Knock Knock live feed of the caller before the 
recipient picks up as the phone rings and has a one-tap call button to jump 
straight into a video call.

 Duo hopes to remove friction and make video calling a one-tap affair.

The app is one of the company’s first that does not require a user to have a 
Google account to use it, instead asking them to register and find users via 
their phone number rather than Gmail address. It follows a trend established by 
the likes of Facebook’s WhatsApp, which instead of creating a new user ID or 
pin, relied solely on a user’s phone number. As a consequence, WhatsApp will 
also only work on a smartphone.

Facebook also recently let users sign into its Messenger app using only a 
phone number, without requiring a full Facebook account, allowing users to chat 
with others via their phone numberinstead. Facebook Messenger also has voice 
and video calling.

Fulay said: “The chances of you having your close friends and family’s phone 
number is much higher than having a specific account, so using the phone number 
makes it easier.”

Whether users will be tempted away from the likes of Facebook Messenger, 
FaceTime and Google’s own Hangouts in any serious number remains to be seen. A 
video calling app, just like any other messaging or social media app, is only 
as good as the number of friends and contacts who use it.

Duo’s success will likely be linked with how many Android smartphones come 
with it pre-installed. Hangouts is one of the 11 apps that Google insists come 
pre-installed on every Android smartphone or tablet that has access to the Play 
Store. But Microsoft’s recent moves with certain smartphone manufacturers, 
including the world’s biggest Android device manufacturer, Samsung, has seen a 
handful of its apps including Skype pre-loaded on manyAndroid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android> smartphones.

If Duo becomes one of the required apps from Google, it could displace the 
competition as the default video calling app on Android smartphones, which may 
be enough to convince iPhone users to install it.

While the distinction might be lost on consumers and users of Google’s 
plethora of communications apps, many of which seem to do the same thing, Duo 
and theyet to be released text messaging app Allo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/google-allo-messaging-app-encryption-apple-fbi>
, are part of the company’s mobile-consumer orientated push.

Google sees Hangouts as part of its enterprise and productivity solution, 
integrating with calendar and email and employed by Google Apps users. 
Meanwhile, a third Google arm is working a system for therich communications 
services <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services> (RCS) 
standard that is currently under development from the telecoms industry body, 
GSMA, which is destined to replace SMS and MMS messaging services.

Google is facing antitrust charges 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/20/eu-commission-google-android-skew-market-competition-antitrust-vestager>
 from the European commission, accused of abusing its market dominance with 
Android and itsrequirement of device manufacturers to install 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/20/google-android-european-commission>
 Gmail, Google Chrome, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Search and six other apps 
on smartphones and tablets with access to the Google Play Store. It remains to 
be seen how another app that directly competes with third-party services will 
be viewed by Europe if Google insists it is pre-loaded on Android phones.
