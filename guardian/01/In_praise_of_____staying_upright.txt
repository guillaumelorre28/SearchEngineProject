It can happen so easily to the professional footballer. One minute they're on 
the ball at full tilt but perfectly balanced, with that top-class player's feel 
for where trouble might come from – and then, oof! The merest nudge, a tug, a 
puff of wind … and they've lost their balance and find themselves less full 
tilt and more flat-out. Pity the poor referee who has to distinguish between 
the genuine foul and its outlaw cousin, the dive. Except that in the digital 
age, half the fans have moving pictures of just what happened and can replay 
them frame by frame. So can the pundits in the TV studio. So surely should the 
referee. That's what Manchester United manager David Moyes – currently

. It can't change the result but, even if it has to be applied retrospectively, 
where appeals to morality seem to fail, a stiff fine might be the best way to 
stop the cheating.
