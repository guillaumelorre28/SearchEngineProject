Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish <https://www.theguardian.com/film/joe-cornish> are 
returning to host their BBC 6 Music Saturday morning show early next month 
after a hiatus lasting more than a year.

Buxton and Cornish will initially be back for a 12-week run in the 10am-1pm 
Saturday slot, which has been presented by Andrew Collins and Richard Herring 
during their absence.

The pair left the station at the end of 2009 for an "extended sabbatical" 
during which Cornish directed his first film, Attack The Block.

They were reunited briefly on 6 Music 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2010/nov/25/adam-joe-christmas-6music?INTCMP=SRCH>
 during the 2010 Glastonbury festival and for a one-off Christmas Day Special, 
while Buxton also presented a weekly series Adam's Big Mixtape last year.

Buxton said he could not wait to get back to doing the award-winning Saturday 
morning show. "I've really missed doing it. Not that I haven't been every bit 
as busy as Joe," he added. "I've created several new filing systems for my CDs 
and DVDs, successfully reunited over 20 odd socks with their partners and 
learned to understand the language of ants though I'm finding Dec's more of a 
problem. It's been fun but I'm looking forward to talking rubbish and playing 
brilliant music with Joe again."

The 6 Music <https://www.theguardian.com/media/6music> controller, Bob 
Shennan, said: "I know listeners have been missing Adam and Joe's warm and 
witty banter from their Saturday mornings so I'm enormously pleased to welcome 
back their Sony Award-winning show to the network."
