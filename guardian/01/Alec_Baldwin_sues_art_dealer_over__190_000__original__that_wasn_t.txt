Alec Baldwin <https://www.theguardian.com/film/alec-baldwin> is suing a 
Manhattan art dealer, saying she sold him a version of a painting for $190,000 
that was not the original.

In court papers filed on Monday, the Daily News reported, Baldwin claimed art 
gallery owner Mary Boone sold him an alternative version of artist Ross 
Bleckner’s Sea and Mirror in 2010.

The actor says Boone told him she could get the original painting. Baldwin 
said he later had the painting examined by experts who told him it wasn’t the 
original painting that Bleckner did in 1996. He is suing for the difference in 
value of the two paintings and attorney fees, it was reported.

Boone’s attorney, Ted Poretz, denied the charges and said Baldwin was made 
aware from the start he was not getting an original.
