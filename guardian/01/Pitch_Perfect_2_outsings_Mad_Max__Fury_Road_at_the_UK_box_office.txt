The head-to-head

When Warners and Universal both opted for the third weekend in May as the 
release date for their filmsMad Max: Fury Road 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mad-max-fury-road> and Pitch Perfect 2, most 
industry analysts expected the rebooted road warrior to beat the glee club 
maidens. After all, George Miller’s slice of post-apocalyptic vehicular carnage 
comes with a reported $150m (£97m) production price tag, compared with around 
$30m for the a cappella comedy. The original Pitch Perfect film opened in the 
UK with £952,000, on its way to a lifetime total of £6.49m – thus achieving a 
large multiple of its opening number.

 Rebel Wilson and Elizabeth Banks on Pitch Perfect 2: ‘We’re performing oral 
magic’ 
Pitch Perfect went on to deliver significant sales on DVD, building an 
audience that has evidently converted to theatrical with this sequel: Pitch 
Perfect 2 has debuted with a stunning £5.01m from 496 cinemas, yielding a site 
average above £10,000. The film looks well-positioned to play as both a weekend 
date-night attraction and also a midweek evening out for female friendship 
groups, and the 12A-certificate title will also benefit from the school 
half-term holiday, which begins on 22 May. Pitch Perfect 2 has achieved one of 
the biggest-ever opening-weekend numbers for a female director (Elizabeth 
Banks), following the success earlier this year for Sam Taylor-Johnson with
Fifty Shades of Grey <https://www.theguardian.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey>.

Previous franchises that followed a similar pattern – a big theatrical uptick 
with the second film, following a stellar DVD result with the first – include 
Austin Powers, Jason Bourne and Twilight.

 Mad Max: Fury Road: ‘We always have the wanderer in the wasteland searching 
for purpose’ 
The success of Pitch Perfect 2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/pitch-perfect-2> means that Mad Max: Fury 
Road had to settle for second place. That indignity aside, the achieved number 
is actually entirely decent, especially when you consider the risk of mounting 
a sequel to a film franchise that saw its most recent entry come out in 1985. 
The danger was always that younger audiences didn’t know or care about the 
character, leaving nostalgic middle-aged males as the primary target. Fury Road 
has kicked off with £4.54m, including £639,000 in previews. That’s the 
biggest-ever debut for a film featuring Tom Hardy in the lead role: titles that 
opened bigger, such as Inception and The Dark Knight Rises, showcased the actor 
in a supporting part.

Mad Max’s distributor Warners released Godzilla  
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/godzilla>a year ago in the same mid-May slot 
– another film based on a vintage property. Godzilla debuted with £6.39m, a 
little ahead of Mad Max: Fury Road. Thereafter, it fell away rather quickly, 
achieving a lifetime total of £17.24m.

The disappointment

Conceived and made under the title Girls’ Night Out, director Julian Jarrold’s 
VE Day-set royal caper was never an automatic slam-dunk with audiences. The 
cast showcases relative newcomers in the lead roles: Sarah Gadon and Bel Powley 
play princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. However, by the time the film was 
retitledA Royal Night Out <https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-royal-night-out> 
and set for mid-May release, expectations of success had risen: the film seemed 
a strong possibility to perform as a word-of-mouth hit, given the warm 
reactions to the film from press and cinema bookers.

 A Royal Night Out: watch an exclusive clip of the royals on the razz 
Those spiralling hopes now look to have been rather optimistic, with A Royal 
Night Out opening with a mediocre £302,000 from 333 cinemas, including previews 
of £27,000. With the film’s single-screen week-long platform at Odeon Leicester 
Square added in, the total gross rises to £315,000. Lionsgate has reasonable 
expectation of a decent midweek result, given the older audience skew, and warm 
approval ratings may help sustain it, but cinemas will presumably start cutting 
back showtimes and shoving it into smaller screens from this Friday.

The arthouse market

Unless you count multiplex-friendly crossover titles Far From the Madding 
Crowd and A Royal Night Out, there are no arthouse movies in the current 
box-office Top 15. Top performer is Olivier Assayas’Clouds of Sils Maria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/sils-maria>, with £55,000 from 30 cinemas, 
including nearly £7,000 in previews. A screen average below £2,000 is not that 
great for a film benefiting from a fairly focused release, including London 
West End arthouse venues that usually deliver strong numbers.

After a fairly uninspiring start the previous weekend, the well-reviewed 
Girlhood <https://www.theguardian.com/film/girlhood> has held up nicely, 
declining just 21% in box-office revenue. An expansion from 28 to 33 cinemas 
will have helped with the healthy sustain for the Céline Sciamma-directed film.

 Girlhood - video review 
The Girlhood result contrasts with Christian Petzold’s Phoenix, which debuted 
with fairly similar numbers, and has now fallen sharply in week two. The Nina 
Hoss starrer drops 65% from the previous weekend and does not look set to 
repeat the sustained run of Petzold’s 2012 hit Barbara, which reached £198,000 
in the UK. Phoenix is now at £77,000.

Despite winning massive acclaim in Cannes last year and garnering a number of 
prizes from international festivals, the critically lauded Ukrainian filmThe 
Tribe <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-tribe> failed to woo significant 
audiences, debuting with £12,700 from 16 cinemas, including previews of around 
£4,000. Despite reviews encouraging audiences to sample a unique picture – a 
virtually all-deaf cast, all in sign language, with no subtitles – many have 
evidently ducked the challenge.

 The Tribe: the silent, violent deaf-school drama – video clip 
The future

Following the weak previous frame, which suffered from a lack of commercially 
strong new releases (Spooks: The Greater Good was the best thing going), 
box-office has rebounded nicely, up 53%. Takings are also 42% up on the 
equivalent session from 2014, which was led by Godzilla. Cinema owners will be 
hoping for decent holds from Pitch Perfect 2 and Mad Max: Fury Road, as well as 
a strong debut from Disney’s Tomorrowland: A World Beyond, directed by Brad 
Bird (The Incredibles) and starring George Clooney. The latest remake of 
Poltergeist should deliver reliable numbers. François Ozon’sThe New Girlfriend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-new-girlfriend> should lead the arthouse 
pack.
