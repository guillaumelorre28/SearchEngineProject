America has always loved Latin American dance music – from tango to 
cha-cha-cha to bossa nova – but none of these crazes were quite as big as 
mambo. In 1950, Cuban bandleader Perez Prado's fast and furious Que Rico El 
Mambo became a hit and, within a year, Prado's band were embarking on 25-date 
coast-to-coast tours. Unlike his rival Machito, Prado's mambo stripped out the 
complicated solos and concentrated on quirky riffs, appealing to the dancefloor 
and selling this thrilling exotic sound to middle America.
