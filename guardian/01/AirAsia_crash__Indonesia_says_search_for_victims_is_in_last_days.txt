Indonesia’s search for dozens of victims still unaccounted for from the crash 
of an AirAsia passenger jet could end within days if no more bodies are found, 
a senior government official has said.


 The Airbus A320 vanished from radar screens in bad weather over the Java Sea 
on 28 December, less than halfway into a two-hour flight from Surabaya, 
Indonesia’s second-biggest city, to Singapore. All 162 people on board were 
killed.

 Indonesia’s civilian National Search and Rescue Agency said it would look for 
bodies for at least another week.

 “Within one week we will evaluate [our search] depending on the result,” said 
agency chief Fransiskus Bambang Soelistyo. “If we can find one or two more 
bodies, that means we have the opportunity to prolong the operation.“

 The military withdrew from the search on Tuesday, apologising to the victims’ 
families for not being able to do more after a month of work.

 A multinational search and recovery operation has found 70 bodies in the Java 
Sea and had hoped to find more after the discovery of the fuselage of the 
plane. But days of rough weather and poor underwater visibility hampered navy 
divers’ efforts.

 Divers have recovered both the cockpit voice recorder and flight data 
recorder from the sea floor.

 Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee will submit its initial 
findings on the crash this week to the International Civil Aviation 
Organisation, though only the final report will be made public.

 Investigators say they have yet to start their analysis of the aircraft’s two 
flight recorders and have been compiling other data for the inquiry.

The Indonesian transport minister, Ignasius Jonan, has said that based on 
radar data the plane climbed faster than normal in its final minutes and then 
stalled.

 Investigators have found no evidence of foul play.
