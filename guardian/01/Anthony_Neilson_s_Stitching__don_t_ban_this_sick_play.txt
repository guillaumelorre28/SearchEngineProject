It has been a hell of a fortnight for British theatre. England People Very Nice

 andSeven Jewish Children 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/feb/18/israelandthepalestinians-religion>
 have generated what feels like more comment and debate about theatre than the 
last 10 years put together. What has been heartening, though, is that none of 
those bitterly opposed to either play have actually called for an outright ban.

Unfortunately, less attention has been paid to the news that Anthony Neilson's 
play Stitchinghas been banned in Malta 
<http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20090126/local/controversial-play-banned/>
. Yes, banned. Banned in a democratic European country due to host one of 
2018's capital of culture celebrations.

Malta has a board of film and stage classification which is nominally in 
charge of providing age restrictions. As well as their six categories (U, PG, 
12, 14, 16, 18), the board also has the option to "ban and disallow" 
productions from being staged.

The reasons given for banning Stitching are as follows:

1 Blasphemy against the state religion – pages 10 and 17
2 Obscene contempt for the victims of Auschwitz – page 29
3 An encyclopaedic review of dangerous sexual perversions leading to sexual 
servitude – eg pages 33, 34 and several others
4 Abby's eulogy to the child murderers, Fred and Rosemary West – page 35 
5 Reference to the abduction, sexual assault and murder of children – page 36

Malta's "state religion" is Catholicism. It should perhaps be noted in passing 
that the classification of Mel Gibson's ultra-violent, antisemitic film The 
Passion of the Christ is U. The blasphemy to which the censor refers is a 
character in the play saying "Jesus fucking Christ" and in response to the 
suggestion that "Sunday is the Lord's day", replying "Fuck him". Similarly, the 
"obscene contempt for the victims of Auschwitz" is committed by, yes, a 
character in a play. It is worth stating that the charge refers to a single 
line in which the male character claims that his first experience of 
masturbation was inspired by a picture of a naked Jewish woman in a 
concentration camp. Yes, it is uncomfortable and unsettling, but it also makes 
a point about this character's troubling amorality and raises questions: Does 
the character understand the context of the nudity at the time? Is it precisely 
the context which arouses him? What does that say about this character?

The fact that Malta even operates theatrical censorship has already attracted 
strong criticism from the Council of Europe 
<http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2008/01/27/censorship.html>. Moreover, the ban is 
a breach of fundamental rights and freedoms as outlined in articles 6 and 10 of 
the European Convention on Human Rights: "Freedom of expression constitutes one 
of the essential foundations of a society, one of the basic conditions for its 
progress and for the development of every man ... It is applicable not only to 
'information and ideas' that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive 
but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the state or any sector of the 
population."

What the Maltese government has issued amounts to a didactic list setting out 
what characters can and can't say in a work of art. It is unacceptable that the 
police force of a European democracy in the 21st century has the power to issue 
notices ordering that a play is not performed. We can only hope thatUnifaun 
theatre <http://www.unifauntheatre.com/future/index.html>'s planned legal 
action against the Maltese government 
<http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20090201/local/banned-play-set-for-court-drama/>
 succeeds, leading to a change in this deplorable law.
