The decision was made this week after the Catholic traditionalist group 
Promouvoir had pushed for the film to be reclassified in order to prevent all 
under-18s from being able to see it. The film had previously held a 16 rating, 
which allowed anyone over that age to legally see it.

The certificate has now been removed and the film will be banned fom cinemas, 
TV and video until it is given a new classification. The ruling court claimed 
the culture ministry had made “a mistake” in the original decision.

The film stars Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe as a couple grieving for 
their son who move to a remote cabin in the woods, leading to a series of 
gruesome events. It was controversial on release due to its extreme violence 
and the unsimulated sex performed by the lead actors’ doubles.

The decision follows a number of stricter rulings made in French courts after 
pressure from Promouvoir. Last year, the lesbian romance Blue is the Warmest 
Colour had its 12 rating revoked because of its sexual content. The same group 
has also focused on Nymphomaniac and Fifty Shades of Grey.
