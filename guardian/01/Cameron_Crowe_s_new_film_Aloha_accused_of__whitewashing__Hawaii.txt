“Caucasians only make up 30% of the population [of Hawaii], but from watching 
this film, you’d think they made up 99%,” said the MANAA. “This comes in a long 
line of films - The Descendants, 50 First Dates, Blue Crush, Pearl Harbor - 
that uses Hawaii for its exotic backdrop but goes out of its way to exclude the 
very people who live there. It’s an insult to the diverse culture and fabric of
Hawaii <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hawaii>.”

Aloha stars Cooper as a military contractor who falls for a pilot at the same 
time as he reconnects with his ex.

The film has had a troubled post-production, with rumoured reshoots and heavy 
editing required. The original release date shifted from an awards-friendly 
week last December to 29 May in the US.

Sony, which is releasing Aloha, has yet to comment.
