Daumier (1808-1879): Visions of Paris

The French poet and art critic Charles Baudelaire 
<http://modernityseminar.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/etienne-carjat-baudelaire.jpg>
 famously wrote an essay calledThe Painter of Modern Life 
<http://www.columbia.edu/itc/architecture/ockman/pdfs/dossier_4/Baudelaire.pdf>
. Today this essay, or at least its title, is widely quoted. It is often 
associated with the insouciant urban eye of his friendManet 
<http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/edouard-manet-music-in-the-tuileries-gardens>
. In fact, Baudelaire was a Romantic and the artists he wrote most about were 
not the impressionists but their elders. Daumier, a caricaturist whomocked the 
king for looking like a pear 
<http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/art/files/2012/06/Pear-by-Daumier-big.jpg> and 
whose paintings grittily observe Paris, was one of his heroes. See why in this 
survey of a great painter of modern life.
