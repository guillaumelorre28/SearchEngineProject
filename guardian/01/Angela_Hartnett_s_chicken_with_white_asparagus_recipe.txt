White asparagus has a slightly more delicate flavour than green. It's great 
simply cooked in vegetable stock, roasted in butter, with lemon and brown 
shrimp and it pairs wonderfully with spring cabbage and pine nuts. Make sure 
you remove the inedible woody stalks, and any fibrous layers from the bottom.

(Serves four)
½ head of spring cabbage
1 bunch white aspargus (about 10 spears)
2-3 tbsp vegetable oil
8 chicken pieces 
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 sprigs thyme
20ml vegetable stock
1 tbsp pine nuts

Remove the root from the cabbage and cut the rest into strips. Snap the stalks 
from the asparagus (as you bend the spears, they will break at the woody part).

Add the oil to a large saucepan, season the chicken and brown both sides on a 
medium heat.

Add the garlic and thyme and saute for a couple of minutes before adding the 
stock, cover and cook for 15-20 minutes.

Just before the chicken is cooked, boil a pan of water, blanch the cabbage for 
a couple of minutes and add it to the chicken.

Do the same with the asparagus for about 4 minutes, checking it has softened, 
and add it too.

Toss the vegetables so they are mixed through with the chicken and serve with 
the pine nuts sprinkled on top.
