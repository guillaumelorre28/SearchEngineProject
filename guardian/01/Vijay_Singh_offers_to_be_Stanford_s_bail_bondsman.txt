These are dark days for Sir Allen Stanford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/allen-stanford>, who is battling 21 
criminal charges of fiddling investors out of $7bn. But he can still count on a 
few loyal friends - one of whom is the Fijian golfer Vijay Singh.

Singh, a former world number one, offered to stand surety for Stanford's 
$500,000 bail,according to CNBC <http://www.cnbc.com/id/31553869>, which 
reports that Stanford's lawyer mentioned the offer during a court hearing in 
Houston on Thursday.

Unfortunately for Stanford, Singh's offer was rejected because he is not a US 
citizen. Stanford has found the money from other sources and his bail was 
provisionally approved by a US judge, although his release was delayed pending 
an appeal by the US government today.

Singh, who has won three major championships, has long been sponsored by 
Stanford Financial Group and, despite the fact that the company is in 
liquidation, he was still wearing a Stanford emblazoned shirt and cap at last 
weekend'sUS Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/usopengolf> in Bethpage, 
New York (he finished equal 27th, at six over par).

Earlier this year, Singh expressed surprise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/8568928> at Stanford's legal 
difficulties, highlighting the Texan financier's support for a program called 
Eagles for St Jude - which raises money for pediatric cancer every time a 
player on the PGA Tour scores an eagle.

"Vijay's opinion is that Stanford is yet to be proven guilty and until then 
has chosen to act supportively," a spokesman for Singh's management firm, IMG, 
told CNBC.
