Aaron Eckhart is in talks to fight it out with Johnny Depp for the affections 
of a beautiful young woman in The Rum Diary, based on the Hunter S Thompson 
novel about boozy expat journalists in 1950s Puerto Rico, according tothe

Richard Jenkins, currently in the running for the best actor Oscar for his 
turn in The Visitor, has already signed on to play Lotterman, the editor of the 
rundown newspaper which employs Depp's character, Paul Kemp, a hard-drinking, 
down-on-his-luck hack.

The Hollywood Reporter has Eckhart down to play a rich landowner, Sanderson, 
the man squiring the lovely Chenault who befriends Kemp, even though Rum Diary 
fans would know that in the book, Kemp's love rival is a fellow journalist 
called Yeamon. Amber Heard, who starred in Pineapple Express and All the Boys 
Love Mandy Lane, will play Chenault.

The original novel is loosely based on Thompson's own experiences as a 
journalist on an ill-fated sports newspaper on the island in 1960. He wrote The 
Rum Diary in the early 60s, when he was just 22, but did not publish it until 
1998.

The author told the PBS talk show host Charlie Rose in 1999 that the book had 
been rejected by publishers seven times. He returned to it for its "romantic 
notion ... that and money".

The film adaptation is to be written and directed by Withnail & I's Bruce 
Robinson.
