The winner

It’s official: American Sniper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/thepriceofpopcorn>, which has already 
taken a stunning $200m (£131.5m) in US cinemas, is also a significant 
box-office success story in the UK. Holding steady with no decline whatsoever 
from the previous weekend session, Clint Eastwood’s Iraq war film knocks Taken 
3 from the top of the chart. In 10 days, the title has grossed a robust £6.62m. 
The last title to reach the summit having debuted lower down the chart isThe 
Grand Budapest Hotel <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-grand-budapest-hotel>
, which achieved that feat last March.

American Sniper has already overtaken the lifetime totals of Eastwood-directed 
hits such as Million Dollar Baby (£5.43m) and Unforgiven (£5.77m), although 
these comparisons are not inflation-adjusted. Sniper should soon overtake 
Eastwood’s top-grossing filmGran Torino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/20/gran-torino-film-review-clint-eastwood>
 (£8.33m).

American Sniper <https://www.theguardian.com/film/american-sniper> saw its 
venue count increase from 401 for its opening frame to 457. The site average 
edged back from £6,172 to £5,557.

 Ex Machina, The Gambler, Mortdecai and A Most Violent Year - video reviews 
Three new films opened at the weekend on at least 300 screens each, all 
landing in the middle of the chart table (see Top 10, below). Best of the 
bunch, box-office-wise, isEx Machina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/25/ex-machina-review-mark-kermode-alex-garland-vikander>
, the directorial debut of The Beach author and 28 Days Later screenwriter Alex 
Garland. The film kicked off with a decent £904,000 (plus previews of £190,000) 
from 442 sites, and a £2,046 average (or £2,475 if previews are included). The 
title found a berth at multiplexes as well as indie chains, offering a smart 
genre alternative to Oscar fare.

Comparisons are tricky to make. However, Spike Jonze’s Her 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/her-review>, which shares an 
artificial-intelligence premise with Ex Machina, began last February with 
£449,000 from 200 cinemas.

Landing in seventh place is Mortdecai 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/22/mortdecai-review>, the caper 
comedy starring Johnny Depp, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ewan McGregor and Paul Bettany. 
The film grossed £485,000 from 350 venues, yielding a £1,385 average. Depp’s 
last lead role was inTranscendence 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/27/transcendence-review-grand-ideas-johnny-depp-wally-pfister>
, which debuted with £587,000 (plus £595,000 in previews) last April. Expensive 
flopThe Lone Ranger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/08/the-lone-ranger-review> kicked 
off with £1.34m in August 2013. Mortdecai enjoys a weak 5.3/10 user rating at 
IMDb and a dismal 27/100 score at Metacritic.Depp’s quirky taste in material 
seems increasingly to be alienating 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/mortdecai-johnny-depp-career> the 
affection of audiences.

One place below Mortdecai, The Gambler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/gambler-film-review-mark-wahlberg-dynamite-selfhatred>
, starring Mark Wahlberg, picked up £382,000 from 345 screens, for a £1,106 
average. So far, the film has been liked a little more than Mortdecai by 
audiences (6.2/10 at IMDb) and also by critics (56/100). The Gambler is a 
remake of the 1974 James Toback-scripted film, which starred James Caan, and 
both are inspired by the Dostoevsky novella. Populated by a number of violent 
criminals but not exactly a propulsive thriller, and saddled with a 
literature-professor protagonist suffering from existential ennui, The Gambler 
suffers from an uncertain genre positioning, as well as rather unlikely casting 
in the lead role.

 The Gambler - video review 
The disappointment

Landing in lowly 17th place, A Most Violent Year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/07/a-most-violent-year-review-plucky-outsider-draws-blood-in-this-years-oscar-battle>
 has begun falteringly with £217,000 from 180 cinemas, yielding a £1,203 
average.Although the JC Chandor film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/25/a-most-violent-year-review-jessica-chastain>
 was nominated for a Golden Globe (Jessica Chastain, supporting actress), has 
appeared in a smattering of critics groups’ annual polls and won three prizes 
including best film from the US National Board of Review, it was not blessed 
with nominations from either Bafta or Oscar. Landing at this highly competitive 
time has clearly been a challenge for the picture.

A Most Violent Year <https://www.theguardian.com/film/a-most-violent-year> has 
always been a tough film to position. It’s not exactly an action thriller – 
although oil delivery trucks are robbed at gunpoint, and its milieu is where 
business overlaps with criminality. As a character-driven drama, a release on 
180 screens seems optimistic. And as for the cast, lead actor Oscar Isaac is 
not yet a marketable movie star, perhaps because he manages to look different 
in all his films (including Inside Llewyn Davis, The Two Faces of January, 
Drive and WE), and broader audiences have yet to get a clear fix on him. The 
cast also includes Jessica Chastain and David Oyelowo.

JC Chandor has yet to achieve a breakout hit in the UK. Debut feature Margin 
Call <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/12/margin-call-film-review> was 
a niche release, grossing £380,000 in total. Follow-upAll Is Lost 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/26/all-is-lost-review> was pushed a 
bit wider, managing £795,000 over its lifetime.

The holdovers

In addition to American Sniper, three further Oscar best-picture nominees 
continue their reign in the top 10. All fell from the previous session by 
amounts in the 30-32% range. Pick of the bunch isThe Theory of Everything 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/theory-of-everything-review-hawking-eddie-redmayne>
, which has racked up £14.74m in 25 days of play, and looks on course to emerge 
as the biggest hit – in the UK – among this year’s awards contenders.Birdman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/birdman-unexpected-virtue-of-ignorance-film-review>
 has been in cinemas for the same period, grossing £4.67m.Whiplash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/whiplash-review> has managed 
£1.28m in 10 days.

Lower down the chart, best-picture nominee The Imitation Game 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/08/the-imitation-game-review-script-fails-to-sizzle>
 is still holding steady in its 11th week of play (down just 12% from the 
previous frame). With takings of £15.53m, the Alan Turing drama remains the 
biggest-grossing among the Oscar films, but Theory of Everything should 
overtake it very soon.

 Why Beyond Clueless is the one film you should watch this week – video review 
Crowd-funded and self-distributed films don’t get much more independent than 
documentaryBeyond Clueless 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/22/beyond-clueless-review-hynotic-teen-movie-collage>
, directed – full disclosure – byGuardian contributor Charlie Lyne 
<http://www.thestateofthearts.co.uk/2015/01/17/charlie-lyne-of-the-guardian-on-his-directorial-debut-beyond-clueless/>
. Recognising that his teen-movie essay film becomes more of a theatrical 
proposition by creating an event around it in individual cinemas, Lyne took the 
film on a 10-day UK tour prior to release, with director Q+As and the 
occasional frat party. The regional tour grossed £6,592, which adds to an 
earlier preview event last summer at London’s BFI Southbank (£3,964). Beyond 
Clueless opened at the weekend at London’s ICA and Glasgow Filmhouse, with 
one-off events in Manchester on Saturday and Dublin on Sunday, together 
grossing £6,456. Total to date is just over £17,000.

Overall, the market was 23% down on the previous frame, and also 8% down on 
the equivalent session from 2014, when The Wolf of Wall Street and 12 Years a 
Slave continued their hold on the top of the chart. Cinemas are now gearing up 
for February half-term, with the arrival on Friday of Disney’sBig Hero 6 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/07/big-hero-6-review>, which has 
grossed $217m in the US.Kingsman: The Secret Service 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/30/kingsman-the-secret-service-first-look-review>
, from Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn, likewise offers commercial appeal, and 
is an alternative for young adults to the prestige dramas currently on release.
Stephen Daldry’s Trash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/20/trash-first-look-review-stephen-daldry-rome-film-festival>
, from a Richard Curtis screenplay, is harder to position, with its child 
protagonists, 15 certificate and significant foreign-language dialogue. Paul 
Thomas Anderson’sInherent Vice 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/05/inherent-vice-review-joaquin-phoenix-paul-thomas-anderson>
 looks the likely winner for the indie sector, with a cast including Joaquin 
Phoenix, Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro, Owen Wilson and Reese Witherspoon. Also 
in the mix: Aussie thrillerSon of a Gun 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/oct/16/son-of-a-gun-review-a-silly-fun-film-with-unfortunate-character-flaws>
, with Brenton Thwaites, Ewan McGregor and Alicia Vikander.
