scuffing the ball in their second Test victory over Australia, whichwas secured 
with devastating reverse swing bowling

.

“We were actually questioning whether or not [South African wicketkeeper] AB 
de Villiers would get the ball in his hand and with his glove wipe the rough 
side every ball,” Warner told Sky Sports Radio. “That’s another thing we have 
to try and bring up with the umpires.”

Proteas team manager Mohammed Moosajee was furious with Warner’s comments, 
which come ahead of the series-deciding clash at Newlands starting on Saturday 
and four months after the Proteas were embroiled in a ball-tampering saga.

“David Warner’s remarks are disappointing and discouraging. It takes the gloss 
off a great Proteas team performance,” Moosajee told South African newspaper 
DFA. “It smacks of sour grapes and it could just be a tactical plan to get us 
involved in matters that will distract our attention from this crucial Test in 
Cape Town. Hardly anyone takes anythingDavid Warner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/david-warner> says serious.”

Moosajee said he would “leave it to the ICC to look into his remarks”.

Dale Steyn, Vernon Philander and Morne Morkel unleashed a day four

In October, Proteas batsman Faf du Plessis was fined 50% of his match fee in a 
nine-wicket win over Pakistan for rubbing the ball near the zipper of his 
trouser pocket.

Match referee David Boon said the ball-tampering charge was warranted, but 
also that it “was not part of a deliberate and/or prolonged attempt to unfairly 
manipulate the condition of the ball”.

De Villiers, speaking prior to du Plessis’ sanction but after umpires Ian 
Gould and Rod Tucker hit South Africa with a five-run penalty during the match, 
was incredulous.

“We’re not a team that scratches the ball,” de Villiers said. “We want to 
swing the ball as much as we can and try to get it to reverse. But we don’t 
cheat.”
