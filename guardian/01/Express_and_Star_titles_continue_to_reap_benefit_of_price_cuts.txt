Richard Desmond’s Express and Star titles continued to reap the benefits of 
recent price cuts, recording small rises in daily circulation during January as 
the rest of the market stayed broadly flat.

The Daily Star recorded a 4.1% rise in sales to 470,369, having halved its 
price from 40p to 20p during the week and also slashing the cost of its 
Saturday edition from 60p to 30p

45p

 at the start of the month and has been prominently advertising its weekday 55p 
price as 10p less than the Mail, saw a rise of just under 2% to 408,700.

Though the price cuts have boosted sales, additional revenue from advertising 
is not thought to have made up for lost circulation income. Just days after the 
Express price cuts emerged in December, Desmond’s Northern & Shell announced it 
was seeking to cut £4m from its editorial budget.
