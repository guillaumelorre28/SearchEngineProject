Russian prosecutors have demanded that the opposition activist Alexei Navalny 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexei-navalny> be imprisoned for a total of 
10 years on allegations of fraud.

In their closing arguments in a Moscow court on Friday, prosecutors asked a 
judge to convict Navalny, who led anti-government protests in 2012, and 
imprison him for nine years, with an additional year added because of a prior 
conviction. They asked that his brother Oleg be jailed for eight years.

Both men have said they are innocent of the charges and have dismissed them as 
part of a Kremlin campaign to stifle dissent.

The pair are accused of stealing from two firms, including an affiliate of the 
French cosmetics company Yves Rocher, between 2008 and 2012.

In a previous trial in 2013, Navalny was charged with embezzling 16m roubles 
from a state-owned timber firm and sentenced to prison, but he was released the 
next day after thousands protested in Moscow. Currently under house arrest, 
Navalny is serving a suspended five-year jail term for the timber conviction, 
which Kremlin critics also call a sham.

Prosecutor Nadezhda Ignatova told the court the 10-year term would cover those 
charges and the earlier conviction.

“The guilt of the defendant has been fully proven,” she said.

Navalny, a western-educated anti-corruption blogger, sighed after the 
prosecutor spoke and said: “At least it’s easy to count.”
