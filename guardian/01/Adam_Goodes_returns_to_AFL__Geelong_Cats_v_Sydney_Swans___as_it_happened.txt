Cats stay in finals race with fourth straight win

Geelong has moved to seventh on the ladder with a 32 point win over Sydney at 
Simonds Stadium.

Against the backdrop of Adam Goodes’ return to the AFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> after a week off in the wake of the 
‘booing’ controversy the game ebbed and flowed throughout the first two and a 
half quarters before Geelong took over. Led by Joel Selwood in his 200th game 
the home side kicked six goals to one in the second half to win comfortably.

Selwood was the leading possession getter on the ground with 35. Tom Hawkins 
kicked four goals. Josh Kennedy was Sydney’s leading ball-winner with 32 but at 
times looked like he was playing a lone-hand during the second quarter.

With the focus firmly on his comeback, and the crowd’s reaction, Goodes 
started slowly before having 12 touches and a goal.

Ted Richards was reported for a bump to the head of Tom Hawkins.

Geelong - 3.4, 6.4, 9.9, 14.11.95
Sydney - 4.1, 8.5, 8.7, 9.9.63

Goalkickers:

Geelong: Hawkins 4, Duncan 2, Lang 2, Caddy 2, Mackie, Gregson, Stokes, Motlop


Sydney Swans: Jetta 2, B.Jack, Mitchell, Heeney, Goodes, Tippett, Parker, 
Hannebery

As for the Goodes controversy the AFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> 
would be breathing a sigh of relief that there were no major outbreaks of 
vitriol at him. That doesn’t excuse isolated outbreaks of abuse amongst the 
crowd but I think many of us feared what would happen if he was treated 
particularly poorly.

Geelong’s champion got the win and will surely pocket the Brownlow votes, but 
on the whole the crowd at Geelong should be commended for reading the mood of 
the wider community and paying respect to a champion of the game.


Anyway, that’s it for me tonight. We’re certainly set up for an exciting last 
month of the season as the top four and top eight spots are decided.

As Joel Selwood is chaired from the ground the Cats leap back into the top 
eight. If all goes as I expect it to they’ll be back out at 4.40pm tomorrow 
when North continue their hoodoo over the Demons but they’ve managed to stay 
very much in the race.

The result is great news for the Bulldogs who move into fourth, but terrible 
for Collingwood and Greater Western Sydney who now find themselves a game and a 
half adrift. You’d expect GWS to beat Essendon tomorrow but that game now 
becomes crucial for their hopes of a first finals appearance.

Final siren - Geelong defeat Sydney 13.10.88 to Sydney 9.8.62

That’s it. Fireworks erupt and Geelong’s finals campaign is well and truly 
back on track. They’ve been written off so many times, and while they might be 
out of the conversation for premierships their amazing run looks like 
continuing. With Hawthorn currently playing a thriller against West Coast their 
game against the Cats is shaping as another in the long series of blockbusters 
between the sides.

It’s been a great night for Joel Selwood in his 200th, he’s been his side’s 
best but they’ve had plenty of contributors across the second half when the 
game was there to be won.

Goal! Geelong 14.10.94, Sydney 9.8.62 (4.36 remaining)

Steven Motlop marks and goals around the corner to further heap misery on John 
Longmire.

The Swans play Collingwood, GWS, St Kilda and Gold Coast in the last few weeks 
so they’re not out of the top four race yet but even if they do make it they’ll 
probably travel back to Perth in the first week

Goal! Geelong 13.10.88, Sydney 9.8.62 (6.55 remaining)

And that will be game, set and match sports fans. The ball is immediately shot 
forward from the centre and Matthew Stokes converts after a mark.

Sydney goes forward from the bounce for a last roll of the dice. Goodes is 
caught holding the ball, before Heeney intercepts the free kick but misses his 
crucial set shot.

There it is. Steven Motlop ended up on the end of a chain of handballs, burst 
away inside 50 and found Josh Caddy in the square. He almost juggles it over 
the line but manages to put the brakes on just in time then converts with a 
kick around the corner to finish off the Swans. It will be a well deserved win 
because they have been the dominant side since half-time.

We’ve got 10 minutes of playing time left, and the difference between the 
sides is that Geelong are happy to kick long inside 50 and hope for the best 
while the Swans are trying to work the ball in towards a non-existent forward 
line.

There’s still time for Sydney but you feel one more Geelong goal and it’s over.

Goal! Geelong 11.10.76, Sydney 9.8.62 (14.06 remaining)

Important goal for the Swans to keep them alive, Lewis Jetta has been well 
held in the second half but manages to get free and set up Daniel Hannebery. He 
marks just inside 50 but plays on, runs away from the traffic and converts.

Hannebery is averaging 30 disposals this year, and is currently on 15 but that 
goal could be crucial.

Goal! Geelong 11.9.75, Sydney 8.7.55 (17.21 remaining)

It’s the Hawkins show. Selwood wins a free for Josh Kennedy brushing an arm 
across his shoulder, and he passes to Tom who rams home a fourth to all but 
finish off the Swans.

Darcy Lang nearly delivers the final blow seconds later but his attempt at a 
running banana Goal of the Week contender misses.

Goal! Geelong 10.9.69, Sydney 8.7.55 (18.49 remaining)

It’s Hawkins again. After 10 minutes of wasted dominance at the end of the 
third quarter he does his best argument for Ted Richard’s defence by going back 
and calmly finishing a crucial set-shot.

Western Bulldogs fans, your chances of ending the evening in the top four are 
increasing every minute. Apologies for picking you to finish last, but you’re 
going to have the last laugh.

More from Mel who is chatting to the crowd at Simonds Stadium


As the third quarter ends it’s clear there’s a lot of love out there for 
Goodes. When there has been booing from the Cats side - not directed at Goodes 
that I’ve heard - some of their fellow supporters have told them to shoosh 
regardless.

But wandering around the ground and speaking to members of the crowd, it can’t 
go unnoticed that there is still an unreasonable level of angst towards him 
from some. A few people use derogatory language to describe him, and reject any 
association with racism.

When I press them about their reasoning for their dislike, the general 
response is Goodes is an attention seeker, which seems odd since it was the 
crowd and their booing, not Goodes, that ensured all attention was on him.

There have been a couple of ‘I’m not racist but...’ type comments. Despite all 
the insightful commentary from the past few weeks [though admittedly, Goodes 
has also been lambasted by some members of the press, adding fuel to the fire] 
there are people in the crowd tonight who still don’t get it. It’s a shame, but 
hopefully they’re in the minority.

Three-quarter time - Geelong lead Sydney 9.9.63 to 8.7.55

Geelong were dominant but missed the opportunity to push their advantage home 
in the last 10 minutes.

Sydney’s forward structure crumbled and they never really looked likely to 
score a goal. Nevertheless they find themselves well and truly in the game, and 
the way the game has swung back and forth all night you wouldn’t write them 
off. Dare I say the door is open for a certain dual Brownlow Medal winner to do 
something remarkable in the last quarter...

I’m sticking with the Cats from here, but in a season where clubs have been 
throwing away leads for fun anything could happen.

Report!

Ted Richards booked for front-on contact with Tom Hawkins. The Tomahawk was 
bending over to pick up the ball when he was bumped with a hip to the head. He 
didn’t suffer any ill-effects from the collision but you’d think even though 
Hawkins turned around and ended up in the line of fire Ted will need to adjust 
his weekly budget to include a fine.

One minute left, Sydney have scored just two behinds this quarter and Geelong 
have all the numbers when the ball goes forward.

Geelong are blazing away but can’t find a fourth goal. We’ve got four minutes 
left in the third quarter and Sydney appear to have temporarily run out of 
ideas. One late goal would change everything but on the odd occasions they’ve 
been inside 50 their delivery has been diabolical.

Substitution

John Longmire senses the need for speed and replaces the tall Nankervis (three 
touches) with midfielder Zak Jones.

Goal! Geelong 9.6.60, Sydney 8.7.55 (10.47 remaining)

Cory Gregson burns off his opponent with pace to mark on his chest. He 
converts the set shot for Geelong’s third in a row and they’re back in front. 
Ted Richards is forced to call his fellow Sydney defenders in for a chat and 
some reorganisation.

The Ted talk had no effect as the Cats went straight forward again courtesy of 
a free kick in the middle, and the ball was lasered to Tom Hawkins. Tomahawk 
misses the shot, and Kelly another opportunity shortly after but in this 
topsy-turvy game the home side are back on top.

Sydney go forward and after a dropped mark by Jackson Thurlow the ball falls 
to Goodes, who wheels around with enough time for us to get a bit of adverse 
crowd noise but misses to rapturous applause. Swans in front by a point.

Goal! Geelong 8.6.54, Sydney 8.6.54 (13.03 remaining)

Scores level! And this one didn’t hit the post so it counts as a goal. Former 
Cat Jeremy Laidler missed at the other end after Selwood gave away a 
50-metre-penalty and Geelong go down the other end for Josh Caddy to convert 
from a set shot. Game well and truly on.

I know club accounts are meant to be parochial, but claiming you’ve had a goal 
taken off you because it hit the post is going too far.

Selwood snaps a goal but it hits the post. 11 pts the diff. Our boys are

Much like the second quarter Geelong are on top early in the third - they’ve 
had 81% time in forward half to now - and Mitch Duncan converts to bring the

Selwood nearly brings the house down with a snap from the pocket which just 
faded away and hit the post at the last minute.

Meanwhile talented Sydney youngster Isaac Heeney is forced to go off for a 
breather after being involved in two big hits within a minute. Had he not 
suffered injury earlier in the year he would be more than welcome in the battle 
royale for the most competitive Rising Star award ever.

The players are back on the ground and the third quarter is go.

For those of you just joining us after Australia’s gone back to being no good 
at cricket, Sydney weathered a storm at the start of the second quarter to take 
a handy lead into half time. The response from the crowd towardsAdam Goodes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-goodes> has on the whole been 
respectful. Fortunately we just might be able to get back to talking about 
footy next week.

Important half time numbers:

Joel Selwood leads all comers for possessions with 19 - including 10 contested 
- while for the Swans Lewis Jetta and Tom Mitchell both have 15. Inside 50’s 
are almost the most useless stat in footy, but in this case I’m willing to 
admit most of Jetta’s five have been quality.

Other than free kicks (Geelong leads 13-6) most of the team stats are similar. 
Sydney have had marginally more tackles, hit-outs and marks inside 50 while 
Geelong are winning the contested ball but there’s no particular dominance 
leaping off the page.

I wouldn’t go writing off the Cats yet but at the moment it looks like as long 
as the Swans can keep getting the ball forward they’re going to manufacture 
enough scores to win. Don’t turn over to the cricket yet (surely it’s over by 
now anyway), there’s plenty of life in this one yet.

Half time - Sydney lead Geelong 8.5.53 to 6.4.40

Considering the way they looked early in the quarter it’s been a huge effort 
by the Swans to open up a 13 point lead at half time. In a neat touch 
considering the lead-up to the game the tide certainly turned after Goodes’ 
electric run through the middle of the ground, and while there was plenty more 
to their comeback he became far more prominent in the second term.

One of the key factors in Sydney settling and taking the lead back was 
Geelong’s turnovers, which cost them all four goals the Swans kicked during the 
term.

Goal! Geelong 6.4.40, Sydney 8.4.52 (0.47 remaining)

With just over a minute remaining and Sam Reid does his best to drop a pass 
from Goodes inside 50. He fumbles before holding onto it but only manages a 
point.

From the kick-in Luke Parker causes a turnover and Lewis Jetta manages to kick 
a 50 metre goal off one step to extend the margin to 13 points.

The latest from Mel in Geelong,

The second quarter begins and I’ve found the Melbourne-based branch of the 
official Sydney Swans cheer squad.

“It’s subdued out there, it’s tense,” Debbie Budge says. “You can tell the 
Swans are nervous.”

Her cheer buddy, Steve Pola, agrees, saying the Swans seem nervous and are 
passing to Goodes too much.

“They’re starting to calm down now but it’s a strange atmosphere,” he said, 
“but Geelong are a polite crowd, a respectful crowd. I’m hopeful tonight will 
go well for Goodes.”

Brett Mollison was at the game against West Coast a couple of weeks back when 
the saga began. He says it was awful.

“The booing was unlike anything I’ve heard. I wanted it to be over”.

Quick reply as the Cats go forward immediately from the bounce and Harry 
Taylor finds the Tomahawk for a chest mark almost directly in front. He kicks 
his second to at least briefly put the brakes on Sydney’s momentum.

All of a sudden everything’s coming up Sydney. The International Festival of 
Crumb continues with Luke Parker getting boot to ball in the square and 
surviving one of the quickest video reviews you’ll ever see.

Geelong Mayor Darryn Lyons, the idea of an International Crumb Festival is all 
yours.

Another touch for Goodes, and the longest he’s had ball in hand tonight. His 
kick is poor, which causes the crowd to erupt in celebration...

... but only because the pass hit local hero Joel Selwood on the chest.

Just like the Swans are back in front. Kurt Tippett wins an arguable free kick 
from Harry Taylor for holding on in the marking contest and has no problems in 
converting before moving back into the ruck.

Against the run of play Sydney drag the margin back to two as Jetta takes a 
tap from Tippett and snaps truly. It’s been a great night for fans of crumb.

Jetta then burns out of the centre from the bounce but only manages a point 
from the long kick.

Goodes nearly goals again, storming through the middle of the ground (possibly 
running too far but who are we to rain on a near-fairytale?) and narrowly 
falling short of kicking the goal. It was the longest he’s had the ball in hand 
all night and there was no audible angst.

A goal would have come at just the right time for the Swans who have been 
ragged in first 10 minutes of the second term.

Goal! Geelong 5.4.34, Sydney 4.1.25 (14.52 remaining)

A contentious downfield free after a McVeigh tackle on Matthew Stokes sees Tom 
Hawkins playing on then being called back to take the set shot instead. He 
missed an opportunity in the first quarter and was visibly upset for the next 
few minutes but makes no mistake this time. And there’s that furious cat 
soundbyte again.

Blicavs, patched up and no longer wearing the crimson mask, uses his pace to 
gather the ball inside 50 and square it to Mitch Duncan standing at the top of 
the square to put the Cats in front. The first two minutes have been all 
Geelong.

Quarter time - Sydney lead Geelong 4.1.25 to 3.4.22

The Swans have dominated in the midfield and spent much of the quarter going 
forward, but when Geelong got free and moved the ball the other way they were 
generally unhindered. We’re no closer to knowing who’s going to win this game, 
but it is shaping up as a tight one.

For Geelong the key possession winners in the first quarter were Selwood with 
nine, Mackie and Motlop with eight each. The Swans chief ball winners were 
Lewis Jetta, Jake Lloyd and Josh Kennedy with nine apiece.

Goal! Geelong 3.4.22, Sydney 4.1.25 (1.18 remaining)

It’s a great moment for fans of classic crumb as Darcy Lang brings the ball to 
ground at the top of the square and turns around to kick his side’s third goal 
of the evening.

Melissa Davey

Melissa managed to beat the sell out and make it inside. She reports a 
generally civil atmosphere so far.

Fireworks erupted as together, the Sydney Swans and Geelong Cats ran through 
the banner emblazoned with the words #Fairness #Unity and #Respect. There’s 
only a smattering of Sydney supporters among the crowd, so chants of Geelong 
are dominating the game so far. There have been a few boos, but not while 
Goodes has had the ball so far as I can tell.

Goodes goals!

Goal! Geelong 2.1.13, Sydney 4.1.25 (4.38 remaining)

The Cats mess around with it in defence and Goodes gets a fist in to a marking 
contest, gathers the loose ball and snaps a goal. The crowd reaction seemed 
reasonable, more dissatisfaction with a defensive blunder rather than the 
identity of the man who took advantage.

Goal! Geelong 2.1.13, Sydney 3.1.19 (6.15 remaining)

The Swans were fortunate not to concede when a loose ball off hands in the 
goalsquare just beat Darcy Lang over the line. Had it sat up for him he’d have 
walked into an open goal but had to settle for a behind. Each side then had 
their chances, with Goodes prominent in the Sydney forward line but still 
unable to win a clear possession.

Eventually Sydney find Isaac Heeney one-on-one with Nakia Cockatoo just 
outside the goalsquare, and the Swan neatly works his fellow rookie under the 
ball for the mark before kicking truly.

Goal! Geelong 2.1.13, Sydney 2.1.13 (10.52 remaining)

Just as I say Sydney haven’t got any marking targets Toby Nankervis bobs up 
with one. After a wait for Mark Blicavs to leave the field with a heavily 
bleeding mouth his set shot floats out to the right where it lands in the 
waiting arms of Tom Mitchell to snap home through a crowd and level the scores.

Geelong 2.1.13, Sydney 1.1.7 (11.54 remaining)

Sydney have certainly had the better of the play so far, but haven’t been able 
to create any real goalscoring opportunities. They’ve had the ball inside 50 
eight times but at least for now are sorely lacking a dangerous marking option.

Goal! Geelong 1.0.6, Sydney 1.0.6 (15.49 remaining)

Just like that the Swans are level. Brandon Jack picks the pocket of Jake 
Kolodjashnij just outside the square and gets boot to ball as he falls to the 
ground. It rolls through and after a cautious start that’s two goals in a 
minute.

Goal! Geelong 1.0.6, Sydney 0.0.0 (16.27 remaining)

Geelong survive an early attack and scramble in the goalsquare, but handed the 
ball back immediately and were lucky not to concede in the first minute. Goodes 
was heavily involved early in the Sydney forward line but didn’t manage a clear 
possession yet before Geelong’s first forward thrust of the game ended in 
Andrew Mackie taking a handball from Selwood and just carrying the Sydney 
defenders from outside 50.

The sides have emerged, and run through the joint banner. Congratulations to 
Joel Selwood for his 200th game and Luke Parker on his 100th.

Selwood has played in wins 78% of the time, and Parker 68%. As a Melbourne 
supporters may I use this space to tell fans of both sides just how jealous I 
am of them.

We’re about five minutes away from the first bounce of what should be a 
fascinating clash on a number of levels.

As the sides emerge to run through the joint banner we can see several 
homemade signs in the crowd supporting Goodes. Whether that represents the 
wider view of the audience we’re yet to see, but if I can make a suggestion 
don’t do a Twitter search for any mention of the joint banner if you want to 
retain faith in humanity.

9.51am BST 09:51  <> 

Don’t be entirely distracted by off-field events, this is a crucial game. 
Results elsewhere this weekend have significantly raised the heat on both sides.

Sydney will make the finals, but by virtue of the Western Bulldogs easily 
dispatching Port Adelaide this afternoon they have temporarily been shuffled 
down to fifth. Remember early in the season when the Dogs pulled off a gutsy 
win at the SCG and it seemed like David toppling Goliath? How quickly things 
change. The Swans are not only now a full win behind them, but also carry a 
marginally lower percentage.

Geelong too find themselves under pressure in the battle for 5th to 8th 
courtesy of Adelaide’s win over Richmond last night. If as expected North 
Melbourne defeat the Demons tomorrow a loss this evening will see the Cats a 
full game and percentage outside the eight with time rapidly running out. Not 
only will they lose ground on the sides above them they’ll also have 
Collingwood and GWS breathing down their neck.

It’s hardly curtains (or cat flaps) for the locals if they lose tonight, but 
they don’t have an easy run home. Their game against Hawthorn next week could 
go anywhere, then they play the unpredictable Saints - and even if they take 
one win out of two there they’ll need to get past Collingwood and Adelaide in 
the final fortnight of the home and away season so a fourth in a row tonight 
would provide valuable insurance.

Tonight’s teams: 


Geelong 

Bartel, Blicavs, Caddy, Cockatoo, Duncan, Enright, Gregson, Guthrie, Hawkins, 
Horlin-Smith, Kelly, Kolodjashnij, Lang, Lonergan, Mackie, Motlop, Murdoch, 
Selwood, Stokes, Taylor, Thurlow, Walker

IN: Stokes, Gregson, Horlin-Smith 
OUT: Kersten (toe), Smedts (omitted), Johnson (suspended) 

Sydney 
In a change to the selected side Zak Jones has replaced Ben McGlynn. 

IN: Goodes, Jones 
OUT: Franklin (back), McGlynn (as yet undisclosed reasons) 

Cunningham, Goodes, Grundy, Hannebery, Heeney, B. Jack, K. Jack, Jetta, Jones, 
Kennedy, Laidler, Lloyd, McVeigh, Mitchell, Nankervis, Parker, Rampe, Reid, 
Richards, Shaw, Smith andTippett

In these glorious last few weeks before the substitute rule is abolished (the 
views expressed represent that of the author and not necessary that ofGuardian 
Australia) the men wearing high-visibility vests and riding exercise bikes for 
much of the evening will be Jones for the Swans and Horlin-Smith for Geelong.

For what’s it’s worth I’m tipping the home side to win by 20 points, which all 
but ensures a Swans victory.

Introduction

Good evening all, and welcome to the Round 19 clash between Geelong and Sydney 
from Simonds Stadium (née Kardinia Park). It’s a rare late season clash where 
not only is there plenty at stake for the participating teams, but also for the 
industry itself.

Most of the footy world (e.g. practically everyone not emotionally or 
physically involved with tonight’s West Coast/Hawthorn game) will be waiting 
anxiously to see how dual Brownlow Medal winnerAdam Goodes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-goodes> is received.

The saga surrounding the treatment dished out to the Sydney champion by 
segments of theAFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> community reared its 
head again after the Swans travelled to Perth a fortnight ago. Since then the 
debate has become all-consuming, spilling from the sports pages to mainstream 
media both national and international. It’s fair to say that eyes across the 
country will be on this game, and many of them will not be concerned with the 
final score.

After taking a week to gather his thoughts after the initial storm, Goodes 
returns to Sydney’s side tonight. His side are desperate for the four points - 
as are the Cats - but you suspect that the big hitters at the AFL will be 
huddled around a television somewhere hoping that we can see this game through 
in the right spirit and that in the lead-up to finals focus will turn back to 
footyand turn the focus back to footy in the lead up to finals.


In the lead up to the first bounce at 7.20pm AEST, here’s a recap of some of 
the key events of the week:


 * Last Sunday the Swans beat Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/01/scg-afl-adam-goodes-swans> 
without Goodes. Sydney fans responded to the week of controversy with an 
outpouring of support.

 * On Tuesday AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan denied reports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/04/gillon-mclachlan-defends-united-afl-commission-over-adam-goodes-issue>
 that the AFL Commission were divided on the league’s firm stance against 
booing of Goodes.

 * The Swans welcomed Goodes back to training the same day. He confirmed he’d 
play this week and said he was “humbled” by the support he’d received from the 
club, Sydney fans and from across the league.

 * As expected Goodes was named in the Sydney side on Thursday night, 
replacing Lance Franklin who has once again succumbed to a back complaint. 
As mentioned below Jonathan Horn made a plea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/07/geelong-show-some-decency-to-adam-goodes-australia-is-watching>
 inThe Guardian for his fellow Geelong fans to show decency towards Goodes. 
Tonight the two clubs will run through a joint banner to show respect, but what 
happens next is largely up to the 25,000 or so people at the ground.

Now, for as long as possible, on to the game.

Adam (not that one, the other, less talked about one) will be with shortly to 
bring you up to speed with what’s happening in Geelong, but before he gets into 
his seat, here’s a teaser of Jonathan Horn’s brilliant piece on tonight’s game.

Four years ago, Adam Goodes <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-goodes> 
walked from Geelong’s Kardinia Park in tears. It had been an emotional 
afternoon. His captain’s baby daughter had died during the week and the Swans 
devoted their win to her memory. Geelong hadn’t been beaten on their home 
ground for eons but Sydney played out of their skins. Goodes pretty much won it 
off his own boot in the final term.

The Geelong fans clapped him off, just as Essendon supporters had applauded 
him a few weeks earlier, after he narrowly missed a set shot after the siren. 
Later, on the night of his 300th game, he was clapped off again. He was not yet 
an affront to the mainstream. It was all very polite and respectful.

Geelong has moved to seventh on the ladder with a 32 point win over Sydney at 
Simonds Stadium.

Against the backdrop of Adam Goodes’ return to the AFL 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> after a week off in the wake of the 
‘booing’ controversy the game ebbed and flowed throughout the first two and a 
half quarters before Geelong took over. Led by Joel Selwood in his 200th game 
the home side kicked six goals to one in the second half to win comfortably.

Selwood was the leading possession getter on the ground with 35. Tom Hawkins 
kicked four goals. Josh Kennedy was Sydney’s leading ball-winner with 32 but at 
times looked like he was playing a lone-hand during the second quarter.

With the focus firmly on his comeback, and the crowd’s reaction, Goodes 
started slowly before having 12 touches and a goal.

Ted Richards was reported for a bump to the head of Tom Hawkins.

Geelong - 3.4, 6.4, 9.9, 14.11.95
Sydney - 4.1, 8.5, 8.7, 9.9.63

Goalkickers:

Geelong: Hawkins 4, Duncan 2, Lang 2, Caddy 2, Mackie, Gregson, Stokes, Motlop


Sydney Swans: Jetta 2, B.Jack, Mitchell, Heeney, Goodes, Tippett, Parker, 
Hannebery
 
As for the Goodes controversy the AFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> 
would be breathing a sigh of relief that there were no major outbreaks of 
vitriol at him. That doesn’t excuse isolated outbreaks of abuse amongst the 
crowd but I think many of us feared what would happen if he was treated 
particularly poorly.

Geelong’s champion got the win and will surely pocket the Brownlow votes, but 
on the whole the crowd at Geelong should be commended for reading the mood of 
the wider community and paying respect to a champion of the game.


Anyway, that’s it for me tonight. We’re certainly set up for an exciting last 
month of the season as the top four and top eight spots are decided.
 
As Joel Selwood is chaired from the ground the Cats leap back into the top 
eight. If all goes as I expect it to they’ll be back out at 4.40pm tomorrow 
when North continue their hoodoo over the Demons but they’ve managed to stay 
very much in the race.

The result is great news for the Bulldogs who move into fourth, but terrible 
for Collingwood and Greater Western Sydney who now find themselves a game and a 
half adrift. You’d expect GWS to beat Essendon tomorrow but that game now 
becomes crucial for their hopes of a first finals appearance.

<https://twitter.com/MelissaLDavey/status/629984082718425088>  
That’s it. Fireworks erupt and Geelong’s finals campaign is well and truly 
back on track. They’ve been written off so many times, and while they might be 
out of the conversation for premierships their amazing run looks like 
continuing. With Hawthorn currently playing a thriller against West Coast their 
game against the Cats is shaping as another in the long series of blockbusters 
between the sides.
 
It’s been a great night for Joel Selwood in his 200th, he’s been his side’s 
best but they’ve had plenty of contributors across the second half when the 
game was there to be won.
 
Goal! Geelong 14.10.94, Sydney 9.8.62 (4.36 remaining)

Steven Motlop marks and goals around the corner to further heap misery on John 
Longmire.

The Swans play Collingwood, GWS, St Kilda and Gold Coast in the last few weeks 
so they’re not out of the top four race yet but even if they do make it they’ll 
probably travel back to Perth in the first week
 
Goal! Geelong 13.10.88, Sydney 9.8.62 (6.55 remaining)

And that will be game, set and match sports fans. The ball is immediately shot 
forward from the centre and Matthew Stokes converts after a mark.

Sydney goes forward from the bounce for a last roll of the dice. Goodes is 
caught holding the ball, before Heeney intercepts the free kick but misses his 
crucial set shot.
 
Goal! Geelong 12.10.82, Sydney 9.8.62 (7.53 remaining)

There it is. Steven Motlop ended up on the end of a chain of handballs, burst 
away inside 50 and found Josh Caddy in the square. He almost juggles it over 
the line but manages to put the brakes on just in time then converts with a 
kick around the corner to finish off the Swans. It will be a well deserved win 
because they have been the dominant side since half-time.
 
We’ve got 10 minutes of playing time left, and the difference between the 
sides is that Geelong are happy to kick long inside 50 and hope for the best 
while the Swans are trying to work the ball in towards a non-existent forward 
line.

There’s still time for Sydney but you feel one more Geelong goal and it’s over.

Substitution

George Horlin-Smith sheds the hi-vis and replaces Nakia Cockatoo for the Cats.
 
Goal! Geelong 11.10.76, Sydney 9.8.62 (14.06 remaining)

Important goal for the Swans to keep them alive, Lewis Jetta has been well 
held in the second half but manages to get free and set up Daniel Hannebery. He 
marks just inside 50 but plays on, runs away from the traffic and converts.

Hannebery is averaging 30 disposals this year, and is currently on 15 but that 
goal could be crucial.
 
Goal! Geelong 11.9.75, Sydney 8.7.55 (17.21 remaining)

It’s the Hawkins show. Selwood wins a free for Josh Kennedy brushing an arm 
across his shoulder, and he passes to Tom who rams home a fourth to all but 
finish off the Swans.

Darcy Lang nearly delivers the final blow seconds later but his attempt at a 
running banana Goal of the Week contender misses.
 
Goal! Geelong 10.9.69, Sydney 8.7.55 (18.49 remaining)

It’s Hawkins again. After 10 minutes of wasted dominance at the end of the 
third quarter he does his best argument for Ted Richard’s defence by going back 
and calmly finishing a crucial set-shot.

Western Bulldogs fans, your chances of ending the evening in the top four are 
increasing every minute. Apologies for picking you to finish last, but you’re 
going to have the last laugh.
 
More from Mel who is chatting to the crowd at Simonds Stadium


As the third quarter ends it’s clear there’s a lot of love out there for 
Goodes. When there has been booing from the Cats side - not directed at Goodes 
that I’ve heard - some of their fellow supporters have told them to shoosh 
regardless.

But wandering around the ground and speaking to members of the crowd, it can’t 
go unnoticed that there is still an unreasonable level of angst towards him 
from some. A few people use derogatory language to describe him, and reject any 
association with racism.

When I press them about their reasoning for their dislike, the general 
response is Goodes is an attention seeker, which seems odd since it was the 
crowd and their booing, not Goodes, that ensured all attention was on him.

There have been a couple of ‘I’m not racist but...’ type comments. Despite all 
the insightful commentary from the past few weeks [though admittedly, Goodes 
has also been lambasted by some members of the press, adding fuel to the fire] 
there are people in the crowd tonight who still don’t get it. It’s a shame, but 
hopefully they’re in the minority.

 
Geelong were dominant but missed the opportunity to push their advantage home 
in the last 10 minutes.

Sydney’s forward structure crumbled and they never really looked likely to 
score a goal. Nevertheless they find themselves well and truly in the game, and 
the way the game has swung back and forth all night you wouldn’t write them 
off. Dare I say the door is open for a certain dual Brownlow Medal winner to do 
something remarkable in the last quarter...

I’m sticking with the Cats from here, but in a season where clubs have been 
throwing away leads for fun anything could happen.
 
Report!

Ted Richards booked for front-on contact with Tom Hawkins. The Tomahawk was 
bending over to pick up the ball when he was bumped with a hip to the head. He 
didn’t suffer any ill-effects from the collision but you’d think even though 
Hawkins turned around and ended up in the line of fire Ted will need to adjust 
his weekly budget to include a fine.

One minute left, Sydney have scored just two behinds this quarter and Geelong 
have all the numbers when the ball goes forward.
 
Geelong are blazing away but can’t find a fourth goal. We’ve got four minutes 
left in the third quarter and Sydney appear to have temporarily run out of 
ideas. One late goal would change everything but on the odd occasions they’ve 
been inside 50 their delivery has been diabolical.
 
Substitution

John Longmire senses the need for speed and replaces the tall Nankervis (three 
touches) with midfielder Zak Jones.
 
Goal! Geelong 9.6.60, Sydney 8.7.55 (10.47 remaining)

Cory Gregson burns off his opponent with pace to mark on his chest. He 
converts the set shot for Geelong’s third in a row and they’re back in front. 
Ted Richards is forced to call his fellow Sydney defenders in for a chat and 
some reorganisation.

The Ted talk had no effect as the Cats went straight forward again courtesy of 
a free kick in the middle, and the ball was lasered to Tom Hawkins. Tomahawk 
misses the shot, and Kelly another opportunity shortly after but in this 
topsy-turvy game the home side are back on top.
 
Sydney go forward and after a dropped mark by Jackson Thurlow the ball falls 
to Goodes, who wheels around with enough time for us to get a bit of adverse 
crowd noise but misses to rapturous applause. Swans in front by a point.
 
Goal! Geelong 8.6.54, Sydney 8.6.54 (13.03 remaining)

Scores level! And this one didn’t hit the post so it counts as a goal. Former 
Cat Jeremy Laidler missed at the other end after Selwood gave away a 
50-metre-penalty and Geelong go down the other end for Josh Caddy to convert 
from a set shot. Game well and truly on.
 
I know club accounts are meant to be parochial, but claiming you’ve had a goal 
taken off you because it hit the post is going too far.

Selwood snaps a goal but it hits the post. 11 pts the diff. Our boys are

Goal! Geelong 7.6.48, Sydney 8.5.53 (14.57 remaining)

Much like the second quarter Geelong are on top early in the third - they’ve 
had 81% time in forward half to now - and Mitch Duncan converts to bring the 
margin back to under one straight kick.
 
Selwood nearly brings the house down with a snap from the pocket which just 
faded away and hit the post at the last minute.

Meanwhile talented Sydney youngster Isaac Heeney is forced to go off for a 
breather after being involved in two big hits within a minute. Had he not 
suffered injury earlier in the year he would be more than welcome in the battle 
royale for the most competitive Rising Star award ever.

 
At the risk of creating my own Accidental Partridge 
<https://twitter.com/accidentalp> moment, can I ask if there’s anyone who wears 
a long sleeve footy jumper better than Jimmy Bartel? Answers on a postcard to 
the usual address.
 
The players are back on the ground and the third quarter is go.

For those of you just joining us after Australia’s gone back to being no good 
at cricket, Sydney weathered a storm at the start of the second quarter to take 
a handy lead into half time. The response from the crowd towardsAdam Goodes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-goodes> has on the whole been 
respectful. Fortunately we just might be able to get back to talking about 
footy next week.
 
Important half time numbers:

Joel Selwood leads all comers for possessions with 19 - including 10 contested 
- while for the Swans Lewis Jetta and Tom Mitchell both have 15. Inside 50’s 
are almost the most useless stat in footy, but in this case I’m willing to 
admit most of Jetta’s five have been quality.

Other than free kicks (Geelong leads 13-6) most of the team stats are similar. 
Sydney have had marginally more tackles, hit-outs and marks inside 50 while 
Geelong are winning the contested ball but there’s no particular dominance 
leaping off the page.

I wouldn’t go writing off the Cats yet but at the moment it looks like as long 
as the Swans can keep getting the ball forward they’re going to manufacture 
enough scores to win. Don’t turn over to the cricket yet (surely it’s over by 
now anyway), there’s plenty of life in this one yet.
 
Considering the way they looked early in the quarter it’s been a huge effort 
by the Swans to open up a 13 point lead at half time. In a neat touch 
considering the lead-up to the game the tide certainly turned after Goodes’ 
electric run through the middle of the ground, and while there was plenty more 
to their comeback he became far more prominent in the second term.

One of the key factors in Sydney settling and taking the lead back was 
Geelong’s turnovers, which cost them all four goals the Swans kicked during the 
term.
 
Goal! Geelong 6.4.40, Sydney 8.4.52 (0.47 remaining)

With just over a minute remaining and Sam Reid does his best to drop a pass 
from Goodes inside 50. He fumbles before holding onto it but only manages a 
point.

From the kick-in Luke Parker causes a turnover and Lewis Jetta manages to kick 
a 50 metre goal off one step to extend the margin to 13 points.
 
The latest from Mel in Geelong,

The second quarter begins and I’ve found the Melbourne-based branch of the 
official Sydney Swans cheer squad.

“It’s subdued out there, it’s tense,” Debbie Budge says. “You can tell the 
Swans are nervous.”

Her cheer buddy, Steve Pola, agrees, saying the Swans seem nervous and are 
passing to Goodes too much.

“They’re starting to calm down now but it’s a strange atmosphere,” he said, 
“but Geelong are a polite crowd, a respectful crowd. I’m hopeful tonight will 
go well for Goodes.”

Brett Mollison was at the game against West Coast a couple of weeks back when 
the saga began. He says it was awful.

“The booing was unlike anything I’ve heard. I wanted it to be over”.

Goal! Geelong 6.4.40, Sydney 7.3.45 (5.17 remaining)

Quick reply as the Cats go forward immediately from the bounce and Harry 
Taylor finds the Tomahawk for a chest mark almost directly in front. He kicks 
his second to at least briefly put the brakes on Sydney’s momentum.
 
Goal! Geelong 5.4.34, Sydney 7.3.45 (6.20 remaining)

All of a sudden everything’s coming up Sydney. The International Festival of 
Crumb continues with Luke Parker getting boot to ball in the square and 
surviving one of the quickest video reviews you’ll ever see.

Geelong Mayor Darryn Lyons, the idea of an International Crumb Festival is all 
yours.
 
Another touch for Goodes, and the longest he’s had ball in hand tonight. His 
kick is poor, which causes the crowd to erupt in celebration...

... but only because the pass hit local hero Joel Selwood on the chest.
 
Goal! Geelong 5.4.34, Sydney 6.3.39 (7.57 remaining)

Just like the Swans are back in front. Kurt Tippett wins an arguable free kick 
from Harry Taylor for holding on in the marking contest and has no problems in 
converting before moving back into the ruck.
 
Goal! Geelong 5.4.34, Sydney 5.2.32 (10.37 remaining)

Against the run of play Sydney drag the margin back to two as Jetta takes a 
tap from Tippett and snaps truly. It’s been a great night for fans of crumb.

Jetta then burns out of the centre from the bounce but only manages a point 
from the long kick.
 
Goodes nearly goals again, storming through the middle of the ground (possibly 
running too far but who are we to rain on a near-fairytale?) and narrowly 
falling short of kicking the goal. It was the longest he’s had the ball in hand 
all night and there was no audible angst.

A goal would have come at just the right time for the Swans who have been 
ragged in first 10 minutes of the second term.
 
Goal! Geelong 5.4.34, Sydney 4.1.25 (14.52 remaining)

A contentious downfield free after a McVeigh tackle on Matthew Stokes sees Tom 
Hawkins playing on then being called back to take the set shot instead. He 
missed an opportunity in the first quarter and was visibly upset for the next 
few minutes but makes no mistake this time. And there’s that furious cat 
soundbyte again.
 
Goal! Geelong 4.4.28, Sydney 4.1.25 (17.55 remaining)

Blicavs, patched up and no longer wearing the crimson mask, uses his pace to 
gather the ball inside 50 and square it to Mitch Duncan standing at the top of 
the square to put the Cats in front. The first two minutes have been all 
Geelong.
 
The goal you’re likely to be seeing a lot of in the next few days.

The Swans have dominated in the midfield and spent much of the quarter going 
forward, but when Geelong got free and moved the ball the other way they were 
generally unhindered. We’re no closer to knowing who’s going to win this game, 
but it is shaping up as a tight one.

For Geelong the key possession winners in the first quarter were Selwood with 
nine, Mackie and Motlop with eight each. The Swans chief ball winners were 
Lewis Jetta, Jake Lloyd and Josh Kennedy with nine apiece.
 
Goal! Geelong 3.4.22, Sydney 4.1.25 (1.18 remaining)

It’s a great moment for fans of classic crumb as Darcy Lang brings the ball to 
ground at the top of the square and turns around to kick his side’s third goal 
of the evening.
 
Melissa managed to beat the sell out and make it inside. She reports a 
generally civil atmosphere so far.

Fireworks erupted as together, the Sydney Swans and Geelong Cats ran through 
the banner emblazoned with the words #Fairness #Unity and #Respect. There’s 
only a smattering of Sydney supporters among the crowd, so chants of Geelong 
are dominating the game so far. There have been a few boos, but not while 
Goodes has had the ball so far as I can tell.
 
Goal! Geelong 2.1.13, Sydney 4.1.25 (4.38 remaining)

The Cats mess around with it in defence and Goodes gets a fist in to a marking 
contest, gathers the loose ball and snaps a goal. The crowd reaction seemed 
reasonable, more dissatisfaction with a defensive blunder rather than the 
identity of the man who took advantage.
 
Just in case you were looking for something different in your footy commentary 
this evening.

Goal! Geelong 2.1.13, Sydney 3.1.19 (6.15 remaining)

The Swans were fortunate not to concede when a loose ball off hands in the 
goalsquare just beat Darcy Lang over the line. Had it sat up for him he’d have 
walked into an open goal but had to settle for a behind. Each side then had 
their chances, with Goodes prominent in the Sydney forward line but still 
unable to win a clear possession.

Eventually Sydney find Isaac Heeney one-on-one with Nakia Cockatoo just 
outside the goalsquare, and the Swan neatly works his fellow rookie under the 
ball for the mark before kicking truly.
 
Goal! Geelong 2.1.13, Sydney 2.1.13 (10.52 remaining)

Just as I say Sydney haven’t got any marking targets Toby Nankervis bobs up 
with one. After a wait for Mark Blicavs to leave the field with a heavily 
bleeding mouth his set shot floats out to the right where it lands in the 
waiting arms of Tom Mitchell to snap home through a crowd and level the scores.
 
Geelong 2.1.13, Sydney 1.1.7 (11.54 remaining)

Sydney have certainly had the better of the play so far, but haven’t been able 
to create any real goalscoring opportunities. They’ve had the ball inside 50 
eight times but at least for now are sorely lacking a dangerous marking option.
 
Goal! Geelong 2.0.12, Sydney 1.0.6 (14.17 remaining)

It’s a shootout! Darcy Lang converts a tough set shot from the pocket and 
whoever’s on the buttons at Simonds Stadium plays snarlingcat.mp3
 
Goal! Geelong 1.0.6, Sydney 1.0.6 (15.49 remaining)

Just like that the Swans are level. Brandon Jack picks the pocket of Jake 
Kolodjashnij just outside the square and gets boot to ball as he falls to the 
ground. It rolls through and after a cautious start that’s two goals in a 
minute.
 
Goal! Geelong 1.0.6, Sydney 0.0.0 (16.27 remaining)

Geelong survive an early attack and scramble in the goalsquare, but handed the 
ball back immediately and were lucky not to concede in the first minute. Goodes 
was heavily involved early in the Sydney forward line but didn’t manage a clear 
possession yet before Geelong’s first forward thrust of the game ended in 
Andrew Mackie taking a handball from Selwood and just carrying the Sydney 
defenders from outside 50.
 
A look at the joint banner, which handled both milestones and the wider issues 
of the week perfectly reasonably. And we’re ready for the first bounce..

The sides have emerged, and run through the joint banner. Congratulations to 
Joel Selwood for his 200th game and Luke Parker on his 100th.

Selwood has played in wins 78% of the time, and Parker 68%. As a Melbourne 
supporters may I use this space to tell fans of both sides just how jealous I 
am of them.

We’re about five minutes away from the first bounce of what should be a 
fascinating clash on a number of levels.
 
As the sides emerge to run through the joint banner we can see several 
homemade signs in the crowd supporting Goodes. Whether that represents the 
wider view of the audience we’re yet to see, but if I can make a suggestion 
don’t do a Twitter search for any mention of the joint banner if you want to 
retain faith in humanity.

Don’t be entirely distracted by off-field events, this is a crucial game. 
Results elsewhere this weekend have significantly raised the heat on both sides.

Sydney will make the finals, but by virtue of the Western Bulldogs easily 
dispatching Port Adelaide this afternoon they have temporarily been shuffled 
down to fifth. Remember early in the season when the Dogs pulled off a gutsy 
win at the SCG and it seemed like David toppling Goliath? How quickly things 
change. The Swans are not only now a full win behind them, but also carry a 
marginally lower percentage.

Geelong too find themselves under pressure in the battle for 5th to 8th 
courtesy of Adelaide’s win over Richmond last night. If as expected North 
Melbourne defeat the Demons tomorrow a loss this evening will see the Cats a 
full game and percentage outside the eight with time rapidly running out. Not 
only will they lose ground on the sides above them they’ll also have 
Collingwood and GWS breathing down their neck.

It’s hardly curtains (or cat flaps) for the locals if they lose tonight, but 
they don’t have an easy run home. Their game against Hawthorn next week could 
go anywhere, then they play the unpredictable Saints - and even if they take 
one win out of two there they’ll need to get past Collingwood and Adelaide in 
the final fortnight of the home and away season so a fourth in a row tonight 
would provide valuable insurance.

Tonight’s teams: 


Geelong 

Bartel, Blicavs, Caddy, Cockatoo, Duncan, Enright, Gregson, Guthrie, Hawkins, 
Horlin-Smith, Kelly, Kolodjashnij, Lang, Lonergan, Mackie, Motlop, Murdoch, 
Selwood, Stokes, Taylor, Thurlow, Walker

IN: Stokes, Gregson, Horlin-Smith 
OUT: Kersten (toe), Smedts (omitted), Johnson (suspended) 

Sydney 
In a change to the selected side Zak Jones has replaced Ben McGlynn. 

IN: Goodes, Jones 
OUT: Franklin (back), McGlynn (as yet undisclosed reasons) 

Cunningham, Goodes, Grundy, Hannebery, Heeney, B. Jack, K. Jack, Jetta, Jones, 
Kennedy, Laidler, Lloyd, McVeigh, Mitchell, Nankervis, Parker, Rampe, Reid, 
Richards, Shaw, Smith andTippett

In these glorious last few weeks before the substitute rule is abolished (the 
views expressed represent that of the author and not necessary that ofGuardian 
Australia) the men wearing high-visibility vests and riding exercise bikes for 
much of the evening will be Jones for the Swans and Horlin-Smith for Geelong.

For what’s it’s worth I’m tipping the home side to win by 20 points, which all 
but ensures a Swans victory.

First bounce is at 7.20. Feel free to get in touch with your thoughts via email

Good evening all, and welcome to the Round 19 clash between Geelong and Sydney 
from Simonds Stadium (née Kardinia Park). It’s a rare late season clash where 
not only is there plenty at stake for the participating teams, but also for the 
industry itself.

Most of the footy world (e.g. practically everyone not emotionally or 
physically involved with tonight’s West Coast/Hawthorn game) will be waiting 
anxiously to see how dual Brownlow Medal winnerAdam Goodes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-goodes> is received.

The saga surrounding the treatment dished out to the Sydney champion by 
segments of theAFL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl> community reared its 
head again after the Swans travelled to Perth a fortnight ago. Since then the 
debate has become all-consuming, spilling from the sports pages to mainstream 
media both national and international. It’s fair to say that eyes across the 
country will be on this game, and many of them will not be concerned with the 
final score.

After taking a week to gather his thoughts after the initial storm, Goodes 
returns to Sydney’s side tonight. His side are desperate for the four points - 
as are the Cats - but you suspect that the big hitters at the AFL will be 
huddled around a television somewhere hoping that we can see this game through 
in the right spirit and that in the lead-up to finals focus will turn back to 
footyand turn the focus back to footy in the lead up to finals.


In the lead up to the first bounce at 7.20pm AEST, here’s a recap of some of 
the key events of the week:


 * Last Sunday the Swans beat Adelaide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/01/scg-afl-adam-goodes-swans> 
without Goodes. Sydney fans responded to the week of controversy with an 
outpouring of support.

 * On Tuesday AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan denied reports 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/04/gillon-mclachlan-defends-united-afl-commission-over-adam-goodes-issue>
 that the AFL Commission were divided on the league’s firm stance against 
booing of Goodes.

 * The Swans welcomed Goodes back to training the same day. He confirmed he’d 
play this week and said he was “humbled” by the support he’d received from the 
club, Sydney fans and from across the league.

 * As expected Goodes was named in the Sydney side on Thursday night, 
replacing Lance Franklin who has once again succumbed to a back complaint. 
As mentioned below Jonathan Horn made a plea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/07/geelong-show-some-decency-to-adam-goodes-australia-is-watching>
 inThe Guardian for his fellow Geelong fans to show decency towards Goodes. 
Tonight the two clubs will run through a joint banner to show respect, but what 
happens next is largely up to the 25,000 or so people at the ground.

Now, for as long as possible, on to the game.
 
Adam (not that one, the other, less talked about one) will be with shortly to 
bring you up to speed with what’s happening in Geelong, but before he gets into 
his seat, here’s a teaser of Jonathan Horn’s brilliant piece on tonight’s game.

Four years ago, Adam Goodes <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-goodes> 
walked from Geelong’s Kardinia Park in tears. It had been an emotional 
afternoon. His captain’s baby daughter had died during the week and the Swans 
devoted their win to her memory. Geelong hadn’t been beaten on their home 
ground for eons but Sydney played out of their skins. Goodes pretty much won it 
off his own boot in the final term.

The Geelong fans clapped him off, just as Essendon supporters had applauded 
him a few weeks earlier, after he narrowly missed a set shot after the siren. 
Later, on the night of his 300th game, he was clapped off again. He was not yet 
an affront to the mainstream. It was all very polite and respectful.
