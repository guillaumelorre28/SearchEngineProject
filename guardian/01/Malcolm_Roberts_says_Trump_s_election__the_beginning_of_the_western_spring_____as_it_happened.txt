Night time politics

 * As we leave #politicslive, the debate has started in the Senate over the 
Adler shotgun import ban. This relates to the lever-action shotgun that has 
been under a temporary import ban as it waits for the state governments decide 
what category it should be put in. It caused a controversy over whether David 
Leyonhjelm was offered a reprieve for the gun in return of his vote on the 
Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-19/abbott-says-'no-deal'-negotiated-with-leyonhjelm-over-adler-ban/7948112>
. At issue tonight is whether the import ban should be lifted. The debate has 
just been postponed for the dinner break.

 * George Brandis has suggested his own LNP Queensland opposition is “very, 
very mediocre” when talking to Victorian Liberal president Michael Kroger in 
front of a live microphone. He says One Nation will win a fair few seats in the 
next Queensland election.

 * Peter Dutton has elaborated on his earlier comments regarding mistakes in 
Australia’s migration stream made under Malcolm Fraser in the 1970s. The two 
big intakes in that period were Vietnamese and Lebanese migrants. Asked by 
Labor, Dutton said Lebanese Muslims of second or third generation represented 
the biggest majority of those charged with terrorism offences.

 * One Nation senator Rod Culleton appeared in the high court for a directions 
hearing on his eligibility as a senator. The hearing was set down for December 
7-8. Bob Katter went down there too to provide moral support – interesting 
given the rumours that he might jump the One Nation ship to Katter. Both men 
ruled it out today (unless Culleton gets the shove).

 * After a Deloitte’s report that predicted a budget deficit blowout of $24bn 
over the next four years, Scott Morrison did agree the budget situation was 
worsening - or rather the numbers were moving. A balanced budget by 2020-2021 
is not so likely by the sound of the treasurer.

 * Question time was led by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, who 
flicked most of the questions to the relevant ministers.

That’s it for tonight. Thanks to the brains trust, Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens, 
Katharine Murphyand Mike Bowers.

By late this evening, we should have a vote on the Adler and rest assured 
Guardian will keep you posted.

See you on the morrow.

Senator Ian Macdonald thanks Malcolm Roberts for bringing a rational debate on 
climate change in the Senate.

Labor’s Jenny McAllister says the Senate should not be wasting an hour on 
whether it is real but should be spending a month on possible solutions.

LNP Liberal senator Ian Macdonald says it is not appropriate for the Greens to 
be sniggering. This is an important debate, says he.

Of course the climate changes, it always has.

Macdonald says he had a visit from a little girl from the Pacific Islands. She 
was worried about her island and climate change. He had to tell her it’s been 
happening for a long time and there was nothing Australia could do.

The climate of the world continually changes from what it was years ago.

The Greens senator Nick McKim has produced a tin foil hat for One Nation’s 
senatorMalcolm Roberts. He asks, why are we wasting our time on this?

What about the moon landing? Is Tasmania an island?

When you close your eyes senator, is it still there?

The National party senator John Williams is speaking on climate change now.

In the background, Michaelia Cash calls over Pauline Hanson. They leave the 
chamber together. Negotiations on the industrial relations bills are obviously 
continuing apace.

BTW, the Senate passed Eric Abetz’s motion against the Labor senator Kimberley 
Kitching by 35-21.

The Senate notes: 


 * The Fair Work Commission found Ms Kimberley Kitching provided untruthful 
and unreliable evidence in Health Services Union-Victoria No. 1 Branch [2015] 
FWC 3359. It also found her conduct strikes at the heart of the integrity of 
the right of entry permit system. This decision was upheld on appeal by three 
members. 
 * Calls on anyone appearing before the Fair Work Commission to provide 
reliable and truthful evidence.

Sorry I should explain. 

This is the Malcolm Roberts “matter of public importance”, being debated in 
the Senate.

The policy position of the Australian government towards the disputed theory 
of global warming with the election of Mr Trump as president, who is well known 
to reject exaggerated claims of anthropogenic climate change.

Roberts says One Nation is working on its links with the Trump camp. He might 
be able to help Trump.

Here comes Malcolm Roberts. He is very excited by the election of Donald J. 
Trump. 

The eeeeelites are wetting their beds, he says.

This is the beginning of the Western Spring.

There is a question in the thread about the Adler disallowance motion. The 
Senate is a funny place but this is how I understand it.

A disallowance motion reverses or “disallows” previous action. In the case of 
the Adler, a temporary import ban was put in place. Leyonhjelm moves the 
disallowance to get rid of the ban.

The key political point is this: if Leyonhjelm wins the vote, the gun comes in 
(again).

If Leyonhjelm loses the vote, the gun stays out.

The ones to watch are the National party senators.

 * As we leave #politicslive, the debate has started in the Senate over the 
Adler shotgun import ban. This relates to the lever-action shotgun that has 
been under a temporary import ban as it waits for the state governments decide 
what category it should be put in. It caused a controversy over whether David 
Leyonhjelm was offered a reprieve for the gun in return of his vote on the 
Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-19/abbott-says-'no-deal'-negotiated-with-leyonhjelm-over-adler-ban/7948112>
. At issue tonight is whether the import ban should be lifted. The debate has 
just been postponed for the dinner break.

 * George Brandis has suggested his own LNP Queensland opposition is “very, 
very mediocre” when talking to Victorian Liberal president Michael Kroger in 
front of a live microphone. He says One Nation will win a fair few seats in the 
next Queensland election.

 * Peter Dutton has elaborated on his earlier comments regarding mistakes in 
Australia’s migration stream made under Malcolm Fraser in the 1970s. The two 
big intakes in that period were Vietnamese and Lebanese migrants. Asked by 
Labor, Dutton said Lebanese Muslims of second or third generation represented 
the biggest majority of those charged with terrorism offences.

 * One Nation senator Rod Culleton appeared in the high court for a directions 
hearing on his eligibility as a senator. The hearing was set down for December 
7-8. Bob Katter went down there too to provide moral support – interesting 
given the rumours that he might jump the One Nation ship to Katter. Both men 
ruled it out today (unless Culleton gets the shove).

 * After a Deloitte’s report that predicted a budget deficit blowout of $24bn 
over the next four years, Scott Morrison did agree the budget situation was 
worsening - or rather the numbers were moving. A balanced budget by 2020-2021 
is not so likely by the sound of the treasurer.

 * Question time was led by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, who 
flicked most of the questions to the relevant ministers.

That’s it for tonight. Thanks to the brains trust, Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens, 
Katharine Murphyand Mike Bowers.

See you on the morrow.

Senator Ian Macdonald thanks Malcolm Roberts for bringing a rational debate on 
climate change in the Senate.

Labor’s Jenny McAllister says the Senate should not be wasting an hour on 
whether it is real but should be spending a month on possible solutions.
 
LNP Liberal senator Ian Macdonald says it is not appropriate for the Greens to 
be sniggering. This is an important debate, says he.

Of course the climate changes, it always has.

Macdonald says he had a visit from a little girl from the Pacific Islands. She 
was worried about her island and climate change. He had to tell her it’s been 
happening for a long time and there was nothing Australia could do.

The climate of the world continually changes from what it was years ago.
 
The Greens senator Nick McKim has produced a tin foil hat for One Nation’s 
senatorMalcolm Roberts. He asks, why are we wasting our time on this?

What about the moon landing? Is Tasmania an island?

When you close your eyes senator, is it still there?

The National party senator John Williams is speaking on climate change now.

In the background, Michaelia Cash calls over Pauline Hanson. They leave the 
chamber together. Negotiations on the industrial relations bills are obviously 
continuing apace.
 
BTW, the Senate passed Eric Abetz’s motion against the Labor senator Kimberley 
Kitching by 35-21.

The Senate notes: 


 * The Fair Work Commission found Ms Kimberley Kitching provided untruthful 
and unreliable evidence in Health Services Union-Victoria No. 1 Branch [2015] 
FWC 3359. It also found her conduct strikes at the heart of the integrity of 
the right of entry permit system. This decision was upheld on appeal by three 
members. 
 * Calls on anyone appearing before the Fair Work Commission to provide 
reliable and truthful evidence.  
Sorry I should explain. 

This is the Malcolm Roberts “matter of public importance”, being debated in 
the Senate.

The policy position of the Australian government towards the disputed theory 
of global warming with the election of Mr Trump as president, who is well known 
to reject exaggerated claims of anthropogenic climate change.

Roberts says One Nation is working on its links with the Trump camp. He might 
be able to help Trump.
 
Here comes Malcolm Roberts. He is very excited by the election of Donald J. 
Trump. 

The eeeeelites are wetting their beds, he says.

This is the beginning of the Western Spring.
