Night time politics

I better step away from the live publishing tool now.

 * The day was dominated by the gun issue after David Leyonhjelm said he would 
negotiate on the government’s industrial relation laws with other issues. He 
has said before the Coalition dudded him on a deal to support a migration bill 
in return for a sunset clause on the Adler gun import ban.

 * The story then got away and the prime minister, while underlining his 
support for the Howard-Fischer National Firearms Agreement , refused to rule 
out negotiating on the Adler. The commonwealth with meet with the states on 
this issue on Friday. It is up to the states and the commonwealth to decide on 
what to do with the Adler.

 * When Labor brought on a motion in parliament, Turnbull ruled out any 
weakening of the gun laws. But the government position remains that there is an 
import ban on the Adler until the Coag decides how to categorise it.

 * Question time was dominated by the issue, which drowned out the Coalition’s 
determination to focus on the industrial relations bills. The ABCC bill passed 
with the Xenophon independent in the lower house late today. It can’t go to the 
senate until November 7 at the earliest.

 * In estimates, Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs withstood 
five hours questioning. Some of it related to Tim Wilson’s role. Some related 
to her views that politicians were generally ill-educated.

 * The ABC managing director Michelle Guthrie and colleagues also took some 
fairly rigorous question. 
Tomorrow we have more estimates and more lower house. Thanks to the blog 
feeders,Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens, Amanda Meade, Jasper Lindell and Mikey 
Bowers.As well as you, dear readers. 

Good night.

The ABCC bill has just gone through the lower house.

NXT senator Rebekha Sharkie voted for the bill. Which gives you an idea of 
whereNick Xenophon is going to go in the Senate. He is looking to amend in the 
Senate.

Indi independent Cathy McGowan also voted for the bill.

Denison independent Andrew Wilkie voted against.

Bob Katter was not listed in the vote.

Alannah & Madeline Foundation’s CEO Lesley Podesta has been meeting with MPs 
in Canberra today to urge them to maintain strong gun laws.
 Walter Mikac, father of Alanna and Madeline who with their mother Nanette, 
were killed in the Port Arthur massacre. 
The Alannah & Madeline Foundation is calling for urgent action to ensure that 
our firearm laws remain strong, and asks that:

1. All states and territories pledge to ensure their gun laws are maintained 
in line with the National Firearms Agreement 1996, and continue to do so.

2. All firearms capable of firing multiple shots in quick succession and which 
could be used to harm a number of people in a short amount of time should be 
restricted, including theAdler A110.

The Foundation is running a petition 
<https://www.change.org/p/sign-to-help-keep-all-australians-safe-from-gun-violence>
 to that effect.

I better step away from the live publishing tool now.

 * The day was dominated by the gun issue after David Leyonhjelm said he would 
negotiate on the government’s industrial relation laws with other issues. He 
has said before the Coalition dudded him on a deal to support a migration bill 
in return for a sunset clause on the Adler gun import ban.

 * The story then got away and the prime minister, while underlining his 
support for the Howard-Fischer National Firearms Agreement , refused to rule 
out negotiating on the Adler. The commonwealth with meet with the states on 
this issue on Friday. It is up to the states and the commonwealth to decide on 
what to do with the Adler.

 * When Labor brought on a motion in parliament, Turnbull ruled out any 
weakening of the gun laws. But the government position remains that there is an 
import ban on the Adler until the Coag decides how to categorise it.

 * Question time was dominated by the issue, which drowned out the Coalition’s 
determination to focus on the industrial relations bills. The ABCC bill passed 
with the Xenophon independent in the lower house late today. It can’t go to the 
senate until November 7 at the earliest.

 * In estimates, Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs withstood 
five hours questioning. Some of it related to Tim Wilson’s role. Some related 
to her views that politicians were generally ill-educated.

 * The ABC managing director Michelle Guthrie and colleagues also took some 
fairly rigorous question. 
Tomorrow we have more estimates and more lower house. Thanks to the blog 
feeders,Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens, Amanda Meade, Jasper Lindell and Mikey 
Bowers.As well as you, dear readers. 

Good night.
 
The ABCC bill has just gone through the lower house.

NXT senator Rebekha Sharkie voted for the bill. Which gives you an idea of 
whereNick Xenophon is going to go in the Senate. He is looking to amend in the 
Senate.

Indi independent Cathy McGowan also voted for the bill.

Denison independent Andrew Wilkie voted against.

Bob Katter was not listed in the vote.
 
Alannah & Madeline Foundation’s CEO Lesley Podesta has been meeting with MPs 
in Canberra today to urge them to maintain strong gun laws.
 Walter Mikac, father of Alanna and Madeline who with their mother Nanette, 
were killed in the Port Arthur massacre. 
The Alannah & Madeline Foundation is calling for urgent action to ensure that 
our firearm laws remain strong, and asks that:

1. All states and territories pledge to ensure their gun laws are maintained 
in line with the National Firearms Agreement 1996, and continue to do so.

2. All firearms capable of firing multiple shots in quick succession and which 
could be used to harm a number of people in a short amount of time should be 
restricted, including theAdler A110.

The Foundation is running a petition 
<https://www.change.org/p/sign-to-help-keep-all-australians-safe-from-gun-violence>
 to that effect.
 
The prime minister is speaking on the ABCC bill. Given most government 
questions spoke to this bill during question time, I won’t give you chapter and 
verse on it.
