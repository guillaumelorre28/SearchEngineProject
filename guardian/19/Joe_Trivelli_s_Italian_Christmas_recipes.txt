There is in my family a deep appreciation for Christmas. We begin with a trip 
across town to buy a tree and, from then on, all surfaces are laden with the 
appropriate kitsch. The warm atmosphere is fuelled by the candles of constantly 
spinning angel chimes and the only space in the house is the empty shelf in the
Christmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> cupboard. I 
jokingly protest but with each year I love it more and every day we celebrate 
in the kitchen.

I love to cook afresh with the extra time in the holidays, taking new 
approaches with known ingredients and recipes. Here, I’ve used things one might 
find lying around already, such as sprouts and Brazil nuts. So, while these 
dishes are loosely based on things I’ve eaten in Italy, they could also be 
described as Anglo-Italian – except the pizza pie which is a straight-up 
Neapolitan classic. “When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie …” I can 
hear everyone singing it now, and I can imagine immigrants from the south of 
Italy (like my grandfather) eating new versions of this with whatever they 
could find in the US at Christmas time a hundred years ago. This is the spirit 
of these recipes. Italian-ish, maybe. I’m far less of a purist, at least in the 
holidays, and am more interested in having fun in the kitchen. Some are beyond 
easy, others take a bit longer; but they are all straightforward, tasty and 
just slightly different to what you thought you were going to make.

At the end, there are two desserts. Nora Ephron says in her essay What I Wish 
I’d Known that you can order more than one dessert. My wife did this week, and 
I think I am therefore allowed this, not just now but forever.

Slow roast stuffed duck

Ducks and geese are stuffed in the same manner as a whole pig in central 
Italy. Keep removing the fat during cooking and you’ll end up with a delicious, 
fragrant Christmas roast. Toss whole peeled potatoes into the roasting tray if 
you’d like to, but if you want to try a goose, leave the fresh pork out.

Serves 6
duck 1, with liver, heart and gizzards
garlic 2 cloves
fennel leaves 1 sprig and/or 1tsp fennel seeds
rosemary 2 sprigs, leaves removed
good salami 80g, cubed
whole peppercorns 8
lemon 1, zested
baby back ribs 1 rack, cut into 3
quinces 2
honey 2 tbsp
fennel 4 bulbs

Heat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7.

Chop the duck offal together with the garlic, fennel tops, half the rosemary, 
salami, peppercorns and lemon zest. Cut away any excess fat from the cavity of 
the duck and turn over. Using strong scissors cut either side of the back bone 
to open the duck up. Season and fill with the stuffing. Close, overlapping the 
two sides and tie tight around the middle to secure it shut; then at either end 
and between them again, making sure it’s closed fast. Take your time doing 
this, it’s even more satisfying than wrapping presents. Chop the rest of the 
rosemary and cover the pork with it.

Put the meat in a capacious deep roasting pan and season. Put into the hot 
oven for 30 minutes until it starts to smell good and a lot of fat has rendered 
out. Remove, turn the heat down to 150C/gas mark 2. and pour off the fat.

Peel the quinces, core, cut into quarters and toss with honey. Halve the 
fennel bulbs. Add to the pan with the meat, loosely cover with tin foil and 
return to the oven. Roast for a further 1½ hours, going to the oven door to 
baste and turn things around from time to time.

It is possible to make this pie without a leavened crust, but this is the 
better version. A centrepiece of the antipasto table, Neapolitans eat this on 
Christmas Eve.

Serves 6, as a starter
For the pizza
dried yeast 1 tsp
tepid water 140g
good quality organic strong bread (or pasta) flour 200g
salt 4g

escarole 1 head (400g-ish)
garlic 2 cloves, peeled
anchovy fillets 6
green and black olives 50g, roughly chopped
pine nuts 20g
salted capers 20g, rinsed (not under vinegar)
currants 15g, soaked in hot water
pepper

To make the dough, mix the yeast with the water and leave for 5 minutes before 
mixing into the flour with salt. This can be done in a bowl and then 
transferred to the surface for kneading. Knead for 8 minutes, keep turning by 
90° and stretching the dough out. Once soft and springy, cover with plastic and 
allow half an hour at room temperature before moving to the fridge for 24 
hours. Should you keep a bread starter you can substitute a soft dough of your 
own. Allow the dough to come back to room temperature before stretching.

For the filling, thoroughly clean and roughly chop the escarole. If you can’t 
find escarole, frisée is a close relative and a good alternative. Heat 3 
tablespoons of olive oil in a pot with the garlic. When the garlic is golden 
add the anchovies, olives, pine nuts, capers and drained currants. Stir a bit, 
bin the garlic, pile on the washed escarole and put a lid on. Cook for about 10 
minutes, stirring often until really quite cooked. If it looks especially wet, 
wait until mostly evaporated. Season just with pepper, as it should be salty 
enough, and allow to cool.

Heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and generously oil a 20cm cake tin. Handling 
gently, cut off ⅔ of the dough and begin to stretch into a round on a floured 
surface. Gently roll out until it fits the tin like a pie crust. Then fill with 
the escarole and cover with the other piece of dough which you have also 
rolled. Turn the first dough over the second at the edges to make a border. 
Brush with olive oil and prick some holes through the top with a fork.

Bake for 35 minutes, until golden on the top and sides. Best enjoyed once 
cooled a bit.

Brussels sprouts under oil

This simple antipasto fills a gap that traditionally would be insalta del 
rinforzo, anglicised with brussels sprouts. Spared the usual soggy overcooking, 
they retain a vegetable heat all their own, like mild horseradish. Add 
peppercorns, or chillis, if you’d like more of a hit. I’ll keep some of these 
to eat with the leftover cold cuts and cheeses.

Serves 6
brussels sprouts 200g
cauliflower florets 150g
garlic cloves 2
sundried tomatoes 50g
red wine vinegar 2 tbsp
olive oil

Really peel back the sprouts to their “sweeter” hearts. If they look a third 
of their size, all the better. Cut some small cauliflower florets about the 
same size and slice the tomatoes lengthways into four. Cut the garlic cloves 
into two and bring them to the boil in a pot of cold water with a large pinch 
of sea salt. Let them boil for five minutes before adding the sprouts and 
cauliflower and letting them boil another four. Then add the tomatoes and leave 
for two minutes. Drain and spread out.


When they are mostly dry but still hot toss with the vinegar and put in a jar 
or bowl and cover with oil (and more salt, to taste). When they are cool, cover 
and move to the fridge.

Eat cold. Better after 24 hours. They’ll keep all holiday (10 days) in the 
fridge. Make the person with a cold eat the garlic cloves and, so as not to be 
wasteful, re-use the oil.

Brazil nuts are full of nutrients but, don’t worry, they’re also wildly rich. 
The cooking and squeezing of the radicchio helps to remove its bitterness, 
however, if you can find a posh forced Italian radicchio, it’s not so much of 
an issue.

Serves 4
brazil nuts 8
radicchio ½ head
water 3 tbsp
extra virgin olive oil 30ml
garlic a thin slice from the tip of a clove
lemon
celery 1 head
truffle 1 (optional)

Soak the brazil nuts overnight in water. Tear the leaves from the radicchio 
and blanch in highly salted boiling water for 2 minutes. Move straight into a 
bowl of ice water and quickly cool. Then return to the boiling water for 
another 2 minutes and again to the ice. Once cold, squeeze dry.

Drain the nuts and put in a blender with the water, oil, garlic, a small 
spritz of lemon and pinch of salt. Whizz for a minute and pass through a fine 
sieve or tea strainer.

Peel the celery back to half its size and slice off only the exposed part of 
the root. Pick some of the pale leaves and slice thinly. Toss everything and 
serve with the truffle grated or sliced on top.

Pear, persimmon and ricotta crostata

 Pear, persimmon and ricotta crostata. Photograph: Jean Cazals for the Observer 
Persimmons are overlooked, particularly as there are fewer varieties of winter 
fruit. This crostata is not too sweet, so be careful with the nutmeg lest it 
take over.

Serves 8
toasted hazelnuts 50g
flour 200g
icing sugar 70g
salt a pinch
butter 90g, cubed
whole eggs 3
pears 2, very ripe
persimmons 2
lemon zest and juice of 1
ricotta 350g
golden caster sugar 70g
egg yolk 1
cream 100ml
nutmeg

Blitz the nuts in a food processor. Add the flour, blitz some more and then 
pulse in the sugar, salt and finally the butter. When crumbed, add an egg 
taking care not to overwork. Bring the dough together on the surface and chill 
for 45 minutes. Then break or cut off pieces and press into a 25cm tart shell 
until uniformly covered and freeze for 30 minutes.

Heat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5 and blind bake the shell with a piece of 
baking paper filled with baking beans. Cook until golden, about 30 minutes, 
removing the paper for the last five.

Lower the oven to 160C/gas mark 2½. Bring 400ml of water to the boil with the 
lemon juice. Slice the pears into ½ cm slices removing the pips and poach for 4 
minutes, less if very ripe. Take out of the syrup. Slice the persimmons the 
same size. Whisk the ricotta with sugar, 2 eggs and 1 yolk, cream, ½ the lemon 
zest, and a scratch of fresh nutmeg. Fill up the tart shell by alternating 
fruit and ricotta until full the brim. Bake for 35 minutes turning half way 
through. Serve completely cool, dusted with icing sugar.

 Sorbetto al caffè corretto. Photograph: Jean Cazals for the Observer 
 This is almost a drink where the alcohol nearly stops it from freezing. Serve 
in frozen espresso cups and consume quickly. You can dance all night if you eat 
it all.

Serves 4
mint leaves 4
very strong double espresso 1
egg white 1
icing sugar 45g
water 45ml
grappa 45ml

Infuse the mint leaves into the hot coffee. Whisk the egg white with the sugar 
in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water until thick, shiny and hot. 
Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly before adding the coffee, 
leaves removed, water and grappa. Cover and freeze for four hours in the bowl, 
whisking with a fork after the first hour and again before serving. Don’t worry 
if it looks like it’s separating – it’ll come together in the end.
