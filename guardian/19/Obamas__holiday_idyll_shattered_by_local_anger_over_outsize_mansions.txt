When the Obama family start their summer holidays this week on the quaint New 
England island of Martha’s Vineyard, off the coast ofMassachusetts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/massachusetts>, they can expect to relax 
in the solitude and privacy they have enjoyed during their previous five 
visits. TheWashington Post called the president the equivalent of a vacationing 
Yeti: “Many have had near brushes with the leader of the free world, but only a 
precious few have actually laid eyes on him.”

But film-maker Thomas Bena says the house the Obamas are renting this year is 
a prime example of the kind of mega-construction that is threatening to destroy 
the character of the island.

Bena has spent 12 years making a film called One Big Home, which is being 
shown to islanders this weekend. It documents an issue that is as tricky for 
residents of the Vineyard as it is for beach destinations everywhere: how to 
protect small communities from the distortions created by an influx of wealthy 
visitors who come for just eight weeks of the year. The film chronicles Bena’s 
crusade against the proliferation of outsize homes in the town of Chilmark, 
where he lives with his wife, Mollie, and daughter, Emma.

Bena argues that the giant homes, often referred to as McMansions, are not 
only out of proportion with their environment, but wasteful symbols of the 
over-reaching vanity of their absentee owners. Over the past 20 years, what 
started as an aberration is now a trend: mansionisation, or the practice of 
building the largest possible house on a plot of land.

“For me, this is more gross than mere conspicuous consumption,” says Bena. 
“It’s another type of gentrification. We need to start taking care of our 
communities and be more careful with land use and zoning.”

A backlash has started, with people in Martha’s Vineyard and in the Hamptons 
on Long Island questioning the wisdom of land being turned over to mansions 
that sit empty, but heated, for 10 months of the year. In Los Angeles, the city 
planning commission recently voted to eliminate various loopholes, including 
one that grants a 20% square footage bonus for building “green”, that has been 
contributing to bigger-is-better mansionisation.

But on Martha’s Vineyard, Bena’s campaign to limit the size of new houses in 
Chilmark caused a stir in the community. Some said the plan sounded 
un-American: the social disruption that comes with gentrification is part of 
the price. “That’s America, like it or not,” the Chilmark building inspector 
Leonard Jason Jr tells the film-maker. “Big houses are what some people feel 
they need. You can always leave.”

Bena believes McMansions have contributed to a new sense of “us and them” – 
local people and summer visitors. “In the summer, you feel that tension 
wherever you go,” he says. “People put a smile on their face because they don’t 
want to bite the hand that feeds them, but it’s there.”

When the president takes his family out to eat, there will be 10 cars in his 
motorcade and a bus for the press, says Bena. “He’s vacationing on a small 
island where people dress down and try to drive older cars. The ethos remains 
intellectuals and artists living in cottages.”

The fisherman Chris Murphy points out: “The more that people trickle in, the 
more they socialise with their own. There’s not that same mixing that used to 
occur. A community should be able to determine its own destiny.”

In 2013, the community of Chilmark voted to introduce a sliding scale that 
would effectively limit house size in the district to 3,500 sq ft.

The film (and legislation) is not anti-wealth, Bena says, but pro-community. 
“The only power the little people have is the power of the vote. So we got 
together and said we want to preserve the rural character of our town. We’re 
not saying we don’t like wealthy people. We’re saying we have a sense of place 
here and we want to maintain that.”
