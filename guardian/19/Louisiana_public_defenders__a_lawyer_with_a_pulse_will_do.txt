Last fall, insurance attorney Ryan Goodwin found himself in a visiting area of 
the Caddo correctional center in Shreveport,Louisiana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana>, bracing for an awkward 
conversation. He had to make an admission to his new client – a 16-year-old who 
was facing life in prison for stealing someone’s wallet and cellphone at 
gunpoint.

“I don’t do criminal defense,” he told the teenager, Norman Williams Jr. “But 
I promise you, I’ll definitely try my best.”

Goodwin typically represents insurance companies in litigation following car 
accidents. His job involves finding out what injuries the victim claims to have 
and whether they were caused by the crash. He has no criminal law experience.

But because the Caddo Parish public defender’s office was suffering from a 
historic, statewide lack of funding, it could no longer provide counsel to 
hundreds of its poor clients. To fill the void, judges were randomly assigning 
the neglected cases to all the lawyers in Shreveport, including those 
specializing in real estate, personal injury, taxes and adoption. Anyone with a 
law license, a professional address in the parish and a pulse was placed 
alphabetically on a list. They could be called on at any moment to take a 
criminal case, unpaid.

For Goodwin, this presented a moral dilemma. When he met Norman, he knew he 
wasn’t fit to represent him, but a court of law was telling him that he was. “I 
took generic criminal law and criminal procedure in law school, but that’s just 
two classes separating me from any person,” he says.

“I wouldn’t want me representing me.”

Louisiana’s public defender system: ‘If you’re alive and have a law license, 
you’re eligible’

Goodwin decided to write a letter 
<https://www.themarshallproject.org/documents/3001071-Letter-to-Judge-Mosely#.HrEVkS7MT>
 to the judge, John Mosely Jr, who had assigned him the case. “I understand the 
current status of the indigent defense office, as well as my civic duty,” he 
wrote. “But the possibility that a young man could spend a significant amount 
of time in prison poses a difficult burden on me, considering my rudimentary 
knowledge of criminal procedure.”

The judge kept him on the case.

So Goodwin wound up at the Caddo correctional center, attempting to explain 
the situation to his young client. “I tried to tell him about the constitution: 
that you have rights, that you have the right to a qualified attorney,” Goodwin 
says.

“But the way things are, I think he was happy just to have any lawyer, period.”

As Louisiana continues to provide insufficient, unreliable funding for the 
legal representation of the poor – “on a scale unprecedented in the history of 
American public defense”, warned an openletter 
<http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/uncategorized/GAO/2016mar30_louisianapublicdef_l.authcheckdam.pdf>
 by the president of the American Bar Association – public defenders across the 
state have barely scraped by, foregoing office necessities and laying off 
attorneys and essential staff.

Earlier this year, many of these offices had so few staff that they resorted 
to placing hundreds of their clients – even those sitting in jail, awaiting 
trial – on “waitlists” to receive a lawyer. “Conflict cases”, with multiple 
co-defendants requiring multiple lawyers, had become especially overwhelming 
for the defenders to handle.

The human toll of America's public defender crisis

<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/public-defender-us-criminal-justice-system>
In Caddo Parish, where Ryan Goodwin was asked to help, budget shortfalls 
forced the public defender to cut 12 attorney positions, leaving only 22 
lawyers to handle more than 15,000 cases. In Lafayette, another populous parish 
215 miles south-east of Caddo, the defender had to cut 47 of 65 attorneys. The 
waitlist there has more than 4,500 defendants, many facing life in prison.

The issue now facing judges and courts across the state is how to ensure a 
functional – and constitutional – justice system in the wake of these 
shortages. In New Orleans, for example, Judge Arthur Hunterruled 
<http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2016/04/orleans_judge_halts_prosecutio.html>
 on 8 April that poor defendants sitting on a waitlist must be released from 
jail until the public defender can represent them. Prosecutors are appealing 
several of those defendants’ cases .

Everywhere else in the state, however, judges have taken more conservative 
approaches.

Their ‘solution’ is to put up cardboard cut-outs of defense lawyers in place 
of spending money on real public defenders
Stephen Singer, Loyola University 
“I’m not going to be the one that lets one of them out, unless a higher court 
tells me I must,” says Jacque Derr, the district judge of Winn Parish, a rural 
area in central Louisiana. “What I’m scared of is some serious offender who is 
guilty ending up walking down our streets because of this … All I can do is 
find a lawyer to agree to do it, or else these suckers are fixing to be home 
free.”

This summer, that is exactly what many of Louisiana’s judges have done. Judge 
Derr has conscripted his city prosecutor to also help out as a public defender. 
And instead of releasing inmates, the judges in Caddo Parish and elsewhere have 
appointed non-criminal attorneys like Goodwin to take criminal cases that they 
may not be equipped for.

“It’s a way of trying to paper over a funding problem without funding – to 
make sure that no matter what, they can keep their prosecutions going,” says 
Stephen Singer, a law professor at Loyola University and formerly the chief of 
trials and general counsel of the New Orleans public defender’s office. “Their 
‘solution’ is to put up cardboard cut-outs of defense lawyers in place of 
actually spending the money on real public defenders.”

‘Like asking a dentist to do heart surgery’

Shreveport, the seat of Caddo Parish, was the last capital of the Confederacy. 
Directly in front of its courthouse, a monument to the cause reads: “Lest We 
Forget.”

The city was also home to a branch of the Standard Oil company, but 
Louisiana’s oil and gas industry has struggled in recent years, leading to an 
economic downturn that affected funding for public services such as indigent 
defense. Today, casinos and strip clubs light up its mid-rise skyline, and 
billboards for lawyers (“One Call, Y’all!”) line the highways.

On a humid day in June, many of those lawyers are gathered for a luncheon 
thrown by the Shreveport Bar Association. Dressed in seersucker suits and bow 
ties, they are crowded around the buffet, spooning fried catfish and black-eyed 
peas on to their plates. Between bites, everyone is commiserating about the 
public defender’s funding crisis, and how ill-equipped they are to fill in. “I 
just got another one this week!” says Richard Lamb, a tax attorney who admits 
he has never argued a case in court.

The analogies seem to come easy: 

“It’s like asking a dentist to do heart surgery,” Lamb says. 

“It’s like if we told a prosecutor to do a medical malpractice suit,” says 
Goodwin, the insurance attorney.

“What if private lawyers were appointed to be DAs?” says Steve Baker, an 
adoption attorney, later in the day. “We’d probably just dismiss a lot of the 
cases, and they don’t want that.”

Another civil attorney, Jim McMichael, chimes in with a funny story about how 
a defendant put an arm around his appointed lawyer’s shoulder and said: “Would 
it help if I told the judge that I also thought you were incompetent?”

Goodwin – whose former client Norman Williams Jr made a deal with the district 
attorney to testify against another defendant and is now doing five years in 
prison – says he cannot tell if this is all a comedy or a tragedy. “We’re 
sharing laughs over beers about how my friend was assigned to represent a 
pimp,” he says. “But then again, someone’s liberty is at stake here.”

On at least three occasions in the past, Caddo Parish has taken the same 
draft-a-lawyer route out of a public defender crisis – and criminal defendants 
have fared far worse than Williams. In 1984, the local bar had divided all of 
Shreveport’s lawyers alphabetically, just as judges did again this year, to 
represent the indigent. In one murder case, a man named Glenn Ford was randomly 
assigned to be defended by an oil and gas attorney and a slip-and-fall 
insurance attorney. They failed to challenge prosecutors’ selection of an 
all-white jury, which then found Ford guilty after deliberating for only three 
hours. He spent the last three decades of his life on death row before being 
exonerated in March 2014.

Ford, one of the longest-serving death row inmates to be exonerated in the US, 
died a year after he was released 
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/glenn-ford-wrongfully-convicted-in-louisiana-murder-case-dies-at-65/2015/07/04/0dfa3cec-2266-11e5-84d5-eb37ee8eaa61_story.html>
 from prison. The state of Louisiana never provided compensation to him or his 
family.

This time around, to better prepare their lawyers for these assigned cases, 
the local bar association planned a seminar on criminal law for non-criminal 
attorneys. (One flyer read: “This Will Sell Out, So Make Your Reservation Now!”)

On a Friday in May, more than 20 private attorneys filed into the basement of 
the Caddo Parish courthouse, where they learned the “Do’s and Don’t’s of 
Providing Effective Assistance” in criminal cases. Over a three-hour period, a 
judge, a representative from the DA’s office, a former DA and a former public 
defender showed them PowerPoint presentations on how to interview a client 
(compare what the client is saying with what you know from the police report), 
how to visit a jail (show your bar card) and how to file basic motions. They 
also provided examples of the differences between criminal and civil rules for 
evidence. In the final few minutes, volunteers were chosen to practice their 
newfound skills in several courtroom scenarios, including a mock arraignment 
and bail hearing.

“We ran out of time before all the questions could get answered,” says Jim 
McMichael, the bar association attorney who helped organize the seminar. 
“People were so concerned, saying: ‘I don’t know what I’m doing.’”

Some in attendance were unimpressed with the crash course. “In three hours, 
they’re supposed to become criminal defenders?” says Henry Walker, a longtime 
criminal defense attorney in Shreveport and the former president of the 
Louisiana criminal defense bar. “They just learned how to trust the DA, make 
quick deals, dispose of the case and go back to their real jobs.”

But Judge Brady O’Callaghan, who helped implement Caddo Parish’s system of 
appointing private lawyers, believes many of them are more capable than they 
have given themselves credit for. “If someone can depose a doctor for five 
hours, they can do a plea hearing,” he says. “I’ve never known a lawyer to tell 
a paying client: ‘I can’t learn this, I’m sorry.’”

In O’Callaghan’s view, all these lawyers have a professional obligation to 
offer their assistance, when needed, to the poor. “This is not something we’re 
ecstatic about,” he says. “It’s not like we’re just picking out of a hat and 
saying: ‘Hey, let’s see what happens’ … But as a temporary solution, it is 
better than either releasing these defendants from jail or incarcerating them 
without any lawyer.”

This is not something we’re ecstatic about. It’s not like we’re picking out of 
a hat and saying ‘Let’s see what happens'
Judge Brady O'Callaghan 
The appointed lawyers say their lack of experience is only part of the 
problem. The court also does not pay them to take the cases and rarely offers 
funds for hiring investigators or expert witnesses. They have little incentive, 
in other words, to investigate crime scenes, call witnesses, meet clients and 
their families, and study up on the developments in criminal law in the years 
since they left law school.

“We’re going to prioritize our paying cases, there’s no denying it,” says 
David Turansky, a former divorce lawyer who now focuses on personal injury 
cases. “We’re just not going to spend our time learning constitutional law or 
what a ‘Batson challenge’ is.”

Steve Baker, a chatty adoption attorney with a thick book of New Yorker lawyer 
cartoons in his office, says that it would be unethical for him to take the 
cases. His strategy has been to object to the appointments outright, and to 
share useful legal motions and pleadings with his colleagues so they can get 
out of them, too.

In one case, Baker was appointed to represent a defendant who faced life in 
prison – but he took no action and never visited the person in jail (the case 
was reassigned to another lawyer more than seven months later). In another, a 
partner at his firm instructed his son, a junior associate, to walk down to the 
courthouse and take a plea as quickly as possible.

“Most of us are just trying to get in, get out,” he says.

On 1 July, Louisiana’s new fiscal year began, and public defense offices in 
several parishes received a small influx of funds. National attention on the 
crisis waned, and in Caddo Parish and elsewhere the public defenders have 
temporarily reduced their waitlists and stopped actively appointing 
non-criminal attorneys.

But because the fundamentals of how the state funds public defense – primarily 
through traffic tickets – have not changed, the defenders say their money will 
inevitably run dry in the course of only a few months. In Caddo, any private 
attorneys who have already been assigned cases still have to see them through, 
and the appointments may resume later in the year.

“We’re trying not to have to do this,” says Pam Smart, the district’s chief 
public defender, referring to the appointment of non-criminal attorneys. “But 
we’re going to always be teetering on the edge of it.”

Prosecutors play defense
winn parish graphic 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/la-winn-public-defenders/> 
A few hours to the south-east, in an office decorated with a wall-sized map of 
the state of Louisiana, a lawyer named J Keith Gates sits behind two heaps of 
files: one for his job as a prosecutor, the other for his job as a public 
defender.

“Look, it’s all courtroom work,” he says, pulling a file from each stack to 
show their similarities. “There’s no conflict unless you’re prosecuting and 
defending at the same time.”

It is a situation practically unheard of elsewhere in the US – a 
half-prosecutor, half-defender – but in Winn Parish, where the funding crisis 
left the public defender’s office even more decimated than in Caddo, it was 
perhaps the only option.

Last year, the Winn public defender saw its staff of three attorneys, two 
investigators, and two secretaries slashed to one part-time lawyer – a former 
Louisiana State University football player named Herman Castete – one part-time 
investigator and a part-time assistant.

Castete implemented a waitlist, and poor defendants in conflict cases were 
sitting in jail without an attorney. “It may be impossible for the public 
defender’s office to remain open,” he wrote in aninternal report 
<https://www.themarshallproject.org/documents/3001010-8th-District-Restriction-of-Services-Plan#.2gWztCIw4>
 to the state public defender board. “There is simply no money available.”

To temporarily resolve that situation, the district judge, Jacque Derr, began 
appointing attorneys from the private bar, just like in Caddo Parish. But Winn 
is much more rural, with fewer available lawyers, so Derr had to take the 
additional measure of enlisting Gates.

It is against Louisiana Public Defender Board policy for anyone serving with 
any public defender’s office to also serve as a prosecutor within the same 
district. But in this case, the defender himself, Castete, hadsigned on to 
<https://www.themarshallproject.org/documents/3001012-8th-District-Prosecutor-Exemption-Request#.fCNf7i9TK>
 the idea.

Gates says that he, Derr, Castete and the DA are all very diligent about 
avoiding potential conflicts of interest. As city prosecutor, he mostly handles 
minor cases brought to him by the city police (battery, disturbing the peace, 
DUI, shoplifting, theft), while in his new role as a district defender he is 
handling more serious felonies (armed robbery, weapons crimes, drug crimes). If 
there is any overlap, he has promised to recuse himself. “We don’t want the 
appearance of impropriety,” he says.

But to Stephen Singer, the former member of the state public defender board 
who objected to using Gates as a defender, this is more than just a rural 
parish performing triage during a funding crisis. “He’s a prosecutor. He plays 
for the other team,” Singer says.

For example, many defendants charged with felonies in district court, where 
Gates would be their defender, have also been charged with misdemeanors in city 
court, where he is the prosecutor. In short, Gates could have defendants whom 
he has both prosecuted and defended.

Derr, whose chambers are decorated with a sign reading “Be Still And Know That 
I Am Boss”, agrees there is a conflict – but adds: “Nobody’s ever said, ‘Hey, 
judge, he prosecuted me, I don’t want him defending me.’”

Besides, says Derr, there are more pressing issues for Winn Parish to resolve 
than Gates’s dual role – like whether the public defense crisis will slow down 
the very important prosecution of Kenneth Bratton, a defendant whom the judge 
calls “a one-man serial crime wave”. Bratton has most recently been accused of 
at least three counts of burglary, three counts of trespassing and damage to 
property, and stealing gasoline. He also led the sheriff’s office on a nine-day 
manhunt.

“Ain’t no question that dude did it,” says Derr, who will be presiding over 
Bratton’s case.

The only problem is that Bratton has been sitting in jail for over a year 
without an attorney, trying to write his own legal motions, because the 
defender’s office is so undermanned. In order to make sure that he has no 
constitutional claim to be released, the judge first tried to appoint two civil 
rights attorneys from New Orleans – without notifying them. They found out and 
objected.

Anna Lellelid, one of the attorneys conscripted from afar, says that being 250 
miles away from her client would make her just as ineffective as a non-criminal 
lawyer. “He’s just shuffling attorneys around,” she says of Derr, “trying to do 
whatever he can to moot the underlying issue, which is the funding of the 
public defender’s office.”

But now the judge is excited about his new strategy: he will have the 
prosecutor, Gates, represent Bratton.

“Kenny’s got a lawyer,” Derr says. “So now we can convict him.”
