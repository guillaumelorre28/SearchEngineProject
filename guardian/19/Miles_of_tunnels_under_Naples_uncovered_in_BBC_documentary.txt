The historian Michael Scott’s worst moment in the miles of tunnels deep under 
Naples, which he has been exploring for aBBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> documentary, came not from fear of 
earthquake or volcanic eruption, nor among crumbling Roman quarries or the 
eerie rusting remains of cars seized and dumped under Mussolini’s regime. 
However, he was extremely unhappy when, in a cramped, airless space heated by 
volcanic gases, reached by a narrow, 2,000-year-old passage, he met a scorpion.

“It was a small scorpion, but it was a very confined space, and all I thought 
I could remember about scorpions is that the small ones are more venomous. I 
stayed very, very still and tried to look unthreatening until it went away.”

Scott, associate professor of classics and ancient history at the University 
of Warwick, was a conventional above-ground historian, interested in the 
development of urban spaces, until he crawled down a narrow shaft into a Roman 
catacomb and was hooked by the underworld.

“The Greeks built tunnels where they needed them but weren’t much interested 
in going underground – but the Romans went for it big time. We think of cities 
as being above ground, but they are powered by underground structures, 
thousands of years of layers of history often unexplored and unmapped,” he said.

“Often they have been explored in parts, but the 3D maps and the raw data we 
have handed over to the local archaeologists are the first time anyone has 
tried to fit the jigsaw of these places together.”

The scores of wrecked vehicles under Naples, including taxis and motor 
scooters, were seized under Mussolini and then dumped in the tunnels, built a 
century earlier by a Bourbon king of Naples and Sicily, Ferdinand II.

Ferdinand became increasingly paranoid about conspiracies, though after three 
revolutions, a 16-month exile and an assassination attempt in 1856, he had good 
reason to fear his enemies. His tunnels were a massive operation, bridging an 
underground river and taking in mines dug by the Romans, and were constructed 
as an escape route between his palace and his main army barracks.

Scott, who explored them with the presenter Alexander Armstrong for Italy’s 
Invisible Cities <http://michaelscottweb.com/index.php/invisiblecities/>, which 
follows 2015’s Rome’s Invisible City and starts on BBC1 on 4 January, found 
that although Ferdinand never used them, they saved the lives of thousands of 
Neapolitans who took shelter there during wartime bombing.


“One of the strangest things I saw there was a bottle of hair lotion, 
perfectly intact, still with that citrus smell of a gentleman’s hairdressing 
establishment. Who, in the middle of a war, thought of grabbing it and taking 
it with them? It may be that the line: ‘My dear, this could be our last night 
on Earth’ was spoken many times down in the darkness.

“There are no records of the wrecked vehicles, who they were seized from, why 
they were just dumped, and what happened to their original owners. Each has a 
story to tell, but we just can’t read it.”

Scott and Armstrong also explored Florence – climbing into a recently 
discovered space under the famous Medici tombs carved as a refuge by 
Michelangelo – and put on scuba equipment to swim among the murky canals of 
Venice.

“In Venice they said that I would of course have some protection before 
diving. It turned out they meant medicated olive oil to be sprayed into my 
ears, because you can’t wear ear plugs with scuba gear, and that was it. So I 
had lovely gleaming ears, but nothing else. I tried very hard not to swallow.”
