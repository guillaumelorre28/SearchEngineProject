Jungfraubahn, Switzerland


Somewhat greedily, the Swiss boast three world-class rail journeys: the 
Glacier Express, the Bernina Express and, most spectacular of all, the 
Jungfraubahn. Climbing to over 3,000 metres, the hourly train scoots up the 
north face of the Eiger before sliding across Mönch and scaling the Jungfrau to 
pull in at Jungfraujoch, the highest railway station in Europe. Built in 1912, 
the line provides the most extraordinary views of the Alps you’ll ever see from 
a train window over the 50-minute journey. Jungfraujoch station is pretty 
special too – like something off the set of a science-fiction film.

From the lonely request stop at Dovey Junction, the Cambrian Coast line clings 
to the shore of Cardigan Bay so closely it is often damaged by sea storms. 
Chugging for the best part of 2½ hours along one of Britain’s most scenic 
railway lines, trains traverse the half-mile-long, 150-year-old Barmouth 
bridge, which spans the Mawddach river. They then pass lovely Portmeirion on 
the far side of the sandy Dwyryd estuary, and offer up choice views of Harlech 
and Criccieth castles.

The pricey Rocky Mountaineer train is not the only way to cross the Canadian 
Rockies. Arguably the more satisfying option is to slide down to Vancouver from 
the ski resort of Jasper on The Canadian, the iconic train that rolls in across 
the plains from Toronto in far off Ontario, 20 hours away. As it squeezes its 
way through the mountains, passengers can gaze out from observation cars and 
stylish art deco-style lounges at moose, eagles and, if they’re lucky, the 
occasional bear.

Since 1998 the weekly Desert Express has been ploughing its way across 220 
miles of one of the harshest yet most captivating landscapes the planet has to 
offer. Leaving the capital, the train crosses huge sand dunes and seemingly 
limitless scrub on its way to Swakopmund, a beach resort full of old German 
architecture. You can either glide through this inhospitable environment on the 
luxurious Desert Express or choose a clear night and join the locals on the 
nocturnal Starline train.

Since the California Zephyr is a daily service that powers all the way across 
the US from Chicago to Emeryville (San Francisco), taking in Denver, Salt Lake 
City, Sacramento, several canyons in Colorado, the Rockies and California’s 
High Sierra among other attractions, it’s a wonder that it isn’t better known 
than it is. It takes a leisurely 52 hours to travel 2,437 miles so its 
passengers have plenty of time to watch the country unfold from the comfort of 
the train’s Sightseer Lounge and Café or a fancy cabin.

The 800-mile Inlandsbanan forges up the spine of Sweden to enter Lapland, the 
domain of the nomadic Sami people, and pushes 60 miles north of the Arctic 
Circle. There are line-side reindeer and moose aplenty and you may even glimpse 
a bear, wolf, wolverine or lynx. Though the whole route is only open in summer 
(great for midnight sun enthusiasts) and requires some train hopping, a 14-day 
Inlandsbanan card allows exploration of the towns and villages along the way.

The morning train to Montenegro passes graffiti-covered engines at Topčider 
that once hauled Marshall Tito’s private train, soon after leaving Belgrade. 
After a brief stop near the pretty monastery of Vrbnica, the train crosses the 
Montenegrin border and starts its ascent among some of the most spectacular 
Dinaric Alps peaks. The line winds along mountainsides over 1,000 metres above 
sea level before descending to Podgorica, crossing the causeway across pretty 
Skadar lake and reaching the glistening Adriatic at Bar. The cost of this 
heroic, 11-hour, 20-minute, 296-mile trip? £20. Though if there’s an offer on, 
you can do it for a tenner.

Table Mountain disappears behind the train and the shanty towns give way to 
the Cape vineyards at the start of this 956-mile, 26-hour trip. By the time 
lunch is served in the dining-car, the train has twisted through the Hex River 
Pass and is trundling sedately across the semi-desert of the greatKaroo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/mar/17/alternative-city-guide-the-karoo-south-africa-holidays>
. After dinner, travellers can enjoy a glass or two in the lounge, then settle 
down for a night in a cosy private sleeper between fresh clean sheets. There’s 
plenty of time for a leisurely breakfast before a late-morning arrival at 
Johannesburg’s Park Station. The luxurious and expensive Blue Train takes this 
route, but the weekly Premier Classe train makes the experience more affordable.

One hundred baht – just over £2 – buys a third-class ticket on the twice-daily 
train from Bangkok to Nam Tok over the infamous death railway that once linked 
Burma with Siam. The cars are basic but comfortable, a welcome breeze wafts 
lazily through open windows, vendors amble up and down selling fruit and soft 
drinks – the fresh slices of pomelo are fabulous. Eighty-two miles and 2½ hours 
from Bangkok, the train calls at Kanchanaburi and soon afterwards heads slowly 
across the infamous bridge on the Kwai, hooting wildly and scattering tourists 
taking selfies on the bridge. The train goes along the peaceful river for 
several miles, hugging the cliffs above the river on the precarious but 
picturesque Wampo viaduct. There’s very little at Nam Tok – but sometimes the 
journey is the thing…

This 50-mile stretch of railway – a section of the 273-mile line between the 
coastal port of Guayaquil and the capital Quito – is something of a miracle. 
Engineers in the 19th century were faced with a climb of nearly 10,000ft and 
the small matter of scaling a mountain. Their solution: these astonishing 
zigzags carved out of the almost perpendicular cliffs of La Nariz del Diablo 
(The Devil’s Nose), a one-hour ascent that really gets the blood pumping (even 
though, sadly, riding on the train roof is no longer allowed).
