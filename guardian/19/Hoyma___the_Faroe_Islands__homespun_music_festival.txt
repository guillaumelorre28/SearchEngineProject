It’s 4pm, shortly before dusk. Cupped in mountains, Sydrugöta is a cat’s 
cradle of streetlights beside a fjord turned to pewter in the fading light. Two 
teenagers lark in an outdoor hot tub, despite the November chill. Otherwise, 
the village is silent. You’d never guess it was about to host the first Hoyma 
music festival.

I’m trying to find Jón Tyril, the thirtysomething organiser who is also behind 
the larger, summerG! Festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/jan/02/faroe-islands-g-music-festival>
. Look in the white house by the beach, they said. But there are five.

Should you ever wonder what makes the Faroese tick, knock on a few doors. No, 
the trick to house visits, I’m told at door three, is to tap briskly, pop your 
head in (no one bothers with locks) and shout “Hello”. To be at home in this 
remote Nordic archipelago is pretty much to have an open door to guests.

Hoyma is a bit like that. Instead of sound stages, 10 villagers will open 
their homes for the all-Faroese line-up – from an alt-folk duo and a classical 
guitarist to a Grammy-nominated singer and a reclusive folk hero. It is an 
anti-festival, Jón tells me. There are, he says, “no stages, no amps, no 
lighting, no security”.

Yet Hoyma – a phonetic rendering of the Faroese word for home, heima – taps 
deeper wellsprings of Faroese culture than that. When the Danish crown outlawed 
Faroese in 1538, the language went underground, preserved in stories and songs, 
and shared during thehúsaganga – the tradition of “house-walking”, by which 
communities celebrated and endured long winters. “Faroese survived by us coming 
together, by sharing,” Jón says. “That’s what Hoyma is.”

Once derided as a backwater, the islands have flowered creatively, inspired by 
returning expats like Jón.Gudrun & Gudrun <http://www.gudrungudrun.com/> has 
made fishermen’s woollies high fashion – Sarah Lund’sThe Killing jumper 
<http://www.gudrungudrun.com/the-killing.aspx> was one of theirs. Koks 
restaurant <http://www.koks.fo/EN/> is at the vanguard of the new Nordic food 
movement, andÖström <http://ostrom.fo/>, a renovated warehouse in the capital, 
Tórshavn, is a showcase for Faroese designers.

Most visitors to the islands come to Tórshavn, a pocket-sized Reykjavik with 
Scandi design boutiques and Hobbity, grass-roofed restaurants serving 
astonishingly good fish, and warmly musty, air-dried lamb. But the point is to 
get out there: to walk, watch sea birds on the cliffs of Kalsoy, see the long 
house at Kirkjubøur that once housed Viking kings, or simply explore a winter 
landscape which carries a sense of immense, withheld power.

A few hours’ drive from Tórshavn I see a waterfall flow upwards, spun into the 
sky as vortices by the wind. At one point I punch through fog and seem to be 
aloft on a celestial highway. It feels less a road trip than a Viking saga.

Nor does winter mean darkness. Surrounded by empty ocean, the islands are 
illuminated by an ethereal light. The sun shoots above the horizon. The sea 
changes from indigo to slate, pewter, then silver within seconds. At night 
there’s the off-chance of seeing the northern lights.It’s not even that cold – 
the gulf stream maintains a winter average of 5C.

On a walk to the west of Vágar, I fall in with a farmer. Winter is his 
favourite time, he says, as we ascend: the nature, the colours, the rough seas. 
We crest the hill and the land vanishes into black cliffs where kittiwakes 
wheel. Ringed by mountains ahead is Gásadalur, a hamlet of 13 people, which 
teeters ona cliff by a waterfall

Back in Sydrugöta 11, Greta Svabo Bech <http://www.gretasvabobech.com/> (who 
won a Grammy nomination for work with dance music giantDedmau5 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDmlz5QVMeg> ) sits on a stool lit by an Ikea 
lamp, and starts to sing – about captured spirits, lovesick trolls and 
departing soldiers. The sound is as haunting as the scenery outside.

For two hours I hop between living rooms. At 10pm, I’m in a stylish open-plan 
lounge to seeKári P <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLhtjMcmdyk>. For your 
average Faroese he is Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney rolled into one, his ballads 
from the 1970s still ubiquitous on the radio. From elfin 18-year-olds to 
beer-swilling 60-somethings, the crowd picks up the tune; sotto voce at first, 
then swelling into the chorus.

Somewhere out there in the darkness are inhospitable mountains and seas that 
will freeze you to death in five minutes. But here we are, snug and warm, 
singing together. Hoyma sweet Hoyma.
