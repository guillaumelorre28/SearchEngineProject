Karolina Pliskova beats Serena Williams 6-2, 7-6

Wow, what an upset. Williams clearly looked tired and one will wonder if the 
lack of rest was a major factor as she clearly lacked the footwork. But take 
nothing away from Karolina Pliskova, she took full advantage of the opportunity 
and was so aggressive. Her first serve winners outworked Williams and her 
movement and timing was much better. Fantastic stuff by the 24-year-old from 
the Czech Republic. Here’s a look at Bryan Graham’s full match report from 
Flushing Meadows.

Karolina Pliskova wins second set and beats Serena Williams!

Second set: Williams 2-6, 6-7 (7-5) Pliskova (*denotes next server)

We’re at tiebreak. Pliskova wins the first with an unforced error and another 
with 111mph serve. Williams is way off here and goes down 3-0 as she overhits. 
She seems to be struggling with her leg. Now, as Williams serves again she gets 
on the board as Pliskova hits the return on the net. On William’s second serve, 
Pliskova over hits and it’s 3-2 to the Czech. She faults but there is going to 
be a challenge...it is indeed out and it’s 3-3. Pliskova serves and as Williams 
returns, the Czech smashes it but Williams returns the shot!!! It’s too much 
for Pliskova and Williams takes the lead at 4-3. Wow. But then Williams DOUBLE 
FAULTS and it’s tied up at 4-4. An amazing rally ends with an even better 
two-handed backhand by Williams and it’s 5-4. We’re at 5-5 after an unforced 
error by Williams and after a fantastic save from a power forehand, Pliskova 
takes it and it’s match point. Williams....loses on a double fault. Wow.

Second set: Williams* 2-6, 6-6 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Williams means business here as she returns on the second serve with a great 
backhand but then gives it right back as she makes an error. Pliskova takes the 
lead with a powerful first serve winner but a long forehand makes it 30-30. 
Will the tide turn here? Williams just misses with a serve return and on 40-30 
Pliskova closes the game with her seventh ace.

Second set: Williams 2-6, 6-5 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams takes the lead after Pliskova commits an unforced error on a serve 
return, and quickly goes to 30-0 after Pliskova keeps chasing power shots and 
just can’t reach them well enough. Pliskova wins the next one with a forehand 
winner but a beautiful drop shot, which is returned, is not enough as Williams 
capitalizes on the second attempt. Williams wins with another first serve 
winner.

Second set: Williams 2-6, 5-4 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

This is the most important game for Serena, right here. She starts well as she 
comes to net, causes Pliskova to panic and it goes out. 15-0. Another backhand 
miss by the Czech and it’s 30-0, Williams aces and she has triple game point. 
Williams wins the game as she makes Pliskova run all over the court and hit a 
soft return. Williams takes over and smashes it.

Second set: Williams* 2-6, 4-4 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Can Williams break here? Pliskova starts well as her one-two punch with a 
serve and forehand winner takes it to 15-0. Williams is making her move, 
though, as she hits a wide forehand, unreachable to Pliskova. 15-15. Williams 
gifts a point to the server with an unforced error and then another one...we’re 
at 40-15. Pliskova double faults again (six total) but a great forehand smash 
is too much for Williams. She takes the game.

Second set: Williams 2-6, 4-3 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams double faults and she really is not using those legs on the serve and 
guess what...another double fault. A strong first serve winner puts her on the 
board and after a backhand unforced error we’re tied up at 30-30. Williams has 
game point with an ace (her fourth of the game) but just as you thought she 
would take the game with a simple volley, she loses focus and hits it on the 
net. Deuce. Pliskova saves two incredible smash volleys! She wins it with a 
great forehand and it’s advantage Pliskova. It goes back to 40-40, however as 
she overhits a forehand. So far, this is the longest game of the 
match...another long shot by Pliskova but she’s going to challenge...it is JUST 
out! Williams has advantage. Pliskova gambles and attacks the second serve but 
it goes long. Williams roars to pump herself up and the crowd go wild.

Second set: Williams* 2-6, 3-3 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Pliskova is moving so well out there but Williams comes back on the first 
point with a cross-court backhand. The Czech double faults AGAIN and Williams 
really needs to take advantage of this 0-30 lead. Another error and it’s triple 
break point. One more long shot means Williams breaks for the first time in the 
match.

Williams starts with an ace, but then commits a forehand unforced error. 
15-15. Pliskova makes an error herself on the return but Williams is really 
slow to react on a simple forehand and it’s 30-30. Pliskova gets a break point 
after another mistake and Pliskova wins it after a magnificent return from a 
powerful forehand. Williams can’t connect and Pliskova breaks.

Second set: Williams* 2-6, 2-2 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Williams is slowly showing signs of her usual rhythm but needs to find a way 
to break the powerful 24-year-old. Williams starts well and connects with her 
second serve return. 0-15. Her forehand, though, is letting her down and it’s 
all tied up. Pliskova double faults, but as Williams comes to the net and 
Pliskova returns, Williams messes up the volley. 30-30. A great one-two punch 
with the first serve and volley gives Pliskova game point but once again, she 
double faults. 40-40. You can sense some nerves kicking in for Pliskova...but 
gets lucky on an unforced error by Williams. She follows up with an ace, and

Second set: Williams 2-6, 2-1 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

The umpire calls a let and Williams is not happy but then retaliates with a 
first serve winner. A mishit by Pliskova on the return makes it 30-0 and as 
Pliskova makes another error it’s quickly 40-0. Williams wants to hit a quick 
backhand, but again, her feet let her down and it’s 40-15. Williams holds serve 
and needs this break.

Second set: Williams* 2-6, 1-1 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Williams remains flat-footed, which causes her to go long again and just like 
that it’s 30-0. Pliskova’s serve is amazing and there really is not much you 
can do when she’s on. On the next point, though, she makes a mistake and it’s 
30-15 but a fault by Williams makes it 40-15. Williams capitalizes on a soft 
second serve and wins with a forehand winner and after a good rally, Williams 
tries to slice it up...but fails. Pliskova wins the game.

Second set: Williams 2-6, 1-0 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams has now changed her strategy a little bit and is now going to the 
net. Wins first point with a volley, 15-0 but then makes an error and it’s tied 
up. An amazing forehand serve return makes it 15-30 and the best rally of the 
match, where Williams smashes a backhand is too much for Pliskova and can’t 
handle the follow-up. 30-30. Williams makes an error and it’s break point, but 
Pliskova returns the favor...we’re at deuce. Williams aces and screams....the 
shouts get louder after she wins the game with a forehand smash.

Pliskova wins first set!

First set: Williams* 2-6 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Williams did mention that not taking a day to rest wasn’t an issue but I 
really don’t believe her. She looks tired and sluggish, at least by her high 
standards. The much younger Pliskova is taking full advantage as she serves for 
the set. She begins with a great forehand winner after a weak return, 15-0. 
Williams goes long and it’s 30-0, but a quick serve return startles Pliskova 
and Williams is on the board. A lucky backhand, skimming the net, makes it two 
set points and she wins the first set in 27 minutes after Williams commits 
another unforced error.

First set: Williams 2-5 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams double faults, that was very much unlike her. A couple of unforced 
errors means she is down 0-40 and the mental aspect of her game is really not 
there. One more mistake and Pliskova breaks again.

First set: Williams* 2-4 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

This is a big game for Serena as she looks to tie the set and break for the 
first time. Pliskova, however, starts with an ace and it’s 15-0. A ridiculous 
backhand winner leaves Williams flat-footed and it’s 30-0. Did last night take 
too much from her? An unforced error puts Williams on the board and Pliskova’s 
first double fault of the match ties it up. A powerful first serve winner gives 
her game point but then ANOTHER double fault makes it deuce. Williams gets 
impatient on the serve return and goes long with her backhand and Pliskova

First set: Williams 2-3 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams seems to be out of sorts as she hits another unforced error and her 
first serve just doesn’t want to go in...or the second. She double faults. 
0-30. A strong forehand winner puts her on the board and a fantastic backhand 
ties it up. We’re at 30-30. Pliskova’s energy is apparent as she wins the next 
one and once again, she can break here. Williams ties it up with an unforced 
error and a forehand winner gives her advantage. Williams wins it with an ace 
and pumps herself up after that one.

First set: Williams* 1-3 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Williams knows that she needs to equal Pliskova and break her serve, otherwise 
the 24-year-old could run away with this set. A powerful first serve makes it 
15-0 and two aces give her a 40-0 lead. Pliskova gets impatient and goes long 
on a forehand and we’re at 40-15 and Williams hits a beautiful two-handed 
backhand: 40-30. Pliskova, however, wins the game with an unforced error.

First set: Williams 1-2 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

As expected this is going to be all about serve domination as Williams quickly 
jumps to 30-0. Pliskova hits it hard and flat and Williams challenges but the 
ball was on the line, 30-15. A fantastic second serve return ties it up and as 
Williams commits an unforced error Pliskova has break point. A long forehand 
means Pliskova wins the game.

First set: Williams* 1-1 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Pliskova forces Williams to commit a long unforced error but she returns the 
favor with one of her own. 15-15. Pliskova wins the next one with a service 
winner and her placement - which is so good - helps her get to 40-15. An 
unforced error by Pliskova rewards Williams with a point and another one wins 
the game.

ESPN showing a short film called The Dream I live, narrated by Alec Baldwin, 
dedicated to the women’s tournament. I must admit, I’ve been generally 
impressed with the coverage this summer, even with John McEnroe, who often 
commentates the same way he played...by nitpicking the unnecessary.

Ace is the name of the game. Serena Williams hit 18 last night, and 60 total 
throughout the tournament. Pliskova, meanwhile, lost just one point on her 
serve in the first set against Konjuh and never faced a break point.

Preamble

Hello everyone and welcome to the first US Open women’s semifinal match between
Serena Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> and 
Karolina Pliskova. This is a quick turnaround for both players, as they face 
each other a without a day’s rest, so the physical aspect of their game will 
surely be tested. Williams, however, has mentioned she is not bothered by the 
lack of a break as she is used to day-to-day playing in most non-major 
tournaments. We will see if the 34-year-old’s stamina will not be affected, 
especially as her opponent is ten years her senior. Pliskova is on a roll, and 
has finally been able to show how dangerous she can be in a major. On her way 
to the last four, the 24-year-old from the Czech Republic has only dropped a 
set, the first against Serena’s older sister, Venus, in the fourth round. She 
is on a ten-match winning streak including victories against Angelique Kerber 
and Garbiñe Muguruza at the Cincinnati Open.


But now comes her biggest test, against the mighty Williams, who is on course 
on tying with Chris Evert for seven US Open titles - the most ever. She can 
also pass Steffi Graf and win her 23rd Grand Slam title, trailing only the 
great Margaret Court, who has 24. Williams defeated Simona Halep last night to 
get here, but it wasn’t easy as the world No 1 dropped a set for the first time 
in the tournament. Halep made Serena work hard for that win and there’s no 
doubt that Pliskova will be looking to do more of the same. Pliskova, standing 
at 6-foot-one, leads the WTA tour in aces so it will be interesting to see who 
breaks first.


The last and only time they have faced each other was two years ago in 
Stanford, Williams won 7-5, 6-2.

Wow, what an upset. Williams clearly looked tired and one will wonder if the 
lack of rest was a major factor as she clearly lacked the footwork. But take 
nothing away from Karolina Pliskova, she took full advantage of the opportunity 
and was so aggressive. Her first serve winners outworked Williams and her 
movement and timing was much better. Fantastic stuff by the 24-year-old from 
the Czech Republic. Here’s a look at Bryan Graham’s full match report from 
Flushing Meadows.

We’re at tiebreak. Pliskova wins the first with an unforced error and another 
with 111mph serve. Williams is way off here and goes down 3-0 as she overhits. 
She seems to be struggling with her leg. Now, as Williams serves again she gets 
on the board as Pliskova hits the return on the net. On William’s second serve, 
Pliskova over hits and it’s 3-2 to the Czech. She faults but there is going to 
be a challenge...it is indeed out and it’s 3-3. Pliskova serves and as Williams 
returns, the Czech smashes it but Williams returns the shot!!! It’s too much 
for Pliskova and Williams takes the lead at 4-3. Wow. But then Williams DOUBLE 
FAULTS and it’s tied up at 4-4. An amazing rally ends with an even better 
two-handed backhand by Williams and it’s 5-4. We’re at 5-5 after an unforced 
error by Williams and after a fantastic save from a power forehand, Pliskova 
takes it and it’s match point. Williams....loses on a double fault. Wow.
 
Second set: Williams* 2-6, 6-6 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Williams means business here as she returns on the second serve with a great 
backhand but then gives it right back as she makes an error. Pliskova takes the 
lead with a powerful first serve winner but a long forehand makes it 30-30. 
Will the tide turn here? Williams just misses with a serve return and on 40-30 
Pliskova closes the game with her seventh ace.

Second set: Williams 2-6, 6-5 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams takes the lead after Pliskova commits an unforced error on a serve 
return, and quickly goes to 30-0 after Pliskova keeps chasing power shots and 
just can’t reach them well enough. Pliskova wins the next one with a forehand 
winner but a beautiful drop shot, which is returned, is not enough as Williams 
capitalizes on the second attempt. Williams wins with another first serve 
winner.
 
Second set: Williams* 2-6, 5-5 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Pliskova takes a 30-0 lead after a strong serve and a Williams error. The 
24-year-old make a mistake of her own with a long forehand and Williams is on 
the board but a sloppy backhand hits the net and Pliskova has double game 
point. A great drop shot means it 5-5.

So tense.

Can Serena pull a Serena and win this set?
 
Second set: Williams 2-6, 5-4 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

This is the most important game for Serena, right here. She starts well as she 
comes to net, causes Pliskova to panic and it goes out. 15-0. Another backhand 
miss by the Czech and it’s 30-0, Williams aces and she has triple game point. 
Williams wins the game as she makes Pliskova run all over the court and hit a 
soft return. Williams takes over and smashes it.
 
Second set: Williams* 2-6, 4-4 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Can Williams break here? Pliskova starts well as her one-two punch with a 
serve and forehand winner takes it to 15-0. Williams is making her move, 
though, as she hits a wide forehand, unreachable to Pliskova. 15-15. Williams 
gifts a point to the server with an unforced error and then another one...we’re 
at 40-15. Pliskova double faults again (six total) but a great forehand smash 
is too much for Williams. She takes the game.
 
Second set: Williams 2-6, 4-3 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams double faults and she really is not using those legs on the serve and 
guess what...another double fault. A strong first serve winner puts her on the 
board and after a backhand unforced error we’re tied up at 30-30. Williams has 
game point with an ace (her fourth of the game) but just as you thought she 
would take the game with a simple volley, she loses focus and hits it on the 
net. Deuce. Pliskova saves two incredible smash volleys! She wins it with a 
great forehand and it’s advantage Pliskova. It goes back to 40-40, however as 
she overhits a forehand. So far, this is the longest game of the 
match...another long shot by Pliskova but she’s going to challenge...it is JUST 
out! Williams has advantage. Pliskova gambles and attacks the second serve but 
it goes long. Williams roars to pump herself up and the crowd go wild.
 
Second set: Williams* 2-6, 3-3 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Pliskova is moving so well out there but Williams comes back on the first 
point with a cross-court backhand. The Czech double faults AGAIN and Williams 
really needs to take advantage of this 0-30 lead. Another error and it’s triple 
break point. One more long shot means Williams breaks for the first time in the 
match.
 
Second set: Williams 2-6, 2-3 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams starts with an ace, but then commits a forehand unforced error. 
15-15. Pliskova makes an error herself on the return but Williams is really 
slow to react on a simple forehand and it’s 30-30. Pliskova gets a break point 
after another mistake and Pliskova wins it after a magnificent return from a 
powerful forehand. Williams can’t connect and Pliskova breaks.
 
Second set: Williams* 2-6, 2-2 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Williams is slowly showing signs of her usual rhythm but needs to find a way 
to break the powerful 24-year-old. Williams starts well and connects with her 
second serve return. 0-15. Her forehand, though, is letting her down and it’s 
all tied up. Pliskova double faults, but as Williams comes to the net and 
Pliskova returns, Williams messes up the volley. 30-30. A great one-two punch 
with the first serve and volley gives Pliskova game point but once again, she 
double faults. 40-40. You can sense some nerves kicking in for Pliskova...but 
gets lucky on an unforced error by Williams. She follows up with an ace, and 
it’s game.
 
Second set: Williams 2-6, 2-1 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

The umpire calls a let and Williams is not happy but then retaliates with a 
first serve winner. A mishit by Pliskova on the return makes it 30-0 and as 
Pliskova makes another error it’s quickly 40-0. Williams wants to hit a quick 
backhand, but again, her feet let her down and it’s 40-15. Williams holds serve 
and needs this break.
 
Second set: Williams* 2-6, 1-1 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Williams remains flat-footed, which causes her to go long again and just like 
that it’s 30-0. Pliskova’s serve is amazing and there really is not much you 
can do when she’s on. On the next point, though, she makes a mistake and it’s 
30-15 but a fault by Williams makes it 40-15. Williams capitalizes on a soft 
second serve and wins with a forehand winner and after a good rally, Williams 
tries to slice it up...but fails. Pliskova wins the game.
 
Second set: Williams 2-6, 1-0 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams has now changed her strategy a little bit and is now going to the 
net. Wins first point with a volley, 15-0 but then makes an error and it’s tied 
up. An amazing forehand serve return makes it 15-30 and the best rally of the 
match, where Williams smashes a backhand is too much for Pliskova and can’t 
handle the follow-up. 30-30. Williams makes an error and it’s break point, but 
Pliskova returns the favor...we’re at deuce. Williams aces and screams....the 
shouts get louder after she wins the game with a forehand smash.
 
First set: Williams* 2-6 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Williams did mention that not taking a day to rest wasn’t an issue but I 
really don’t believe her. She looks tired and sluggish, at least by her high 
standards. The much younger Pliskova is taking full advantage as she serves for 
the set. She begins with a great forehand winner after a weak return, 15-0. 
Williams goes long and it’s 30-0, but a quick serve return startles Pliskova 
and Williams is on the board. A lucky backhand, skimming the net, makes it two 
set points and she wins the first set in 27 minutes after Williams commits 
another unforced error.
 
First set: Williams 2-5 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams double faults, that was very much unlike her. A couple of unforced 
errors means she is down 0-40 and the mental aspect of her game is really not 
there. One more mistake and Pliskova breaks again.
 
First set: Williams* 2-4 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

This is a big game for Serena as she looks to tie the set and break for the 
first time. Pliskova, however, starts with an ace and it’s 15-0. A ridiculous 
backhand winner leaves Williams flat-footed and it’s 30-0. Did last night take 
too much from her? An unforced error puts Williams on the board and Pliskova’s 
first double fault of the match ties it up. A powerful first serve winner gives 
her game point but then ANOTHER double fault makes it deuce. Williams gets 
impatient on the serve return and goes long with her backhand and Pliskova 
takes it with a serve winner.
 
First set: Williams 2-3 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams seems to be out of sorts as she hits another unforced error and her 
first serve just doesn’t want to go in...or the second. She double faults. 
0-30. A strong forehand winner puts her on the board and a fantastic backhand 
ties it up. We’re at 30-30. Pliskova’s energy is apparent as she wins the next 
one and once again, she can break here. Williams ties it up with an unforced 
error and a forehand winner gives her advantage. Williams wins it with an ace 
and pumps herself up after that one.
 
First set: Williams* 1-3 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Williams knows that she needs to equal Pliskova and break her serve, otherwise 
the 24-year-old could run away with this set. A powerful first serve makes it 
15-0 and two aces give her a 40-0 lead. Pliskova gets impatient and goes long 
on a forehand and we’re at 40-15 and Williams hits a beautiful two-handed 
backhand: 40-30. Pliskova, however, wins the game with an unforced error.
 
First set: Williams 1-2 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

As expected this is going to be all about serve domination as Williams quickly 
jumps to 30-0. Pliskova hits it hard and flat and Williams challenges but the 
ball was on the line, 30-15. A fantastic second serve return ties it up and as 
Williams commits an unforced error Pliskova has break point. A long forehand 
means Pliskova wins the game.
 
First set: Williams* 1-1 Pliskova (*denotes next server)

Pliskova forces Williams to commit a long unforced error but she returns the 
favor with one of her own. 15-15. Pliskova wins the next one with a service 
winner and her placement - which is so good - helps her get to 40-15. An 
unforced error by Pliskova rewards Williams with a point and another one wins 
the game.
 
First set: Williams 1-0 Pliskova* (*denotes next server)

Williams begins with an ace, and an unforced error by Pliskova makes it 30-0. 
Williams looks composed and ready on that forehand as she makes it 40-0 and 
with another error it’s game.
 
Let’s play some tennis! Williams will serve first. 
 
Both players are now entering the court. Huge cheers for Serena Williams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams>, who looks composed and 
focused. They’ll warm up and not long now until the main event begins.

impressed with the coverage this summer, even with John McEnroe, who often 
commentates the same way he played...by nitpicking the unnecessary.
 
Ace is the name of the game. Serena Williams hit 18 last night, and 60 total 
throughout the tournament. Pliskova, meanwhile, lost just one point on her 
serve in the first set against Konjuh and never faced a break point.

inside Arthur Ashe stadium.
 
Preamble

Hello everyone and welcome to the first US Open women’s semifinal match between
Serena Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> and 
Karolina Pliskova. This is a quick turnaround for both players, as they face 
each other a without a day’s rest, so the physical aspect of their game will 
surely be tested. Williams, however, has mentioned she is not bothered by the 
lack of a break as she is used to day-to-day playing in most non-major 
tournaments. We will see if the 34-year-old’s stamina will not be affected, 
especially as her opponent is ten years her senior. Pliskova is on a roll, and 
has finally been able to show how dangerous she can be in a major. On her way 
to the last four, the 24-year-old from the Czech Republic has only dropped a 
set, the first against Serena’s older sister, Venus, in the fourth round. She 
is on a ten-match winning streak including victories against Angelique Kerber 
and Garbiñe Muguruza at the Cincinnati Open.


But now comes her biggest test, against the mighty Williams, who is on course 
on tying with Chris Evert for seven US Open titles - the most ever. She can 
also pass Steffi Graf and win her 23rd Grand Slam title, trailing only the 
great Margaret Court, who has 24. Williams defeated Simona Halep last night to 
get here, but it wasn’t easy as the world No 1 dropped a set for the first time 
in the tournament. Halep made Serena work hard for that win and there’s no 
doubt that Pliskova will be looking to do more of the same. Pliskova, standing 
at 6-foot-one, leads the WTA tour in aces so it will be interesting to see who 
breaks first.


The last and only time they have faced each other was two years ago in 
Stanford, Williams won 7-5, 6-2.
