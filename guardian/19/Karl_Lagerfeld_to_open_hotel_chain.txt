His first hotel is being built with a local partner in the luxury Lisboa 
Palace Complex inMacau <https://www.theguardian.com/world/macau> but the 
Lagerfeld group is “in the process of studying other opportunities to open 
other properties around the world,” it said in a statement.

The 83-year-old German-born fashion designer has already collaborated with 
luxury Parisian address Le Crillon and the Metropole in Monaco but the new 
business will involve his company in designing entire hotels.

Leading fashion houses from Dior to Diane von Furstenberg have developed a 
lucrative sideline designing suites and other interiors for hotels.

Lagerfeld intends to follow the example of rivals including Armani, Bulgari 
and Versace, which have gone one step further and opened properties under their 
own names.

The Lisboa Palace Complex in Macau – the only place in China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> where gambling is legal – will 
include casinos, restaurants and various hotels, notably the Versace Palace.
