There are two cathedrals in Bilbao: the Catholic one and San Mamés, the 
football stadium. Athletic Bilbao signs Basque players only [a unique case in 
European football]. I don’t like football but I like the club’s values: work 
with your people, try your best, respect others, be loyal. People say it’s a 
pity you can’t hire Ronaldo or Messi, but I say, no, it’s a pity for them they 
can’t join Athletic.

 Ivan Jimenez Aira 
I have clear childhood memories of Bilbao: I didn’t like it. It was a grey 
place: the river was polluted and the streets black. Now, with its 19th-century 
facades renovated, the Gran Via could be a street in Vienna and there are more 
green spaces here than any other city in Spain.

Industrial recession hit us hard in the early 1980s. But then the government 
built the technology park, making the city a centre for research and 
development. This was followed by the Guggenheim, promenades, the underground, 
and the renovation of the Casco Viejo. We were all so excited. I’ve lived in 
and around the city all my life and seen the evolution year by year. It’s 
incredible.

 Michelin-starred Mina 
Twenty years ago, it was impossible to walk through Bilbao la Vieja, on the 
left bank of the river Nervión; it was full of drug addicts. Now there is a 
Michelin-starred restaurant,Restaurante Mina <http://www.restaurantemina.es/>, 
among many good places to eat, and a mix of cultures from all over the world.

We have our own mapa mundi, our take on the medieval mappae mundi, that puts 
Bilbao at the centre of the world. It’s the second most popular picture in bars 
after the Athletic team. It’s very funny. Pride keeps our language and culture 
alive. We are a country of only two million (if you don’t count the folk to the 
south), but we like being special.

I love the Alhóndiga 
<http://www.bilbaoturismo.net/BilbaoTurismo/en/new-architecture/alhondiga-bilbao_2>
, the cultural centre designed by Philippe Starck. The rooftop pool has a glass 
floor, so you can stand below and watch people swim. When Bilbao ran for World 
Design Capital, it made a video of its most important new buildings, and most 
were by foreign architects. People asked, why are there no Basque architects? 
But although Frank Gehry designed the Guggenheim, it was built by Basques – the 
same with Norman Foster’s underground, and so on. We accept the combining of 
international architects with local engineers.

I’ve been to the  Guggenheim <https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en/> six or 
seven times. I like the building very much but the art is not accessible. Most 
of it looks like something my kids could have done. I prefer the Museo de 
Bellas Artes; <https://www.museobilbao.com/>the art is more accessible.

As a child, taking the funicular railway from downtown to Mount Artxanda was 
magical, going from sad Bilbao to the middle of nature. Now the city’s all 
green, the change isn’t so startling, but it’s still a special place to go for 
not very adventurous trekking, places for children to play, good views of the 
city, and Txakoli Artxanda, a good pintxo place.

Going for pintxos is not just about eating, but socialising with your kuadrilla
. The kuadrilla is a really Basque thing, a group of friends who, regardless of 
your path in life, status or background, you stay with, always.

Food is a religion in Bilbao and throughout the Basque country. Every summer 
festival holds its own gastronomic competition. Even in my little village of 
Mungia, on the first Sunday of July, 300 teams of between 10 and 20 people 
compete to make the best beef stew –sukalki. It’s friendly ... but it’s very 
important to do well.

The art in the Guggenheim is not accessible. Most of it looks like something 
my kids could have done

In the Basque country, we call gastronomic societies txokos. They usually 
comprise a private cooking and dining area at the back of a building, with 
members who share the running costs. They used to be for men only but women are 
allowed now, though the men still handle the cooking. We book a table, some of 
us shop, and we share all the expenses. Within the group there’s always someone 
who’s lazy, who will tell you how to prepare the table, cut up some cheese, sit 
down and demand a glass oftxakoli (traditional Basque wine). That’s accepted, 
it’s not a competition. There’s one I’ve never seen cooking, but he’s a very 
funny guy, so it doesn’t matter.

 Pintxos at Peso Neto 
When I get a call to say my kuadrilla has txoko on Saturday, I’m so happy. 
Usually four of us go with our kids, (four men and 11 daughters – incredible) 
to Mercado de la Ribera to buy fish, then to the old town for pintxos and 
txakoli. It’s not politically correct to have pintxos with children, but atBar 
Zuga <http://www.barlaolla.com/> and La Olla <http://www.barlaolla.com/> they 
play in the square while we cook and talk. The women usually arrive just as 
everything’s ready. I love it.
