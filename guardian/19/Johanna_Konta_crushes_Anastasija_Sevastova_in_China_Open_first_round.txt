Johanna Konta <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/johanna-konta> gained a 
measure of revenge on Anastasija Sevastova as she reached the second round of 
the China Open in Beijing.

The British No1, who lost to Sevastova at the US Open, beat the Latvian 6-1, 
6-1 in less than an hour.

The win boosted her hopes of reaching the WTA Finals in Singapore in three 
weeks’ time, helping her to make ground on Carla Suárez Navarro – whom she beat 
at the Wuhan Open last week – after the Spaniard suffered a surprise first 
round defeat.

Konta, who plays Tímea Babos next, is ninth in the race to Singapore; the top 
eight qualify. The 11th-ranked Briton will hope to make points up on both 
Madison Keys and Svetlana Kuznetsova this week.

In the men’s event, the British No2 Kyle Edmund will join Andy Murray in the 
main draw after beating Evgeny Donskoy 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 in qualifying.
