WINNING TIP: Stroll among the cypress swamps

Eschew the organised swamp tours and go it alone. The Barataria Preserve 
<http://www.nps.gov/jela/barataria-preserve.htm> is just 30 minutes south of 
New Orleans and admission is free. There are ranger-guided walks, or you can 
pick up a trail map at the visitors’ centre (Wednesday to Sunday 9.30am-4.30pm) 
and explore the eerie cypress swamps and lazy bayous. The friendly staff will 
advise you where to go to spot turtles, snakes, alligators, rare birds and 
insects. There are shady picnic tables near each car park, but no food outlets, 
so bring supplies.

This is where you’ll find Nola greats like theThe Neville Brothers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/mar/09/popandrock3> and the Rebirth 
Brass Band playing. One of the best, if not the best gig I’ve ever been to was 
here, with the warmth, character, musicianship and atmosphere combining in a 
truly memorable night. A wonderful place.

Jogging tour

This guided tour was booked on my behalf as means to shake off a long day’s 
travelling. As somebody who can barely run the length of myself, I was dreading 
the prospect but it was nothing to be afraid of. The knowledgable guides keep 
to your pace, while pointing out areas of historic and cultural note and the 
fact I’d exercised for 90 minutes meant I didn’t feel as guilty that evening 
when tucking into wonderful food at places recommended earlier on the tour.
10km tours cost $30, neworleansjoggingtours.com

Candlelight Lounge


We went to The Candlelight Lounge on our last night in Nola to see the Treme 
Brass Band <https://www.facebook.com/TremeBrassBand>. We’d read reviews saying 
you are coerced into dancing, which for two shy, reserved Brits sounded like 
hell but we did really want to see the band. It was a fantastic night. The 
hospitality from Gladys, who runs the place, was immense. She did coerce us 
into dancing and it was brilliant fun. The band is incredible, the atmosphere 
relaxed and friendly.

Stay at the Jazz Quarters


The Jazz Quarters are renovated early 19th-century Creole cottages set round a 
lovely courtyard. They are really well located – just across Ramparts Street in 
Tremé – a relatively quiet area, safe and secure and yet close to the French 
Quarter. Very different from a standard city centre hotel.
Rooms from $149, two-night minimum, jazzquarters.com

This hidden gem of a bar in the Bywater is my personal favourite place to 
chill out in New Orleans. It’s a bit spit and sawdust, a dive even, but man the 
atmosphere is brilliant. They have loads of local live bands, and the bar is 
cash-only.

Take the Riverfront streetcar to the centuries-old French Market and spend the 
morning browsing while your senses delight in the sights, sounds and smells of 
this New Orleans landmark. Sample local produce, chat to stallholders and treat 
yourself to a few bottles of Louisiana hot sauce before adjourning to the
Original French Market Restaurant <http://www.frenchmarketrestaurant.com/> for 
lunch. Relax outside on the elegant roof terrace while dining on delicious 
seafood gumbo and Cajun jambalaya with a chilled bottle of chardonnay.

Eaten in a few of New Orleans’s best-known restaurants? What about learning to 
cook some of the region’s most famous dishes? Make your way down Canal Street 
to the French Quarter and head to the New Orleans School of Cooking for a 
three-hour masterclass. You will learn how to prepare Louisiana classics such 
as gumbo, jambalaya and pralines. Sessions are as entertaining as they are 
informative, and a great way to learn about New Orleans food traditions and 
pick up some local history and anecdotes.
