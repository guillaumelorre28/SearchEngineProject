Beethoven’s thrilling, electrifying Eroica 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj4JFAQ0N8c>, a piece of music originally 
dedicated to Napoleon and celebrating the revolutionary spirit sweeping Europe, 
has been named the greatest symphony of all time by the world’s greatest 
conductors.

BBC Music Magazine surveyed 151 conductors working across the world to come up 
with a top 20 great symphonies.

The Eroica, Beethoven’s Third Symphony

<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/may/27/symphony-guide-mozart-41st-jupiter-tom-service>
 was in third place while Mahler occupied the next two places withhis Ninth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/jul/29/mahlers-ninth-tom-service-symphony-guide>
 and Second symphonies respectively.

Surprisingly, Beethoven’s Fifth

, with its instantly recognisableduh-duh-duh-duuuh 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4IRMYuE1hI> opening, missed out on a top 10 
spot, coming in 11th place.

Oliver Condy, editor of the magazine, admitted it was no great surprise 
Beethoven dominated the list. “It has been over 200 years since Beethoven’s 
symphony number three was written and the vote suggests that it has not been 
improved on in those years, which is remarkable really and is testament to his 
absolute genius.

“Conductors love conducting it. They love it because there is just so much to 
it, there is so much happening ... that opening is a real punch in the face.”

The British conductor Jonathan Nott, music director of the Tokyo Symphony 
Orchestra, told the magazine the Eroica was boundary-breaking. “This symphony 
is not about the glory of God, it’s about humans – our struggles, challenges 
and victories.

“Later, composers became preoccupied with life’s depressions and bitterness, 
but I never get that in Beethoven. You come away having experienced the power 
and joy of being alive.”

The Eroica, written in 1803, was originally destined to be called the 
Bonaparte, a celebration of Napoleon and all he stood for. Beethoven changed 
his mind when he heard that Napoleon had declared himself emperor, denouncing 
him as a tyrant and scrubbing out his name so hard there is a hole in the 
manuscript.

The Third heralded a new era for the symphony, said Han-Na Chang, chief 
conductor of the Trondheim Symphony. “He finds his voice and we see who he is.

“The way he works out all the motifs, melodies and themes in such detail, 
while at the same time maintaining a completely organic development of the 
emotional message, seems to me unbeatable.”

Condy said he would have predicted that the Ninth, which contains the European 
Union anthem, Ode to Joy <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ecrJaA_mXg>, would 
have been at No 1. “There is this real joyful sense of brotherhood and unity, 
which is interesting of course in these Brexit times.”


Mahler is represented three times with his Second, Third and Ninth Symphonies; 
the Ninth hasa beautifully slow final movement

In third place is Mozart’s last symphony, No 41 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK5295yEQMQ>, while his arguably more popular 
40th <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l45DAuXYSIs> is at No 15.

“I’m not sure why the conductors don’t find it as alluring,” said Condy. “But 
don’t forget we are talking about people who know the symphonies inside out, 
they really get inside the works, the structure, the textures and 
orchestrations.”

The top 10 is completed by Brahms’s Fourth Symphony (6th); Berlioz’s Symphonie 
Fantastique (7th); Brahms’s First Symphony (8th); Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony 
(9th ); and Mahler’s Third Symphony (10).

The most recent work on the list is Shostakovich’s Symphony No 5, ranked at 
17. It was written in 1937, a time of great personal crisis for the composer 
after the state denunciation for his opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk.

The absence of more recently written symphonies is down to fashion, said 
Condy. “Composers don’t tend to write symphonies these days, they are mostly 
shorter orchestral pieces with titles.”

Each conductor was asked to name his or her top three symphonies in any order 
before the magazine processed that into a top 20. Among the conductors polled 
was Simon Rattle (Beethoven’s Third, Bruckner’s Eighth, Mahler’s Das Lied von 
der Erde), Marin Alsop (Barber’s First, Brahms’s Third, Mahler’s Second), who 
last year conducted Last Night of the Proms, and Sakari Oramo (Beethoven’s 
Third, Mahler’s Third, Sibelius’s Fifth), who will do so this year.
