A walk through Harlem at dusk with Marcus Samuelsson is less gentle stroll 
than royal procession. The chef may be wearing a flat cap, pulled down over his 
eyes, and a dark jacket, but they all know who he is out here north of 
Manhattan’s 110th Street. And they want him to know they know. As we barrel 
from neon-gilded diner to cocktail place, from his own rotisserie chicken joint 
to the jazz bars he wants me to see, he is constantly greeted with shouts of 
“Hey chef!” from passersby which he returns with a gentle, “Oh, pur-leeze”, and 
a shrug as if to say: “I’m just another guy.”

For many people in Harlem, Samuelsson is not just another guy. For a start, 
the Ethiopian-born chef with the aquiline features, the Swedish surname and the 
only-in-America story, is a major employer. Through his various ventures, 
including his flagship restaurant theRed Rooster on Lenox Avenue 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/may/06/new-york-restaurants-uptown-manhattan>
, he has given jobs to 200 locals. Paul McCartney and the jazz trumpeter Wynton 
Marsalis have eaten there, along with former state governors and superstar 
basketball players. It is liberal New York’s fantasy come to life; a single 
room in this splintered city where its various social tribes really do seem to 
break bread together.

The food festival Samuelsson launched, Harlem EatUp, held each year in May, 
brings big-name chefs from all over America to their doorstep. What’s more, 
havingcooked for Barack Obama at the White House 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/24/obama-state-dinner-india-singh>, 
he even brought the president back to his place in Harlem for a $30,000-a-plate 
election fundraiser. Making his home neighbourhood the star is, he claims, what 
really matters. “It’s Harlem first, the Red Rooster second,” he says. “A menu 
you can learn. But the place? Learning a place is different.”

Right now, he is trying to learn an entirely new place. In the autumn, he 
opens a second Red Rooster, inside the new Curtain Hotel in London’s 
Shoreditch. His take on American soul food subtly refracted through the lens of 
his African heritage is coming to London. “We must get 20 requests a year to 
open a new Red Rooster,” he says. “I only wanted to do it in a city with a 
dynamic we could learn from.”

for Observer Food Monthly 
This, he tells me, “is a humble journey. It’s not some big New York 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york> chef rolling into London.” I 
suggest to him gently that the Curtain’s owners may have different ideas. 
“Look,” he says. “I really believe in what we have to say.” It’s why he wants 
to take me on a tour of Harlem, so I can understand how he went about launching 
the Red Rooster and making it a part of the community. He insists it’s not all 
about him.

That may well be true, but his personal story is compelling. Samuelsson, now 
45, was born Kassahun Tsegie in rural Ethiopia in 1971. When he was one, he and 
his three-year-old sister were taken by their mother to hospital in Addis Ababa 
so all three could be treated for tuberculosis. His mother died there, and the 
children were quickly adopted by Lennart and Ann Marie Samuelsson, a geologist 
and his wife from Gothenburg in Sweden. “Apparently my birth mother’s side 
wanted to keep us but they couldn’t track us down. My father’s side was happy 
to let us go.”

Samuelsson recognises that it looks like a curious upbringing, the black 
African boy raised amid the blond, blue-eyed Scandinavians, but as a child, he 
says, you accept the reality you are given. “I had two parents who didn’t look 
like me,” he says, with a shrug. More important to him, was his dad’s obsession 
with fishing. “We lived in a fishing village and though we didn’t have a lot, 
we ate well. I was pickling mackerel and herring. My grandmother Helga was a 
big cook and four nights a week we ate with her. There was lots of foraging. I 
remember shelling peas in front of the TV. September meant mushrooms.” He 
played football (developing an obsession with Arsenal, which had Swedish-born 
players) but quickly gravitated to weekend jobs in kitchens, finding a similar 
team vibe in both places.

You can from somewhere else, yet be American. I’d tried to fit in before but 
you realise it’s not going to happen

At 16, he went to catering college before finding his first professional jobs. 
In 1989 he got a position in a grand Swiss hotel that made him so nervous he 
threw up before every service. He was taught pastry in Austria before landing a 
place at the three Michelin-starred restaurant of Georges Blanc in France, 
where he started right back at the bottom. “If you work for Georges Blanc even 
the lowest guy is fantastic.”

He visited New York for a stage – an unpaid period of employment – at Aquavit, 
a Swedish-influenced restaurant that was beginning to make a name for itself. 
He immediately knew he’d found a town in which he could belong. “Here you could 
be from somewhere else, yet be American,” he says. “I’d tried to fit in but 
eventually you realise it’s just not going to happen that way. I wanted 
somewhere where the conversation was based on talent.”

He returned to New York in the early 1990s, and a job at Aquavit, this time on 
the staff. After the untimely death of the head chef he was put in charge. “I 
was only meant to hold the fort until they found a replacement.” None was ever 
appointed. Shortly after that, Samuelsson received three out of four stars from 
theNew York Times; at 23 he was the youngest chef ever to do so. And so he dug 
into life as a feted New York chef. He could, he says, have carried on like 
that were it not for his sister Linda, who 15 years ago tracked down their 
birth family through the adoption agency. Samuelsson admits this was not 
something to which he’d given much thought; he’d simply considered himself 
fortunate. He credits his sister with “living a fuller life” than he does.

Together they went back to the village of their birth and met their father, a 
priest and farmer. Samuelsson discovered he had eight half siblings, whose 
education he now supports. Not long after that he was teaching a class at the 
Culinary Institute of America when he was heckled by a student. He could talk 
fluently about the food of Sweden and France, the young trainee said, but what 
could he tell them about Africa? “He had a point,” Samuelsson says. “It was 
time to do some research.” He travelled throughout Africa.

 Inside the Red Rooster Photograph: Colin Clark for Observer Food Monthly 
The book that resulted from the journey, 2006’s The Soul of a New Cuisine: a 
Discovery of the Food and Flavours of Africa, came with a foreword from 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and was named best international cookbook by the James 
Beard Foundation. “I was both trying to find out about the food and myself.” 
The African restaurant he opened on the back of it was less successful, which 
made the Red Rooster project – a rebirth for the Red Rooster name, a long-gone 
Harlem institution – that much more important. I ask whether he set up the 
classy soul food restaurant, up here in then down-at-heel Harlem, out of guilt: 
guilt that he had led such a comfortable life when so many in Ethiopia had not, 
guilt that he had enjoyed so much success. He thinks for a moment. “It’s a good 
question. The thing is as a chef you can’t just cut from the centre cut.”

You mean you can’t just always work with the best ingredients? “Exactly. 
Having been to Africa I couldn’t be blind to all that. But I also knew Africa 
wasn’t just about poverty. Getting away from Africa brought with it a 
responsibility. When I was growing up in Sweden we had a saying in my family 
that you should never get stuck on bitter.”

I first came across Samuelsson in 2009 when I was judging Top Chef Masters, a 
US TV show in which big name chefs competed for a $100,000 cheque for charity 
and bragging rights. Samuelsson’s story, always expressed through his food – a 
Swedish-inspired fish dish here, an African stew there – was thrilling and 
that, combined with killer technique, took him to the title. He seemed 
ineffably chilled. But, if anything, the man I meet now is much more at ease 
with himself.

The first stop on our tour of Harlem is Sylvia’s, a local institution just the 
next block down from the Rooster on Lenox, which has been trading there for 
over half a century. Samuelsson moved up to Harlem with his Ethiopian-born 
model wife, Maya Haile, five years before he opened the restaurant. They are 
now expecting their first child. Sylvia’s is all Formica-topped counter, and 
clatter and hiss. Behind that counter is a long “steam table”, a holding place 
for oxtail and fried chicken and collard greens cooked in volume. “I used to 
come up here to eat after service downtown because it’s relaxed,” he says. 
“It’s rooted in African-American dining. Here they want to know how you’re 
doing, how’s your uncle, how’s your mom.” A place like Sylvia’s, he says, is 
one long conversation.


What will happen when Harlem becomes white?

Didn’t he worry that he was going to be stepping on their toes by opening the 
Rooster? After all, they’re famed for their fried chicken and he was going to 
be doing that too. “Their chicken is boneless breast meat. I decided I would do 
only bone-in brown meat. Right there you have a difference. There had to be a 
divide.” He says he’ll be trying to apply the same ideas at the London venture.

Yes, he’ll be bringing his “yardbird” fried chicken to Shoreditch and Helga’s 
meatballs, named after his grandma’s recipe. There will be gravadlax and fried 
fish, and the sudden outbreaks of African spicing that speak of his beginnings. 
“But some of the dishes are going to be interpretations of east London, of the 
dishes of the Jewish community that used to be there and of the Bangladeshi 
community that’s there now. In London, the world is there.” He has been coming 
and going from London for months now, he says, grazing his way along Broadway 
Market in Hackney, or having breakfast at Roast above Borough Market.

Which leads to the inevitable question: just how much time will he be spending 
in London? “I’m not just gonna be phoning it in. Come the fall I’ll be 
relocating, certainly for a while.” It transpires that his wife’s sisters live 
in west London, and with the baby arriving, living there, albeit temporarily, 
makes an awful lot of sense. Plus, he says, it’s the only way to get it right. 
“I can’t claim to have lived in London for five years as I did with Harlem 
before opening. I have to hit a completely different drumbeat.”

We leave Sylvia’s and walk back past the Red Rooster to look at the site of 
what was once the Lenox Lounge, one of Harlem’s great jazz spots. Now it’s 
closed and boarded up. “It’s a sad sight,” he says. But he’s tried to rebalance 
things, by having jazz in the front of the Rooster by the bar, and downstairs 
in the basement at Ginny’s Supper Club, where Alicia Keys has played. “I’m led 
through culture,” he says. “Without culture we are nothing.” Music, he says, is 
a part of that. “I take pride in having musicians sitting next to the ladies 
just in from church and bankers.”

As night falls we take a short cab ride over to 8th Avenue. Unlike Lenox, 
which still has its rough edges, its discount stores and fast food joints, 8th 
Avenue is starting to feel like a creeping extension of the well-to-do Upper 
West Side a few streets south.

Streetbird, Samuelsson’s rotisserie chicken restaurant, is a few blocks away. 
We step inside. The air is thick with the smell of roasting hen and the sound 
of music. It’s themed around hip hop, and received flak when it opened because 
the decor included pairs of hanging trainers, which in New York can be used to
reference inter-gang killings 
<https://www.wbez.org/shows/curious-city/shoes-on-a-wire-untangling-an-urban-myth/f46d882f-dd38-452b-98dc-be406135429a>
. In 2012 he published a memoir,Yes, Chef; the review of it in the New York 
Observer accused him of a condescending approach to Harlem, of using it for his 
own purposes. He shrugs at this and looks around the full tables, as if wearied 
by such political point scoring. He says simply that the site occupied by 
Streetbird was once one of the biggest crack houses in Harlem. “The name Harlem 
is not just some name tag,” he says. “It was here before us. My ambition is to 
make having worked in Harlem as a cook mean something.”

We make our way back to the Rooster, via a couple of still empty jazz venues. 
His own restaurant is now heaving. We are meant to have dinner together, eating 
some of the dishes his team is planning for London. As well as the obvious – a 
whole chicken, tenderised in buttermilk, then deep fried and served with mace 
gravy – there are more refined touches: a savoury macaroon of chicken livers, 
cured salmon on sushi rice, slices of barbecue pork with slippery ribbon 
noodles in a chicken stock that punches hard with ginger. But this, Samuelsson 
says, is a work in progress.

Or at least he says this when I can catch him, because he keeps disappearing 
to hop tables and work the room. Clearly he feels a responsibility to be 
present. Here in this corner of Harlem, he has created much more than just a 
restaurant. Now all Marcus Samuelsson has to do is work the same magic in 
London.

Serves 4-6
For the lingonberry preserves (makes about 650g)
lingonberries 100g (available from scandikitchen.co.uk 
<http://www.scandikitchen.co.uk/>)
sugar 450g
water 950ml 

For the pickled cucumbers 
cucumber 1 
sea salt 1 tbsp 
water 360ml 
white wine vinegar 120ml 
sugar 225g 
bay leaf 1 
allspice 2 berries

For the meatballs
dry breadcrumbs 60g 
double cream 60ml 
red onion 1 medium, finely chopped
olive oil 2 tbsp 
ground chuck or sirloin beef 225g
ground veal 225g
ground pork 225g 
honey 2 tbsp 
egg 1 
salt 1½ tbsp 
black pepper ½ tbsp 
unsalted butter 3 tbsp 

For the sauce
chicken stock 480ml 
double cream 120ml 
lingonberry preserves 165g (see above)
pickle juice 2 tbsp, from the pickled cucumbers (see above)
salt ½ tbsp 
black pepper 2 tsp

For the braised cabbage 
bacon 225g, diced
onion 100g, sliced thin
carrots 75g, sliced thin
red cabbage 300g, thinly sliced 
green cabbage 300g, thinly sliced
apple cider vinegar 60ml 
salt 1 tbsp
black pepper 2 tsp 

To make the lingonberry preserves, combine all the ingredients in a pot and 
bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a low flame and simmer until a syrupy 
consistency is achieved, then cool.


To make the pickled cucumbers, use a mandoline to thinly slice the cucumber. 
Put in a colander, toss with the salt and stand for about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine the water, vinegar, sugar, bay leaf and allspice in a 
medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and let cool.

Rinse the salt off the cucumber and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. 
Put the cucumber and pickling liquid in a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate 
for 3-6 hours before serving.

To make the meatballs, in a small bowl soak the breadcrumbs in the cream, then 
set aside. In a frying pan over a medium heat saute the onion in oil for about 
5 minutes, until softened. Remove from the heat.

Combine the ground beef, veal and pork with the onion, honey and egg, and mix 
well with your hands in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Add the 
soaked breadcrumbs and combine well. With wet hands (to stop the mixture 
sticking) shape into meatballs the size of a golf ball, placing them on a plate 
lightly moistened with water. You should have about 24 meatballs.

Melt the butter in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the 
meatballs in batches and cook, turning frequently, for about 7 minutes. Be sure 
that all sides are browned and the meatballs are cooked through. Transfer them 
to a plate. Reserve 1 tablespoon of fat from the frying pan for the sauce.

To make the sauce, in the meatball frying pan whisk together the reserved fat, 
stock, cream, preserves and pickle juice and bring to a simmer. Let the sauce 
simmer and reduce until thickened. Season to taste. Add the meatballs to the 
sauce, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for about 5 minutes.

To make the braised cabbage, cook the bacon over a medium heat until the fat 
has no colour. Add the onion and carrot, and cook for 10 minutes.

Add the cabbage and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Finish with vinegar, 
salt and pepper.

To serve, place the cabbage on a plate and top with the meatballs. Spoon some 
sauce over each individual meatball. Serve with the lingonberry preserves and 
pickled cucumbers on the side.
