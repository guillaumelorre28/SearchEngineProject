Burnley have won four of their past five home games and, if victorious against 
Sunderland, could end the year in the top half of the table. The absence of 
Jordan Pickford, Sunderland’s breakout star of 2016, may help them as Vito 
Mannone could be rusty after not featuring since 21 August. David Moyes and
Sunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland>, however, are no 
strangers to adversity and will be fired up by the possibility of climbing out 
of the relegation zone.Graham Searles
