Vice-President Joe Biden has attacked the Republican presidential candidate, 
Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, for remarks 
suggesting that soldiers who suffer from mental health issues might not be as 
strong as those who don’t.

“How can he be so out of touch?” Biden asked in an interview that aired on 
Tuesday on CNN. The vice-president also said Trump is “not a bad man”. But he 
added: “His ignorance is profound, so profound.”

Biden also said government leaders in general, including Democrats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats>, have not communicated well 
enough with American people feeling “scared” about their future.

“We don’t speak to them enough,” he said. Biden suggested that the Democratic 
presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, needs to speak more fiercely about 
issues she cares about, but also said “every time she expresses emotion, she 
gets clobbered”.

He called Trump “this megaphone out there” and said supporters “think he 
speaks to them because they haven’t been listening to what he’s been saying”.
