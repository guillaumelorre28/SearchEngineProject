For the past two years, Paris has committed itself to taking on the love lock 
trend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2015/jun/02/paris-padlocks-lovepont-des-arts-bridge-removed-in-pictures>
, in which couples, particularly tourists, attach padlocks to the city’s 
bridges as a symbol of their love.

And since the authorities made the decision to start removing them 18 months 
ago – cutting down an incredible one million padlocks in the process – it has 
been left with 65 tonnes of scrap metal to deal with.

Now, authorities hope that the removed locks will be able to spread some more 
love, after plans were announced to sell 10 tonnes of the locks to members of 
the public keen to possess a piece of Parisian history – and give the proceeds 
to refugee groups.


Bruno Julliard, first deputy mayor of Paris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris>, said, “Members of the public can buy 
five or 10 locks, or even clusters of them, all at an affordable price.

“All of the proceeds will be given to those who work in support and in 
solidarity of the refugees in Paris.”

Juillard added that he hoped the sale, which is expected to take place next 
year, could raise up to €100,000, with the remaining locks melted down and sold 
as scrap.

Paris-based American ex-pat Lisa Anselmo, who launched a high-profile 
preservation campaign – No Love Locks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/mar/31/campaign-paris-love-locks-banned>
 – in January 2014, praised the “interesting twist” to the story: “Paris has 
made a strong statement in this one act. I hope other cities around the world 
will follow its lead.”
