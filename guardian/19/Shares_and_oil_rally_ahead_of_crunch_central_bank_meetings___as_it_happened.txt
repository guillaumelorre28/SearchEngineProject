Over in Greece the government is once again in a race against the clock to 
implement reforms that will unlock further bailout funds.After the tense 
restart of talks with visiting inspectors last week, officials are promising to 
placate creditors with an omnibus bill detailing new measures this week. Helena 
Smith reports from Athens:

With its popularity plummeting in the polls, Greece’s leftist-led government 
is keen to use the resumption of talks with lenders to good effect. Long and 
short, that means debt relief and putting discussion of it on the table. To get 
there Athens needs to complete the current round of prior actions, or milestone 
reforms, it failed to deal with over the summer. Upon them not only rests the 
next installment of bailout aid – at €2.8bn critical for the debt-wracked 
economy - but the onset of official debate over what to do about Greece’s 
unsustainable debt load, at 180% of national output by far the highest in the 
eurozone. “The idea is to push the multi-bill with all these measures through 
parliament this week,” said one well-placed source.

Among the measures will be the appointment of a supervisory board for the 
country’s new privatisation fund - an issue Athens has rowed about vociferously 
with creditors – and the formal inclusion of several loss-making public 
entities in the body.

With Greece’s debt-repayment timetable far from pressing, creditors - though 
peaved with the slow pace of reforms - are not piling on the pressure. Instead 
it is the government, that feeling the pinch of public hostility, is now keen 
to move on to the next step of passing the reforms so theEuro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/euro> Working Group can agree to disburse 
the aid when it next meets on September 29. If that goal is achieved, the hope 
is the next bailout review will begin on October 17 – and with it the much 
anticipated issue of debt forgiveness.

Addressing his Syriza party’s central committee over the weekend, prime 
minister Alexis Tsipras insisted “there will be developments on the debt issue 
soon.”

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

European markets jump ahead of Fed meeting

With a recovery in oil prices and hopes that the US Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> will keep interest rates 
on hold on Wednesday, stock markets have begun the week on an upbeat note.

A weaker dollar helped lift commodity companies, with mining companies making 
up five on the top ten riser on the FTSE 100 index. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 103.27 points or 1.54% at 6813.55 
 * Germany’s Dax jumped 0.95% to 10,373.87 
 * France’s Cac closed 1.43% higher at 4394.19 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB added 1.28% to 16,399.26 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.95% at 8715.5 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market edged 0.36% lower to 557.47 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 75 points or 
0.4%.

Analysts are wondering whether the markets can build on today’s gains ahead of 
the Bank of Japan andFederal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> meetings, or whether we 
are in for more volatility until the outcome of the latest central bank 
deliberations is known.

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

Monday has seen stock markets march higher in lockstep, with healthy gains 
across the board. The FTSE’s mining and oil firms have taken the space afforded 
by a weaker dollar to move strongly higher, and while the index appears to be 
slipping back as the session winds down, it looks like buyers are returning in 
large numbers. Today of course is the calm before the storm, as everyone gears 
up for the BoJ and Fed decisions on Wednesday, so we can expect to see risk 
appetite more severely tested in the coming 48 hours, but for now bearish 
thoughts have been banished.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

There was little new to work with this afternoon, the markets continuing to 
climb on the hopes of Fed inaction on Wednesday.

While not quite as excited as its European peers, the Dow Jones nevertheless 
posted some solid growth this Monday... The dollar, on the other hand, spent 
the day falling from the levels it struck last Friday; against the pound it 
lost more than half a percent, while it shed 0.3% against the euro.

In a remarkably stable showing the European indices didn’t veer from their 
opening growth this Monday. The FTSE [trickled] over the 6800 mark as the index 
benefited from both the lack of rate hike likelihood in the US and the gains 
made by Brent Crude following this morning’s rumours of an OPEC/non-OPEC deal. 
The Eurozone indices saw similar performances for most of the same reasons as 
the UK index, the DAX and CAC seeing 1% and 1.5% increases respectively

It will be interesting to see if this momentum can continue to build tomorrow, 
or whether a) any pre-Fed jitters will set in as September’s meeting grows ever 
closer or, related, b) the lack of data on Tuesday will cause investors with 
too much time on their hands to doubt the decisions they made this Monday.

Elsewhere gold remains a haven in troubled times, not least for central banks. 
Phillip Inman writes:

Central banks have boosted their gold stocks by almost 10% since the financial 
crash, reflecting its renewed attractiveness as a safe haven in an environment 
of uncertainty and low or negative interest rates.

China and Russia have led the switch to gold away from foreign currencies, 
especially the US dollar, to shore up their reserves. Western nations, 
including the UK, have halted several decades of mass sell-offs.

According to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF 
<http://www.omfif.org/>), central banks have swooped on the gold markets 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/12/gold-gordon-brown-sell-off> 
every year since 2008 to become net bullion buyers, adding more than 2,800 
tonnes, or 9.4%, to reserves.

Britain has one of the smallest holdings of gold in the G7 at 0.9% in 2016 
while the US has the largest after increasing its share from 24.5% to 24.8% 
between 2000 and 2016. In 1980, the US had 44.1% of all gold stocks and 75.7% 
in 1940.

“Developed countries [accounting for the lion’s share of total official 
holdings] have been conserving stocks, while developing countries led by China 
and Russia have been building them up.

“This is the longest protracted spell of gold accruals since 1950-65, when 
central banks and treasuries acquired a net total of more than 7,000 tonnes 
during the economic recovery after the second world war,” said David Marsh, the 
director of OMFIF.

Ahead of the Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> meeting come stronger 
than expected US housing figures.

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo housing market index  
<https://www.nahb.org/en/news-and-publications/press-releases/2016/09/builder-confidence-surges-in-september.aspx>
came in at 65 in September compared to forecasts of a level of 60. August’s 
figure of 60 was revised downwards marginally to 59. NAHB chairman Ed Brady

As household incomes rise, builders in many markets across the nation are 
reporting they are seeing more serious buyers, a positive sign that the housing 
market continues to move forward. The single-family market continues to make 
gradual gains and we expect this upward momentum will build throughout the 
remainder of the year and into 2017.

Wall Street opens higher

The rise in global markets continues in the US, ahead of the latest interest 
rate decisions from theFederal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> and the Bank of Japan.

A recovery in the oil price after Venezuela suggested that producers meeting 
at the end of the month might agree action to curb the slump in crude has also 
helped lift shares.

So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 90 points or 0.5%, while 
the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both opened up around 0.3%.

The dollar continues to weaken, on the growing expectation that the US Federal 
Reserve <https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> may not raise 
interest rates this week.

The euro has hit a day’s high of $1.1176 against the US currency while the 
pound is up 0.62% at $1.3078.

As it’s quiet, let’s trawl through some of the charts doing the rounds in the 
City today.

This one shows how imposing negative interest rates can backfire, as it forces 
investors to take their money overseas:

A new report from Bank of International Settlements (the “central banks’ main 
organisation) has also got chart-fans excited.

BIS is very worried that China is on the brink of a banking crisis, as its 
credit boom has soared to new heights. China’s “credit to GDP gap” is now 30.1 
– a level that has historically proved to be bad news (as in the 1997 Asian 
Financial Crisis)

BIS also flag up that inflation is looking rare, despite the huge expansion in 
central bank balance sheets and record low interest rates.

 Franck Dixmier, Global Head of Fixed Income at Allianz Global Investors, 
reckons America’s central bankers won’t be able to keep interest rates on hold 
for much longer.

With core inflation contained well below the US Federal Reserve’s 2 per cent 
target level, the Fed has so far felt no sense of urgency to raise interest 
rates. Nevertheless, given the now almost-full level of employment in the US 
economy, it will be increasingly difficult for the Fed to maintain the status 
quo.

 With investors’ risk appetites coming back during the summer, the arguments 
that the Fed used in June and July to do nothing – citing external risks to 
growth and questionable financial stability linked to Brexit – are no longer 
valid. From now on, the Fed is much more likely to focus on domestic economic 
developments, and those indicators have been growing stronger.

Nevertheless, this monetary policy normalization cycle will probably be very 
different from the ones we have seen in the past. This tells us to expect only 
very gradual and moderate hikes. The Fed will also be particularly keen to keep 
its policy decisions from having any negative effect on US economic growth and 
financial stability.

I suggested earlier that the Bank of Japan was unlikely to cut interest rates 
deeper into negative territory on Wednesday’s meeting.

Masaaki Kanno of JPMorgan Securities Japan doesn’t agree, saying

“We think that the BOJ will likely cut the rate to negative 30 basis points 
from negative 10 basis points.”

He also expects the Bank of Japan to boost its quantitative easing programme, 
and aim to expand the Japanese monetary base even wider.

Other analysts, though, are still plumping for ‘no change’ from the BoJ. As 
Mike Bird of the WSJ points out, there’s more uncertainty than usual...
Mike Bird (@Birdyword) 
Lot of CB meetings are tighten/hold or ease/hold. Not many ease/tighten/hold. 
Not to mention not clear cutting is easing for BOJ any more.

Europe’s builders had a cracking July, according to a new report today.

Construction output across the EU jumped by 1,8% during the month, according 
to Eurostat -- the biggest monthly rise since January.

On an annual basis, construction output was 3.1% higher than a year ago.

Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says:

Building activity was particularly strong in July, rising 2.2% month-on-month 
and 3.2% year-on-year. Civil engineering output was up a lesser 0.4% 
month-on-month, although it was up 2.9% year-on-year.

Economist Rupert Seggins has provided more context too:

Brexit: What it means for passporting

The City is bracing itself for the possibility that it will lose its prized 
‘passporting’ rights if Britain leaves the European single market.

Passporting allows a bank to base itself in one EU country and offer services 
across the bloc. It’s thusextremely useful for London-based investment banks, 
asset managers and the like, who don’t need to be licenced in individual 
European countries.


Now, Germany’s top central banker, Jens Weidmann, has fired a warning shot at 
London that passporting rights will be lost if Britain goes for a ‘hard’ Brexit.

Weidmann told the Guardian that:

...passporting rights are tied to the single market and would automatically 
cease to apply if Great Britain is no longer at least part ofthe European 
Economic Area 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/28/the-norway-option-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-britain>
” (EEA).

That implies that City firms would have to moves sales offices, trading desks 
and middle office jobs into another EU country; time-consuming, expensive, and 
a blow to the UK capital.

Hard Brexit will cost City of London its hub status, warns Bundesbank boss
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/hard-brexit-will-cost-city-of-london-its-hub-status-warns-bundesbank-boss>
Rating agency Moody’s is more optimistic, though. In a new report, it suggests 
that losing passporting rights would “likely be manageable for most UK-based 
financial firms”.

That’s because Moody’s believes other legislation would allow London-based 
firms to sell banking services into the EU even if Britain left the single 
market.

Simon Ainsworth, Senior Vice President at Moody’s, says:

“In particular, we consider that the third country equivalence provisions 
contained within the incoming MIFID 2 EU directive may provide firms with an 
alternative means of accessing the single market. The complexity of (quickly) 
unwinding the status quo and a desire to minimise the initial impact on 
European domiciled banks will likely lead to the preservation of most 
cross-border rights to undertake business.”

But there’s a snag..... that “third country equivalence” relies on a judgement 
from the European Commission. So there’s no escape from uncertainty on this 
issue, so some banks may simply decide to play it safe and move over the 
Channel...

Over in Greece the government is once again in a race against the clock to 
implement reforms that will unlock further bailout funds.After the tense 
restart of talks with visiting inspectors last week, officials are promising to 
placate creditors with an omnibus bill detailing new measures this week. Helena 
Smith reports from Athens:

With its popularity plummeting in the polls, Greece’s leftist-led government 
is keen to use the resumption of talks with lenders to good effect. Long and 
short, that means debt relief and putting discussion of it on the table. To get 
there Athens needs to complete the current round of prior actions, or milestone 
reforms, it failed to deal with over the summer. Upon them not only rests the 
next installment of bailout aid – at €2.8bn critical for the debt-wracked 
economy - but the onset of official debate over what to do about Greece’s 
unsustainable debt load, at 180% of national output by far the highest in the 
eurozone. “The idea is to push the multi-bill with all these measures through 
parliament this week,” said one well-placed source.

Bratislava. Photograph: STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images 
Among the measures will be the appointment of a supervisory board for the 
country’s new privatisation fund - an issue Athens has rowed about vociferously 
with creditors – and the formal inclusion of several loss-making public 
entities in the body.

With Greece’s debt-repayment timetable far from pressing, creditors - though 
peaved with the slow pace of reforms - are not piling on the pressure. Instead 
it is the government, that feeling the pinch of public hostility, is now keen 
to move on to the next step of passing the reforms so theEuro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/euro> Working Group can agree to disburse 
the aid when it next meets on September 29. If that goal is achieved, the hope 
is the next bailout review will begin on October 17 – and with it the much 
anticipated issue of debt forgiveness.

Addressing his Syriza party’s central committee over the weekend, prime 
minister Alexis Tsipras insisted “there will be developments on the debt issue 
soon.”

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
With a recovery in oil prices and hopes that the US Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> will keep interest rates 
on hold on Wednesday, stock markets have begun the week on an upbeat note.

A weaker dollar helped lift commodity companies, with mining companies making 
up five on the top ten riser on the FTSE 100 index. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 103.27 points or 1.54% at 6813.55 
 * Germany’s Dax jumped 0.95% to 10,373.87 
 * France’s Cac closed 1.43% higher at 4394.19 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB added 1.28% to 16,399.26 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.95% at 8715.5 
 * But in Greece, the Athens market edged 0.36% lower to 557.47 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 75 points or 
0.4%.
 
Analysts are wondering whether the markets can build on today’s gains ahead of 
the Bank of Japan andFederal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> meetings, or whether we 
are in for more volatility until the outcome of the latest central bank 
deliberations is known.

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

Monday has seen stock markets march higher in lockstep, with healthy gains 
across the board. The FTSE’s mining and oil firms have taken the space afforded 
by a weaker dollar to move strongly higher, and while the index appears to be 
slipping back as the session winds down, it looks like buyers are returning in 
large numbers. Today of course is the calm before the storm, as everyone gears 
up for the BoJ and Fed decisions on Wednesday, so we can expect to see risk 
appetite more severely tested in the coming 48 hours, but for now bearish 
thoughts have been banished.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

There was little new to work with this afternoon, the markets continuing to 
climb on the hopes of Fed inaction on Wednesday.

While not quite as excited as its European peers, the Dow Jones nevertheless 
posted some solid growth this Monday... The dollar, on the other hand, spent 
the day falling from the levels it struck last Friday; against the pound it 
lost more than half a percent, while it shed 0.3% against the euro.

In a remarkably stable showing the European indices didn’t veer from their 
opening growth this Monday. The FTSE [trickled] over the 6800 mark as the index 
benefited from both the lack of rate hike likelihood in the US and the gains 
made by Brent Crude following this morning’s rumours of an OPEC/non-OPEC deal. 
The Eurozone indices saw similar performances for most of the same reasons as 
the UK index, the DAX and CAC seeing 1% and 1.5% increases respectively

It will be interesting to see if this momentum can continue to build tomorrow, 
or whether a) any pre-Fed jitters will set in as September’s meeting grows ever 
closer or, related, b) the lack of data on Tuesday will cause investors with 
too much time on their hands to doubt the decisions they made this Monday.
 
Elsewhere gold remains a haven in troubled times, not least for central banks. 
Phillip Inman writes:

Central banks have boosted their gold stocks by almost 10% since the financial 
crash, reflecting its renewed attractiveness as a safe haven in an environment 
of uncertainty and low or negative interest rates.

China and Russia have led the switch to gold away from foreign currencies, 
especially the US dollar, to shore up their reserves. Western nations, 
including the UK, have halted several decades of mass sell-offs.

According to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF

<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/12/gold-gordon-brown-sell-off> 
every year since 2008 to become net bullion buyers, adding more than 2,800 
tonnes, or 9.4%, to reserves.

Britain has one of the smallest holdings of gold in the G7 at 0.9% in 2016 
while the US has the largest after increasing its share from 24.5% to 24.8% 
between 2000 and 2016. In 1980, the US had 44.1% of all gold stocks and 75.7% 
in 1940.

“Developed countries [accounting for the lion’s share of total official 
holdings] have been conserving stocks, while developing countries led by China 
and Russia have been building them up.

“This is the longest protracted spell of gold accruals since 1950-65, when 
central banks and treasuries acquired a net total of more than 7,000 tonnes 
during the economic recovery after the second world war,” said David Marsh, the 
director of OMFIF.

Ahead of the Federal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> meeting come stronger 
than expected US housing figures.

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo housing market index  
<https://www.nahb.org/en/news-and-publications/press-releases/2016/09/builder-confidence-surges-in-september.aspx>
came in at 65 in September compared to forecasts of a level of 60. August’s 
figure of 60 was revised downwards marginally to 59. NAHB chairman Ed Brady 
said:

As household incomes rise, builders in many markets across the nation are 
reporting they are seeing more serious buyers, a positive sign that the housing 
market continues to move forward. The single-family market continues to make 
gradual gains and we expect this upward momentum will build throughout the 
remainder of the year and into 2017.

The rise in global markets continues in the US, ahead of the latest interest 
rate decisions from theFederal Reserve 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> and the Bank of Japan.

A recovery in the oil price after Venezuela suggested that producers meeting 
at the end of the month might agree action to curb the slump in crude has also 
helped lift shares.

So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 90 points or 0.5%, while 
the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both opened up around 0.3%.
 
The dollar continues to weaken, on the growing expectation that the US Federal 
Reserve <https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve> may not raise 
interest rates this week.

The euro has hit a day’s high of $1.1176 against the US currency while the 
pound is up 0.62% at $1.3078.
 
As it’s quiet, let’s trawl through some of the charts doing the rounds in the 
City today.

This one shows how imposing negative interest rates can backfire, as it forces 
investors to take their money overseas:

A new report from Bank of International Settlements (the “central banks’ main 
organisation) has also got chart-fans excited.

BIS is very worried that China is on the brink of a banking crisis, as its 
credit boom has soared to new heights. China’s “credit to GDP gap” is now 30.1 
– a level that has historically proved to be bad news (as in the 1997 Asian 
Financial Crisis)

central bank balance sheets and record low interest rates.

The US stock market is expected to open a little higher in an hour’s time, 
following the solid rally in Europe.

The Dow Jones industrial average is being called up around 0.6%:

 Franck Dixmier, Global Head of Fixed Income at Allianz Global Investors, 
reckons America’s central bankers won’t be able to keep interest rates on hold 
for much longer.

With core inflation contained well below the US Federal Reserve’s 2 per cent 
target level, the Fed has so far felt no sense of urgency to raise interest 
rates. Nevertheless, given the now almost-full level of employment in the US 
economy, it will be increasingly difficult for the Fed to maintain the status 
quo.

 With investors’ risk appetites coming back during the summer, the arguments 
that the Fed used in June and July to do nothing – citing external risks to 
growth and questionable financial stability linked to Brexit – are no longer 
valid. From now on, the Fed is much more likely to focus on domestic economic 
developments, and those indicators have been growing stronger.

Nevertheless, this monetary policy normalization cycle will probably be very 
different from the ones we have seen in the past. This tells us to expect only 
very gradual and moderate hikes. The Fed will also be particularly keen to keep 
its policy decisions from having any negative effect on US economic growth and 
financial stability.
 
I suggested earlier that the Bank of Japan was unlikely to cut interest rates 
deeper into negative territory on Wednesday’s meeting.

Masaaki Kanno of JPMorgan Securities Japan doesn’t agree, saying

“We think that the BOJ will likely cut the rate to negative 30 basis points 
from negative 10 basis points.”

He also expects the Bank of Japan to boost its quantitative easing programme, 
and aim to expand the Japanese monetary base even wider.

Other analysts, though, are still plumping for ‘no change’ from the BoJ. As 
Mike Bird of the WSJ points out, there’s more uncertainty than usual...
Mike Bird (@Birdyword) 
Lot of CB meetings are tighten/hold or ease/hold. Not many ease/tighten/hold. 
Not to mention not clear cutting is easing for BOJ any more.

Europe’s builders had a cracking July, according to a new report today.

Construction output across the EU jumped by 1,8% during the month, according 
to Eurostat -- the biggest monthly rise since January.

On an annual basis, construction output was 3.1% higher than a year ago.

Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says:

Building activity was particularly strong in July, rising 2.2% month-on-month 
and 3.2% year-on-year. Civil engineering output was up a lesser 0.4% 
month-on-month, although it was up 2.9% year-on-year.

Economist Rupert Seggins has provided more context too:

The City is bracing itself for the possibility that it will lose its prized 
‘passporting’ rights if Britain leaves the European single market.

Passporting allows a bank to base itself in one EU country and offer services 
across the bloc. It’s thusextremely useful for London-based investment banks, 
asset managers and the like, who don’t need to be licenced in individual 
European countries.


Now, Germany’s top central banker, Jens Weidmann, has fired a warning shot at 
London that passporting rights will be lost if Britain goes for a ‘hard’ Brexit.

Weidmann told the Guardian that:

...passporting rights are tied to the single market and would automatically 
cease to apply if Great Britain is no longer at least part ofthe European 
Economic Area 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/28/the-norway-option-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-britain>
” (EEA).

That implies that City firms would have to moves sales offices, trading desks 
and middle office jobs into another EU country; time-consuming, expensive, and 
a blow to the UK capital.

Hard Brexit will cost City of London its hub status, warns Bundesbank boss

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/hard-brexit-will-cost-city-of-london-its-hub-status-warns-bundesbank-boss>
Rating agency Moody’s is more optimistic, though. In a new report, it suggests 
that losing passporting rights would “likely be manageable for most UK-based 
financial firms”.

That’s because Moody’s believes other legislation would allow London-based 
firms to sell banking services into the EU even if Britain left the single 
market.

Simon Ainsworth, Senior Vice President at Moody’s, says:

“In particular, we consider that the third country equivalence provisions 
contained within the incoming MIFID 2 EU directive may provide firms with an 
alternative means of accessing the single market. The complexity of (quickly) 
unwinding the status quo and a desire to minimise the initial impact on 
European domiciled banks will likely lead to the preservation of most 
cross-border rights to undertake business.”

But there’s a snag..... that “third country equivalence” relies on a judgement 
from the European Commission. So there’s no escape from uncertainty on this 
issue, so some banks may simply decide to play it safe and move over the 
Channel...
 
The FTSE 250 index of smaller, largely-UK focused companies isn’t joining in 
today’s rally.

It’s broadly flat today, dragged down by Mitie’s slump (still down 25%).
