Seema live on site with their young daughter, and will share additional 
equipment for children on request. The swimmable lagoon at Dalawella beach is a

Not to be confused with Ceylon Tea Trails near Hatton, refurbished 1930s 
Ceylon Tea Bungalows in the hills near Bandarawela opened in July, and offers 
comfort, style and personalised service. The five cosy doubles – named after 
villages in the Lake District – even have private butlers. It’s on the 
Hilpankandura estate, and guests can wander the tea fields, join a tea plucking 
session or hike to viewpoints including Lipton’s Seat, favoured perch of 
British tea purveyor Thomas Lipton.

On an organic farm in the Amba Valley, a 30-minute drive from Ella, Amba Estate
’s family-friendly guesthouse began life as just one century-old four-bedroom 
bungalow back in 2013. Two newer cottages were added in July to take the room 
total to 11. The community-based guesthouse is staffed by villagers from the 
valley who receive a 10% share of the revenue. Activities include farm tours, 
tea rolling, trail hiking and mountain biking, and the estate also produces 
artisanal teas and spices, which make lovely gifts to take home.

Dots Bay House on teeny, horseshoe-shaped Hiriketiya bay opened in late 2015 
with three rustic rooms (some with TVs and aircon), and additional beds in an 
open-to-the-breeze dorm with quality linen and mosquito nets. The 
restaurant-bar is a repurposed shipping container, and the setup is sociable; 
many guests linger here far longer than planned. Slightly cheaper beds can be 
had at Dots Surf Cafe Hostel, near the main road, which opened last month, 
attached to a superb cafe and surf shop. Both offer surfing lessons and yoga 
classes, and rent boards too.

Black Cat B&B is a vintage cafe with rooms in an atmospheric 1920s house in 
Colombo’s chi chi Cinnamon Gardens district, close to galleries, cafes and 
shops. It was conceived by a young husband-and-wife team who upgraded the rooms 
(aircon, kingsize beds and bathrooms with strong showers) in modern minimalist 
style, and furnished them with the “basic luxuries” they seek out on their 
travels. Breakfast costs extra, and the cafe is known for its deep-filled 
sandwiches and excellent coffee.

A modern concrete structure with reclaimed antique doors and windows, Urban 
Castle is a bijou hotel eight miles from Kandy, and something of an ode to Sri 
Lanka’s heritage. Its four en suite rooms and upper-floor communal lounge are 
all adorned with Kandyan antiques. The owners are happy to point guests to 
less-visited tea plantations and spice gardens nearby, as well as Kandy’s 
sights. The small swimming pool, flanked by a saffron-walled dining terrace, is 
useful for expelling the calories gained from indulging in the excellent local 
food.

Weligama, a deep sandy bay on the south coast, is Sri Lanka’s best beginners’ 
surf destination.Hangtime Hostel, with nautical-themed female and mixed dorms 
in a three-storey building opposite the beach, doesn’t affiliate with any surf 
school, so guests can choose their own from those lining the sand. All the 
dorms have balconies with rainbow-hued chair hammocks for surveying the surf, 
and there are a few private doubles on the ground floor, with beds crafted from 
old fishing boats. The rooftop cafe has awesome bay views, serves sushi and 
burgers and gets lively during weekly beer pong sessions and open mic nights.

Diklande Estate Bungalow is one of six eco-conscious properties run by Back of 
Beyond, which specialises in simple lodges in alternative locales. Diklande is 
their smartest offering to date, with three en suite rooms opening on to a 
central living-dining area, and a swimming pool set in a jungle grove. It’s on 
a 50-acre, 200-year-old coconut estate in Negombo’s rural hinterland, which 
guests can explore; if they’re lucky, they might get to watch estate workers 
plucking coconuts with sticks and hooks during harvest time. A 30-minute drive 
from Colombo airport, Diklande is a great place to wind down before flying home.

The 55-room, seven-storey Jetwing Jaffna hotel, which opened last April, will 
appeal to those seeking western-style facilities in Sri Lanka’s northernmost, 
Tamil-dominated peninsula. Bedrooms are identical, modern and well-appointed , 
and the decadently designed restaurant serves Jaffna cuisine. Those wanting 
more authentic fare will find it easily in the town’s local restaurants – 
though unlike the hotel, many are dry, owing to the town’s Hindu cultural 
sensitivities. The peninsula is big, so it is worth staying a few days to tour 
it; the spectacularly atmospheric Hindu Nallur Kandaswamy temple on the edge of 
the city, and Nainativu Island’s Nagadeepa (Buddhist) temple are among the 
highlights.
