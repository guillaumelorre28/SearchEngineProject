Sweet aromatics infuse the winter months: ginger, nutmeg, clove, clementine, 
spiced rum and brandy. Their exotic, warming flavours wrap around you like a 
warm blanket. My California blood almost curdled when I was first faced with 
Christmas pudding, but now I crave the concentrated sweetness of sun-dried 
fruits in midwinter. We all know a recipe for the classic, but why not switch 
things up now and again? This week, I’ve created five show-stopping 
alternatives toChristmas <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> 
pudding.

Spiced cheesecake with cranberry compote

At this time of year, I can’t get enough of cranberries. A traditional New 
York-style cheesecake is only made better with this tart, pungent compote.

Makes 1 cake
For the cheesecake
175g ginger biscuits
75g butter, melted
600g cream cheese
180g caster sugar
¼ tsp salt
¼ tsp cinnamon
A grating of black pepper
A grating of nutmeg
¼ tsp mixed spice
A pinch of ground allspice
2 tsp vanilla extract
4 eggs, plus 1 extra yolk
200g creme fraiche

For the cranberry compote
340g cranberries
300g caster sugar
Zest and juice of 1 orange

1 Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Grease a 20cm springform tin.

2 Grind the biscuits in a food processor until fine. Stir in the melted 
butter, then press into the bottom of the tin.

3 Beat the cream cheese with the sugar, salt, pepper, spices and vanilla until 
smooth. Beat in the eggs and extra yolk. Fold in the creme fraiche.

4 Wrap the bottom of the cake tin with tin foil, then scrape in the batter. 
Put it in a roasting pan large enough for it to sit in comfortably. Pour in 
water to 3/4 up the side of the cake tin and bake for 1 hour 20 minutes. It 
should have a slight wobble but be set around the edges. Allow to cool 
completely, then chill in the tin for at least 2 hours.

5 For the compote, add all the ingredients to a heavy-based saucepan. Cook for 
around 15 minutes, or until jammy. Allow to cool.

6 Serve the cheesecake with a dollop of the cranberry compote, or spread it 
all over the top.

Banana, chocolate and spiced rum pavlova

Custard and cream are flavoured with ample nutmeg and booze, topped with 
perfectly ripe bananas drizzled with lashings of dark chocolate ganache.

Perers for the Guardian 
Serves 6-8 
For the meringue
4 egg whites
¼ tsp salt
½ tsp vinegar
1 tsp vanilla extract
270g caster sugar
2 tbsp cornflour
½ a nutmeg, grated, plus extra to finish

 For the custard
50g cornflour
4 egg yolks
600ml whole milk
100g caster sugar
½ tsp salt
2 tsp vanilla extract

For the cream
400ml double cream
2 tbsp rum
A grating of nutmeg
1 tsp vanilla
2 tbsp caster sugar

For the ganache
200g 70% dark chocolate
200ml double cream

To finish
3 ripe (but not over-ripe) bananas

1 Preheat the oven to 110C/230F/gas mark ¼. Line a tray with baking paper. 
With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites, salt, vinegar and vanilla on a 
high speed until soft peaks form.

2 Whisk the sugar, cornflour and nutmeg together by hand, then add half to the 
frothy egg whites. Whisk until very stiff, then add the remaining sugar 
mixture. Whisk until smooth and glossy.

3 Pipe the meringue into a 23cm circle or oval, making a slight depression in 
the centre. Bake for about 2 hours. Remove from the oven. Transfer the meringue 
on to a cooling rack right away to cool completely.

4 To make the custard, have ready an iced water bath, with a bowl set inside 
it. In a small bowl, whisk the cornflour into the yolks.

5 In a heavy-based pan, heat the milk, sugar, salt and vanilla until it starts 
to foam. Pour a little over the yolks to temper, whisk, then return to the pan. 
Cook until the custard has thickened and coats the back of the spoon. The 
custard should be the thickness of a creme patisserie.

6 Transfer the custard to the bowl set in the iced water bath to stop it 
cooking any further. Cover the surface of the custard with clingfilm to prevent 
a skin forming. Chill.

7 For the cream, mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl. Whisk until 
it has just thickened into loose peaks, as it will continue to thicken after 
you stop whisking. Set aside.

8 To make the ganache, chop the chocolate finely and put in a heatproof bowl. 
Heat the cream until it is just bubbling, watching it closely to ensure it 
doesn’t bubble over. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, and leave to sit 
for five minutes. Stir to combine and until the ganache is shiny.

9 To assemble the pavlova, transfer the meringue to a serving dish. Top with 
the custard, then the cream, and finally the sliced bananas. Drizzle with the 
ganache, and finish with a grating of nutmeg.

Figgy mulled wine honey cake (main picture)

Dried figs are plumped with the remains of yesterday’s red wine and steeped in 
spices, then drenched in honey. The texture and stickiness of this one makes it 
my favourite.

Makes 1 cake
400g dried figs
165g unsalted butter
75g brandy
300ml red wine
Zest of 1 orange, and 25ml freshly squeezed orange juice
250g honey, plus extra for drizzling
1 egg
1½ tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp ground cloves
200g wholemeal wheat or wholemeal spelt flour
1½ tsp baking powder
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda

1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and line a 23cm cake tin with 
baking parchment.

2 Trim the rough stems off the figs, then chop into 1cm pieces. Cut the butter 
into small pieces and allow it to soften to room temperature.

3 Put the brandy, wine and dried figs in a heavy-based saucepan and simmer 
over a medium-low heat to plump the figs. After 15 minutes, remove the pan from 
the heat and cool for 20 minutes.

4 Add the orange zest and juice, then stir in the butter and honey. Leave for 
15 minutes, then whisk in the egg.

5 In a separate bowl, whisk together the cinnamon, cloves, flour, baking 
powder and bicarbonate of soda. Slowly whisk into the wet ingredients. Transfer 
the mixture to the prepared tin, and bake for 45 minutes.

6 Cool the cake in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out on to a plate. To 
serve, drizzle with a little extra honey and serve warm with yoghurt.

Orange almond syrup cake

Claudia Roden’s orange cake is famous for its use of an orange boiled whole. 
I’ve spiced it up here with cinnamon, added whole, unpeeled almonds that you 
grind yourself, and drizzled it with a Cointreau-laced syrup.

Guardian 
Makes 1 cake
For the cake
2 large oranges
250g whole almonds (skins on)
6 eggs
200g caster sugar
1 tsp baking powder

 For the custard
2 bay leaves
300ml double cream
3 egg yolks
2 tbsp caster sugar

For the syrup
Juice and zest of 1 orange
100g caster sugar
100ml water
Juice of 1 lemon
4 tbsp Cointreau or other orange liquor

1 Butter and line a 20cm cake tin with baking parchment.

2 Wash the oranges, then simmer them whole (including their peel) in a 
saucepan of water for two hours. Cool, then cut open and remove any pips.

3 Grind the almonds to a fine powder in a food processor, then set aside.

4 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Cut the oranges into quarters and 
put in a food processor. Process to a pulp. Add the ground nuts, then the eggs 
one at a time, then the sugar and baking powder.

5 Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and bake for about an hour. Cool in 
the tin, and then turn out on to a serving plate.

6 For the custard, put the bay leaves and the cream in a heavy-based saucepan. 
Steep over a medium heat just until the cream comes to the boil. Watch it 
closely as it can boil over.

7 In a bowl, whisk together the yolks and sugar. Temper the yolks with a 
little of the bay cream, then return to the saucepan and whisk over a low heat 
for five minutes. Allow to cool.

8 For the syrup, put all the ingredients into a small saucepan. Reduce by 
half. Skewer the cooled cake, then pour half of the syrup over just before 
serving. Serve the remaining syrup separately for pouring over individual 
slices of cake with the custard.

Dulce de leche and chocolate pudding

This is made with the moreish caramel that results from reducing cream and 
sugar or condensed milk into a jam. Chocolate and cinnamon have a long history 
together in Mexico and here they make this delicious, self-saucing, flan-like 
dessert more Christmassy. The cake mixture and the flan mixture could both be 
made in advance and then assembled and baked closer to the serving time. 
Alternatively, you could bake the dish a few hours before serving and serve at 
room temperature, but it really should be made on the day.

 Claire Ptak’s dulce de leche and chocolate pudding. Photograph: Kristin Perers 
for the Guardian 
Makes 1 cake
200g dulce de leche 
¼ tsp Maldon salt

For the cake
150g caster sugar
100g plain flour
40g cocoa powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp baking powder
A pinch of fine sea salt
180g plain yoghurt
4 tbsp mild olive oil
1 egg

For the flan
340g evaporated milk
400g sweetened condensed milk
4 eggs
1 tsp vanilla

1 Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5 and have ready a roasting tray that 
is large enough to house a round or oval pudding dish, and is at least 4cm 
deep. Spread the dulce de leche inside the pudding dish, as if you were 
buttering it. Sprinkle with the Maldon salt.

2 For the cake, whisk together the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, whisk 
together the yoghurt, olive oil and egg. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry 
ingredients, and pour into the prepared pudding dish.

3 In a separate bowl, whisk together the evaporated milk, condensed milk, eggs 
and vanilla. Decant into a jug, and slowly and gently pour this over the 
chocolate cake mixture. You want to try to keep distinct layers at this stage.

4 Set the pudding dish within the larger roasting tray, then carefully fill 
the tray with water until it is halfway up the sides of the pudding dish. Cover 
the whole roasting tray with tin foil (shiny side down), and bake for one hour, 
until the chocolate cake has risen to the top and is set.

5 Remove from the oven and allow the pudding to cool for 10 minutes in the 
water. Remove from the water and cool for another 10 minutes. Run a small sharp 
knife around the perimeter of the pudding to separate it from the dish. Invert 
on to a serving plate and serve.
