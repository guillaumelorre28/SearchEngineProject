Los Angeles Athletic Club

Chaplin lived in this downtown Los Angeles club for long periods during his 
first decade in California. In his autobiography, he praised its sports 
facilities: an Olympic-sized pool, cycling studio, squash courts, billiards 
room, and an indoor running track all open to hotel guests – which are still 
exceptional today. The bedrooms are classic, comfortable and recently 
redecorated, and there are vintage images around the halls of some of the 
sports stars who have trained here. Nearby isCole's 
<http://213nightlife.com/colesfrenchdip>, the oldest public house in LA, opened 
in 1908, which serves "French dip" (meat) sandwiches with jus on the side and 
pickle spears.

Opened by Chaplin and Harry Culver in 1924, the hotel hosted stars including 
Douglas Fairbanks, Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford. Many of the cast of the 
Wizard of Oz, including the munchkins, stayed here during filming in 1938. The 
wedge-shaped building is now a graceful boutique hotel, with small but 
glamorous rooms and friendly staff. It's next door to the large, colonnaded 
Culver Studios, where the burning of Atlanta scenes for Gone with the Wind were 
filmed, and is close toSony Pictures Studios 
<http://www.sonypicturesstudiostours.com/>, open daily for tours ($38pp).

The Cadillac Hotel

This was once Chaplin's summer residence, before becoming a tourist hostel, 
and then what the owners call a "radically, extra-affordable, definitely 
different" hotel. Rooms are basic but comfortable and clean, and it's in a 
lively part of Venice Beach. Hire a bicycle and go to Santa Monica state beach, 
where you'll find theAnnenberg Community Beach House 
<http://annenbergbeachhouse.com/> with free tours of the remaining part of 
Marion Davies's estate. Davies was a silent screen star and long-time 
girlfriend of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. She once led Winston 
Churchill on a hunt around her beach house to find the gin she'd secreted in 
the toilet tanks, away from Hearst's disapproving gaze.

Casa Cody, Palm Springs

In the early days of film, many studios stipulated in actors' contracts that 
they could not travel more than two hours from Hollywood. Palm Springs became a 
thriving desert resort as a result. Harriet Cody, cousin to Buffalo Bill, 
opened her hotel here in 1932. In its grounds is a small adobe house once 
occupied by opera star and actor Lawrence Tibbett, a great friend of Chaplin, 
who would perform on the tiny stage in the house for their Hollywood friends. 
The adobe house is available to rent and many of the other hotel rooms have 
large closets and small kitchens, a legacy of the actors who would stay through 
the winter. Try aBest of the Best tour <http://thebestofthebesttours.com/> of
