Away from Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> briefly and some 
more reaction to the UK jobs numbers.

Some analysts, while acknowleding the latest figures are generally positive, 
wonder if the momentum can continue. Nina Skero, managing economist at the 
Centre forEconomics <https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> and 
Business Research, said:

Given the low unemployment rate and still modest, but accelerating wage growth 
it may be difficult to think of the labour market as anything but robust. 
However, other indicators suggest that a labour market softening may not be far 
off. The latest employment figures saw a decline of 9,000 persons compared to 
the June to August period. Correspondingly, the proportion of people in work 
decreased by 0.1 percentage points compared to June to August 2016 and now 
stands at 74.5%.

The Claimant Count statistics, which are considered experimental by the ONS 
but are the most timely, also suggest that the labour market may be losing some 
steam. In December 2016, the number of people claiming unemployment related 
benefits declined by 10,100 compared to November 2016 but was 26,900 higher 
than in December 2015.

With the economy set for a slowdown in 2017 and 2018, many firms will be more 
reluctant to hire. A worst case scenario could even see some businesses lay off 
existing staff. For instance, many companies that rely on imports find 
themselves in a tricky situation given that a weaker pound has increased their 
production costs but they are unable to raise prices drastically due to fear of 
losing market share. One option for such firms will be to cut down on spending 
by reducing head counts.

On the bright side, although the labour market may soften in the coming year 
it is starting its marginal decline from a place of strength. While we expect 
the unemployment rate to increase from current levels in 2017, it will remain 
below rates seen for much of 2015 and 2014. The real risk lies within wage 
growth which despite the acceleration in the most recent data has been 
unimpressive in the post-crisis period and now stands to be overtaken by 
inflation.

Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Europe, said:

The main headlines from the UK labour market report continued the recent run 
of relatively optimistic news on the state of the economy. The unemployment 
rate held at 4.8%, the fall in the level of employment of 9k 3m/3m was smaller 
than the 35k decrease expected and average earnings growth picked up to 2.8% 
3m/y (inc. bonuses), the strongest since September 2015.

Private sector average earnings growth is now above 3% 3m/y and above 4% 3m/y 
in the retail/restaurant sector, each for the first time since Q3 2015. The 
relative weakness in terms of private sector pay is the financial and business 
service sector where growth is just 1.9% 3m/y. As with the inflation data 
yesterday, this development won’t ease the MPC’s concerns about the anticipated 
period of above-target CPI.

In our assessment there is a very good chance that unemployment rises to 4.9% 
next month, but the more concerning element of the report is the news on total 
hours worked (but also note the highest number of redundancies at 123k since Q1 
2014). In the three months to November 2016 total hours worked fell 1.2mn 
compared to the three months to August. This comprises both the modest fall in 
the level of employment as well as a reduction in average hours worked to 
31.9/wk...

As we flagged recently, the near-term risk to our 1.2% 2017 GDP forecast is 
that the headwinds we have identified don’t materialise as quickly as expected 
at the start of the year, with survey evidence on the outlook remaining 
impressive at the end of 2016. That is likely to lead the Bank of England to 
revise up its GDP forecast at the FebruaryInflation Report but the scale of any 
such optimistic revisions should be tempered given the context of less 
encouraging news on the quantity of labour being used in the economy.

Sadiq Khan to fight 'hard Brexit' at Davos

London mayor Sadiq Khan is in Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> today, as part of his push to 
protect the capital, and its financial centre, from harm from Britain’s exit 
from the EU.

He’s holding various meeting, and will also address business leaders tonight 
at a Morgan Stanley dinner.

According to his office, he will say:

“Securing privileged access to the single market must be the top priority for 
the negotiations. It’s critical for London. Nothing else will do. It can’t be 
brushed aside – as it was yesterday.

“A hard-line approach to Brexit ……. could rip Britain apart. 

“And if we continue on this path - towards a ‘Hard Brexit’ – we risk having to 
explain to future generations why we knowingly put their economy, their 
prosperity and their place on the world stage in such peril.”

The FT’s Katie Martin has a good take 
<https://www.ft.com/content/b763b979-de7d-3bb5-8721-e71428900355> on Joe 
Biden’s sting criticism of Russia, in his final speech as vice-president.

US vice president Joe Biden <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden> has 
pointed the finger of blame specifically at Russia for seeking to “whittle away 
at the edges of the European project.”

The country, he said, is “testing the fault lines between western nations.”

Mr Biden described himself as a committed supporter of globalisation, while 
issuing a plea to defend the “liberal international order” and the close ties 
between the US and Europe that he describes as key to securing prosperity and 
security.

“Impulses to hunker down, to build walls, are precisely the wrong answer,” he 
said.

Biden: US and Europe must defend democratic values

Biden ends his final speech as US vice-president with a rousing call for 
Europe and the US to “lead the fight” to defend the values that created today’s 
world.

That means:

A fight for democracy, a fight to reject isolationism and protectionism”.

Quite a way to bow out of office.

Biden: Russia is stirring things up

Biden then turns to geopolitics, and singles out Russia.

Under president Putin, Russia has been testing the fault lines in other 
nations, says Biden. It is trying to return to a world of ‘spheres of 
influences’, even sending ‘little green men’ across borders to stir up

Biden: Richest 1% aren't pulling their weight
 US vice president Joe Biden addressing Davos Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/EPA 
Looking into his audience of global leaders in Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos>, Biden says a “progressive tax 
system” where everyone pays a fair share will help address the crisis.


And he appeals to their better nature, saying:

I told a group of you last night - the top 1%’s not carrying their weight

You’re not bad guys, you’re good guys.

If you speak to the public and ask if they’d rather have free college 
education, or a raise - they’d take the free college education, Biden continues.

Biden also says that people also need “continuing education” through their 
lives to help them adjust to technology change, and we must ensure basic 
protections for workers.

Biden: Must address the economic trends fuelling social unrest

Millions of people around the world have benefitted from globalisation and new 
technology, Biden continues.

But in other places, factories are closing and jobs are being lost.


Taken together, these forces are effectively hollowing out the middle-class, 
the traditional engine of economic growth and social stability in Western 
nations.

We cannot undo the changes that technology has wrought in our world, nor 
should we try.

But we can and we must take action to mitigate the economic trends that are 
stoking unrest in so many advanced economies and undermining people’s basic 
sense of dignity.

Biden is speaking about how the liberal world order pioneered by the US and 
Europe after world war 2 delivered unprecedented growth and security; but it is 
now at threat.

He explains how his father had explained that a job was about more than just a 
pay cheque; it was also about self respect and worth.

And he talks about how workers are losing out:

In my country, there used to be a basic bargain since the mid-20th century, 
agreed by both parties....

If you contributed to the success of the enterprise that you were engaged, you 
got to share the success and the profits.

Biden: Palpable uncertainty about the world today

Biden begins by telling that there is “palpable uncertainty about the state of 
the world.”

And he doesn’t mean the transfer of power in America this week.


In two days there will be a new president of the United States...

<boo> calls out one delegate.

No, Biden replies.

The challenges we face, and the choices we must make as an international 
community doesn’t hinge exclusively on Washington’s leadership.

Whether we reinforce the ties that bind us or whether we unravel under the 
current pressure. These choices must be made by very single nation.

Away from Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> briefly and some 
more reaction to the UK jobs numbers.

Some analysts, while acknowleding the latest figures are generally positive, 
wonder if the momentum can continue. Nina Skero, managing economist at the 
Centre forEconomics <https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> and 
Business Research, said:

Given the low unemployment rate and still modest, but accelerating wage growth 
it may be difficult to think of the labour market as anything but robust. 
However, other indicators suggest that a labour market softening may not be far 
off. The latest employment figures saw a decline of 9,000 persons compared to 
the June to August period. Correspondingly, the proportion of people in work 
decreased by 0.1 percentage points compared to June to August 2016 and now 
stands at 74.5%.

The Claimant Count statistics, which are considered experimental by the ONS 
but are the most timely, also suggest that the labour market may be losing some 
steam. In December 2016, the number of people claiming unemployment related 
benefits declined by 10,100 compared to November 2016 but was 26,900 higher 
than in December 2015.

With the economy set for a slowdown in 2017 and 2018, many firms will be more 
reluctant to hire. A worst case scenario could even see some businesses lay off 
existing staff. For instance, many companies that rely on imports find 
themselves in a tricky situation given that a weaker pound has increased their 
production costs but they are unable to raise prices drastically due to fear of 
losing market share. One option for such firms will be to cut down on spending 
by reducing head counts.

On the bright side, although the labour market may soften in the coming year 
it is starting its marginal decline from a place of strength. While we expect 
the unemployment rate to increase from current levels in 2017, it will remain 
below rates seen for much of 2015 and 2014. The real risk lies within wage 
growth which despite the acceleration in the most recent data has been 
unimpressive in the post-crisis period and now stands to be overtaken by 
inflation.
 Unemployment rate holds steady but could start to rise Photograph: Global 
Warming Images/REX 
Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Europe, said:

The main headlines from the UK labour market report continued the recent run 
of relatively optimistic news on the state of the economy. The unemployment 
rate held at 4.8%, the fall in the level of employment of 9k 3m/3m was smaller 
than the 35k decrease expected and average earnings growth picked up to 2.8% 
3m/y (inc. bonuses), the strongest since September 2015.

Private sector average earnings growth is now above 3% 3m/y and above 4% 3m/y 
in the retail/restaurant sector, each for the first time since Q3 2015. The 
relative weakness in terms of private sector pay is the financial and business 
service sector where growth is just 1.9% 3m/y. As with the inflation data 
yesterday, this development won’t ease the MPC’s concerns about the anticipated 
period of above-target CPI.

In our assessment there is a very good chance that unemployment rises to 4.9% 
next month, but the more concerning element of the report is the news on total 
hours worked (but also note the highest number of redundancies at 123k since Q1 
2014). In the three months to November 2016 total hours worked fell 1.2mn 
compared to the three months to August. This comprises both the modest fall in 
the level of employment as well as a reduction in average hours worked to 
31.9/wk...

As we flagged recently, the near-term risk to our 1.2% 2017 GDP forecast is 
that the headwinds we have identified don’t materialise as quickly as expected 
at the start of the year, with survey evidence on the outlook remaining 
impressive at the end of 2016. That is likely to lead the Bank of England to 
revise up its GDP forecast at the FebruaryInflation Report but the scale of any 
such optimistic revisions should be tempered given the context of less 
encouraging news on the quantity of labour being used in the economy.
 
London mayor Sadiq Khan is in Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> today, as part of his push to 
protect the capital, and its financial centre, from harm from Britain’s exit 
from the EU.

He’s holding various meeting, and will also address business leaders tonight 
at a Morgan Stanley dinner.

According to his office, he will say:

“Securing privileged access to the single market must be the top priority for 
the negotiations. It’s critical for London. Nothing else will do. It can’t be 
brushed aside – as it was yesterday.

“A hard-line approach to Brexit ……. could rip Britain apart. 

“And if we continue on this path - towards a ‘Hard Brexit’ – we risk having to 
explain to future generations why we knowingly put their economy, their 
prosperity and their place on the world stage in such peril.”
 
Biden left the stage to a rousing standing ovation - but I suspect it won’t be 
last time we see him at Davos:
 
The FT’s Katie Martin has a good take 
<https://www.ft.com/content/b763b979-de7d-3bb5-8721-e71428900355> on Joe 
Biden’s sting criticism of Russia, in his final speech as vice-president.

US vice president Joe Biden <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden> has 
pointed the finger of blame specifically at Russia for seeking to “whittle away 
at the edges of the European project.”

The country, he said, is “testing the fault lines between western nations.”

Mr Biden described himself as a committed supporter of globalisation, while 
issuing a plea to defend the “liberal international order” and the close ties 
between the US and Europe that he describes as key to securing prosperity and 
security.

“Impulses to hunker down, to build walls, are precisely the wrong answer,” he 
said.

Biden ends his final speech as US vice-president with a rousing call for 
Europe and the US to “lead the fight” to defend the values that created today’s 
world.

That means:

A fight for democracy, a fight to reject isolationism and protectionism”.

Quite a way to bow out of office.

Biden out. He didn't pull his punches.

Biden then turns to geopolitics, and singles out Russia.

Under president Putin, Russia has been testing the fault lines in other 
nations, says Biden. It is trying to return to a world of ‘spheres of 
influences’, even sending ‘little green men’ across borders to stir up 
separatism in Ukraine.

And he insists that Nato’s ‘sacred’ commitment to defend each other from 
attacks can never be questioned (a nudge towards Donald Trump, who has 
suggested the alliance is obsolete)

Looking into his audience of global leaders in Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos>, Biden says a “progressive tax 
system” where everyone pays a fair share will help address the crisis.


And he appeals to their better nature, saying:

I told a group of you last night - the top 1%’s not carrying their weight

You’re not bad guys, you’re good guys.

If you speak to the public and ask if they’d rather have free college 
education, or a raise - they’d take the free college education, Biden continues.

Biden also says that people also need “continuing education” through their 
lives to help them adjust to technology change, and we must ensure basic 
protections for workers.
 
Millions of people around the world have benefitted from globalisation and new 
technology, Biden continues.

But in other places, factories are closing and jobs are being lost.


Taken together, these forces are effectively hollowing out the middle-class, 
the traditional engine of economic growth and social stability in Western 
nations.

We cannot undo the changes that technology has wrought in our world, nor 
should we try.

But we can and we must take action to mitigate the economic trends that are 
stoking unrest in so many advanced economies and undermining people’s basic 
sense of dignity.
 
Biden is speaking about how the liberal world order pioneered by the US and 
Europe after world war 2 delivered unprecedented growth and security; but it is 
now at threat.

He explains how his father had explained that a job was about more than just a 
pay cheque; it was also about self respect and worth.

And he talks about how workers are losing out:

In my country, there used to be a basic bargain since the mid-20th century, 
agreed by both parties....

If you contributed to the success of the enterprise that you were engaged, you 
got to share the success and the profits.
 
Biden begins by telling that there is “palpable uncertainty about the state of 
the world.”

And he doesn’t mean the transfer of power in America this week.


In two days there will be a new president of the United States...

<boo> calls out one delegate.

No, Biden replies.

The challenges we face, and the choices we must make as an international 
community doesn’t hinge exclusively on Washington’s leadership.

Whether we reinforce the ties that bind us or whether we unravel under the 
current pressure. These choices must be made by very single nation.
