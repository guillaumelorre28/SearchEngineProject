Gustavo Kuerten kept up his indomitable form on European clay - he has already 
won the year's first major title on the surface in Monte Carlo - as he swept 
into the final of the Italian Open and reinforced his favouritism for the 
French Open later this month.

Kuerten, who will be defending champion in Paris, overwhelmed Sweden's Andreas 
Vinciguerra 6-2 6-4 on the Foro Italico's red clay, supplementing his usual 
barrage of groundstroke winners with 13 aces. He faces the Spaniard Juan Carlos 
Ferrero in today's best-of-five-sets final.

Ferrero, who lost to Kuerten in the semi-finals of last year's French Open, is 
unlikely to yield to the Brazilian without a fight. He beat Nicolas Lapentti 
6-3 6-3 yesterday to go through to his first Masters Series final without 
dropping a set.

Ferrero, the eighth seed, moved Lapentti around the court with a mixture of 
topspin and hard, flat drives until the dispirited Ecuadorian double-faulted on 
match point. Kuerten said: 'I had a little trouble in the first round, but from 
there I have built my game and my confidence now is very high.

'I am also learning how to deal with pressure and handle everybody's 
expectations better. I sometimes can't believe all this is happening to me. I 
used to watch Lendl and Muster play on clay, and I tried to copy them.'
