Well, Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> brought it on 
themselvesand failed to kick on from scoring the opener through their skipper, 
Aubameyang, who found the net with his only real chance in the game. 
Guinea-Bissau’s heads never dropped and it looked as though they were going to 
be unlucky, until Soares’s late diving header. A deserved reward, and what a 
start for Baciro Candé’s side of predominantly unattached players. The scenes 
of celebration at full-time, with players being mobbed by supporters over the 
advertising hoardings, tell you all you need to know.

A thoroughly enjoyable match, with Guinea-Bissau getting the just reward for 
their efforts. Burkina Faso play Cameroon tonight, in an hour or so, in the 
other Group A match. Next up for Guinea-Bissau are Cameroon on Wednesday, while 
Burkina Faso will play tournament hosts Cameroon.Thanks for your company, 
emails and tweets, and don’t forget to check out the match report below. Bye!

Full-time! Gabon 1-1 Guinea-Bissau

So Guinea-Bissau, the smallest nation in this competition, have a point in 
their first ever match at a major tournament. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looks 
rather glum as he leaves the field while it’s all smiles for Guinea-Bissau, who 
have recorded a famous point in this Group A opener.

90+3 min: Zezinho, the Guinea-Bissau captain, is pushing everybody forward for 
one last attack, as they win yet another free-kick. They go short and the

90+2 min: Mendes, the Guinea-Bissau goalkeeper is down once more. It looks as 
though he has cramp this time. Either that, or it’s some marvellous 
time-wasting.

That is some header too, with Soares diving from another of Zezinho’s deep 
cross. He has silenced the home crowd, and every member of the team has ran off 
to celebrate with the defender who found the net.Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> have dropped two points here it 
seems, but they’ve been far from convincing.

87 min: José Luis Camacho is frantically trying to make another change for 
Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>. They need to disrupt 
Guinea-Bissau’s rhythm somehow, who just keep coming back at them time and 
again. It’s forward Evouna Malick who will be replaced by Kevin Angoue.

85 min: A huge chance for Guinea-Bissau! Zezinho floats in the set-piece but 
Frederic Mendy’s header is straight at the Gabon goalkeeper. Mendy escaped his 
marker and leapt high, getting good power on his effort but it’s directly into 
the hands of theGabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> stopper.

78 min: Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> slow things down in 
an attempt to take back control. Since going in front, they’ve stalled a bit. 
Zezinho, meanwhile, the Guinea-Bissau captain, looks in considerable pain and 
is on the floor with what looks like an achilles injury. The midfielder 
appeared to land awkwardly on the pitch, which is a little cut up.

75 min: Just wide from Rudinilson, the Guinea-Bissau defender! Zezinho’s 
corner is not properly cleared and the centre-back half-volleys an effort that 
falls just wide of goal. If that was on target, it surely would have nestled 
into the back of the net. Guinea-Bissau are not out of this just yet. A free 
agent, too, remember! Swansea City conceded four, while Peterborough conceded 
five today ... Rudinilson’s done himself no harm whatsoever.

73 min: A change for Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>, as 
Lemina is withdrawn for Guelor Kanga, who plays his club football in Serbia 
with Red Star Belgrade. Piqueti, then, has a sight at goal and he lets fly, and 
his effort is deflected for a corner-kick. And before it’s taken, Guinea-Bissau 
make their final change, as Balde replaces Junior.

70 min: Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> supporters are in 
good spirits now, dancing and singing away ... but they still only have a 
one-goal lead. Dabo combines with Toni Silva, who does brilliantly before 
firing his effort at the goalkeeper. Silva will have won plenty of admirers on 
this showing, he’s proved to be Guinea-Bissau’s best outlet.

69 min: It would have been a spectacular goal! Lemina runs in behind the back 
four, and gets his cross in from the byline. The ball is played behind 
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who tries to hook it goalwards on the volley but 
it’s always rising. The chance is gone, and the striker’s wry smile says as 
much.

65 min: Guinea-Bissau surge forward once more and they appear to have rolled 
up their sleevs a little. Piqueti causes the Gabon defenders to backpeddle 
before the ball eventually rolls out play on the flank. Obiang, theGabon

63 min: Guinea-Bissau win a free-kick, as Nanissio Soares does brilliantly to 
swivel away from his marker before winning a foul. The visitors really have not 
disgraced themselves at all here, and could have taken the lead. They will 
doubtless pay for their profligacy, though.

break? They have been rejuvenated since half-time. Palun, in particular, is

57 min: That goal from Aubameyang has seen Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> come alive but there’s still very 
much a game on. Guinea-Bissau charge down the right-hand flank through Toni 
Silva and he jinks past his man to cross for Camara. It causes panic before the 
coolest head in the box, Appindangoye, does superbly to calmly chest the ball 
back to his goalkeeper.

exactly why he’s so prolific. Guinea-Bissau looked the more dangerous team but 
the opening 10 minutes of this second period have seen Gabon grapple hold of 
the match.Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> are camped inside

GOAL! Gabon 1-0 Guinea-Bissau (Aubameyang, 53)

Aubameyang just could not miss from there. The Dortmund striker slides home a 
yard or so out from goal to convert a low cross from Bouanga. The tension 
around Stade d’Angondjé has been lifted as a result of that breakthrough and 
suddenlyGabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> are in pole 
position. This will be a real test of character now for Guinea-Bissau.
 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, left, slides in to give Gabon the lead.

49 min: Mendes tips over from Bouanga! The winger darts inside onto his right 
foot, before bending a shot goalwards and the Guinea-Bissau keeper does well to 
keep it out.Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> suddenly look 
like they want to take charge of this match now. Palun then combines with 
Bouanga, who whips in a floating ball, which Mendes punches clear. He’s taken a 
whack for his efforts, though.

47 min: Mendes hoofs the ball upfield but Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> come straight back at them, 
Aubameyang sprints through over the top but he’s flagged offside. It’s more 
encouraging at least for the hosts.

The teams are on their way back out for the second half. Meanwhile, rapper 
Booba is serenading the crowd and players pitch-side, as they gear up for the 
next 45 minutes. The officials look pretty bewildered by the Frenchman’s 
lyrics. According to Wikipedia, he’s got a 2013 hit called “A.C. Milan”.

Half-time! Gabon 0-0 Guinea-Bissau

The hosts have failed to really showcase any of their talents, and, instead, 
Guinea-Bissau are doing themselves justice in this Group A and tournament 
opener. The “wild dogs” have made Aubameyang and Lemina, of Dortmund and 
Juventus respectively, look rather ordinary. The pair have been marshalled well 
by the Guinea-Bissau backline, including free agent Rudinilson Silva.

It was Toni Silva, the Guinea-Bissau winger who squandered probably the best 
chance of the match, while Lemina should have done better with his header. The 
second half, if nothing else, will surely see a better performance fromGabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>. The next 45 minutes will prove 
something of a litmus test for both teams’ competition credentials.

44 min: A wild challenge from Manga and he’s duly reprimanded by the referee. 
A reckless, high challenge leaves Guinea-Bissau’s Francisco Junior in a heap on 
the floor.

43 min: A great chance for Guinea-Bissau! But Toni Silva’s volley falls just 
wide after chesting the ball down just inside the box. Baciro Candé will be 
very pleased with his side’s first-half display. Silva, once of Liverpool, 
Barnsley and Northampton Town, has looked pretty nifty so far.

40 min: Bouanga’s involved once more, and it’s his sweeping free-kick in from 
the right that causes panic in the Guinea-Bissau box. It’s a fine, whipped ball 
in but Lemina fails to get his header on target. He makes very little contact 
and that’s a big chance gone, perhaps the best in this matchup so far.

39 min: Bouanga looks to latch onto a through ball but is blocked en route to 
the box. A foul is given against the winger though which is probably a little 
harsh. Bouanga later has a go with some head tennis and he looks to find a 
passage towards goal.

37 min: For Guinea-Bissau, it’s a case of so far so good as they’ve 
neutralised Gabon’s key threats. Mendes is back on his feet too, and has just 
took an age over a goal kick. Time-wasting, even at this early stage, it seems.

Well, Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> brought it on 
themselvesand failed to kick on from scoring the opener through their skipper, 
Aubameyang, who found the net with his only real chance in the game. 
Guinea-Bissau’s heads never dropped and it looked as though they were going to 
be unlucky, until Soares’s late diving header. A deserved reward, and what a 
start for Baciro Candé’s side of predominantly unattached players. The scenes 
of celebration at full-time, with players being mobbed by supporters over the 
advertising hoardings, tell you all you need to know.

A thoroughly enjoyable match, with Guinea-Bissau getting the just reward for 
their efforts. Burkina Faso play Cameroon tonight, in an hour or so, in the

So Guinea-Bissau, the smallest nation in this competition, have a point in 
their first ever match at a major tournament. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looks 
rather glum as he leaves the field while it’s all smiles for Guinea-Bissau, who 
have recorded a famous point in this Group A opener.

90+3 min: Zezinho, the Guinea-Bissau captain, is pushing everybody forward for 
one last attack, as they win yet another free-kick. They go short and the 
whistle is blown.
 
90+2 min: Mendes, the Guinea-Bissau goalkeeper is down once more. It looks as 
though he has cramp this time. Either that, or it’s some marvellous 
time-wasting.
 
That is some header too, with Soares diving from another of Zezinho’s deep 
cross. He has silenced the home crowd, and every member of the team has ran off 
to celebrate with the defender who found the net.Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> have dropped two points here it 
seems, but they’ve been far from convincing.

And how deserved it has been too!
 
88 min: Piqueti has shown plenty of pace and trickery in his cameo here. The 
TV commentator’s just likened his approach to Senegal’s Sadio Mané, which feels 
about right on the 20 minutes or so of evidence here. Meanwhile, Guinea-Bissau 
have yet another free-kick ...
 
87 min: José Luis Camacho is frantically trying to make another change for 
Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>. They need to disrupt 
Guinea-Bissau’s rhythm somehow, who just keep coming back at them time and 
again. It’s forward Evouna Malick who will be replaced by Kevin Angoue.
 
85 min: A huge chance for Guinea-Bissau! Zezinho floats in the set-piece but 
Frederic Mendy’s header is straight at the Gabon goalkeeper. Mendy escaped his 
marker and leapt high, getting good power on his effort but it’s directly into 
the hands of theGabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> stopper.
 
84 min: Piqueti has been a real livewire since coming on for Guinea-Bissau, 
and he’s just won another free-kick, to ensure a nervous finish at the Stade 
d’Angondjé.
 
82 min: Zezinho’s back on his feet and takes a deep free-kick just inside the 
opposition half, which reaches Mendy but N’dong, Sunderland’s £13m record 
signing, wins a free-kick. Danger averted.
 
81 min: There’s no carnival atmosphere just yet but the horns are back out, as 
theGabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> supporters victory in 
their Group A opener is ever closer. It’s been a far from convincing 
performance, and Dabo has just done well again down the right for Guinea-Bissau 
before his cross is cleared.
 
78 min: Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> slow things down in 
an attempt to take back control. Since going in front, they’ve stalled a bit. 
Zezinho, meanwhile, the Guinea-Bissau captain, looks in considerable pain and 
is on the floor with what looks like an achilles injury. The midfielder 
appeared to land awkwardly on the pitch, which is a little cut up.
 
75 min: Just wide from Rudinilson, the Guinea-Bissau defender! Zezinho’s 
corner is not properly cleared and the centre-back half-volleys an effort that 
falls just wide of goal. If that was on target, it surely would have nestled 
into the back of the net. Guinea-Bissau are not out of this just yet. A free 
agent, too, remember! Swansea City conceded four, while Peterborough conceded 
five today ... Rudinilson’s done himself no harm whatsoever.
 
73 min: A change for Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>, as 
Lemina is withdrawn for Guelor Kanga, who plays his club football in Serbia 
with Red Star Belgrade. Piqueti, then, has a sight at goal and he lets fly, and 
his effort is deflected for a corner-kick. And before it’s taken, Guinea-Bissau 
make their final change, as Balde replaces Junior.
 
70 min: Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> supporters are in 
good spirits now, dancing and singing away ... but they still only have a 
one-goal lead. Dabo combines with Toni Silva, who does brilliantly before 
firing his effort at the goalkeeper. Silva will have won plenty of admirers on 
this showing, he’s proved to be Guinea-Bissau’s best outlet.

69 min: It would have been a spectacular goal! Lemina runs in behind the back 
four, and gets his cross in from the byline. The ball is played behind 
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who tries to hook it goalwards on the volley but 
it’s always rising. The chance is gone, and the striker’s wry smile says as 
much.
 
66 min: Camara is replaced by Frederic Mendy, who plays his club football in 
South Korea. Mendy is found straightaway after Junior goes into the challenge 
to win the ball back.Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> appear 
to have taken their foot off the gas a little. Can Guinea-Bissau seize on their 
opponents’ lax spell.
 
65 min: Guinea-Bissau surge forward once more and they appear to have rolled 
up their sleevs a little. Piqueti causes the Gabon defenders to backpeddle 
before the ball eventually rolls out play on the flank. Obiang, theGabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> defender, meanwhile has just 
picked up the first yellow card of the tournament.
 
63 min: Guinea-Bissau win a free-kick, as Nanissio Soares does brilliantly to 
swivel away from his marker before winning a foul. The visitors really have not 
disgraced themselves at all here, and could have taken the lead. They will 
doubtless pay for their profligacy, though.
 
60 min: The first change of the afternoon sees Guinea-Bissau’s Mario replaced 
by Piqueti Djassi. Mario appeared to roll his ankle on the byline only a moment 
before but did get back up on to his feet. Meanwhile,Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> seize back possession through 
Bouanga, who’s starred so far this second half.
 
59 min: Just what did José Luis Camacho, the Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> coach, say to his players at the 
break? They have been rejuvenated since half-time. Palun, in particular, is 
finding lots of joy down the right.
 
57 min: That goal from Aubameyang has seen Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> come alive but there’s still very 
much a game on. Guinea-Bissau charge down the right-hand flank through Toni 
Silva and he jinks past his man to cross for Camara. It causes panic before the 
coolest head in the box, Appindangoye, does superbly to calmly chest the ball 
back to his goalkeeper.
 
55 min: Aubameyang has taken his only real chance of the game, and that’s 
exactly why he’s so prolific. Guinea-Bissau looked the more dangerous team but 
the opening 10 minutes of this second period have seen Gabon grapple hold of 
the match.Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> are camped inside 
the visitors’ box now.
 
Aubameyang just could not miss from there. The Dortmund striker slides home a 
yard or so out from goal to convert a low cross from Bouanga. The tension 
around Stade d’Angondjé has been lifted as a result of that breakthrough and 
suddenlyGabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> are in pole 
position. This will be a real test of character now for Guinea-Bissau.

49 min: Mendes tips over from Bouanga! The winger darts inside onto his right 
foot, before bending a shot goalwards and the Guinea-Bissau keeper does well to 
keep it out.Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> suddenly look 
like they want to take charge of this match now. Palun then combines with 
Bouanga, who whips in a floating ball, which Mendes punches clear. He’s taken a 
whack for his efforts, though.
 
47 min: Mendes hoofs the ball upfield but Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> come straight back at them, 
Aubameyang sprints through over the top but he’s flagged offside. It’s more 
encouraging at least for the hosts.
 
46 min: Guinea-Bissau get us back underway, they’re straight on the front 
foot, too, through the captain Zezinho and Toni Silva, their two most dangerous 
players in the first half.
 
The teams are on their way back out for the second half. Meanwhile, rapper 
Booba is serenading the crowd and players pitch-side, as they gear up for the 
next 45 minutes. The officials look pretty bewildered by the Frenchman’s 
lyrics. According to Wikipedia, he’s got a 2013 hit called “A.C. Milan”.
 
The hosts have failed to really showcase any of their talents, and, instead, 
Guinea-Bissau are doing themselves justice in this Group A and tournament 
opener. The “wild dogs” have made Aubameyang and Lemina, of Dortmund and 
Juventus respectively, look rather ordinary. The pair have been marshalled well 
by the Guinea-Bissau backline, including free agent Rudinilson Silva.

It was Toni Silva, the Guinea-Bissau winger who squandered probably the best 
chance of the match, while Lemina should have done better with his header. The 
second half, if nothing else, will surely see a better performance fromGabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>. The next 45 minutes will prove 
something of a litmus test for both teams’ competition credentials.

45 min: The resulting free-kick sees Zezinho blast at goal from about 35 yards 
out. It’s deflected for a corner, which will surely be the last action of this 
half.
 
44 min: A wild challenge from Manga and he’s duly reprimanded by the referee. 
A reckless, high challenge leaves Guinea-Bissau’s Francisco Junior in a heap on 
the floor.
 
43 min: A great chance for Guinea-Bissau! But Toni Silva’s volley falls just 
wide after chesting the ball down just inside the box. Baciro Candé will be 
very pleased with his side’s first-half display. Silva, once of Liverpool, 
Barnsley and Northampton Town, has looked pretty nifty so far.
 
42 min: Evouna looks up at goal from just outside the box, looks to surge 
towards goal and falls flat on his face after tripping over the ball ...
 
40 min: Bouanga’s involved once more, and it’s his sweeping free-kick in from 
the right that causes panic in the Guinea-Bissau box. It’s a fine, whipped ball 
in but Lemina fails to get his header on target. He makes very little contact 
and that’s a big chance gone, perhaps the best in this matchup so far.

39 min: Bouanga looks to latch onto a through ball but is blocked en route to 
the box. A foul is given against the winger though which is probably a little 
harsh. Bouanga later has a go with some head tennis and he looks to find a 
passage towards goal.
 
37 min: For Guinea-Bissau, it’s a case of so far so good as they’ve 
neutralised Gabon’s key threats. Mendes is back on his feet too, and has just 
took an age over a goal kick. Time-wasting, even at this early stage, it seems.
