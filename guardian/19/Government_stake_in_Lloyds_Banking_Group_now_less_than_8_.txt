The government’s stake in Lloyds Banking Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/17/lloyds-banking-group-from-bailout-to-selloff>
 is now less than 8% – down from 43% at the time of its £20bn taxpayer bailout 
in 2008.

The reduction took place after Philip Hammond abandoned any attempt at a 
discounted offer of shares to the public and pressed on with plans to sell 
shares on the stock market. Thecurrent sales

 are taking place at a price lower than the 73.6p average price paid for the 
stake during the time of the crisis.

Even so, the chancellor expects to recoup the total amount injected into the 
bank, which rescued HBOS during the height of the crisis.

“Selling our shares in Lloyds Banking Group 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group> and making sure 
that we get back all the cash taxpayers injected into it during the financial 
crisis is one of my top priorities as chancellor,” said Hammond, as he prepared 
to present his plans for the post-Brexit vote economy in Wednesday’s autumn 
statement.

Lloyds shares are trading at just below 60p. While the stake in Lloyds is 
falling, the government is holding on to its 73% stake in Royal Bank of 
Scotland. Hammond said last month that the time had not come to sell off any 
more of the shares in the Edinburgh-based bank, in which onlya 5% stake was 
sold in August 2015 at a £1bn loss.
