 Kate Beckinsale in Love & Friendship: ‘She reminded me of JR [in Dallas].’ 
Photograph: Bernard Walsh/AP 
I went with my girlfriend on a whim and loved it – I laughed almost all the 
way through. It was charming and clever. I liked the characterisation, the 
witty lines. I suppose it was a bit like an 18th-centuryDallas, in that the 
main character seemed to be able to get all the other characters to do exactly 
what she wanted without them realising it, which reminded me of JR – although 
the language was a little different. It was a delightful film, and it’s one we 
came out of with big smiles.

This was recommended to me by the outgoing chairman of the National Theatre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/national-theatre>, and it’s one of the best 
productions I’ve seen there: it was powerful and very gripping. It’s set in 
Africa, and it’s about the effects of colonialism and its demise. Nice to see a 
cello on stage as well, in the middle of Africa – it’s there to represent 
something [a character you never see], and it was thought-provoking.

 ‘A master at the piano’: Kirill Gerstein. Photograph: Marco Borggreve 
My friend Kirill Gerstein is playing [on 7 August 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/evnbp6>] what has turned out to be the authentic 
version of the famous Tchaikovsky first piano concerto, which is so much nicer 
than the version everybody plays. He found that the version we’ve been playing 
is wrong: somebody made an addition that wasn’t necessarily approved by 
Tchaikovsky, but it became the standard edition. Funnily enough there’s a wrong 
version of a cello piece by Tchaikovsky too, and people were playing it for 
many years. Kirill is a super-intelligent, serious musician, and he’s a master 
at the piano. I’m looking forward to hearing the piece live.

 ‘Amazing’: My Guardian Demon.

My Guardian Demon: Letters of André Tchaikowsky and Halina Janowska 
<http://andretchaikowsky.com/biography/>

This is an amazing book made up of letters between the Polish pianist André 
Tchaikowsky and a friend, Halina Janowska. It’s not all about music; it’s more 
about their relationship. Tchaikowsky was gay, and Janowska was madly in love 
with him, even though she married twice during the course of their 
correspondence. They first met when they were young, but then they met very few 
times after that [she was behind the Iron Curtain] and they didn’t really get 
on. Their relationship is painful at times, but they’re both so intelligent, so 
articulate. I was completely gripped.

An Officer and a Spy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/02/officer-spy-review-dreyfus-affair-robert-harris>
 by Robert Harris

I found this fascinating. It’s very closely based on the Dreyfus case in 
Paris, which divided France. An innocent Jewish man was accused of spying. A 
lot of people knew he was innocent, but had been ordered to protect the corrupt 
upper echelons of the army, which caused him to be falsely imprisoned. It 
seemed like the more they knew he was innocent, the worse they treated him.
Harris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/09/robert-harris-imperium-why-i-write-political-fiction>
 turns it into a novel, although he’s constantly quoting true sources. It’s 
very powerful. I was shocked by the extent of antisemitism in France at that 
time. It really brings home how awful it was.

 Welcoming... Allora. 
6 | Restaurant


Allora, north London <http://allorafini.co.uk/>

I like going to restaurants where it’s not just about the food, it’s the 
welcome. I often go to my local restaurants. When we go to Allora, it’s like 
we’re doing the proprietor a favour; she thanks us for coming. The food is very 
good [traditional northern Italian] – it’s not haute cuisine but it’s nice and 
nutritious. And the people there are just so sweet. You feel as if they’re 
genuinely glad to see you. We knocked over a table once – it wasn’t really our 
fault but we did knock it over – and glasses broke and things, and they were so 
nice about it, they kept apologising. You wouldn’t get that in every restaurant.
