A collaboration between Los Angeles media outfit GOOD, designer Gregory 
Hubacek and organic sports nutrition company CLIF Bar aims to open Americans' 
eyes to the travel options provided by cycling.

Their map, shown above, includes both urban and rural routes as well as 
details such as the total length of cycle lanes in major US cities.

Much as the railroads once did - and in fact several stretches of the cycle 
routes follow disused railway lines - the networks stretch from coast to coast, 
offering the chance to pedal all the way from New York to San Francisco, for 
example, on dedicated cycle paths.

Three routes - the Northern and Southern Tiers and the Transamerica Trail - 
reach all the way from coast to coast, with dozens of regional links branching 
off along the way.

At 4262 miles in length the Northern Tier is the longest single route, edging 
the Transamerica Trail into second by a mere 20 miles. Paths such as the Great 
Divide and Great Parks North cross the border into Canada.

As far as urban networks are concerned, new York has the longest offering - 
its routes stretch for a total of 620 miles - while L.A. comes in second with 
481 miles.
