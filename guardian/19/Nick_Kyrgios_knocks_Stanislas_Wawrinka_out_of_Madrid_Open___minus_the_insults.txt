Nick Kyrgios <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nick-kyrgios> let his tennis 
do the talking against Stanislas Wawrinka as he knocked the No4 seed out of the 
Madrid Open with a scintillating display.

Last year the 20-year-old got a suspended 28-day ban and $25,000 fine (£17,000)

 after making lurid remarks about Wawrinka’s girlfriend during their match at 
the Rogers Cup in Montreal.

Kyrgios, who has had several brushes with authority, was widely criticised, 
but his 7-6, 7-6 second-round victory over the Swiss on Wednesday showed he has 
moved on after he won a first ATP title this year in Marseille.

There was the odd outburst at the umpire, one after a first serve during the 
first-set tie-break was called out despite appearing to clip the line, but 
Kyrgios kept his emotions in check.
