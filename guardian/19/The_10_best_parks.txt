Ibirapuera <http://www.parqueibirapuera.org/ibirapuera-park/>
Sao Paulo, 1954


Sao Paulo is a harsh city, brooding and landlocked, which makes the 221 
hectares ofIbirapuera Park <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibirapuera_Park> all 
the more essential. It is the work ofRoberto Burle Marx 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/21/arts/design/21burl.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0>
, the great landscape architect who combined cubist and surrealist inspiration 
with a deep knowledge of Brazilian botany. The park is lush, curvilinear in 
every direction, sometimes mysterious, sometimes breaking out into powerful 
colour. Burle Marx often played second fiddle to the architectOscar Niemeyer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/dec/09/oscar-niemeyer-appreciation-rowan-moore>
, with whom he frequently collaborated. Here, the park is the star, even though 
it contains the huge anddazzling pavilion

des Buttes-Chaumont <http://equipement.paris.fr/parc-des-buttes-chaumont-1757> 
is the alter ego of the straight-lined order of the Baron’s famous boulevards. 
It inspired the surrealist writerLouis Aragon 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/louis-aragon>, for whom it was “ludicrous 
and alluring”, “a test tube of human chemistry” and a “crazy area born in the 
head of an architect from the conflict between Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the 
economic conditions of existence in Paris”. It is all these things and more.

 The Boboli Gardens, Florence. Photograph: Alexey Pavin/Alamy 
Once the Medicis’ principal playground, the Boboli Gardens 
<https://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/en/musei/?m=boboli> are, at their simplest, 
a nice place from which to get a view of Florence, but they are very much more 
than that. They play out a duel between culture and nature that ranges from a 
symmetrical central theatre to shadowy woods and thebe-stalactited Grotta Grande
 
<https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grotta_del_Buontalenti#/media/File:Grotta_del_buontalenti,_prima_sala_07.JPG>
, whose statues of Venus and of Paris and Helen snogging are, frankly, 
pornographic. The placing of planes of water on its steep slope gives the 
garden a levitating quality. The Italian renaissance is sometimes seen as the 
triumph of order and taste: the Boboli shows it was more interesting than that.

Impossible to omit, although its popularity means that it is often now not a

on the abandoned railway viaduct on which theHigh Line 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/22/final-stretch-new-york-high-line-complete>

of the accidents of time and place that led to a park in the air. It is now

 North Duisburg Landscape Park, Germany. Photograph: Alamy 
Before there was the High Line the landscape architect Peter Latz 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Latz> created another park out of derelict 
industry, on a far larger scale. A contaminated ensemble of collieries and 
steelworks has been populated with art, culture and places of work. Concert 
venues and climbing walls have been formed out of the steel frames of old 
factories, hulks of blast furnaces and slag heaps. Particularly smart is the 
approach to cleaning up the filthy land: it is allowed to take its time, with 
water and planting that assists the process forming part of the design of the 
park.

Another that is impossible to omit. It is everything that people say it is, a 
powerful illusion of rustic nature within a metropolis. As with the Boboli, the 
view of the city is part of the experience, making it a place to escape, look 
back and reflect. Perhaps for this reason it has inspired artists, poets and 
visionaries, such as Constable, Keats, and thesemi-criminal American tycoon 
Charles Tyson Yerkes <http://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Tyson-Yerkes>
, who was inspired by a visit to theheath 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/audioslideshow/2010/nov/01/tour-hampstead-heath-audio-slideshow>
 to build much of what is now the London underground. But for vigorous 
campaigns in the 19th century, the heath could have been lost to housing.

 Antoni Gaudí’s Park Güell in Barcelona. Photograph: Jorg Greuel/Getty Images 
Park Güell was partly a property speculation, as the centre of a proposed 
garden suburb of expensive villas. It was also, according toAntoni Gaudí 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/20/architecture>’s biographer
Gijs van Hensbergen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/30/biography.art>, a “living essay 
on Catalan nationhood and Catholic piety”. It includes the emblems of the local 
dark ages heroWilfred the Hairy 
<http://www.chicagotribune.com/#lightbox=49892161> and refers to a belief that 
the Garden of Eden was located in the region. All of which are pretexts for a 
convulsive mating of construction and nature, in which it can be hard to tell 
where one ends and the other starts. Also includes never-bettered decoration 
with broken ceramics.

The 7th Earl of Elgin 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bruce,_7th_Earl_of_Elgin>’s contribution 
to world culture (Parthenon marbles) is well known. His son the 8th earl went 
further, ordering the destruction of much of the Summer Palace (as well as the
Old Summer Palace <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Summer_Palace>) during the 
second opium war. Fortunately, the palace, an ensemble of lakes, gardens and 
buildings created for the Imperial family, was so vast that, with the help of 
restoration, it is still magnificent. Designed as a refuge from the city’s 
oppressive heat, some of its best features are devices for creating cooling 
breezes and shade. An almost inexhaustible series of spaces formed from 
buildings and nature together.

 Part of Olmsted and Vaux’s integrated parks system in Buffalo. 
Frederick Law Olmsted <http://www.fredericklawolmsted.com/> and Calvert Vaux 
<http://www.fredericklawolmsted.com/calvert_vaux.htm> are best known as the 
creators ofCentral Park in New York City <http://www.centralparknyc.org/>, but 
their greatest work is the co-ordinated system of parks and parkways, the first 
of its kind in the United States, in what was then the boom town of Buffalo. 
The idea was to integrate the network of green space with the fabric of the 
city, so that you were never far from it. Buffalo fell on hard times in the 
last century, but the parks still fulfil Olmsted’s idea that nature could 
“refresh and delight the eye and through the eye, mind and spirit”.

As the first publicly funded park in Britain, Birkenhead 
<http://www.liverpoolparks.org/red/docs/parks/birkenhead_park/index.html> 
pioneered one of the country’s gifts to urban civilisation. It impressed 
Olmsted, too, and so can take some credit for inspiring Central Park and the 
Buffalo network. It was created byJoseph Paxton 
<http://www.parksandgardens.org/places-and-people/person/1047>, the gardener 
who went on to design the giant greenhouse known as theCrystal Palace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/26/crystal-palace-rebuild-chinese-developer>
. Paxton also worked on theDuke of Devonshire’s gardens at Chatsworth 
<http://www.chatsworth.org/attractions-and-events/garden>, and Birkenhead can 
be seen as the democratisation of the aristocratic landscape, with striking 
buildings such as an Italianate boat house and a “Swiss bridge” artfully 
distributed among winding paths and curving lakes.
