How have you dealt with your growing fame after winning the award this year?
My life has definitely changed; I’ve gone from not doing many concerts to 
performing at lots of important venues. It’s been really exciting, but it’s 
important not to do too many things too soon. I’m in my last year of school, 
and at the moment I find the pressure manageable. I had a chat with the 
violinistNicola Benedetti 
<https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/may/05/nicola-benedetti-violin-pushy-parents>
 [who won the competition aged 16 in 2004], and she advised that while I’m 
still young and studying I should learn as much repertoire as possible, because 
it becomes more difficult once you’re doing lots of concerts.

If you’re a young black child going to a classical concert you don’t see 
anyone who looks like you in the orchestra

Last year you appeared on Britain’s Got Talent 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jA05iFPhpI> with your siblings. How did that 
compare to the BBC competition?
Britain’s Got Talent was a good experience for getting used to performing in 
front of lots of people, with cameras and interviews. When it came toBBC Young 
Musician there were fewer cameras so I wasn’t fazed at all.

Who are your musical heroes?
Jacqueline du Pré and Mstislav Rostropovich – both cellists – are two of my 
musical heroes, but I never got the chance to hear them live, which is a shame. 
I listen to a lot of Bob Marley when I’m not listening to classical.

To what extent was pursuing classical music your decision?
Although my parents have always encouraged me to practise, I’ve always wanted 
to be a musician. I actually started on the violin for about a month, but my 
elder brotherBraimah <http://www.kannehmasons.com/biogs/braimah-kanneh-mason/> 
was also playing the violin. I wanted to outdo him and play a bigger instrument 
so I switched to the cello when I was six and a half years old.

What did your parents do to make sure that you and your siblings got a musical 
education?
My parents were very keen on this from a young age. They made a lot of 
sacrifices, like holidays, to pay for music books and instruments and to ensure 
we could go to the Royal Academy of Music. Also we travel from Nottingham to 
London about twice a week, which is expensive – it’d be a lot easier if we 
lived in London! Hopefully seeing us become successful will make it worthwhile.

How did you become involved with [black and minority ethnic orchestra] Chineke!
 <http:>?
My family have been with it from its birth. The founder, Chi-chi Nwanoku 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/02/chi-chi-nwanoku-classical-music-living-colour-black-orchestra-chineke-foundation>
, came to watch a trio concert of me, my elder sister, Isata 
<http://www.kannehmasons.com/biogs/isata-kanneh-mason/>, and elder brother, and 
invited us to be involved. It’s inspiring, especially being one of the younger 
ones in the orchestra and having lots of role models to look up to.

What are your thoughts on diversity in classical music?
For me, my race has never been a problem; I’ve always felt that I fitted in in 
places like the Royal Academy of Music. It’s only when you look at the bigger 
picture and realise the lack of diversity that it becomes apparent. Ultimately, 
the classical music world isn’t racist, that would be the wrong way of looking 
at it. The problem is people not getting the opportunity to see it as something 
to get into. If you’re a young black child going to a classical concert you 
don’t see anyone who looks like you in the orchestra.

How could that change?
I think it’s a difficult thing to change, but it’s a case of giving everyone 
the opportunity to access classical music. For a number of reasons, music isn’t 
given enough time and money in many state schools, so kids miss out. Hopefully 
me being from a state school, and the first winner who is black, and seeing 
things like the Chineke! Orchestra, will inspire others from similar 
backgrounds to see this journey as something that they could also do.
