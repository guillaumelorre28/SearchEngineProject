Everton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton> have rejected Milan’s 
offer to sign Gerard Deulofeu on loan but the Spain Under-21 international’s 
future at Goodison Park remains uncertain.

The Everton winger, who has fallen out of favour under Ronald Koeman, is a 
target for several clubs in Europe and the Premier League with Ajax the latest 
to register interest in signing the 22-year-old this month.

Milan <https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan> have held talks with 
Everton officials in recent days with the chief executive, Adriano Galliani, 
telling Gazzetta dello Sport: “Everton knows we can do loans or loans with 
right of redemption.”

Their initial approach has been rejected, however, presenting Ajax with an 
opportunity to pursue a deal for the former Barcelona player. Middlesbrough are 
also believed to be interested.

Deulofeu rejoined Everton in a permanent £4.3m transfer from Barcelona in 2015 
but has been unable to secure a regular first team role since Koeman replaced 
Roberto Martínez as manager.

His last start came in the 3-2 defeat at Watford

 on 10 December and despite impressing as a substitute in the FA Cup defeat by 
Leicester City, creating Romelu Lukaku’s goal, he did not make the match-day 
squad for the4-0 win against Manchester City on Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/15/everton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report>
.

The Everton manager recently claimed there was “no possibility” for Deulofeu 
to leave this month because of injuries to Yannick Bolasie and Dominic 
Calvert-Lewin, although a better offer than Milan’s would test that resolve.
