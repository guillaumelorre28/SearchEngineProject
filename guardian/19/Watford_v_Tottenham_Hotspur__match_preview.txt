Watford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> have chanced upon an 
ideal time to play Tottenham. Jan Vertonghen and Kyle Walker are suspended and 
Toby Alderweireld may still be feeling the after-effects of a virus. However in 
Watford’s past six matches they have failed to score three times and scored 
more than one goal just once in the other three. Tottenham’s replacements will 
not be quaking in their boots.Graham Searles
