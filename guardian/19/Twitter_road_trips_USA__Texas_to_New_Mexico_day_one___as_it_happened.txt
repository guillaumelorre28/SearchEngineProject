Day 1 is a wrap!

I'm back in the golf room at Gruene Apple <http://www.grueneapple.com/>, 
making notes for tomorrow. Here's the planned route 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2013/jun/20/texas-new-mexico-usa-twitter-trip>
 -- we're still on track! -- and what I have on the agenda for Tuesday: 

- We'll visit New Braunfels in the morning. Among the tips for New Braunfels 
is a visit to theNatural Bridge caverns 
<http://www.naturalbridgecaverns.com/(S(x13l2255txhlb2vp05omcg55))/Index.aspx>, 
but since our driving day is so long -- we're supposed to be in Marfa by 
sundown -- we'll have to see if we can do this and still make good time. 

- Kerrville, Fort Stockton, and Alpine are all on the way to El Cosmico in 
Marfa <http://elcosmico.com/>, our eventual destination. What should we stop 
and see along the way? Where should we eat? What quirky landmarks do we need to 
pull over and see? Send a tip using#Twitrips

Gruene, Texas

Gruene Hall <http://www.gruenehall.com/> was recommended by several readers, 
including@peterkraft 
<https://twitter.com/peterkraft/status/349331892941750274%20%20>. A few seconds 
after setting foot inside, it was clear to see why. Hallowed ground for both 
musicians and their fans, the ancient dancehall's wooden floorboards were so 
worn they bounced underfoot. 

I helped myself to a $3.75 Shiner Bock and sat down to listen to Danny Bams 
and Billy Bright. This was a free show, the latest in a mix of gratis and paid 
gigs listed on the bar's chalkboard. Just outside, town of Gruene is quite 
touristy, packed with bed and breakfasts, and so the crowd at the dancehall was 
mostly families with small children.

But vestiges of the past were everywhere, from a tribute to local icon George 
Strait and ending with a small corner homage to John Travolta, whose famous 
dance scene in the movie Michael was filmed at Gruene Hall. 

Gruene Hall was where I decided to try something that popped into my head 
while preparing for this trip. For many Guardian readers, Texas is a mystery, 
so I decided to ask a few Texans two simple questions:What's the biggest 
misconception about Texas ... and what's the biggest truth? 

Logan Felch, 18, from San Marcos said the biggest misconception about Texas is 
the fact that most people think it's a desert. The biggest truth?

"It's the greatest state in America." 

Gruene Hall bartender Chelsey Fisher, 21, from nearby New Braunfels laughed 
when asked about the biggest misconception:

"There's a bunch, aren't there? It's probably that we're all rednecks and ride 
our horses everywhere." 

The biggest truth?

"Everyone's very nice, friendly and welcoming."

[Blogger's note: So far, this is absolutely true.] 

Outside and around the corner at the Gruene General Store, I ran into Belmont, 
Texas-based Jean Parigi, who gave her age as "old enough to know 
better." What's the biggest misconception about Texas?

"That everybody wears cowboy hats." 

The biggest truth?

"It's big."

[Blogger's note: Also true. We'll find out just how big tomorrow, when we 
drive 500 miles toMarfa.]

Katie, Sarah and John have entered Gruene, Texas, along the Guadalupe River. 
Built around the cotton industry in the 1870s, Gruene fell on hard times when
boll weevils <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boll_weevil> and the Great 
Depression caused its population to plummet to less than a hundred people. 

It's revived since its ghost town days of the 1950s, and become a tourist 
attraction known for its mix of Victorian and frontier architecture, including 
one of the oldest dance halls in the country.

Austin's BBQ Belt

Though Katie left Austin's city limits this afternoon, we've collected a map 
of notable barbecue joints of note in and around the city, per reader 
recommendations andTexas Monthly's 2013 
<http://www.texasmonthly.com/eat-my-words/list-top-50-barbecue-joints> area 
picks

1.38am BST 

There was too little time to make the BBQ joint and gas station that featured 
in the originalTexas Chainsaw Massacre 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre> (1974). Crowbiscuits
 <https://witness.guardian.co.uk/user/Crowbiscuits> recommended the site via 
Guardian Witness 
<https://witness.guardian.co.uk/assignment/51c2cf40e4b081563c05a969/380498>, 
pointing out that "sadly, there was no sizzling BBQ on offer!" 

If you're in search of Leatherface lore, however, you can find the abandoned 
building just south of Bastrop, on Highway 304. Beware malicious attendants.

Beaver tubes and a B&B

Happily, I can report that usaprofessor5 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2013/jun/24/twitter-road-trips-texas-new-mexico#block-51c88eede4b02ff2488a5f03>
's assessment of Texas Hill Country is totally accurate: it's gorgeous. Rolling 
hills, corn fields ... and a giant, Wal-Mart-sized gas station chain called
Buc-ee's <http://www.bucees.com/>, where people go to fill up on petrol. And 
magnets, river rafts, Texas A&M gear and Blue Bell ice cream.

After that uniquely Texan experience, we arrived at Gruene Apple Bed & 
Breakfast <http://www.grueneapple.com/bedrooms1.asp>, which came recommended by 
@nbraunfels2day <https://twitter.com/NBraunfels2day/status/348651649050480641>. 
I'm currently staying in a completely golf-themed room, while Sarah's room has 
a floral and hot air balloon motif, both $120 per night.

There is an automatic piano playing in the lobby, there's free wine and The 
Wedding Planner starring Jennifer Lopez is the featured film tonight. 

That's all very tempting, but we're heading to the Guadalupe River and then to 
Gruene Hall for the evening. Stay tuned.

The first taste of Texas BBQ

Since 99% of tips for the Austin area involve food, and 99% of those food tips 
involve BBQ, it's important to note that we didn't take our First Taste of 
Texas BBQ decision lightly.

Many of you wanted us to visit Salt Lick <http://www.saltlickbbq.com/> (too 
far off-path). Others wantedFranklin's <http://franklinbarbecue.com/> (not open 
Mondays). And then there was a small set of you who suggested the BBQ pits out 
in Lockhart, a 45-minute drive from Austin through Texas hill country. We 
decided to go with @crkmcabbe 
<https://twitter.com/crkmccabe/status/349151045978574848> and @hardyintl 
<https://twitter.com/hardyintl/status/349258351105945600>'s suggestion: 
Smitty's Market <http://www.smittysmarket.com/>.

The first thing that hits you when you arrive at Smitty's is not the smell but 
the thick, almost overpowering heat – at Smitty's, patrons walk through the 
barbecue pit to order before passing though to the mercifully air conditioned 
seating area.

We ordered a pound each of of the most popular meets (ribs, brisket and 
sausage), which came to $33 and included with several thick slices of white 
Texas bread and crackers. We carried our plates – tear sheets of thick brown 
paper – and utensils – knives and fingers – to the seating area and dug in.

According to photographer Sarah (our trusty Texas native), Smitty's is a 
classic pit used that was at "the top of the barbecue game" for a long time. 
Trendier spots have stolen the spotlight in recent years, but the experience of 
walking through the huge barbecue pit and the huge old market building it sits 
in is completely unique.

Dizzy with meat coma, we skipped town before we could check out 
nearby competitorBlack's <http://www.blacksbbq.com/>, but their sides and 
desserts are said to be worth the trip from Austin.

Before departing Austin, we swung by Mayfield Park and Nature Center
to visit with the free-range peacocks who roam the grounds.

Peacocks, an unofficial if inexplicable mascot of Austin, are known
for being excellent 'guard dogs'. This became immediately clear; as
soon as we stepped foot inside Mayfield's front gate, loud cries rang
out around the grounds.

After strolling the gardens and watching the peacocks strut around and
shake their feathers at each other for a bit, we decided this was as
good a time as any to leave Austin.

Now we're in a car heading toward Lockhart for Smitty's BBQ 
<http://www.smittysmarket.com/>,
recommended by @crkmccabe 
<https://twitter.com/crkmccabe/status/349151045978574848>. This drive is about 
an hour and it's definitely the shortest amount of travel we'll do at any one 
time on this trip. We'll savor it while can.

If you have tips for this afternoon (Lockhart) and this evening
(Gruene and New Braunfels), send them to me @katierogers

University challenge

After lunch, the temperature inched up to 37C (99F). Texas A&M University 
<http://www.tamu.edu> was reader-recommended but a ways off our route, so we 
set off towards the grounds of the nearbyUniversity of Texas at Austin 
<http://www.tamus.edu/>. (Sorry, Aggies. Maybe next year.) UT Austin is the 
fifth-largest university in the US, with over 50,000 undergraduates and 24,000 
faculty. But the campus was summertime quiet, instead dotted with campus tours 
for prospective students.

We encountered some friendly moss-covered turtles in the campus's famous 
turtle pond:

mass shooting which left 16 dead. Its observation deck has since been reopened

Top tipster

Our thanks to usaprofessor5 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/4262649>, who has just posted a 
great list of tips below in the comments for the drive from Austin to Las 
Cruces, including these, which is where Katie will be heading after Austin

1. The Texas Hill Country between Austin and Fredericksburg is beautiful--much 
of it was settled by Germans in the 1800s, hence towns with names like Gruene, 
Fredericksburg and New Braunfels.

2. If you need a cool place to stop since you're in the summer heat, after 
Gruene head south to New Braunfels and do the Natural Bridge caverns--beautiful 
formations and not too big (I wasn't expecting such a beautiful cave) or, 
later, off of I-10 the Caverns of the Sonora.

3. Balmorhea, as someone suggested, has a nice springs (like the one you 
depicted in Austin) just a few miles off the highway. Not far from the road.

4. Went through Marfa and Alpine last summer--most of the galleries were 
closed, looked like a ghost town.

And they end with a sober warning:

Last advice: Do not let your gas tank get below half full. You can go almost 
100 miles between gas stations in spots. Careful! And, it's over 100 degrees 
here, so stay hydrated. Have fun.

7.07pm BST 

We coaxed one of Qui's chefs, Yoshi Okai, out of the kitchen and asked him 
about King's restaurant philosophy:

"It's being creative and always making new food to attract new people," Okai 
said. "And I always make sure my cooks are happy. Happy people can make really 
good food."

With that, Okai returned to the kitchen to make us a bowl of Sapporo beer 
bacon miso ramen ($8). The broth is made with the beer's foam, and it includes 
bacon dashi, white miso, corn, butter and bamboo shoots, among other things. An 
order of Paul Qui's pork belly buns ($7) later, and we doubt we'll be ready to 
eat for a while.

Next up: Hopefully a lot of walking. We'll visit The Drag 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(Austin,_Texas)‎>, a shopping district near 
UT Austin, peacock-infested Mayfield Park <http://mayfieldpark.org> and onward 
to Lockhart, where many of you have directed your very strong views about Texas 
BBQ.

Updated at 7.31pm BST

7.03pm BST 

Lunch at East Side King

East Side King <http://eskaustin.com> is a chain of restaurants owned by one 
of Austin's own celebrity chefs, Paul Qui. The restaurant's located in the back 
of a bar calledHole in the Wall <http://www.holeinthewallaustin.com> and serves 
up ramen and pork buns.

7.00pm BST 

Capitol building

Shortly after the cemetery, we made the executive decision to step over to the 
Texas Capitol <http://www.tspb.state.tx.us/SPB/capitol/texcap.htm> to snap a 
few pictures of the centre of the Lone Star state's government - and buy 
ourselves more time before the next reader-recommended food destination, of 
which there have been plenty.

Everything's bigger in Texas: the building is ornate and enormous, with state 
troopers in cowboy hats at every corner. If you stand in the centre of the 
rotunda, you'll be able to hear your voice echo from all directions - not that 
it's the kind of place you'd feel comfortable yelling.

After a quick peek in Governor Rick Perry's public reception room, we're off 
toward UT Austin's West campus to try @hinesalmy's food suggestion: East Side 
King.

Katie replies

I just checked in with our [luckily] Texas native photographer, Sarah. We're 
already taking a pretty long route as it is, we are just skirting around San 
Antonio - it would take an extra few hours we just don't have. All is not lost: 
We'll end up in Marfa a day before its famous film festival starts, and we've 
booked an old trailer at ElCosmico <http://elcosmico.com> for Tuesday night 
(unfortunately, all the teepees were full).

Route manoeuvres

A bit of a lobby forming below for Katie to reroute from I10 and take the 
'longer road'

Up4GrabsNow <http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/24568608> 
started it with a nice suggestion:

If you take TX 90 instead of I10, go through Hondo and tweet a pic of the sign 
on the way in. "This is God's country, please don't drive through it like hell"

And Alexandriti <http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/24569545> 
pressed the point:

Katie: 
You should consider taking the "long-way" from Austin to Albuquerque. One 
suggestion is to head toward San Antonio then take Rt 90 towards Uvalde, Del 
Rio and make plans to spend the night in Marfa, TX... Book a tent-yes a tent- 
or a teepe for less than $75/night at the El Cosmico in Marfa. Ask the locals 
about the "lights". Stop to eat and chat at food trucks, even attempt an 
excursion toward the village of Alpine and the gaggle of telescopes of the 
University of Texas. Drive your car below the speed limit, keep your windows 
down and take a friend or two with you. Happy and interesting travels!

What does everyone else think?

Since east Austin is still a bit sleepy on Monday mornings, we detoured to the 
Texas State Cemetery <http://www.cemetery.state.tx.us>, final resting place of 
Texas politicians and other "people who have their name on stuff", according to 
photographer Sarah.

For the price of zero, you can conduct of self-guided walking tour of the 
lovingly manicured grounds. Among the people buried here:Stephen 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_F._Austin> F Austin 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_F._Austin>, the 'father of Texas'; Albert 
Sydney Johnston 
<http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/biographies/albert-johnston.html>, 
general for three different nations including the Republic of Texas; and one 
French Sailor, the oldest set of European bones in Texas.

Don Juan's reckless breakfast challenge

At the recommendation of a few readers including @d_eklund 
<https://twitter.com/D_Eklund/status/348203518634639360>, we stopped at Juan in 
a Million <http://www.juaninamillion.com/> in up-and-coming East Austin. Food 
Network fans may remember the restaurant from a past episode of Man vs Food, 
where hostAdam Richman attempted to consume a record number of Don Juan tacos 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXxGabLOOCk>. (Spoiler alert: man lost.)

Waitress Vanessa Cervantez told me that people cross state lines often to come 
try their hand at the Don Juan Challenge. The 1lb, $4.50 taco comprises a 
'secret' blend of potato, bacon, egg and cheese; the most anyone has ever 
consumed is nine and a half. Richman ate four and a half. Our driver, John, 
could only get through one.

"A few days ago this guy came in from Ohio and tried to do the challenge," 
Cervantes told me. "He only ate seven."

Also worth trying at Juan in a Million: Migas ($7.95) and the chorizo and 
potato taco ($2.25).

Next up: A few of the sites of East Austin. Got tips? Send them my way

Hitting the road

Hello – or, howdy – and welcome to the first day of Guardian Travel’s 
reader-assisted road trip from Austin, Texas to Albuquerque, New Mexico. The 
premise of this trip is simple: I’ll go where you tell me. Just post your 
suggestions in the comments below, on Twitter using#Twitrips 
<https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?hashtags=TwiTrips%2C&original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Ftravel%2F2013%2Fjun%2F20%2Ftexas-new-mexico-usa-twitter-trip&related=AndyPietra&tw_p=tweetbutton>

toolGuardianWitness 
<https://witness.guardian.co.uk/assignment/51c2cf40e4b081563c05a969>.

Any and all ideas will be considered, but as I noted last week 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2013/jun/20/texas-new-mexico-usa-twitter-trip>
, this road trip is pretty ambitious – 1,030 miles in five days. Along with a 
photographer,Sarah Lim <>, and my boyfriend/our driver, John Chinoransky, I’ll 
have to be strategic about which recommendations to choose, but we’ll be sure 
to stay caffeinated, hydrated and sunblocked in order to cover as much of this 
stretch of the southwest as possible.

It’s Monday morning, and I’m off to grab a breakfast burrito at Juan in a 
Million <http://www.juaninamillion.com/> on the city’s East side – thanks to 
@d_eklund <https://twitter.com/D_Eklund/status/348203518634639360> for that 
suggestion. But I landed a day early to see as much as I could of Austin. My 
brother lives here, so, as one is accustomed to doing on road trips, I accepted 
a night of free lodging within the city limits. Here’s what reader-recommended 
activities I’ve been up to:

Sunday morning, it was a sunny 33C – early, cool summer, I’m told – so I 
decided to follow up onone of the very first reader recommendations 
<http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/24457682> I received for 
Austin: a trip toBarton Springs Pool 
<http://austintexas.gov/department/barton-springs-pool>. But first, I grabbed a 
$0.99 kolache from my brother’s local hole-in-the-wall bakery,Donut4U 
<http://www.yelp.com/biz/donut-4u-austin>.
Katie Rogers (@katierogers) 
#twitrips <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23twitrips&src=hash> breakfast: The 
humble $.99 kolache, beloved pig-in-a-blanketesque Austin breakfast staple
pic.twitter.com/Pu9zFK5WrK <http://t.co/Pu9zFK5WrK>

<https://twitter.com/katierogers/statuses/348830792279027712> 
The Czech pastries are a simple creation: dough encasing sausage, cheese and 
jalapenos. Butthe humble kolache is a Texan breakfast staple 
<http://homesicktexan.blogspot.co.uk/2007/03/sweet-escape-kolaches.html>, and 
they are delicious.

Post-kolache, it was off to Austin’s Zilker Park, home of the Austin City 
Limits Music festival <http://www.aclfestival.com> and Barton Springs 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barton_Springs>, a man-made, three-acre pool fed 
from water from a nearby spring of the same name. The pool is beautiful, 
tranquil … and the only place in the world where you’ll find a particular type 
of reptile, the Barton Springssalamander 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barton_Springs_Salamander>. Environmental 
protections went into effect shortly after the salamander’s discovery 20 years 
ago, which is why this pool literally feels more like a lake; at the deep end, 
the natural floor is covered in seaweed, and in the shallow end, bathers relax 
on algae-covered rocks.

I paid $5 to park and a $3 entry fee, the latter of which hasn’t changed in 
some time, a #TwiTrips reader tells me:
Alex Horton (@AlexHortonTX) 
@katierogers <https://twitter.com/katierogers> It's been $3 since I was 
swimming there as a kid in the 90s. Saw Quentin Tarantino once.

By Sunday afternoon, it was time for a late lunch and to check into our home 
for the night,Austin Motel <http://www.austinmotel.com/>. The motel is one of 
the most recognisable buildings in the trendy South Congress area, if not for 
its bright lights then for its slightly phallic shape:

For $150 a night and at the recommendation of @TWalk 
<https://twitter.com/TWalk/status/347006443104382976>, we checked into a huge, 
clean room – nothing outwardly fancy about the decor, but the room was clean, 
bright and funky. More interesting is what’s outside: the motel office is full 
of weird touches and family photos, and the pool overlooks South Congress, 
which provides for quality people-watching.

The immediate area offers nearly every type of dining option, from gourmet 
ice-cream to Japanese food ordered via iPad. But since #Twitrips reader
@elizalive <http://www.twitter.com/elizalive> suggested grabbing food at South 
Congress Cafe <http://www.southcongresscafe.com/>, an upscale diner located 
nearby, I walked the few blocks to try the BBQ pork flank sandwich ($15).

At sundown Sunday, word of mouth led me to Congress Avenue Bridge to watch the 
nightly flight of Austin’s humungous bat colony that takes place each year from 
March until November. It's popular - hundreds of people gather on a patch of 
land below the bridge to watch the 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats spiral 
up into the dusk.

You can also hire a riverboat or park a kayak to watch the bats from the 
water, but the view is just as nice from the top of the bridge, not to mention 
relatively guano-free.

Afterwards, I checked out Rainey Street 
<http://www.yelp.com/biz/rainey-street-austin>, a local part of Austin’s 
downtown known for its relative lack of tourists and old cottage homes 
converted into trendy bars. AtLustre Pearl <http://www.lustrepearlaustin.com/>, 
there were beautiful, beachy interiors and some sort ofHula Hoop competition 
<https://twitter.com/katierogers/status/348993906182074370>. At Blackheart 
<http://www.blackheartbar.com/>, I found reasonably priced Moscow Mules and 
live music under bright red lights.

Today, I’ll be wandering around east Austin and finding some decent BBQ, 
before departing for nearby Gruene to check outthe oldest operating dancehall 
in the country <http://www.gruenehall.com/>, recommended early on by one of my 
Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/katierogerswrites/posts/10100480000542061> 
connections. If you have any BBQ recommendations other thanSalt Lick 
<http://www.saltlickbbq.com> (outside of Austin and not exactly on the route) 
andFranklin’s <http://franklinbarbecue.com> (closed on Monday), please let me 
know!
