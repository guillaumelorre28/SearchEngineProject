1 Rubell Family Collection, and de la Cruz Collection

They look like museums and boast museum-worthy collections but the Rubell and 
the de la Cruz are actually large private contemporary art collections that are 
open to the public. They are well worth visiting, featuring pieces by Andy 
Warhol, Cindy Sherman, and other luminaries.

Open Wed-Sat 10am–6pm, adults $10, under 18 and students $5. Complimentary

2 Wynwood graffiti murals

A working-class Puerto Rican neighbourhood that is fast evolving into the 
epicentre of Miami's art scene, Wynwood is a veritable open-air graffiti 
museum. Rare is the wall not covered in bright spray paint and fantastical 
creatures. Hop on a bike or take a scooter tour (roamthere.com 
<http://roamthere.com/> is one option) to appreciate block after block of 
world-class spray-paint art.

3 Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami

A bit farther north than most tourists tend to roam, perhaps, but the city's 
most cutting-edge contemporary art museum lures culture-seekers year round with 
out-there exhibitions, stimulating talks and great parties.
• +1 305 893 6211, mocanomi.org <http://mocanomi.org/>. Open Tue, Thur, Fri 
and Sat 11am–5pm, Wed 1pm–9pm, Sun midday–5pm. Adults $5, students and 
concessions $3

4 Little River Yacht Club
 Little River Yacht Club 
Don't let the name fool you. You're more likely to see a keg stand than a 
coxswain at this funhouse, exhibition space, and artist-studio complex. One 
past show featured a giant crossbow, a machete and wooden projectiles.

5 The University of Miami's special books collection

Comprising more than 50,000 books, this library houses a little-known 
collection, in the university's library system including an artist's book whose 
pages are coated with impasto turmeric and cayenne pigment, and one with a 
cover inlaid with abalone shell, and a book that unfolds with origami-like 
complexity. Worth enduring the traffic for.

6 Miami Marine Stadium

With its dramatic 1960s cantilevered concrete roof, this is one of the city's 
most under-appreciated buildings. Abandoned in the early 90s and covered with 
two decades of graffiti, it looks like a giant street-art sculpture.
