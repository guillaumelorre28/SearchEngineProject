One night last spring I was in a car with friends on the Pacific Coast Highway 
being driven from Los Angeles toSan Francisco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/apr/11/top-10-shops-attractions-san-francisco-design-lovers>
. I had fallen asleep but was woken by someone telling me we had arrived at our 
stopover.

When we got out, all of us fell silent, overwhelmed by the moment – the big 
waves crashing on to the shore and the sky packed with thousands of stars. 
Another peaceful source of light towered before us – the Pigeon Point 
lighthouse.

The lighthouse is on the southern approach to San Francisco Bay and was built 
in 1871. It is now a largely decorative part of a cheap, worn hostel, and if 
you saw the interiors only I doubt that you would make a reservation. But 
arriving in the dark and seeing only the beaming light, the beauty of it really 
hits you, as it does again in the morning when thePacific Ocean

 welcomes you to a new day.

 The hostel’s hot tub 
There’s a hot tub with a magnificent view that you can use for just a few 
dollars – though we enjoyed it for free because we’d arrived really late and no 
other guests had booked it.

Unfortunately, you’re not allowed to go inside the lighthouse. It has been 
closed to the public since 2001 because of structural concerns, though there 
are plans to restore and open it again.

The hostel doesn’t offer any restaurants or grocery stores, but guests can 
prepare their own food in a self-service kitchen, which is a nice way to get to 
know other guests.

I’ll keep this memory in my heart and I really recommend the place. Just make 
sure you fall asleep right before your arrival and it’s late at night.
