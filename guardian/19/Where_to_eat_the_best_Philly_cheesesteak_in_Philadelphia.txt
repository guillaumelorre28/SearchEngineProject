The cheesesteak – thin slices of beef cooked on a griddle and stuffed into a 
long, soft hoagie roll smeared with cheese (preferably a nuclear 
radiation-resistant processed brand known as Cheez Whiz) – clings to the 
sophisticated Philadelphia dining scene like an embarrassing ex-lover. While 
you're much likelier to witness natives devouring roast pork-and-broccoli rabe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/09/alys-fowler-broccoli-raab>
, here are a few of the best places to sample an authentic cheesesteak.

John's Roast Pork

You wouldn't expect a place named for roast pork sandwiches to also make great 
cheesesteaks, but this cinderblock bunker serves the best in the city, sliced 
superthin and veiled in gooey cheese. Do like the longshoremen from the nearby 
docks and get there early: John's closes at 3pm in the week and 4pm on 
Saturdays. You can phone ahead and they'll have your sandwich ready. The roast 
pork, predictably, is also amazing.

Joe's Steaks + Soda Shop

The old guard grumbled when Joe Groh, owner of this luncheonette in the 
blue-collar Tacony neighbourhood since 1999, replaced its long-time name 
(Chink's Steaks) with something more politically correct. Fortunately, nothing 
has changed about its cheesesteak, satisfying diners since '49.

Santucci's Pizza

Square pizzas baked in cast-iron pans are the main attractions at this family 
owned pizzeria, which relocated from north-east to South Philly two years ago. 
But chef Bobby Saritsoglu does so much more, including a beefy cheesesteak 
sandwiched between planks of house-made garlic bread.

Paesano's

Purists would scoff at calling the Paesano – the signature item at chef Peter 
McAndrews's new-school Italian sandwich shop of the same name – a cheesesteak. 
Braised brisket subs in for seared rib-eye, provolone for the typical Wiz or 
American cheese, while additions of horseradish mayo, hot peppers, roasted 
tomatoes and a fried egg are considered downright blasphemous. Their loss. 
McAndrews's Paesano delivers the same deadly delicious doses of beef and cheese.

American Sardine Bar

Scott Schroeder, chef of this arriviste hangout in up-and-coming Point Breeze, 
serves his "Pittsburgh" cheesesteak crowned with salt- and-pepper fries and 
vinegary coleslaw, as is the custom atPrimanti Brothers 
<http://primantibros.com/home.html> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. But the heart 
of this late-night favourite is the beef, dry-aged rib-eye from New York
