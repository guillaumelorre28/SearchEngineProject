King-sized kiwis, curvy squash and smaller-than-usual apples and limes. That 
was the “ugly” produce count in boxes of fruits and vegetables Deborah Levine 
recently received at her home in the San Francisco Bay Area. While most of the 
produce she gets in her biweekly deliveries is “very normal”, she recalls one 
particular veggie. It was like a siamese carrot, but with part of it broken 
off, it looked like it “didn’t have its leg”.

Half of all US food produce is thrown away, new research suggests

“It was kind of funky looking. But you clean it, peel it and chop it up and it 
makes no difference,” says Levine, who works as an editor. “But you’d never see 
that in the market.”

Since August, Levine has been getting deliveries of imperfect or “ugly” fruits 
and vegetables, those that taste fine but are often banished from grocery 
stores because they don’t meet industry’s cosmetic standards. It arrives at her 
doorstep courtesy of Imperfect Produce, one of a handful of food delivery 
services that’s cropped up in recent years as part of an emerging movement to 
make acceptable and sell discarded produce at more affordable prices.

It’s one way to fight back against the massive amounts of food wasted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/us-food-waste-ugly-fruit-vegetables-perfect>
 in the United States.

“When you look at our food system farm to fork, a stunning 52% of all produce 
in the US goes uneaten,” says JoAnne Berkenkamp, a senior advocate with the 
Natural Resources Defense Council. “Burgeoning awareness of this reality has 
led a growing number of eaters and businesses to take a second look at product 
that doesn’t meet prevailing industry standards for size, shape, color and 
other cosmetic attributes.”

Besides Imperfect Produce, other such delivery services include Hungry 
Harvest, which delivers “recovered” produce in Baltimore, Washington DC, 
Philadelphia and surrounding areas, and Perfectly Imperfect, which serves the 
Cleveland area. Even Fresh Direct now has an ugly vegetable box.

Imperfect Produce, which delivers to the Bay Area, started in August 2015 and 
says its produce costs up to 50% less than retail store prices since they’re 
fruits and vegetables that usually go to waste on farms. Ron Clark, the 
company’s co-founder and chief supply officer, estimates about 20% of produce 
overall doesn’t make it to the market because of cosmetic reasons. But the 
demand is there. Imperfect Produce began with 150 deliveries, he says, and now 
has over 10,000 customers.

“It’s a new market niche that will continue to grow,” says Clark. “It’s in the 
public eye, it’s captured people’s imagination and, most of all, there’s a 
brand new giant generation out there, the millennials, that deeply care about 
these issues ... climate change, food waste, properly using all of our 
resources, being stewards of the planet.”

Clever and lighthearted marketing also doesn’t hurt. Hungry Harvest recently 
released ugly produce emojis. And Levine once received googly eyes in her 
Imperfect Produce box with encouragement to share a photo of the eyes on ugly 
produce for a discount off her next order. After much searching, she picked a 
not-so-ugly onion for the Instagram shot.

Food activist Jordan Figueiredo, who’s been petitioning large grocers like 
Whole Foods, Walmart and Target to stock imperfect produce, plays up the 
produce’s “personalities” on social media. Part of hisUgly Fruit and Veg 
Campaign <http://www.endfoodwaste.org/ugly-fruit---veg.html>, these daily doses 
of “ugly fun” feature such produce as intertwined carrots with the caption “Ah, 
young carrot love” and a tomato with a seemingly long nose, coined “Cyrano de 
Tomato” by one commentator.

“Ugly produce just resonates with people,” says Figueiredo, who also gets 
Imperfect Produce deliveries. “A lot of people in this movement have 
capitalized on making it fun and not some sort of drudgery of environmental 
tasks ... It’s not just intuitive to want to do everything you can to prevent 
waste and help the planet and all that. Unfortunately it’s just not as easy as 
we’d like it to be.”

Beyond waste concerns, thanks to imperfect produce’s cheaper cost, some hope 
this trend will also help provide the more than 48 million Americans who 
struggle with hunger greater access to fresh food. This was part of the 
motivation behind the launch in May of Perfectly Imperfect by produce 
wholesaler Forest City Weingart. Perfectly Imperfect offers boxes of imperfect 
produce at discounted rates for pick up or delivery in and around Cleveland.

“We couldn’t help but notice that the neighborhood surrounding our warehouse 
was an area in need and considered a food desert, and really just wanted to try 
to connect the few dots and figure out a way to disperse some of this food to 
some of the people who can afford to buy food for themselves but just need 
things that are as affordable as possible,” says Ashley Weingart, director of 
communications and community outreach for the company.

Forest City Weingart is in Central, a neighborhood in Cleveland that Weingart 
says is one of the lowest income areas in Ohio. From 2010 to 2014 its median 
household income was $9,647, compared to $26,179 for Cleveland, and almost 70% 
of households received food stamps, according to the Center for Community 
Solutions.

But Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at 
New York University, says while these types of services may be a reasonable 
short-term measure, solving hunger requires structural and sustainable 
solutions.

“Food insecurity is the result of lack of resources – money to buy food, 
access to food sources, ability and time to cook, adequate transportation, the 
cost of food and other such factors. It is not about the appearance of fruits 
and vegetables. If these are cheaper, poor people might be more willing to buy 
them, but they would need to want to, like them and know how to cook them, all 
of which are cultural issues,” she says.

Weingart admits “the biggest challenge we face is informing the people who 
need it the most”. That’s why they’re working with partners in the city to get 
this produce delivered to community and recreation centers. Weingart says 
they’re also developing a bag of produce that would cost less than $10, since 
it’s easier to transport and cheaper.

The financial savings haven’t been huge for Levine, in the Bay Area, she 
thinks possibly due to Imperfect Produce’s delivery charges. She spends about 
$25 every two weeks. But she plans to stick with it. She’s happy with the 
produce and says the variety has expanded her cooking repertoire. Mostly, 
though, it makes her feel a little more proactive.

“I can’t change the economy, I can’t get rid of poverty,” she says. “It’s 
shameful in a country that has ... so many people who don’t have enough food to 
be wasting food. And truly gargantuan amounts of food. When you know that you 
want to do something about it and you get the opportunity to do that, I’d take 
it.”
