Crédit Agricole yesterday ended speculation that it would bid for Alliance & 
Leicester with the announcement that it would focus instead on buying a Greek 
bank.

Shares in Alliance & Leicester slumped after any likelihood of a £6bn takeover 
by the French bank evaporated. Takeover speculation had fuelled A&L's value in 
the last year taking it to a peak of £12.77 a share in May.

The shares closed down 65p at £10.84 yesterday. CA said in May it was 
examining Britain's seventh largest bank as a possible acquisition opportunity, 
but said yesterday it would not proceed "in light" of "further analysis".
