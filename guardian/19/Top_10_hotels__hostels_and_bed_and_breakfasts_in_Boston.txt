Hotel Commonwealth


A harbinger of the revitalisation of blighted Kenmore Square, this 10-year-old 
hotel has 149 rooms in the shadow of Fenway Park and three of the city's 
choicest eateries and bars – Eastern Standard, Island Creek Oyster Bar and the 
Hawthorne – on site. Flush Red Sox fans should spring for the handsome baseball 
suite, stocked with vintage Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and Jackie Robinson cards, 
and other memorabilia. Those with bleacher-seat budgets should opt instead for 
the oversized standard rooms, which all offer king beds. All can take advantage 
of fun amenities like the DVD lending library, with selections and popcorn 
delivered to your door. Fever Pitch and Field of Dreams have to be among the 
choices, right?

Irving House

 Irving House Boston 
Families will love this laid-back, green guesthouse, mere blocks from Harvard 
Yard. Children under seven stay free and brood-friendly rooms feature a queen 
bed for mum and dad, along with a trundle bed or bunk beds with privacy 
curtains for the little ones. Bookworms of all ages will delight in the lending 
library – the dozen or so books in each room or on shelves throughout the 
property are yours for the picking. And if pint-sized travellers want to report 
all the happenings of their Cambridge trip to grandma and grandpa, the front 
desk offers a selection of picture postcards that they'll send anywhere, 
postage gratis.

Samuel Sewall Inn/Bertram Inn

 Samuel Seall Boston 
Lounge in front of an in-room wood-burning fireplace at the Samuel Sewall Inn 
or the Bertram Inn, and you'll feel worlds away from the city bustle (in warmer 
months, you'll hear crickets). But these sister properties, across the street 
from each other in the leafy suburb of Brookline, are just a 20-minute T ride 
from Boston Common. The 1886 Samuel Sewall Inn and the 1907 Bertram Inn – both 
built as private homes – share staffers and boast the same creature comforts 
(Turkish towels, plush robes, on-site parking for $15 a night) alongside period 
details, antiques and original furnishings. Feeling sprightly? Hoof it up 
nearby Summit Avenue to Corey Hill Park for striking views of Boston and 
Cambridge.

Clarendon Square Inn

 Clarendon Square, Boston 
Foodies flock to the South End, and for good reason: the picturesque enclave 
is buzzing with some of the city's best restaurants. This historic 
townhouse-turned-bed and breakfast is the perfect base for culinary 
exploration. Each of the stylish rooms – from the cheaper interior queen to the 
splurge-worthy, apartment-sized luxury suite – is decked out with thoughtful 
touches, and the whole property, including the parlour, baby grand piano, 
library, and sunny back deck, is yours to enjoy. At the end of a long day spent 
noshing and nibbling, you can sip wine under the stars in the rooftop hot tub – 
yes really! – and dream about your next meal.

Inn at St Botolph

 The Inn St Botolph, Boston 
A swish but more affordable alternative to its sister property XV Beacon 
<http://www.xvbeacon.com/>, this Celeste Cooper-designed inn, in a converted 
brownstone near the Prudential Centre and Newbury Street's shops, is 
appropriately named for the patron saint of travellers (and for the street it's 
on, of course). You can really settle in for a few days, as each of the 16 
spacious suites – decorated in graphic, deco-esque style – has a fully equipped 
kitchenette and a queen-sized bed, and all but the studios have gas fireplaces. 
There's also a fitness centre and continental breakfast is served daily in the 
lounge.

Hotel Veritas

 Boston Hotel Veritas 
You'd be forgiven for mistaking this Mark Boyes-Watson-designed Harvard Square 
hotel for a grand private manor – after all, the facade is a reconstruction of 
the 1880s home that once stood on the site. But the sleek lobby, with its 
curving couches and gilded walls, is decidedly modern. Bedrooms are intimate 
but well-appointed, with Etro bath products, cushy Anichini linens, marble 
bathrooms and mirrored nightstands (five have private balconies). Taste the 
local flavour by ordering a New England brew or a cocktail crafted from area 
spirits in the Simple Truth Lounge downstairs – retire to the patio and you'll 
sit on chairs made in Cambridge by designer Adam Simha. If it's Saturday night, 
don't be alarmed by the parade of rollerskaters and divas across the street; 
it's just the colourful crowd exiting The Donkey Show, American repertory 
theatre's long-running disco romp at the Oberon theatre.

Kendall Hotel

 Kendall Hotel Boston 
Local artist Charlotte Forsythe and her husband, architect and developer 
Gerald Fandetti, turned a shuttered Victorian firehouse across from the Kendall 
Square T-stop into this 77-room hotel, infusing it with personality and warmth. 
In keeping with the theme, metal fire trucks, old photos, hats and other 
firehouse antiques and memorabilia dot the homey property (there's even a 
collection of patches from visiting current and retired firemen, who exchange 
them for a special discount). But you don't have to be an engine-and-ladder 
enthusiast to relish the full breakfast buffet of pastries, cheese, pancakes, 
eggs, bacon, and from-scratch granola (included in the price), or to raise a 
glass with other guests in the rooftop solarium during wine hour (5pm-6pm, 
Mon-Thurs).

The College Club of Boston

 College Club of Boston 
For a stay steeped in history, try a ridiculously high-ceilinged room at this 
122-year-old women's college club, the oldest in the US. The Back Bay Club has 
hosted non-members since the 1990s and, from 2005 to 2008, each of the 11 rooms 
was renovated by a different local designer and decorated for – and dedicated 
to – a specific college. The Connecticut College room, for one, was conceived 
by Lisey Good of Good Interiors, and features deep camel walls (in honour of 
the mascot), antique maps, period furniture and fabric in the school's colours, 
blue and white. Continental breakfast and afternoon cookies are included, as 
are modern amenities such as Wi-Fi and air-conditioning (televisions, however, 
are blissfully absent from the rooms).

HI-Boston

 Hi-Boston hostel 
Green-minded travellers will appreciate Hostelling International's 
year-and-a-half-old facility on Stuart Street. Housed in the 19th-century Dill 
Building and constructed to LEED-certification standards, the industrial-chic 
480-bed hostel has energy-efficient elevators and lighting (and plenty of 
natural light from large windows), low-flow showers, toilets and taps, even 
chairs and tables made from recycled materials in the dining area. Whether you 
choose the dorm-style accommodation with four or eight beds, or one of 22 
private ensuite rooms, bedlinen, Wi-Fi, continental breakfast and use of all 
shared spaces (library, kitchen, game room) are all included. While you can 
easily explore nearby Chinatown and the Theatre District solo, the hostel 
offers daily free and low-cost activities, such as neighbourhood tours and 
museum visits to get you acquainted with the city outside your door.

Beacon Hill Hotel

 Beacon Hill Hotel and Bistro, Boston 
Elegant Beacon Hill, with its brick pavements, quaint shops and cobblestones, 
is the quintessential Boston neighbourhood (Secretary of State John Kerry lives 
in a Louisburg Square manse, though he's not at home much these days). It oozes 
charm – as does this 13-room inn spanning two 19th-century townhouses on lovely 
Charles Street. Peter and Cecilia Rait, who foundedLa Brasserie de L'Entrecôte 
<http://www.brasserieentrecote.pt/> restaurant in Portugal before moving to 
Boston, were inspired by the hotels they stayed at while travelling around 
Europe to open the Beacon Hill Hotel in 2000. The recently renovated rooms have 
plantation shutters and windows that actually open, as well as black-and-white 
photography and new TVs, but the best perk is the complimentary breakfast at 
the award-winning bistro. Also nice is the private roof deck.
