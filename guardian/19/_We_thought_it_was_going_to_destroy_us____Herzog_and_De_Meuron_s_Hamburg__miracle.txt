Rising more than 100 metres above Hamburg’s harbour like a great glass galleon 
marooned atop an old brick warehouse, theElbphilharmonie 
<https://www.elbphilharmonie.de/en/> concert hall looks as unreal as its 
computer renderings, first published 13 years ago to gasps of incredulity.

The gargantuan glass tent rises to a roofline of frothing peaks, inscribing a 
silhouette of waves across the city’s low-rise skyline, like a chunk of the sea 
that’s been frozen, chiselled out of the water and craned into place. Its 
glacial walls ripple and bulge, their surface punctured with convex 
semi-circular openings, forming a cliff-face of little mouths gaping in glee.

It’s only appropriate for the building to have the last laugh. A national 
embarrassment for the last decade, as the budget galloped ever higher, with 
construction mired in delays and the very real threat that its carcass might be 
left as an Ozymandian ruin, this €789m mega-project is finally complete – and 
it is thankfully every bit as spectacular as its architects promised.

Standing on the roof, surrounded by heaving valleys of gleaming white sequins 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BMWsacGArw-/> that swell to a spiky mountain 
range, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron have never looked so relieved. 
“There were moments when we thought this building would destroy our whole 
career,” says Herzog. “Somehow we were responsible for this total disaster, 
because we had seduced the people with our design.”

The project began as the unlikely dream of Alexander Gérard, a private 
developer and former classmate of Herzog and De Meuron, who had hoped to 
finance the scheme with the45 luxury flats 
<https://www.engelvoelkers.com/en-de/hamburg/projekte/elbphilharmonie/> and 
250-roomhotel <http://www.westinhamburg.com/en> that are also housed in the big 
glass mountain. He commissioned the architects to come up with a dazzling 
alternative to a dreary plan for a 90-metre media office tower on the site, 
which died away with the end of the dotcom boom. The Swiss starchitects’ 
thrilling images quickly caught the public imagination and the project was 
adopted by the city in 2003 and prioritised as a plan of national importance.

Launched with a price tag of €77m (which Herzog says was “absurdly low” and 
never actually costed), and scheduled to open in 2010, the finished project has 
cost 10 times that amount and been subject to a catalogue of disputes, lawsuits 
and a lengthy parliamentary inquiry. The resulting 800-page report noted 
witheringly that “the claim of a public sector building to be counted among 
world architecture does not necessarily extend totoilet brushes 
<http://www.thelocal.de/20131118/overbudget-concert-hall-spends-on-toilet-brush>
 costing €291.97 each”.

Exploring the voluptuous caves and terraced levels housed within this vast 
iceberg, it is clear that the toilet brushes were one of the cheaper items on 
the shopping list. It is a project on an unparalleled scale of ambition, an 
ocean liner of architectural virtuosity that revels in its sculptural feats and 
bespoke craftsmanship. The grand hall, itself hung from the 700-tonne roof like 
a dangling cocoon, features 1,000 hand-blown glass lamps and 10,000 uniquely 
carved acoustic panels, while the facade incorporates 600 curved panes of 
48mm-thick glass. It has been compared toKaiser Wilhelm’s megalomania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/hamburg-elphie-concert-hall-elbphilharmonie-finished>
, but it’s fair to say it gives the pharaohs a run for their money.

 ‘Like Giza masterminded by Liberace’ … the main entrance. Photograph: John

Echoes of Giza begin with the arrival sequence, where visitors are transported 
up an 80-metre escalator in a creamy spangle-lined tunnel, as if the entrance 
to the Great Pyramid had been masterminded byLiberace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/liberace>. The escalator is gently curved in 
a hump-backed profile, so you can’t see where you’re going, adding to the camp 
drama of it all, before you emerge at a big picture window punched into the 
brick wall, affording the first great view across the harbour.

From here, a second escalator leads up to a brick-paved plaza on the roof of 
the old warehouse, planned as a new (free, but ticketed) public space for the 
city, jacked 40 metres up in the air. It is one of the project’s most 
exhilarating moments, where you’re sandwiched between the plinth of the brick 
shed (which now mostly houses the car park) and the diaphanous cloud of culture 
above. A sculpted white ceiling swoops above your head, flaring out on either 
side of the building to frame views of the city in a pair of vaulted apses – an 
appropriate form for what is a cathedral of our time.

 Intricacy and complexity … the white ceiling. Photograph: PR Company Handout 
Sleek curtain walls of rippling glass lead out to a walkway that runs around 
the entire 340-metre perimeter of the building, like being on the deck of a 
liner, from where you can survey a horizon of shipping cranes to one side, 
church spires to the other. “Our role is to connect the old city with the new 
city beyond,” says De Mueron, referring to theHafenCity 
<http://www.hafencity.com/en/home.html> quarter, an emerging district slated to 
house 12,000 people in the former docklands, in which the “Elphie”, as locals 
have nicknamed the concert hall, stands as a shining beacon.

From the plaza, wide staircases spiral up between the curvaceous white walls, 
recalling the generous sweeping levels of Eero Saarinen’s 1960sTWA terminal 
<http://ny.curbed.com/2015/6/30/9944758/explore-the-twa-terminal-a-pristine-time-capsule-from-1962>
 in New York, leading concert-goers up through a precipitous crevasse, carved 
out between the grand hall and the rest of the building. “We really hacked this 
space out,” says Herzog, jabbing at the air with his big imaginary knife. “It 
was an archaic, kindergarten process of sculpting and carving,” he says, 
describing how they attacked their 5-metre-wide cardboard study models. “More 
than any other building we’ve done, we needed to use different methods to 
design these spaces. They could not be done on the computer.”

He’s right. There is an intricacy and complexity to the sequence that sets it 
apart from the parametrically generated formal acrobatics of their 
contemporaries. These are spaces that have been designed from the inside out, 
prised open in a process of keyhole surgery, with an acute sensitivity to the 
experience of rising through the building. Much of it is down to the relentless 
perfectionism of Ascan Mergenthaler, the busy partner in charge of theTate 
Modern Switch House

<http://www.dezeen.com/2015/02/17/herzog-de-meuron-updated-design-hong-kong-m-museum-west-kowloon-cultural-district/>
 too – projects that all revel in their interior spatial drama, driven by a 
precise choreography of how people move through them.

“We want visitors to be flushed into the hall,” says Mergenthaler, walking 
through one of the relatively narrow tributaries that feed into the main 
auditorium, describing the movement of his audience in terms of fluid dynamics. 
Once you’re inside, you can see why. Seating 2,100 people in a steeply sculpted 
bowl, it feels like entering a rock pool, a coral cave carved out by millennia 
of erosion. Chiselled balconies spill from one level to the next, connected by 
steps in one continuous terraced landscape. Every surface is covered in apitted 
mineral texture of little stalactites <https://www.instagram.com/p/BMYV3tIA8RT/>
, CNC-milled from gypsum fibreboard, that compresses and expands as it ripples 
around the room, mapping the invisible mechanics of acoustic absorption and 
reflection. A huge pendulous mushroom plunges down from the ceiling, serving as 
both an acoustic reflector and a space-age chandelier.

“We didn’t want the usual velvety ‘salon’ aesthetic, or the wooden instrument 
cliche,” says Mergenthaler. Instead they have taken the “vineyard” form 
(pioneered byHans Scharoun’s 1963 Berlin Philharmonic 
<http://www.archdaily.com/108538/ad-classics-berlin-philharmonic-hans-scharoun>
, whose tent-like roof is also echoed here) and cross-fertilised it with the 
verticality of a Shakespearean theatre and the packed intensity of a football 
stadium. Tuned by renowned Japanese acousticianYasuhisa Toyota 
<http://www.nagata.co.jp/e_index.html>, the proof of the pudding will come only 
in January, when the concert season begins. (NB music fans, De Meuron confides 
that the cheapest seats at the top actually have the best acoustic.)

The second, smaller hall is a totally different affair, an oblong shoebox for 
chamber music and recitals that feels hollowed out from a giant tree-trunk, 
againmilled with a pleasingly lumpy surface 
<https://www.instagram.com/p/BMXLoxRACqC/>. Deeper in the bowels of the old 
cocoa warehouse, meanwhile, there is a studio for more experimental music, 
where we findBrian Eno <https://www.theguardian.com/music/brianeno> hunched on

It is one of the many surreal situations awaiting discovery in this sprawling 
vertical city of culture, a bygone species of building that won’t be repeated 
for a very long time. “The whole thing is really so unlikely,” says Herzog, 
reflecting on the last 13 years of struggle. “It almost happened by chance, 
from this individual, whose idea then gained a kind of bottom-up momentum. You 
could not win with such a thing in a design competition. And perhaps we are the 
last generation of ‘author’ style architects to have such a chance.”

Rearing up on the hillside above the historic town of Santiago de Compostela, 
this gargantuan €400m cultural complex opened in 2011, nine years late and four 
times over budget – andstill only half finished

“an expensive mistake” by one member of the original competition jury. 
“Probably one of the largest in the history of architecture.”

Like one of George Lucas’s menacing starships crash-landed on the Boulevard 
Périphérique, the €390m concert hall finally opened last year, two years late 
and three times over budget. “The architecture is martyred, the details 
sabotaged,”complained its architect, Jean Nouvel

architecture, for the profession and for the architect of the most important 
French cultural programme of the new century”.

price tag and delay to match. When theSydney Opera House

 finally opened in 1973, Jørn Utzon’s spectacular cluster of white sails was 10

had long since walked off the project over disagreements with the client.

A topic of debate for three decades, Boston’s grand plan to bury the city’s 
central highway in a 3.5-mile tunnel ended up costing $14.8bn. Begun in 1982, 
it was plagued by escalating costs, overruns, leaks, accusations of shoddy 
workmanship and substandard materials, criminal arrestsand a death 
<https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2015/12/29/years-later-did-big-dig-deliver/tSb8PIMS4QJUETsMpA7SpI/story.html>

finally completed in 2007. The Boston Globe estimated that the project will 
ultimately cost $22bn, including interest – and that it won’t be paid off until 
2038.

After nearly 15 years in the planning process, construction of Berlin’s new 
airport began in 2006, and there is still no end in sight. Originally scheduled 
to open in 2011, it has been beset by issues ranging from corruption to 
malfunctioning smoke vents and structural issues with the roof. It has already 
missed four opening deadlines, during which time the budget has soared from 
€1.7bn to over €5bn.The mayor has suggested it miiight be ready by 2018, but 
don’t hold your breath.
