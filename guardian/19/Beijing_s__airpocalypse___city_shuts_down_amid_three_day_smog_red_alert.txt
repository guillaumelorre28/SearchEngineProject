“Create a paradise,” urges the motto of Beijing’s Baijiazhuang primary school 
– a message stamped on to its front gate in bright red calligraphy.


On Tuesday morning, as China’s smog-choked capital declared its first ever air 
pollution red alert, the school, normally buzzing with over-energetic 
10-year-olds, was almost silent. A pungent mist hung over the outdoor 
basketball courts and running track.

And inside the four-floor main building, hundreds of small wooden desks and 
chairs were empty.

“Usually it won’t be this quiet,” said Wang Ye, a 24-year-old English teacher, 
as she toured its ghostly corridors and classrooms where forgotten rucksacks 
and winter coats were among the few reminders of its normal routine.

Across Beijing, thousands of other schools and nurseries were in a similar 
state of almost total shutdown after the city’s authorities announced a 
three-day state of emergency because of the pollution.


Building sites and factories were forced to close; millions of cars were 
ordered off the roads; and teams of environmental inspectors fanned out across 
the surrounding region to ensure that coal-fired power stations and steel mills 
were not secretly churning out even more filth into the already putrid 
atmosphere.

 “Environment authorities must closely follow the situation, improve 
monitoring and forecasting, and guide local governments’ emergency response 
plans,” China’s environment minister, Chen Jining, said,according to Xinhua 
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-12/08/c_134896224.htm>, the official 
news agency.

At 7am, when the red alert – the first in Chinese history – officially came 
into force, a thick gloom hung over Beijing.


Pollution <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pollution> levels were 
already nearly 15 times higher than the World Health Organisation deems safe.

Polluting smog envelopes Beijing

Wearing an anti-smog facemask, Wang set off from home just before sunrise and 
turned up for work alongside about 60 fellow teachers.


But following government advice, just 20 of the school’s 250 children – those 
whose working parents had nowhere else to send them – had showed up for class.


“Learning is quite important to them but health is more important. Under the 
circumstances I think they should stay at home,” said Wang.


“It’s quite difficult because we must develop and developing can bring some 
problems,” the teacher said of the smog. Asked about its physical effects, she 
croaked: “You can hear my throat.”

Those who missed the government’s high-profile announcement of the pollution 
alert on Monday evening needed only to pick up Tuesday morning’s papers for the 
gory details.


“The first ever red alert for heavy air pollution,” read the Beijing Times’ 
front-page headline, pointing readers to an inside spread detailing the city’s 
latest “airpocalpyse”.


Beneath was an image designed to highlight the Communist party’s determination 
to crack down on polluters: an environmental inspector using a camera to 
photograph an oil refinery not far from the capital.

Liao Yuxi, a news stand owner, said the alert had proved a double dose of bad 
news for his family. Not only had he been unable to send his 10-year-old son to 
school but newspaper sales were also down as many of Beijing’s 23 million 
residents avoided venturing out into the foul-tasting murk.

“Business isn’t good,” the 44-year-old said, as his child sat in the corner 
filling in a colouring book. “I read the papers every day. The government 
always says it is taking measures. But I haven’t seen any details of them.”

Li Biwen, a 55-year-old street sweeper, said he had no plans to hang up his 
broom despite the risk the smog posed to his lungs.


“In my village the air is much better,” said Li, who came to the Chinese 
capital from Sichuan province’s Luozi county almost two decades ago. “[But] in 
Sichuan I was a farmer. I can make more money in Beijing.”


He said his employers had handed out facemasks when the red alert was 
announced. “But I don’t want to wear it,” Li said, sweeping cigarette butts 
from a dust-clogged gutter. “It’s at home.”


Others were making the most of the three-day shutdown, which is set to last 
until Thursday when rain should clear the smog.

“We’re off today. Everything has stopped,” said Zhang Lijun, a plumber who 
would normally have been working on one of several skyscrapers being built in 
the central business district.


In the absence of work, Zhang, 37, was sprawled out in the back of a transit 
van parked near his building site enjoying a pre-lunch can of Blue Ribbon beer 
and a cigarette.

But the plumber, who had travelled from the neighbouring province of Hebei to 
find work, was unimpressed at the suspension. “I don’t think it’s a good thing. 
If we don’t work we don’t get paid,” said Zhang, who usually receives 200 yuan 
(£20.70) a day.

Jin Yingtang, a 44-year-old carpenter, turned up at another construction site 
to find a red placard informing workers of the shutdown. “Halt all dirt trucks, 
gravel trucks and other vehicles which are prone to produce dust and smog,” the 
sign read. “All construction units must stop outdoor work.”

Jin shrugged when asked about the red alert’s impact on his life. “I don’t 
feel good or bad about it,” he replied. Asked about his plans for his day off, 
he grinned. “I’ll have a little rest,” he said.


As the pollution levels climbed on Tuesday afternoon, teachers at Baijiazhuang 
primary school battled to minimise the disruption for their children.

Zhang Guohui, the dean, said staff were using the internet and social 
messaging networks such as WeChat to help pupils study from home.

Wang said she thought her 35-strong class would take advantage of such methods 
rather than using the smog as an excuse to slack off. “I believe they won’t 
just play. They will learn.”

Sat in an office beside the school’s deserted reception, she said her 
workplace was a lonely one without the boisterous youngsters it was built to 
educate. “Usually there would be a lot of noise,” Wang said. “But we love to 
hear them laugh. That’s quite beautiful.”
