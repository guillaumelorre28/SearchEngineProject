The Churchill Arms, Kensington

Start by stepping into a Christmas tree. The evergreen Churchill Arms on 
Kensington Church Street becomes one enormous conifer each December. This year 
the pub is strapping 80 Christmas trees to its exterior walls and decorating 
them with 18,000 fairy lights. The spectacular light show will be ceremonially 
started on Tuesday 6 December, accompanied by mulled wine and festivities. If 
you get peckish afterwards, go through to the Thai restaurant. The Churchill 
Arms was the first London pub to sport a Thai kitchen; the Pad Siew noodles are 
recommended.

Nothing warms the cockles like carolling. Merry gentlemen and merry 
gentlewomen should go to The Harlequin on Wednesday 14 December, where there 
will be a gathering around the piano to belt out an evening of yuletide 
favourites. Expect a Bohemian king, herald angels, five gold rings and a not 
very silent night. Vocal chords will be lubricated with mulled wine and those 
attempting the dog-whistle Ding Dong descant would do well to consult the pub’s 
superior malt whisky collection in advance. This cosy little wood-panelled 
“beer shop”, a free house, has been serving since 1848, and is popular with the 
pre- and post-theatre crowd attending events at Sadler’s Wells nearby.

If you would like to boil your neighbours with their puddings and bury them 
with a stake of holly through their hearts, your name is probably Ebenezer 
Scrooge. Close up your counting house on Christmas Eve and watch your clerk 
slide homewards along the ice slide on Cornhill, before slouching around the 
corner to take your “melancholy dinner” in the “usual melancholy tavern”. Or 
you could try Simpson’s Tavern on nearby Ball Court. Founded in 1757, this snug 
and steamy hostelry is the city’s oldest chop house and all its meals (mains 
from £5.75) are served with a complimentary sausage. Don’t miss the “stewed 
cheese” (£3.50) for dessert.

The Spirit of Christmas Presents walks abroad. The glowing doors of megastores 
are drawing us in with Pied Piped muzak and will-o’-the-wisp Christmas deals. A 
crowd flows along Oxford Street, and you may suddenly feel the need to escape. 
Look no further than the Argyll Arms on Argyll Street, next to Oxford Circus. 
This excellent 19th-century boozer has private mahogany snugs, with 
etched-glass partitions, so you can hide from the shoppers and enjoy a quiet 
pint (or cheeky gin, a house speciality). If you need to make a swift exit, 
however, hunt for the secret tunnel that is alleged to run from the Argyll Arms 
to the London Palladium opposite. You’ll pop up in Cinderella, next to Julian 
Clary’s Dandini (maybe).

For something more hygge, pull up a doily at Little Nan’s on Deptford Market 
Yard and get snug in one of its deep armchairs. Little Nan will set things to 
rights with a warming teapot full of mulled apple juice, made to her family’s 
106-year-old secret recipe. Savour the aromas of vanilla, cinnamon, hibiscus 
and miscellaneous spices, or, if you fancy some pep in your toddy, Nan might be 
persuaded to add a shot of the house spiced rum. Expect leopard-print mugs and 
cat-themed cushions.

The Christmas meal is always a crisis: burnt potatoes, soggy parsnips, turkey 
grease on Uncle Norman’s sweater, and the annual outing of Satan’s mini 
cabbages. This year, take a break. Chef Aidan McGee has begun a residency at 
The Wellington on Haldane Road. Widely credited with the best Sunday roasts in 
London, McGee is now turning his hand to Christmas, rustling up trademark 
sharing platters of delectable festive viands (two-course Christmas menu £28, 
three courses £32). Begin with roasted cauliflower soup; progress to ham hock 
terrine by way of cured salmon in London gin; gorge on roast turkey with all 
the trimmings and polish off proceedings with plum pudding and cinnamon custard 
or a communal cheeseboard. Sorted.

He’s making a list. He’s checking it twice. Santa Claus is coming to town and 
you had better have your stocking ready. The Antelope on Mitcham Road has a 
choice of three open fires where you can affix your undergarments. The bar area 
has two coal fires, but my favourite is the wood-burning hearth in the 
spacious, panelled back room, where you can pull up a high-backed church pew 
and await the arrival of St Nicholas. While away the time by examining the 
pub’s impressive collection of antlers and assorted taxidermy. Don’t let them 
get their hands on Rudolph.

When your commute involves 212 million miles and 233 million households, you 
deserve at least one for the road. Everyone knows that Father Christmas’s 
tipple of choice is brandy, so Santa, if you’re reading this, we recommend you 
pause in The Flask on Highgate West Hill for a quick snifter. This historic 
coaching inn has retained its original stable block, with two 17th-century 
horseboxes that will do perfectly for Donner and Blitzen. The atmosphere inside 
is warm with reassuringly low ceilings: a cosy place to enjoy a quiet cognac. 
Or, if you feel like branching out, try a pint of Dapper Ales Doctor Brown, a 
delicious brown ale brewed in Herne Hill.

Start scanning the sky for signs of reindeer and sleighbells. The Queen of 
Hoxton, Curtain Road, is a good vantage point: its permanent rooftop wigwam 
goes through a seasonal facelift twice a year. This winter you’ll be stepping 
into Skye Halla, a Viking “Drinking Hall in the Clouds” with fire pits, 
driftwood sculptures and a Viking long boat. Peruse the Daily Feasting Menu: 
Hodhr’s Hotpot (from £5) goes particularly well with a horn of Gullveig’s Grog 
(whisky, mead, elderflower and pale ale, £8). Be sure you don’t mistake 
incoming reindeer for the Ride of the Valkyries …

After a hearty Christmas meal, there’s nothing better than a crisp country 
walk followed by a glass of amber refreshment. Go for a stroll in Richmond 
park, looking out for the deer, and wind up in the Roebuck on Richmond Hill. 
This historic pub catches spectacular sunsets: its view overPetersham Meadows 
<http://www.petershamvillage.org/petersham-meadows.html> is almost unchanged 
since JMW Turner painted it in 1815. It serves all the trusty Taylor Walker 
brews, as well as a selection of guest ales on tap. The food menu includes 
sharing platters (from £11.49), fish and chips (from £8.99) and classic pub 
grub (from £8.49). When the Roebuck was renovated in the 1950s, a cache of 
18th-century highwaymen’s loot was discovered in the roof. Keep your eyes 
peeled and Christmas might just come early.
