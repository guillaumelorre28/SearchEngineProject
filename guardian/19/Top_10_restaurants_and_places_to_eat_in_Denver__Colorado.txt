ChoLon Modern Asian Bistro

Food-infatuated Denverites secure a seat at the chef's counter to witness 
chef-owner Lon Symensma's culinary magic, which unfolds in an exhibition 
kitchen that struts Southeast Asian dishes of the kind that make you drop your 
jaw. Symensma's presentations, the food equivalent of mosaics, remind you of 
museum art, each plate beautifully composed with impeccable ingredients. The 
soup dumplings spilling with sweet onions and melty gruyère are as good as it 
gets, a punch of flavours that explode like rockets in your mouth. The kaya 
toast with coconut jam and a jar of custard-like "egg cloud" requires you to 
demand that your heart be still.

Cafe Brazil
 Cafe Brazil, Denver 
Stunningly prepared seafood dishes take centre stage at this exuberant north 
Denver shrine to Brazil, with its aromatic thumps of garlic, ginger,dendê 
(palm) oil and chillies, most of which penetrate the mind-altering stews 
bobbing with scallops, shrimp or bacalhau, a dried and salted cod. Chef-owner 
Tony Zarlenga pairs his flavour-bombed marvels, which also includefeijoada 
(black bean stew, the national dish of Brazil), with an unparalleled rum roster 
that trumpets nearly 100 bottles in the adjacent – and equally ebullient – Rum 
Room, which throbs to Brazilian beats.

El Taco de Mexico
 El Taco De Mexico, Denver 
No sojourn in the Mile High City is complete without at least one trip to this 
taqueria, which turns out the city's best green chile stew, a savoury, 
spice-smacked nod to Denver's unapologetic obsession with the dish. The open 
kitchen is commanded by unflappable women whose conversations – always in 
Spanish – are muted by the thud of cleavers that come down on pieces of meat, 
which are quickly turned into street tacos, or tucked into flour tortillas 
draped with that magnificent green chile and specked with coriander and onions. 
The fearsomely spicy salsa is an object of true beauty, too.

Tom's Home Cookin'
 Tom's Home Cookin' Denver 
The queue at this purveyor of comfort food in the Five Points neighbourhood 
often starts long before the doors swing open, but the Southern-inspired 
platters, served in colossal heaps in boxes, more than make up for the wait. 
The board changes daily, and while you'll probably want one of everything, the 
copper-crusted fried chicken – if it's available – flies me to the moon. So, 
too, does the andouille sausage and chicken gumbo, the meatloaf and the stewed 
collard greens, and for a flourishing finale, peach cobbler channels every 
sweet tooth's fantasy. Get an extra one for the road.

Vietnam Grill
 Vietnam Grill, Denver 
Vietnam Grill is more than a pho parlour, although you'll always encounter a 
procession of pho aficionados slurping noodles from steaming broths. But my 
advice is to forgo the pho (for that, point your chopsticks toPho 95 
<http://www.pho95noodlehouse.com/>) and explore the funkier offerings on the 
ambitious menu of more than 150 dishes. There's a bloodied, deeply crimson 
soup, for example, bobbing with pig's feet, stellar pork-stuffed chicken wings, 
or playfulbánh khot, custardy, rice-flour "cupcakes" that brim with pudgy 
shrimp, toasted coconut flakes and ribbons of spring onion. Its strip mall 
setting isn't particularly appealing, but the interior, bedecked with white 
table linens illuminated by soft lighting, makes it one of the few Vietnamese 
joints in Denver that's conducive to a couple's outing.

Biker Jim's
 Biker Jim's diner, Denver Photograph: Lori Midson for the Guardian 
There are plenty of pedestrian wiener slingers on Denver's asphalt, but Biker 
Jim, aka Jim Pittenger, is the city's bona fide frankfurter gigolo, pumping out 
a slew of exotic, grilled sausages, from reindeer and elk to wild boar and 
rattlesnake. Regulars – and there are lots of them – order their dogs crowned 
with onions soaked in Coca-Cola and a squiggle of cream cheese fired from a 
caulking gun, but when it comes to toppings, the possibilities are endless. But 
don't stop there: sides such as charred cauliflower, fried green tomatoes and 
deep-fried macaroni and cheese deserve their legions of fans, as do the 
ice-cream sandwiches.

Jax Fish House & Oyster Bar
 Jax Fish House and Oyster Bar, Denver 
Fact: Colorado is a landlocked state. Myth: the absence of an ocean means an 
empty net. For proof that this city swims with the sharks, sail straight to Jax 
Fish House and Oyster Bar, with two locations in Denver and four altogether in 
the state. Within the polished living museum of aquatics, which sources its 
sustainable seafood from coastal fishermen, is a glistening ice bar stocked 
with bright, briny, shiny oysters, shrimp, clams, king and Dungeness crab and 
Maine lobsters. Caviar, along with made-to-order clam chowder and a seasonally 
conscious fish scroll that might proffer Alaskan halibut, Bristol Bay salmon or 
grilled Gulf prawns, round out the nautical eats that are bolstered by clever 
cocktails, offbeat wines and excellent craft beers, mostly brewed in Colorado.

Squeaky Bean
 Squeaky Bean diner, Denver Photograph: Lori Midson for the Guardian 
Call them what you like – foodniks, foodies or gastronauts – they all clamour 
for chef Max MacKissock's innovative cooking. His cutting-edge New American 
style trumpets ingredients from the restaurant's own one-acre farm, and 
MacKissock, who thinks way beyond ordinary culinary boundaries, transforms just 
about everything he touches into a showstopper. You can order à la carte, but I 
highly recommend splurging on one of his tasting menus – a four- or 
seven-course symphony of dishes that can be paired with wines. A spectacular 
cocktail menu – easily one of Denver's best – elevates the bar to new heights, 
and the globe-trotting cheese cart is a lovely ending to a sublime dinner.
• 1500 Wynkoop Street, + 1 303 623 2665, thesqueakybean.net

menus from $55

Osteria Marco
 Osteria Marco, Denver 
Chef Frank Bonanno has an empire of restaurants in Denver, but my favourite is 
his Larimer Square osteria, a rollicking homage to thin-crusted pizzas, 
housemade salumi and cheeses and suckling pig, the latter of which is served 
only on Sunday night. Sashay down the wide staircase, past the ever-present 
throng at the bar sipping cocktails and slip into a booth to consider the 
marvel that's the Carbonara pizza splayed with an egg that spills a river of 
yolk over the crisped pancetta. Then again, you can simply graze on pulled 
pork, bresaola and lonza, all of which are made in-house, as is the 
unassailable burrata.

Fruition
 Fruition Denver Co 
Chef, owner, farmer, butcher, cheesemaker and forager Alex Seidel's gift to 
locals – and everyone else who takes pleasure in food – is this Capitol Hill 
jewel, barely bigger than a thimble, but a place where strangers become 
friends, bonding over just-picked beets, turnips and seasonally inspired 
vegetables sharing space on the plate with centrepieces of wonderment: Colorado 
lamb loin, roast pork, steelhead trout, duck breast, or pan-seared diver 
scallops dusted with cured foie gras powder. Seidel's menu changes on a whim, 
thanks to his intense focus on fresh ingredients – but this is where you want 
to celebrate, well, anything, including just an exquisite dinner out.
