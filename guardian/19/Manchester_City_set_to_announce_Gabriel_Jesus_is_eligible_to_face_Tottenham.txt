The Football Association is nearing completion of its due diligence process

 regarding the Brazilian and it now seems likely he will be available for 
Saturday’s visit of Tottenham Hotspur to the Etihad Stadium.

The length of time in having Jesus signed off for City has been down to the 
player, who cost £27m from Palmeiras, having been third-party owned.

As the 19-year-old has been training for three weeks with the club, Guardiola 
may decide to draft Jesus into the match-day squad for Tottenham, though it may 
be unlikely for him to be given a starting berth to face the Premier League’s 
second-placed team.
