At last, arrival in the Conch Republic

The drive down to Key West was marked by a heavy thunderstorm. I braved the 
rain, but it slowed the pace and limited the view of the sea as we slowly made 
our way south west.

About 30 miles away from our end destination the storm finally cleared, and I 
saw the sun for the first time since Wednesday. As the drive continued remnants 
of a train track, raised high above the water, sporadically appeared. The train
no longer runs down here <http://www.flaglerkeys100.com/key-west-history> from 
mainland USA, but it makes for reflective moments as you speed past it.

Some 35 miles from Key West I stopped in at No Name Pub, on a suggestion from 
@toomuchme <http://twitter.com/toomuchme>.

On the way down Key Deer, an endangered species, wandered up to the car and 
allowed themselves to be photographed. The bar itself was great, a roaring 
locals joint about 3 miles off US 1 on Big Pine Key - one of the number of 
islands that makes up the road down. Walking in you immediately notice the 
thousands and thousands of dollar hills lining the walls and ceiling - 
according to a (fairly old) article in the bathroom, between $65,000 to $75,000 
hangs in the bar. 

The bills have all been left by customers, with personalised messages, so I 
left one from the Guardian, stapled into the ceiling with a staple gun provided 
by a woman at the bar.

I had tried to book into Eden house on a tip from @murphyway 
<http://www.twitter.com/murphyway>, but they were full, so I opted for 
Southernmost House instead - a turn of the 19th century three storey house wood 
panelling in the corridors and beautiful four poster beds in the rooms.

After dumping bags, I headed straight down to Mallory Square, a famous point 
for watching the sunset. Hundreds of people had gathered at the water to see 
nightfall, and it didn't disappoint - the rain had long departed and left 
behind beautiful blue skies. I grabbed a piña colada, housed in a coconut and 
joined everyone by the pier to look on. A lovely end to the day.

It's basically a big, covered fruit stall that does much-lauded drinks. I had 
a "Fun in the Sun" as the grey skies began to drizzle, which consisted of 
mamey, banana and strawberry.

From there, I took Card Sound Road towards the start of the US 1 out to Key 
West.@ariellec <http://twitter.com/ariellec> and @keysclaudia 
<http://twitter.com/keysclaudia> suggested I stop in at Alabama Jack's, but I 
just had a look in as a) a storm is in the way in and I wanted to get on the 
way and b) I'm stuffed full of crab and smoothie

Day four: the journey so far, Miami heralded

Adam woke up in the deco splendour of the Colony Hotel 
<http://www.colonymiami.com> on Ocean Drive in South Beach - a relative bargain 
at $120 a night. Not such a bargain was his breakfast atNews Cafe  
<http://www.newscafe.com>which came in at a quarter of that.

Next stop: The Miami bike scheme, Decobike 
<http://www.decobike.com/pricing.php>, allowed Adam to work off some steam and 
to take the splendid architecture of the South Beach area. After which, it was 
time for another little nibble - atJoe's Stone Crab <http://joesstonecrab.com>, 
a South Beach institution serving crab claws ($18 for four).

Next stop: A cooling dip at the Venetian Pool at Coral Gables - a beautiful 
spot, with a large pool ringed by Venetian-style architecture.

Next stop: Heading out of town, Adam stopped off at Coral Castle 
<http://coralcastle.com>, in Homestead, a paean to unrequited love built by 
Latvian immigrantEd Leedskalnin 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Leedskalnin> and described as "an 
engineering marvel that had been compared with Stonehenge and the Great 
Pyramids of Egypt". Bit of an exaggeration, but that's the broken-hearted for 
you.

Now: Adam is en route to Key West, party central in the Straits of Florida - a 
four-and-a-half drive away. By the time he gets there, it should be happy hour, 
so tell him where's best to whet his whistle and where to rest his weary head 
tonight.@AdamGabbatt <https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt> #roadtriptips 
<https://twitter.com/search?q=%23roadtriptips&src=hash>

7.42pm BST 

Coral Castle <http://coralcastle.com>, in Homestead, is described in its own 
marketing as "an engineering marvel that had been compared with Stonehenge and 
the Great Pyramids of Egypt".

While it is very nice, I think that might be overdoing it a bit.

The "castle" is more a ringed off garden area than anything else, with a small 
two-storey structure in one corner serving as the sole living quarters.

It was built by one man - Latvian immigrant Ed Leedskalnin 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Leedskalnin>, who according to the 
leaflet, posters, and videos on display decided to build the castle after being 
spurned by a lover - constantly referred to as "his sweet sixteen".

The museum at the castle makes out as if Leedskalnin is some kind of hero for 
sacrificing his life after a single jilting, but I couldn't help feeling he'd 
have been happier if he'd just found himself someone else. Still, he was 
building it in the 50s so it was pre-online dating.

Among the things to see at the castle: the "throne room", which isn't a room 
at all but an open-air zone with thrones - one for Leedskalnin and one for his 
beloved, which reinforced the feeling that he should really have tried harder 
to get over her.

It's undeniably impressive that one man created this though - 28-years of 
allegedly single-handed labour, using improvised tools and manoeuvring some 
coral blocks that could weight up to 23 tons. Holes in the coral were filled 
with more coral, forming tight walls with no holes.

Coral Castle came recommended by @salamandor3 
<https://twitter.com/salamandor3/status/329957061477662720> and, of course, 
@ariellec <https://twitter.com/ariellec/status/329958537360982017>, who 
described is as "old weird tourist-trap Florida". I enjoyed it very much, but 
be warned: it is $15 to get in.

Venietian Pool at Coral Gables

Coral Gables, recommended by @georgianak 
<https://twitter.com/georgianavk/status/329956386593198081>, is a beautiful 
place. It's a quiet neighbourhood with pretty houses and banyan trees lining 
the streets. Georgiana recommended Coral Bagels (2750 SW 26th Ave) in 
particular, but having eaten eggs and crab already I decided to take follow up 
on a tweet from@discoverusauk 
<https://twitter.com/discoverusauk/status/329903684664299521> and head down to 
the Venetian Pool.

The pool, and the buildings that surround it, are located on de Soto 
Boulevard. You can spot it from the street as you walk past.

It's a beautiful spot, with the large pool ringed by Venetian-style 
architecture.

The pool was created in 1923 from a coral rock quarry. Some of the rock mined 
here has been used to create waterfalls around the edge of the pool, and 
there's a little coral cave that you can splash around in.

The water in the large pool drawn from an underground spring and according to 
theVenetian Pool website <http://www.coralgables.com/index.aspx?page=167> is 
drained and replenished each day. It's lovely and cool and a great respite from 
the heat.

There were just two other people in the pool when I got in there, meaning we 
were outnumbered by the lifeguards. I'm sure it's busier on sunny days though.

Entrance is $11.50, and I had to buy a towel for an extra $7. Non-swimmers can 
just walk around for a dollar.

Lunch at Joe's Stone Crab

Joe's Stone Crab (11 Washington Avenue, joesstonecrab.com 
<http://www.joesstonecrab.com>) came recommended by lots of readers 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2013/may/01/florida-road-trip-day-three#comment-23207983>
 as a Miami must-do.

It's down in the South Beach section of Miami Beach - itself an island off the 
coast of mainland USA - and right near where I dropped off my DecoBike.

Joe's Stone Crab was opened by Joe Weiss in 1913 and was reportedly referenced 
in the James Bond novel Goldfinger. It's a restaurant first and foremost, but 
in the day there is a little fish market where you can buy your crab, or 
lobster, or other fish, and sit at tables to eat it.

I had four "medium" stone crab claws for $18, at the recommendation of a very 
friendly woman who talked me through what was on offer. There's a little 
terrace at the front of Joe's with decorative iron railings and I sat there and 
scoffed the lot.

The crab came with a buttery sauce for dipping and a couple of bread rolls, 
which I ignored. It was tender and delicious. 

One commenter had voiced concern that Joe's Stone Crab had become a tourist 
trap. As a tourist myself, I didn't seem to notice it being overly filled with 
fellow holidaymakers. More importantly, despite this place being a pretty well 
known "destination" restaurant, the food was still amazing and the staff still 
friendly. I'd definitely come back.

Next up: I'm heading to Coral Gables <http://www.citybeautiful.net/>, as per 
@georgianak <https://twitter.com/georgianavk>'s instruction.

Possibly to swim, as per @discoverusauk <https://twitter.com/discoverusaUK>'s

Tour de Miami

On Twitter @perrygrove 
<https://twitter.com/perrygrove/status/329635057788678144> said I should hire a 
bike along the south beach.

There are hire points <http://www.decobike.com/pricing.php> all along this 
southern stretch of Miami beach, and a swipe of the credit card grants easy 
access. It's $4 for 30 minutes but the price falls away the longer you hire the 
bike, so not too expensive.

The bikes are single speed beach cruisers, very heavy but pretty smooth and 
easy to pedal. I had a quick whirl around the south beach area, tootling past 
people being worked out by personal trainers and tall apartment blocks with 
gates entrance ways.

There's lots of lush grass around and it would be a great spot to sit and 
relax. One man was doing just that, strumming a guitar with his shirt and shoes 
on the ground beside him and an Alsatian looking on.

Some of the tall rise buildings are really striking around here, one 
burnt-orange coloured 30-storey-plus effort in particular jumping out - the top 
is disc-shaped like some kind of peach UFO.

$30 bill

Just finished breakfast at News Cafe. Was aghast when the check came to $30. 
But then this isn't a cheap area.

I'm now going to rent a bike. Miami Beach has a public scheme, called Decobike 
<http://www.decobike.com/>, with bikes lined up along the shore. Apparently you 
can just swipe your credit card and ride. We'll soon find out.

I'm breakfasting at News Cafe this morning, a block away from the
Colony Hotel on Ocean Drive.

Twitterer @hangingwithmr <https://twitter.com/hangingwithmr> suggested this 
place. A News Cafe snippet:
Giovanni Versace bought magazines from here on 15 July 1997. He then walked 
the short distance home, where he was shot dead on his doorstep byAndrew Cunanan
 
<http://abcnews.go.com/Archives/video/july-15-1997-suspect-versace-murder-10363773>
.

The service is a little slow. And not very friendly. But the decor inside is 
quite nice, with red leather booths and black and white photos on the walls, 
while outside is a good spot for people watching.

I'm having eggs news: a slice of tomato, a slither of ham and a poached egg 
atop an English muffin. With a little pot of warm cream cheese on the side. 
Surprisingly good.

It's on Ocean Drive in Miami Beach – one of the many art deco hotels on this 
stretch. My room is fairly basic but is all you'd want from this kind of thing, 
and cost $120, pretty cheap by US standards. The colony comes complete with a 
slightly iffy bar/restaurant out front, which I ignored, only to find out that 
most of the bars along Ocean Drive are pretty similar: staffed by short-skirted 
woman and white-shirted, slick-haired men.

I popped into the Clevelander hotel for a drink, just a couple of blocks from 
the Colony at about 10th Street, and after recording the rather sorry 
experience on Vine.

<https://twitter.com/StacyLynnLondon>. She sent me to Mac's Club Deuce Bar on 
14th Street, still in Miami Beach, which was an altogether more authentic 
experience – a straight-up American dive joint, complete with black-and-white 
tiled floor and figure of eight-shaped bar. Lots of fun.

Today I'm in Miami until around 3pm, then driving to Key West. I'd like to go 
for a nice Miami-style lunch and take in a couple of lesser-visited spots here 
before heading off. Hotel tips for Key West would be great, too, including any 
recommendations for the drive.

In the meantime, here's my video round-up from day three:
