Brentford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/brentford> are determined not 
to sell Scott Hogan for less than their £15m valuation after rejecting West 
Ham’s latest offer worth up to £12.5m for the striker.

Slaven Bilic is desperate to add to his attacking options with Italy forward 
Simone Zaza likely to leave the club this month and Diafra Sakho still out 
injured. Having made an unofficial enquiry at the start of the month, West 
Ham’s first official bid of £9m was rejected last week and they returned with 
an improved offer of £10m before the weekend.

That was also summarily rejected by Brentford, whose manager, Dean Smith, left 
Hogan out of the squad for the 5-1 thrashing of non-league side Eastleigh in 
the FA Cup on Saturday which set up a fourth round tie against Premier League 
leaders Chelsea.

A third bid worth up to £12.5m in bonuses for the 24-year-old, who has scored 
14 Championship goals this season, was submitted on Monday but it was again 
turned down due to the structure of the deal. Watford and Newcastle have also 
expressed an interest in signing Hogan, who has only 18 months remaining on his 
contract, but Walter Mazzarri’s side refused to increasetheir initial offer of 
£8m

, while it is understood the player will only move to the Premier League.

Zaza, who joined on an initial loan deal from Juventus, is wanted by both 
Valencia and Fiorentina on a similar deal having failed to score in 11 
appearances for West Ham. Jonathan Calleri, the Argentina under-23 striker who 
is on loan from Deportivo Maldonado, could also leave the club this month with 
clubs in Spain interested in taking him on loan.
