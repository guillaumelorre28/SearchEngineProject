The police and crime commissioner for Northumbria, Vera Baird, is in talks 
with local government officials in an attempt to stop the withdrawal of funding 
for women’s refuges inSunderland <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/sunderland>.


The Labour-led council recently told residents in a consultation that it would 
cut its budget by £74m over the next three years.

Charity officials at Wearside Women in Need 
<http://www.ourgateshead.org/womeninneed>, which runs four refuges for 173 
women and 107 children as well as a 24-hour helpline, said they were told their 
funding of £568,000 would be withdrawn in June.

Domestic violence <https://www.theguardian.com/society/domestic-violence> has 
been increasing in Northumbria, with incidents rising by 62% between 2007-8 and 
2014-15. If the proposed cut goes ahead the charity said it would probably be 
forced to close.

Baird will meet the leader of the council and the chief executive to try to 
resolve the situation.

“Sunderland would be the only Labour council in the north-east to close 
domestic abuse refuge provision if this went ahead,” she said.

“My experience of councillor colleagues in Sunderland – and indeed of council 
employees there – is that they have always been committed and supportive of the 
need to tackle domestic abuse. They have often been at the forefront of 
innovating activities around this work that we have pursued together.”

Wearside Women <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women> in Need has 
been running a refuge in Sunderland for 35 years. Clare Phillipson, director of 
the charity, said its funding had been cut by 33% since 2010.

“If this goes ahead it will create a dangerous precedent of a council being 
able to stop funding all its women’s refuges. If one does so, I am sure others 
will think they can follow,” she said.

A spokesman for Sunderland city council said no decision had been made. 

The council will vote on changes to its revenue budget in February and March.

Cllr Graeme Miller, who runs health, housing and audit services, said: 
“Because of the unprecedented cuts and budget pressures the council has been 
facing since 2010, many services have to be reviewed, refreshed and reorganised.

“While no final decisions have been made on the council’s budget for next 
year, the council consults with many individuals and organisations.

“For several years, this has included dialogue on a more collaborative and 
comprehensive approach working with Wearside Women In Need and others to 
support victims of domestic violence. This dialogue is continuing.”
