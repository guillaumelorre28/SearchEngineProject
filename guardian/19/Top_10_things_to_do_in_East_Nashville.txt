I Dream of Weenie

If you've ever fantasised about eating a hotdog, then I Dream of Weenie is the 
place to live out that dream. In the 5 Points area, it's the place to munch 
down on a dog after a beer at any of the bars that are within walking distance. 
It's also in a Volkswagen bus with picnic tables provided to sit and enjoy your 
wiener and the kitschy decor. Coined as East Nashville's only "full-service 
wienery", and serving up hotdogs from $2.75-$3.75, you won't find a cheaper or 
better snack. You can get almost anything you can think of on a hotdog and 
there are tofu dogs for vegetarians.

Fond Object Records
 Photograph: Lindsay Scott 
Fond Object is not your typical record store. This "art collective" is home to 
new and used vinyl, books and magazines, custom-made clothing, and the only 
local petting zoo in East Nashville. It hosts bands in the backyard of the 
store and also has in-store performances during the winter. When the weather is 
nice, they show movies on an outside projector. Not only can you grab some 
tunes and listen to some tunes, you can also pet some barnyard animals at the 
same time. That's pretty cool.

Mas Tacos Por Favor
 Photograph: Lindsay Scott 
Mas Tacos Por Favor started as a food truck when Teresa would park her old 
school RV outside the busy bars in East Nashville's 5 Points. It was a great 
way to feed hungry drunk people. The $3 tacos are so good that soon they were 
at every banging event in town. Now with a lo-fi restaurant – service is 
through a hatch, the interior has a rustic decor with chipped wood on the walls 
and a chalkboard menu – people come to Teresa. Her authentic Mexico City-style 
tacos have been featured on the Food NetworksDiners, Drive-in's, and Dives 
<http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/diners-drive-ins-and-dives.html> show.

Jeni's Ice Cream
 Photograph: Lindsay Scott 
Jeni Britton Bauer started her ice-cream shop in Ohio, then set up a store in 
East Nashville just a few years ago. Though there are now two others in town, 
with flavours such as brambleberry crisp and goat cheese with red cherries, 
this is no chain store. For $4.50 you get two scoops in a cone or bowl and for 
$12 you can enjoy an entire pint. Bauer has a passion for freshness and sources 
her ingredients locally. The staff are friendly and patient: they will let you 
try every single flavour at the long counter before making your choice. There's 
plenty of seating inside, with bar tops and stools and two large church pews, 
and bright orange plastic chairs outside.

Shelby Park

Shelby Park was established in East Nashville in 1912. Since then it has grown 
to be one of the most visited parks in the city. It is in the Lockland Springs 
neighbourhood, and there are plenty of things to do there: there's a dog park, 
tennis courts, a community garden and a playground on one side of the park. The 
other side sits right on the Cumberland river where there's a golf course, 
baseball fields and a large duck pond. Another great amenity is the Greenway, 
which is a long stretch of paved trails for long-distance walking and running. 
The nature centre provides an array of activities from children's crafts to 
yoga and they lend bikes for free.

The East Nashville Running Club
 Photograph: Lindsay Scott 
Known as East Nasty, this club meets at 11th and Holly Street each Wednesday 
night and runs through the streets of East Nashville no matter the weather. 
It's a large group you can't miss because of the glow from the vests and 
reflectors. The runners all congregate at3 Crow Bar <http://3crowbar.com/> 
afterwards to rehydrate and socialise. There are 12 different runs, so you can 
choose from three miles up to six. It's perfect for runners new to town or 
people who just want to make friends and get fit at the same time.

The Family Wash
 Photograph: Lindsay Scott 
When you pass by the bright turquoise building that is The Family Wash, you 
could be forgiven for thinking it's a laundromat. In fact, it's one of the 
coolest bars in East Nashville. This eccentric little dive specialises in 
shepherd's pie and for $10 you get a pie and a pint of beer. Also available are 
pot pies and the baked brie. They serve local Yazoo beer on tap, as well as 
many high-gravity bottled beers, including Hoptimus Prime Double IPA. If Pee 
Wee Herman owned a bar, it might look something like this – with random action 
figures littering the bar, there is always something to play with while you 
wait on your food. The walls are decorated with local artwork for sale and they 
have live music every night.

The Idea Hatchery
 Photograph: Lindsay Scott 
This lovely set of eight shops describes itself as a "small-business-incubator 
concept". It's born and bred of local artists and entrepreneurs who created an 
environment to share their dreams in a collective space. You can find almost 
everything at this shopping stop: western boots, handmade leather wallets, 
fancy jeans, a press shop, art gallery, books, and oatmeal at Haulin' Oats. 
Prices vary but you can find anything from simple gifts starting at $5 to jeans 
for around $100. On the second Saturday of each month in the spring and summer, 
the row celebrates with its community by staying open late and offering 
significant discounts on the goodies.

Village Pub
 Photograph: Lindsay Scott 
This isn't your typical East Nashville hipster bar (we have plenty of those). 
This is the bar you go to where the bartender asks your name and shakes your 
hand. Inside, its like a cosy log cabin, and the wraparound porch is perfect 
for enjoying a beer in the spring and summer. The southern craft beer choices 
include ales from Alabama'sGood People Brewing 
<http://www.goodpeoplebrewing.com/>, Tennessee's Calfkiller Brewery 
<http://www.calfkillerbeer.com/> and Mayday Brewery 
<http://www.maydaybrewery.com/>. The pretzels are delicious and make the 
perfect sidekick to a cold beer. Mondays are hopping with the "Mule Day", 
featuring signature liquor drinks served in the coldest silver mugs in the 
world (goblets, they call them) – for half price.

Olive and Sinclair

Olive and Sinclair was started in 2009 by Scott Witherow, and his chocolate 
bars (from $6.99) can now be found in dozens of stores in Nashville. His new 
home is a retail store front in East Nashville where customers can tour the 
facility and see exactly how this artisan chocolate is made. The storefront is 
bright and welcoming with homemade hot chocolate and samples. In the back, 
hand-picked cacao beans are combined with robust flavours of the south, such as 
coffee bean, sea salt and Mexican style cinnamon-chili. It was voted "America's 
Best Chocolate" by Southern Living Magazine.
