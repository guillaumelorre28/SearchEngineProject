The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and their Russian chief conductor 
Vasily Petrenko <http://www.liverpoolphil.com/vasily-petrenko> have an 
instinctive rapport, audible in the electrifying first volume in this series (
Symphonies 1, 2, 5 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/19/tchaikovsky-symphonies-1-2-5-liverpool-philharmonic-petrenko-review>
). It’s evident again here, importantly in the much-loved No 6 (“Pathetique”). 
From the soulful opening bassoon solo, warm strings and alert woodwind detail, 
this is a reading of depth and passion rather than surface angst. No 4 blazes, 
the RLPO brass in glowing form. The “Polish” No 3, with its constant answering 
phrases and sudden flowing melodies, is as satisfying as this slightly lopsided 
five-movement symphony can be. The lovely second movement, Alla tedesca, flutes 
nimble, cellos ardent, perfectly captures a mood of carefree rapture – rare in 
Tchaikovsky but all the more rewarding for it.
