Soju, the world’s bestselling alcohol, is a rice-based Korean hooch that packs 
a fair punch. That said, it is almost Christmas, so you could use St Germain 
instead of the cordial to make this even boozier. Serves one.

20ml soju 
20ml elderflower cordial
10ml Cointreau
10ml lime juice
20ml orange juice
10ml egg white
Angostura bitters <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angostura_bitters>, to finish

Shake the soju, cordial, Cointreau, citrus and egg in a shaker, add ice and 
shake again. Strain into a coupe glass, add a drop of bitters and serve.
