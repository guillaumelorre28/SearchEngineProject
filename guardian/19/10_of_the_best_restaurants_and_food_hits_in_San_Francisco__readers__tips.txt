WINNER: Boudin Bakery

Right on the seafront is Boudin Bakery, and its speciality is soup in a 
sourdough breadbowl. The lid is the roof of the loaf to dip in the soup. 
Perfect after a windswept boat trip across to Alcatraz. Sit outside with the 
wharf and the trams right there, sea lions honking in the background. Clam 
chowder is the best to eat so close to the Pacific.

Hamburgers, Sausalito

A unique lunch stop is Hamburgers, just across the street from the ferry 
terminal. It’s a tiny place with a line of lunch customers along the sidewalk. 
Burgers are delicious and made to order. Expect to pay around $10 with fries. 
There’s no room to eat in there, so find a bench and enjoy the views across the 
bay: Alcatraz across the water, the Golden Gate to the right, Oakland to the 
left and San Francisco beyond.

San Francisco’s best vegan chow
 Cinnaholic 
San Francisco is well catalogued as a vegan’s paradise (Mission District’s 
Gracias Madre’s warm potato gorditas with avocado and piquant salsa verde are 
fantastic), but in Berkeley is where you’ll find the world’s best cinnamon 
buns. The warm, chewy pastries at Cinnaholic are not only all vegan, they can 
also be customised with warm cookies, mocha frosting and sprinkles.

Words alone cannot convey how good the porchetta roll at the Roli Roti food 
truck is – it’s pork loin wrapped in pork belly with herbs, and the crispy skin 
is to die for. The juices that come off the pork go into the roasted potatoes 
they serve on the side.

Perbacco

This Italian restaurant in the financial district has a handwritten menu that 
changes every day – a sure sign of fresh ingredients in the kitchen and on 
diners’ plates. It’s based on northern Italian cuisine with a hint of Provençal 
herbs, and is hugely popular with locals. A great atmosphere develops 
downstairs as the Californian wine starts flowing in the beautiful vaulted 
cellar. Try linguine with pesto, and roast lamb with rosemary potatoes for the 
lunchtime special, at $25.

Sam’s is a historic San Francisco restaurant. It has recently reopened after a 
six-month closure, with a change in ownership, but its class and history remain 
untouched. The seafood is fabulous and the waiters, who wear long black aprons, 
really know their stuff. The room is charming, with round cafe tables and 
curtained private booths – and the sanddabs (a flatfish) were excellent.

El Farolito

In a city (and a neighbourhood) filled with great Mexican food, El Farolito is 
still the best – the lines out of the door every evening say it all. The 
service is quick and when you bite into their food you understand why it’s 
permanently busy: juicycarnitas and burritos, tender tacos, and the carne asada 
super quesadilla suiza is out of this world. Throw in the (complimentary) 
chips, salsa and guacamole, a few cans of Tecate and you’ve got a meal that’s 
not only delicious but also cheap: dinner for two is less than $20. It’ll be 
the first meal I have the next time I’m in SF.

I am a huge fan of desserts, especially ice-cream, and I have tried different 
kinds in different parts of the globe, but the best gelato on the entire planet 
is Alimento, a small Italian deli in North Beach, San Francisco. My personal 
favourite flavours were dulce de leche and pistachio. If you want to taste a 
little bit of heaven, this is the place.

Amazing breakfasts in Potrero Hill

 serves delicious, locally sourced breakfasts. It’s a little out of the way in 
Potrero Hill but well worth the journey. Go for the scrambled eggs with 
stinging nettles, mushrooms, goat’s cheese and crispy house potatoes. And add a 
side order of lemon-ricotta pancakes! Afterwards, head down the road to Baked 
bakery for one of its fantastic brownies or blondies.

Pupusas and Kimchi burritos

Head out to El Paisa, a Central American restaurant known only to locals. It’s 
a bit of a trek, but thepupusas (thick Salvadoran corn tortilla)alone are worth 
it. They’re homemade, small and indescribably delicious – I like the revueltas 
best, but try a couple of each. Wait until the next day to head to HRD 
Coffeeship near the Embarcadero and the Giants’ ballpark. The kimchi burrito is 
amazing – a tangy, spicy and incredible mix of Korean and Mexican loveliness. 
One thing, though: don’t arrive at noon as there will be a line down the 
street; better to show up on the early or later side.
