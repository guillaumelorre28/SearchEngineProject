Nick Kyrgios <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nick-kyrgios> risked a fine 
after he was knocked out of the second round of the Shanghai Masters after 
apparently serving without any effort. At one point, he approached the umpire 
Ali Nili and asked: “Can you call time so I can finish this match and go home.”

The Australian tennis player, ranked 14 in the world, on one occasion appeared 
to walk off the court before his opponent, the world No110 Mischa Zverev, had 
returned a ball to him and he also seemed to make no attempt to return a Zverev 
serve. He later said that he “took the easy way out” as he lost the match 6-3, 
6-1. Umpire Nili – who also gave Kyrgios a code violation for swearing – told 
him: “Nick, you can’t play like that. It’s just not professional. This is a 
professional tournament.”

The Association of Tennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> 
Professionals’ rules state that any player failing to put in ‘best efforts’ in 
a match can be fined up to $10,000 (£8,000) for each violation.

At one stage a fan called out to Krygios to tell him he should “respect the 
game” and “respect the people”, causing the tennis player to stop playing and 
reply: “You wanna come here and play? Sit down and shut up and watch.”

Afterwards, Krygios claimed he was tired. “It was just tough. Obviously I 
played a lot of matches in a row. Physically tired, mentally tired,” he said. 
“That’s why I’m trying to work on being able to be consistent every week. Just 
took the easy way out tonight and obviously didn’t show up at all. I wasn’t so 
much frustrated. I just tapped out a little bit, I guess.”

Asked about the confrontation with the spectator, Kyrgios said: “I feel like 
if they knew what they were talking about they’d be on the tennis court and 
being successful as well. I can’t really understand it at all. They don’t know 
what I’m going through, so no, I don’t understand it.

Not good enough today on many levels, I'm better than that. I can go on about 
excuses but there are none. Sorry#StillAWorkInProgress

“I don’t owe them anything. It’s my choice. If you don’t like it, I didn’t ask 
you to come watch. Just leave. If you’re so good at giving advice and so good 
at tennis, why aren’t you as good as me? Why aren’t you on the tour? You want 
to buy a ticket? Come watch me. You know I’m unpredictable. It’s your choice. I 
don’t owe you anything. Doesn’t affect how I sleep at night.”

Zverev said: “It was definitely a match that I did not expect was going to go 
that way. It happened to be a little easier than I expected.”

On Tuesday, Kyrgios claimed to be “bored” as he beat the world No29 Sam 
Querrey in the first round. Last year, he was fined $1500for calling the 
tournament “a circus” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/12/nick-kyrgios-code-violation-shanghai-masters>
 and criticising the “fucking surface”. Three days ago, however, he beat David 
Goffin to win the Japan Open.

Previously, he sparked criticism after apparently refusing to try at Wimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/06/nick-kyrgios-fine-wimbledon-umpire-warning>
 in 2015 in protest at receiving a code violation for swearing during his 
fourth round defeat to Richard Gasquet.
