For our fifth annual survey we have gathered our biggest panel yet: 124 judges 
from 45 countries choosing the 100 best male footballers in the world in 2016. 
Our global panel of players, coaches, broadcasters, reporters, correspondents 
and editors is headed by 11 former internationals who have won a combined total 
of 767 caps.

Names such as Hernán Crespo, Faustino Asprilla, Jan Aage Fjortoft and Javier 
Zanetti have given up their time to participate in an illustrious judging team 
which also comprises two head coaches and a wide array of broadcasting and 
journalistic talent. Many are household names in their own country.

How they made their choices

• Our judges were sent a longlist 
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i1lH0Nw0FYsObXF9tEhYwC5lxsknWNdlMjFupL8rw1w/edit#gid=3>
 of more than 350 footballers drawn from leagues on every continent and asked 
one simple question: who have been the best male players in the world in 2016?

• We asked our judges to choose 40 names each, and rank their selection in 
order from 1-40, No1 being their choice of the best male player in the world 
this year.

How the voting works

• The No1 choice of each judge was awarded 40pts, No2 given 39pts, down to 1pt 
for their No40 choice. All the votes were added together to give a raw score.

• To minimise the influence of outliers in the list, the highest score awarded 
to a player was then deducted to give a final score.


• A player needed to receive votes from at least five judges to qualify for 
the list.

• If players are level on points in the scoring, the number of individual 
votes cast is used as a tie-breaker.

• The individual voting breakdown will be published when the full list has 
been revealed.

Voting disclosure

• We are very grateful to our judges for taking part, and none have been paid 
for participating in this project.

• To allow our judges the freedom to express their opinions without fear or 
favour, individual voting records will be anonymised in the full breakdown of 
scores.

• Voters are identified only by their category and a number chosen at random. 
The judges’ numbers bear no relation whatsoever to the alphabetical list of 
judges’ names presented above.
