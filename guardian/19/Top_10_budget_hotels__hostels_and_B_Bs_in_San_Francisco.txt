Nob Hill Inn 

A turn-of-the-century Victorian hotel built after the great quake of 1906, 
this beautifully restored townhouse is located in the posh Nob Hill 
neighbourhood. The 21 guestrooms and suites have Edwardian-style antiques – 
think four-poster beds and carved wooden furniture – and rates include 
continental breakfast, plus tea and sherry in the parlour every afternoon from 
4-6pm. Although the building feels delightfully old-fashioned, the owners have 
gone to great lengths to offer contemporary amenities. Lovely suites with 
fireplaces and bay windows, sleeping four to six, are comparatively affordable 
for families.

San Remo Hotel 
 The San Remo, San Francisco 
The story behind this quaint Italianate-Victorian hotel mirrors the history of 
San Francisco itself. The great earthquake of 1906, and the massive fires that 
followed, devastated the city. The founder of Bank of America, AP Giannini, 
built this 62-room hotel during the construction boom that followed the 
disaster. The first occupants were Italian immigrants recruited to assist with 
the rebuilding effort, and the hotel has served the community ever since, 
offering multi-course Italian meals for 50 cents during the Depression and free 
accommodation to displaced victims of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. Pleasantly 
off the beaten path in a quiet North Beach neighbourhood, the San Remo 
maintains an old-world European charm: guestrooms are cosy, with brass beds and 
oak furniture, and quiet, without telephones or TVs; bathrooms are shared.

Touchstone Hotel 
 Geary Street, San Francisco Photograph: Alamy 
Reuben, blintz and matzah-ball enthusiasts – and those seeking a slice of 
old-school Americana – will love the fact that this hotel is attached to 
David's Delicatessen. The classic mid-century diner was founded by David 
Apfelbaum, a Polish-born Holocaust survivor who later dedicated himself to 
Holocaust education in San Francisco. The 42-room Touchstone Hotel is 
old-fashioned, with small, simply decorated rooms and gracious service; it's an 
ideal choice for budget-minded travellers. It's close to the city's theatre 
district, though the central location means the place is a little noisy at 
night. Union Square and a plethora of restaurants, museums and shops are steps 
away, too.

Inn on Castro 

Colourful Castro – the historic neighbourhood where the first openly gay US 
politician, Harvey Milk, fought for gay and lesbian rights in the 1970s – 
remains the happening centre of San Francisco's LGBT community. This petite B&B 
is your best budget bet, featuring eight rooms with boldly coloured walls, 
fresh flowers and modern art pieces, plus an ample breakfast and a cosy living 
room with a fireplace; save a few bucks by choosing a room with a shared bath. 
Best of all, you're steps away from Castro Street's famous dining and nightlife 
scene.

Grant Plaza Hotel
 Ignore the bedspreads and enjoy the location 
One of San Francisco's most vibrant attractions is Chinatown: the bustling 
neighbourhood is the largest of its kind outside of Asia and, dating from 1848, 
the oldest Chinatown in the US. Grant Plaza is inside its magnificent gates. 
Guest rooms are basic – this place won't win any prizes for style, especially 
with its garish bedspreads - but have TVs and free Wi-Fi. Elsewhere in the 
hotel, unexpected details remind you that you're in a historic neighbourhood, 
such as the stained-glass skylights in the top-floor lounge. Thanks to its 
fantastic location, the Grant Plaza remains a perennial pick for budget 
travellers.

Chancellor Hotel
 Contemporary bedroom at the Chancellor 
You'd never guess that this elegant boutique hotel on Union Square could offer 
prices in the budget category, but you can score a room here for $129 – 
provided you book ahead. Built in 1914 as a centrepiece of the Panama Pacific 
International Exposition of 1915, the Chancellor was the tallest building in 
San Francisco when it opened. Today, the 137-room hotel remains a classy, 
family-run affair ideally located right on the Powell Street cable car line. 
Guestrooms are compact and contemporary, with large TVs and a "pillow menu"; 
the onsite Luques Restaurant & Bar, with a nightly happy hour, stocks an 
impressive range of Californian wines.

Hotel Beresford
 Sutter Street, San Francisco. Photograph: Alamy 
Just around the corner from Union Square, this classy little hotel exudes 
old-world San Francisco charm – note the cheerful awning, polished front desk 
and chandeliers in the breakfast room. All 114 guestrooms have sweet Victorian 
decor, private baths and satellite television; not that you're likely to spend 
much time watching TV when you're staying in the heart of San Francisco. The 
continental breakfast is complimentary; just next door is the lively White 
Horse Tavern, an English-style pub that gets busy with theatregoers after 
curtain call most nights.

Herbert Hotel
 One of the junior suites at the 34-room Herbert Hotel 
Just off Union Square on the famed Powell Street cable car line, the 34-room 
Herbert Hotel is in an antique building that's undergone thorough renovations. 
Today, the interiors are crisp and minimal, though the hotel still has a 
European feel – rooms are small but functional, and only a few have private 
bathrooms. Amenities are fairly basic, but the hardwood floors and sleek lines 
appeal to design-minded travellers. Petite single rooms are ideal for solo 
travellers, and families find the double- and triple-adjoining guestrooms 
especially convenient. The Herbert Hotel's big draw is its location - the 
flipside is ongoing noise from the street.

Pacific Tradewinds Hostel

Geared towards international travellers, backpackers and solo adventurers, 
Pacific Tradewinds is all about the social atmosphere: guests come for the 
communal dinners, guided excursions, organised pub crawls and the chance to

shared bathrooms are basic, but there's 24-hour access, a well-equipped 
communal kitchen, laundry facilities, luggage storage and helpful staff to help 
you plan your urban adventures. The hostel is a short walk from Chinatown, and 
you can hop on a cable car just around the corner.
