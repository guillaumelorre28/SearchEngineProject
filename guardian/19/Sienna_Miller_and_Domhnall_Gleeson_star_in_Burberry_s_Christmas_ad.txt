Burberry <https://www.theguardian.com/business/burberrygroup> has created a 
cinematic short film celebrating a fictionalised history of its founder as this 
year’s Christmas ad.

The glossy three-minute story features a plethora of British stars 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D5IZtDCS5c> who act out a dramatic love story 
directed by Asif Kapadia, the maker of award-winning documentaries Amy and 
Senna.

Domhnall Gleeson, who has appeared in Star Wars and Harry Potter, plays Thomas 
Burberry, Sienna Miller plays his wife, Dominic West appears as Ernest 
Shackleton, the polar explorer who wore Burberry for three expeditions, and 
Lily James plays a fictional pilot based on Betty Kirby-Green, who flew from 
England to Cape Town in 1937 dressed in Burberry.

 Burberry’s Christmas ad 
Christopher Bailey, chief creative and chief executive of Burberry, said: 
“This Christmas, as we celebrate our 160th anniversary we wanted to tell the 
story of Thomas Burberry – pioneer, inventor, innovator, and the man behind the 
iconic trenchcoat – in our own words. The film we have made is a brief glimpse 
inspired by his full and extraordinary life, which threaded its way through the 
history of the 20th century in all its tumultuous highs and lows.”

Burberry is launching its ad on Wednesday across social media, and a shorter 
version will also be playing in cinemas. Stills from the film will be used in 
print and on billboards.

The luxury British brand is one of the first to launch its festive campaigns, 
with many more expected to be unveiled in the next couple of weeks.

Toy retailer The Entertainer launched its biggest ever TV campaign on 20 
October during Emmerdale and John Lewis is expected to launch its ad,which 
usually garners widespread attention

days.


Burberry’s latest ad marks a change of tone from the past two years when Romeo 
Beckham took centre stage. Last year’s ad celebrated the anniversary of the 
musical Billy Elliot with a star-studded ad featuringJames Corden
