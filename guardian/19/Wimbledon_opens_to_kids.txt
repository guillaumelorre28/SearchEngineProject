 The All England Club is opening its grass courts to children and juniors for 
the first time in an effort to produce future Wimbledon champions.

The home of Wimbledon has launched a junior coaching initiative to encourage 
children to stay in the sport and set an example to other clubs.

Britain's No1 Tim Henman said the "Road to Wimbledon initiative makes the club 
more accessible for younger players.

"If the premier club in the country is not doing anything [for juniors], then 
that is going to send out the wrong signals," he added.

"We want to change that. Some of these youngsters will witness not just what 
goes on in the [Wimbledon] champi onships but what goes on at the club 
throughout the year."

Around 1,200 local children will take part in tennis and general sport skills 
training sessions at the club and be given free coaching on most weekends, 
starting on May 12.

In addition boys and girls under-14 from the 2,400 clubs affiliated to the Lawn
Tennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Association will take part in 
singles competitions, with finals to be played at Wimbledon on August 19-24.

The All England's chairman Tim Phillips said the club wanted more children to 
take up the sport: "If we are serious about wanting young people to play 
tennis, to stay in tennis and to dream of playing at Wimbledon, we must give 
them the opportunity to turn those dreams into reality."
