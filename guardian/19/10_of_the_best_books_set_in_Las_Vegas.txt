Heart of the American Dream

, 1972

An eccentric journalist and his lawyer travel to the Las Vegas of the 
psychedelic 60s in this legendary novel/memoir.

"Saturday midnight … Memories of this night are extremely hazy. All I have, 
for guide-pegs, is a pocketful of keno cards and cocktail napkins, all covered 
with scribbled notes. Here is one: 'Get the Ford man, demand a Bronco for 
race-observation purposes … photos? … Lacerda/call … why not a helicopter? … 
Get on the phone, lean on the fuckers … heaving yelling.'

"Another says: 'Sign on Paradise Boulevard- "Stopless and Topless" … 
bush-league sex compared to LA; pasties here – total naked public humping in LA 
… Las Vegas is a society of armed masturbator/gambling is the kicker here/sex 
is extra/weird trip for high rollers … house-whores for winners, hand jobs for 
the bad luck crowd."

edited Mike Tronnes

This eclectic compendium of writers on Las Vegas includes Tom Wolfe's famous

"He had been rolling up and down the incredible electric-sign gauntlet of Las 
Vegas' Strip, US Route 91, where the neon and the par lamps – bubbling, 
spiraling, rocketing, and exploding in sunbursts 10 stories high out in the 
middle of the desert – celebrate one-story casinos. He had been gambling and 
drinking and eating now and again at the buffet tables the casinos keep heaped 
with food day and night, but mostly hopping himself up with good old 
amphetamine, cooling himself down with meprobamate, then hooking down more 
alcohol, until now, after 60 hours, he was slipping into the symptoms of toxic 
schizophrenia."

Dave Hickey, Air Guitar: Essays on Art & Democracy 
<http://www.amazon.com/Air-Guitar-Essays-Art-Democracy/dp/0963726455>, 1997

The Nevadan art historian and Vegas resident has written a fascinating memoir. 
Here an excerpt from his essay, A Rhinestone as Big as the Ritz about the 
Liberace Museum.
 Air Guitar: Essays on Art & Democracy 
"The balcony of my apartment faces west toward the mountains, overlooking the 
Las Vegas Strip; so, every evening when the sky is not overcast, a few minutes 
after the sun has gone down, the mountains turn black, the sky above them turns 
this radical plum/rouge, and the neon logos of The Desert Inn, The Stardust, 
Circus Circus, The Riviera, The Las Vegas Hilton, and Vegas World blaze forth 
against the black mountains – and every night I find myself struck by the fact 
that, while The Strip always glitters with a reckless and undeniable 
specificity against the darkness, the sunset, smoldering out above the 
mountains, every night and without exception, looks bogus as hell. It's 
spectacular, of course, and even, occasionally, sublime (if you like sublime), 
but to my eyes that sunset is always fake – as flat and gaudy as Barnett Newman 
and just as pretentious. Friends of mine who visit watch this light show with 
different eyes, they prefer the page of the landscape to the text of the neon. 
They seem to think it's more 'authentic'. I, on the other hand, suspect that 
'authenticity' is altogether elsewhere – that they are responding to nature's 
ability to mimic the sincerity of a painting, that the question of the sunset 
and The Strip is more a matter of one's taste in duplicity. One either prefers 
the honest fakery of the neon or the fake honesty of the sunset – the 
undisguised artifice of culture or the cultural construction of 'authenticity' 
– the genuine rhinestone, finally, or the imitation pearl."

Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour, Learning from Las 
Vegas: The Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Las-Vegas-Forgotten-Architectural/dp/026272006X>
, 1972

Now seen as a bible for postmodernist architecture, Venturi's seminal book saw 
the urban sprawl of Las Vegas as an architecture of communication over space, 
achieved through style and signs.
 Learning from Las Vegas 
"The sign for the Motel Monticello, a silhouette of an enormous Chippendale 
highboy, is visible on the highway before the motel itself. This architecture 
of styles and signs is anti-spacial; it is the architecture of communication 
over space; communication dominates space as an element in the architecture in 
the landscape. But it is for a new scale of landscape."

, 1990


This searing novel of alcohol, obsession and suicide became an award-winning 
film starring Nicholas Cage.
 Leaving Las Vegas 
"Casinos … know that chips are a wonderful, pretty tool, and possess none of 
the stigma of dollars. Dollars translate too easily into hours or houses or 
cars or sex or food or everything, and so losing a dollar is a much more 
tangible experience than parting with a chip, an object that looks more like a 
midway consolation token than a medium of exchange."

Joe McGinniss Jr, The Delivery Man 
<http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk:80/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781843547310>
, 2008

An electric debut novel about Generation Y, set against the real lives and 
suburbs and gated communities of today's Las Vegas.
 The Delivery Man 
"Even though it's only May it feels like the end of July. (Minutes ago the 
temperature reading on the Sahara marquee read 96 degrees.) And it all lies 
before him: 21 stories below is the Garden of Earthly Delights dotted with 
clear blue rectangular pools and burgundy cabanas, and then it's the Strip and 
then the pink homes of Green Valley and the surrounding desert and the I-15 
that leads to Los Angeles where Chase's father still lives."

Larry McMurtry, The Desert Rose 
<http://www.amazon.com/Desert-Rose-Novel-Larry-McMurtry/dp/0684853841>, 1983

From the Pulitzer-prize winning author comes the compelling story of Harmony, 
an ageing Las Vegas showgirl, in a novel that is both tough and tender.
 The Desert Rose 
"When she turned off the pavement onto the bumpy dirt road Harmony looked back 
at the Strip, eight miles away. It looked so miniature, like a wonderful toy 
place, with all the lights still on … It was one of her favourite things, to 
turn onto her own road with the air smelling so good and be able to see the 
Strip, with the Trop up at one end and the Sahara at the other, and besides 
that have the sun coming up just as she got home. With sights like that to see 
every day, who could complain?"

, 2008

A mesmerising novel that has been compared to Jonathan Franzen's The 
Corrections <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corrections>, as it brings 
together the lives of those who live, love and work in a city, as corrupt as it 
is compelling.
 Beautiful Children 
"Waves of electricity, emanating from pop art facades, actually transforming 
the nature of the atmosphere, creating a mutation of night, a night that is not 
night – daytime at night,"he writes. 

"The 24-hour bacchanal. The party without limits. The crown jewel of a country 
that has institutionalized indulgence.

"… 105 outside for the 99th straight day. That dry desert heat, a wall that 
hit the moment you stepped outside, then pounded relentlessly. To get local 
fanboys away from their liquid crystal screens, out of their air-conditioned 
living rooms, and into their air-conditioned cars, management at Amazin' 
Stories had been importing the biggest names in the fantasy game."

James Ellroy, The Cold Six Thousand 
<http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk:80/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099537830>
, 2001

From Kennedy's assassination in Dallas to crime and punishment in Las Vegas, 
the epic and magisterial sequel to Ellroy's American Tabloid.
 The Cold Six Thousand 
"Vegas sparkled – fuck death – should-haves meant shit. Nice breeze/nice 
sun/nice casinos. Pete crossed the Strip. Pete logged distractions: The 
Tropicana course. Cocktail carts abundant. Carhops on skates. Uplift abundant. 
Pete made two circuits. Shit popped out. Some nuns hit the Sands. They spot 
Frank Sinatra. They swoon and piss Frank off. They shuitz up his Sy Devore suit 
… Nice mountain. Neon signs. Jap-tourist shutterbugs."

Various writers, Fade, Sag, Crumble <http://fadesagcrumble.com/>, 2011

Las Vegas writers confront the decay, physical and spiritual, at the heart of 
today's city in a book specially published for this year's Vegas Valley Book 
Festival. Here we discover The Neon Museum in Danielle Kelly's essay Live Rust: 
Love, Mold, and Heavy Metal in the Neon Boneyard:
 Fade, Sag, Crumble, 
"The Neon Museum and Boneyard has spent 15 years preserving the neon 
vernacular of Las Vegas. The Museum collection holds more than 150 signs, but 
fewer than one tenth of those signs are restored. The rest sit unelectrified in 
the Neon Boneyard. The condition of some is impeccable, and a few are on the 
brink of collapse, but most exist somewhere in between. Each has a beautifully 
disproportionate combination of elegant tubing hugging exposed metal, with 
unevenly corroding paint and the occasional rusted corner. Some wear the scars 
of decades of labour and occasional abuse, are partially crushed or 
dismembered. A pathway has been plotted in and around the signs, which tend to 
veer, all angles and abstracts, into the path as they see fit. It's like a 
grand promenade through a rusty Roman ruin.

"Thousands flock every year to capture a snapshot of this fallen neon. They 
bear witness to the itchy peeling paint and the scratchy broken tubing. They 
take pictures of glass. The harsh desert sun refracting through an incandescent 
bulb casts an inverted shadow of thin circles … The Stardust is there, the 
Desert Inn and the Sahara, the Tropicana and the Aladdin. There are signs that 
only natives or long-timers might recognize: Society Cleaners, Steiner's 
Cleaners, Ugly Duckling Car Sales, and the Green Shack."
