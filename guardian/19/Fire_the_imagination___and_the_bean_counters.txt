In your report on IPPR’s analysis of the challenges facing Britain in the 
2020s you rightly highlight some of the more alarming trends (UK in 2030, 29 
December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/29/uk-in-2030-older-more-unequal-and-blighted-by-brexit-report-predicts>
). But the report’s argument is that these trends are likely, but not 
inevitable. As a society there is little we can do about an ageing population 
or the growth of Asian economies, but there is everything we can do about 
rising inequality, pressures on health and social care services and the loss of 
jobs from automation. There are public policies which can meet these challenges 
if our democracy can summon the imagination and ambition to choose them.

Over the next two years the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice will be 
seeking to show how this can be done.

• Larry Elliott, your Economics Editor, suggests that one explanation for the 
UK’s deterioration in productivity is the shrinkage of the financial sector (
Economics, 26 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/25/what-is-productivity-why-uk-poor>
). I contend that the financialisation of our economy is a root cause of our 
productivity malaise. Consider, for example, that the UK has some 586,000 
members of the major accounting bodies, more than the rest of the European 
Union put together (France and Germany each have roughly 34,000). My 
imagination has failed me in identifying how bean-counting to such a degree 
benefits productivity. Suggestions welcomed.
