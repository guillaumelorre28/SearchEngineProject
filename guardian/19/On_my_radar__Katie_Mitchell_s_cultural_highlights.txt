very funny’. Photograph: Susannah Wimberley, Courtesy the artist and Frith 
Street Gallery, London 
Tacita Dean <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tacita-dean> was 
commissioned to make a piece of work that looked at the relationship between 
theatre and visual art, so she made this fantastic film with the actor Stephen 
Dillane, who does a whole rainbow of different types of performing. They’re in 
a bit of a tussle – he challenges her views of what theatre is, what art is – 
and in their argument about the differences between their two fields they come 
up with this third thing, which is absolutely beautiful and very funny. It’s 
nearly an hour long but is more at home in an art gallery than a cinema – I saw 
it at Tate Modern. It made me reframe what I do in the theatre in a really 
exciting way.

 Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley: tackles important subjects rarely seen on 
TV. Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBC/PA 
This is one heck of an exquisite cultural event. The whole series is carried 
by two middle-aged sisters, one of whom is a police detective, the other a 
recovering alcoholic. It has all the wonderful twists and turns of a great 
crime thriller series, but also unexpected and beautiful details about women’s 
lives. It’s just amazing to see a TV programme carried by middle-aged women who 
are preoccupied not so much with appearance but (particularly one of them) with 
being proper, decent and moral, the complexity of that, and the complexity of 
being a working mum and grandmum. These are really important subjects that you 
very rarely see on TV. The second series, which just ended, was breathtakingly 
good.

 ‘A gorgeous piece of work’: Linda Bassett, Deborah Findlay, Kika Markham and 
June Watson in Caryl Churchill’s Escaped Alone. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for 
the Guardian 
This is the latest Caryl Churchill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/carylchurchill> play, which has just ended 
at the Royal Court. Again, it’s really important from a feminist point of view 
– you can see my preoccupation, can’t you? It’s a very strong political play 
with an unexpected setting: a back garden somewhere in the south of England 
where four women are ostensibly having a nice chat but are actually terrified 
for various reasons, about existence and the future. It’s a gorgeous piece of 
work, up there with Churchill’s best in terms of formal experimentation and 
political content. The performances were remarkable. There aren’t many roles 
for women in their 60s and 70s in the theatre and it was wonderful to see these 
women [including Linda Bassett and Kika Markham] performing at the height of 
their talent and skill.

 Karen Fergusson as the young Janet Frame in An Angel at My Table: ‘a very, 
beautiful, moving story’. Photograph: Ronald Grant 
This film involves two fantastic women: it’s Jane Campion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/19/fiction5>’s adaptation of the 
autobiography of New Zealand authorJanet Frame 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/30/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries>
. In her early teens, Frame is misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and ends up in 
various mental institutions undergoing unbelievably awful treatment, including 
electroconvulsive therapy. They are just about to do a lobotomy when her first 
book,The Lagoon and Other Stories, which she wrote in secret, is published to 
great acclaim. It’s a very beautiful, moving story and I’m ashamed that I’d 
never seen the film before. Now I’m reading all of Frame’s books – I’ve just 
finished her first novel,Owls Do Cry.

The Bookshop by Penelope Fitzgerald 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/penelope-fitzgerald> 

Here’s something else I should have done a long time ago. The composer George 
Benjamin <https://www.theguardian.com/music/george-benjamin>, who I’ve been 
working with, told me I must read Penelope Fitzgerald, so I’ve just finished
Offshore and The Bookshop <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/bookshop.html>. 
Fitzgerald is such an important writer, with an outsider eye.The Bookshop is a 
very quiet novel. It’s about a woman who tries to set up a bookshop in East 
Anglia and fails gloriously. I liked the slow, enormous ambition of this very 
discreet woman in a very conservative landscape – she’s in the wrong place at 
the wrong time but goes through with it anyway. It’s much weirder than it 
sounds – there are ghosts and things like that. I loved it.

 Martha Argerich: ‘warmer and more lyrical than Glenn Gould’. Photograph: 
CAP/NFS/Capital Pictures 
I’m looking forward to watching this film 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/video/2015/may/01/watch-a-clip-from-argerich-stephanie-argerichs-film-pianist-mother-video>
 about the great Argentinian pianist Martha Argerich, directed by her daughter 
Stéphanie. It looks at a mother-daughter relationship where the mother is 
travelling all around the world playing concerts. It taps into a fear of mine, 
because I do worry about my daughter staying here while I travel around the 
world for work. Argerich is a majorly important interpreter of composers such as
Bach <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mFDXNODNyc&nohtml5=False> and Chopin 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCSEwfqs-VM>. She’s warmer and more lyrical 
than Glenn Gould, but has the razor precision necessary to play Bach (though of 
course she can play everything). The film looks absolutely beautiful.
