The pair, reported to be foreign students, were part of an official stadium 
tour on the eve of the match, but managed to cut away from the group and stay 
at the ground.

The fans were found during a routine security sweep at Old Trafford, being 
caught by one of the pre-match check measures. Police decided not to arrest the 
duo and United are investigating how the supporters managed to evade detection.

A club spokesman said: “We realise people will go to any lengths to watch a 
game at Old Trafford but these people went too far. The fact that they and 
their belongings had been searched before entry means we are confident there 
was no risk to safety.”

United were the subject of a high-profile security breach in May, when the 
season finale with Bournemouth was postponed due to a bomb scare. The stadium 
was evacuated after the discovery of what proved to be a fake bomb, left behind 
following a security training exercise, sparked a safety alert.
