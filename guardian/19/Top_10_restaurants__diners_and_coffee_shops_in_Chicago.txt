Superdawg

No ketchup. That's the first commandment of a Chicago-style hotdog, served in 
all its relish-and-sport-pepper-topped glory at this historic drive-in hotdog 
stand. Order through a call box and a friendly server whisks your "dog" – and 
milkshake and fries – out to your car. Before you drive away, snap a picture of 
the vintage hotdog figures perched atop the restaurant.

For a proper taste of the midwest, snag a table for lunch, dinner or the 
super-popular brunch service at chef-owner Jason Hammel's laidback temple to 
local and seasonal cuisine. While the ingredients come from nearby farms, 
global flavours keep the menu interesting. Expect a hip crowd as eclectic as 
the menu.

<http://lulacafe.com/>. Open 9am-2pm, closed Tuesday. Mains $9-$29

Little Goat Bread
 Little Goat Bread, Chicago 
A winner of TV show "Top Chef <http://www.bravotv.com/top-chef>", Stephanie 
Izard <http://www.stephanieizard.com/> remains one of the city's hottest 
restaurateurs … but good luck getting a reservation to her 
booked-three-months-out restaurantGirl & The Goat 
<http://www.girlandthegoat.com/>. You'll have better luck at Little Goat Bread,

The Doughnut Vault
 Doughnut Vault 
The early bird gets the doughnuts at this to-go-only window in River North. 
Lines are manageable during the week, but can stretch for an hour on weekend 
mornings – but don't worry, the wait is justified once you bite into the crisp, 
perfectly-frosted Old Fashioned cocktail. Oh, and it's best to stock up on 
seasonal flavours, too, since you've probably worked up an appetite.

<http://thedoughnutvault.tumblr.com/>. Open Tues-Fri 8am until sold out; Sat 
9.30am until sold out. Doughnuts $2-$3

Avec
 Avec, Chicago 
Before the city was head-over-heels for small plates, Avec introduced 
shareable, seasonal dishes, communal seating and an esoteric wine list. Truly, 
Chicago's never been the same. A decade later, this chic but casual 
no-reservations restaurant is as popular as ever, with awards for food and 
innovative design under its belt.
• 615 West Randolph Street, +1 312 377 2002, avecrestaurant.com 
<http://avecrestaurant.com/>. Open Mon-Thurs 3.30pm-midnight, Fri-Sat

Cemitas Puebla
 Cemitas Puebla 
A sandwich worth a 45-minute bus ride from downtown? That's exactly what's 
cooking at this bare-bones sandwich spot, where the namesake cemitas rolls – 
crispy and sesame seed-studded on the outside, soft on the interior – barely 
contain the onslaught of fillings such as pork Milanesa andcarne asada. Your 
best bet is the Atomica, a diet-annihilating trio of pork Milanesa, carne 
enchilada and ham.
• 3619 West North Avenue, +1 773 772 8435, cemitaspuebla.com 
<http://www.cemitaspuebla.com/>. Open daily 11am-9pm. Cemitas $6.50-$9

Ruxbin
 Ruxbin, Chicago 
Ruxbin's team serves whimsical and funky food in one of the smallest dining 
rooms in the city. The team are serious about solid flavours: there's Asian 
inspiration, midwest ingredients and a range of other influences on the 
constantly changing menu at one of the city's best-loved BYOs (bring your own 
alcohol). Come early, though, since reservations are only accepted on Sundays.

Bang Bang Pie Shop

Light wood, brightly coloured chairs and a charming, shady patio all 
contribute to make Bang Bang a cosy bakery worthy of multipleInstagrams 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram>. But yes, you're here for the pie, 
available in daily rotating flavours by the slice or whole pie. Don't neglect 
the house-roasted coffee or the dense, melt-in-your-mouth buttery biscuits.

Three Aces
 Three Acres 
Punk rock. Seasonal, Italian-leaning bar food. Weekday brunch. An Elvis 
pinball machine. Somehow, this odd mix of rock and refinement suits this Little 
Italy bar that's quickly become an under-the-radar favourite. During the 
summer, there are few spots better than Three Aces' picnic table-dotted parking 
lot patio for bourbon, a burger and sunshine.
• 1321 West Taylor Street, +1 312 243 1577, threeaceschicago.com 
<http://threeaceschicago.com/>. Open Sun-Fri 11am-2am, Saturday 11am-3am. Mains 
$12-$26

The Bento Box
 The Bento Box, Chicago 
This off-the-beaten path matchbox of a restaurant is the sort of place that 
defines "neighbourhood restaurant". A limited-but-tight chalkboard menu of 
mostly Asian-leaning dishes such as Korean fried chicken and beef bulgogi 
changes often, but the friendly service and BYO policy is consistent.
• 2246 West Armitage Avenue, +1 773 278 3932, artisancateringchicago.com/Box 
<http://www.artisancateringchicago.com/Box.html>. Open Wed-Thurs 5.30pm-9pm,
