Although the patties are small, ranging in size from a 10c piece to a $5 note, 
Maritime Safety Queensland is not taking any chances.

The state’s environment minister, Steven Miles, said no wildlife appeared to 
be affected by the spill and the clean-up should minimise any environmental 
impacts.

A list of ships known to have been in the area is being compiled.

In July 2015 10 to 15 tonnes of oil was spilled off Cape Upstart on Fraser, 
which is the world’s largest sand island.

Maximum fines for a discharge offence can reach up to $11.78m under Queensland 
law, and $17m under federal law.
