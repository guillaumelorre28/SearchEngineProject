Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have completed 
the signing of QPR striker Charlie Austin in a cut-price £4m deal.

The 26-year-old was one of the stars of last season, but his 18-goal haul in 
his maiden top-flight season

 was not enough to help the west London club retain their Premier League status.

Austin had been widely expected to leave Loftus Road at the end of last 
season, but remained after QPR stood firm on their £15m valuation of the 
forward, whose contract was due to expire at the end of this season. However,QPR
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> this week accepted what is 
understood to be a £4m fee for the striker, which was announced by the south 
coast club on Saturday lunchtime.

Austin, who was called up by England for the first time at the end of last 
season, has signed a four-and-a-half-year deal at St Mary’s. “I’m delighted to 
have got it over the line so soon into January,” he said. “I can’t wait to get 
started now.

“As soon as Southampton showed an interest, that was the one club I wanted to 
go to. You see the progression from when I was playing against Southampton for 
Swindon. For me, it was important to come to a club that’s on the up and that’s 
what I’ve got here.

“I think the last five years have shown the ambition the club has and I just 
want to be part of that now. I’m delighted to join forces and hopefully bring 
my quality into a team with a lot of quality players already here. I can’t wait 
to meet the lads and show them what I can do on the pitch.”

Austin, a former bricklayer, has only been in the professional game since 
2009, when his fine form with Wessex League part-timers Poole Town earned a 
move to Swindon. The striker continued to find the net and moved on to Burnley 
before then joining QPR, where he became a fans’ favourite with 48 goals in 89 
appearances.

Austin, who has been out for the past month with a hamstring complaint, has 
scored 10 goals in 16 appearances this term and leaves Loftus Road with the QPR 
director of football Les Ferdinand’s best wishes. “It’s no secret that Charlie 
is out of contract in the summer so this is a decision made in the best 
financial interests of the club,” he said.

“Charlie has had a significant impact on this football club in his time here 
and we are hugely grateful to him for his contribution during his spell with 
us. Whilst we are sorry to lose Charlie, once he expressed an interest in 
moving to Southampton, we could not stand in his way.”
