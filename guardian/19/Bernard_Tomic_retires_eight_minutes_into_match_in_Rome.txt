Bernard Tomic’s French Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/frenchopen> 
preparations are in disarray after the Australian retired from his Rome 
International first round clash after just eight minutes due to illness.


Tomic who was heavily criticised by world No1 Novak Djokovic

 after appearing to give up when facing three match points at the Madrid Open 
last week, led Benoît Paire 2-1 when he stunned the crowd and his opponent by 
conceding the match to the Frenchman following a short consultation with a 
doctor during a medical time out.

“I was feeling bad all night,” Tomic said. “I couldn’t play with the heat. I 
felt so, so bad and I felt like I was going to collapse. It was the best thing 
for me to do to retire. ... The main thing is to get it out of my system.”

It is the latest setback for the Queenslander who now has crashed out at the 
first hurdle in his last three competitions.


Not for the first time in his career, he was accused of tanking in Madrid

 after turning his racket the wrong way to face a serve from Fabio Fangini when 
trying to save the match.


Tomic is not currently not slated to play in any further ATP events before the 
French Open gets underway at Roland Garros on 17 May and has only won a single 
set in his last four matches on clay.
