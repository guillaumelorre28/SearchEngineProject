The Glory, Haggerston

In deepest, darkest “Faggerston” lies the jewel of east London’s late-night 
alt-drag-queer-party-performance-disco world. The Glory is co-owned and run by 
the Bert and Ernie of drag, Jonny Woo and John Sizzle. Upstairs it’s Cheers 
meets queers, an East End boozer where everyone knows your name and your Grindr 
profile, and downstairs there’s banquette seating, arty performance and even 
some plays. We love performing here, it’s relaxed, it’s intimate, it’s loud, 
it’s our place to play and experiment. Shows happen through the week, with 
late-night performances from midnight at the weekend. If you’re looking for the 
most exciting and progressive mix of drag kings, queens, performance art and 
comedy, this is the place.

Soho has undergone so many facelifts in recent years, it has begun to take on 
traits of the ageing celebrity: plastic, shiny, hard to find the personality. 
So thank goddess for Soho Theatre, which has been bringing weirdos like us to 
Dean Street since 2000 and now stands as one of the few places to see 
first-rate comedy and cabaret in the capital. Its three venues sit on top of 
each other: a studio space above, a theatre in the middle and, down in the 
basement, a cabaret space – where we can usually be found. Late shows in the 
cabaret space start at 9.30pm, with a piano bar running afterwards on most 
Friday nights. Come for the shows, stay for the prosecco, leave when security 
force you to.

Pink 
Step off Bethnal Green Road past a tapas restaurant and a church converted 
into “luxury flats” and you wouldn’t expect to find a traditional working men’s 
club. It’s a proper sticky-carpeted, plastic cups of wine, regulars of 80-plus 
kind of club. And, with a balance of new east London nights mixed in with its 
regular activities, it’s thriving. We first attended a night called Britain’s 
Next Top Tranny, hosted by drag queen Fabulous Russella about 10 years ago. The 
contrast of what we saw on stage versus what we saw around the venue was 
magical. The nostalgia, and sensory overload, that a traditional working men’s 
club with heart and soul makes it, in our opinion, London’s best late-night 
performance venue. Warren and Charlotte, who run things, always support the 
newest, weirdest, most wonderful talents and nights. The making of our dress-up 
party Sink The Pink came from their trust and support when we were just two 
over-excited kids with a bag of wigs. From the long-standing regular night 
Coney Island (where dressing up to various classic movies is encouraged, music 
is themed accordingly and hotdog eating competitions are standard) to The 
Virgin Xtravaganzah and her variety show of the best of London’s alternative 
cabaret scene to the popular Disco 54 night, there’s something for everyone. 
London is so lucky to have the BGWMC.

Soho Burlesque Club – at the Hippodrome Casino – is a properly late-night 
cabaret experience. The show starts at 11pm and you’ll often see red-faced 
showgirls running across Leicester Square from earlier shows that didn’t run to 
time (me, every single week). Not only is what is happening on stage pretty 
glamorous, but the audience is often full of post-show cabaret performers 
letting their hair down. If you want to watch cabaret’s great and good 
consuming one too many glasses of prosecco, Saturday night at the Soho 
Burlesque Club is the place to go. And being in a casino lacking in natural 
light and time-telling devices, means that everybody stays out far too late. I 
once stayed out drinking there with burlesque superstar Dirty Martini until the 
early hours of the morning. I went upstairs to grab my bag so I could head 
home, sat on the very comfortable sofa in the dressing room and accidentally 
fell asleep. I was woken by the cleaners at lunchtime the next day.

Circus is really more of a dinner venue and it has fabulous pop-up 
entertainment until 11.30pm, but then the tables are pushed backto make the 
restaurant into a club, which is open until about 2am. The main feature is a 
huge marble table that doubles as a stage: people can sit down at it and enjoy 
their meal, but between courses the plates are cleared and you can see 
world-class acrobats spinning above your head from hoops suspended from the 
vaulted glass ceilings. You could findLe Gateau Chocolat 
<http://legateauchocolat.com/about/> high kicking along the table or, one time 
for a Circus birthday party, the management had a ramp built and I rode a tiny 
motorbike up it. It often gets travelling performers in, so you can see the 
likes of the Briefs cast up close and personal. The menu has to be the best 
food I’ve had at a cabaret show and its cocktail menu is to die for! I’d 
recommend the black angus fillet with this amazing caramel soy sauce and the 
lobster with white truffle aioli, washed down with a Carousel – a cocktail 
served with alcoholic cotton candy.

 The Leviathon Show at Hackney Showroom. Photograph: Ambra Vernuccio 
Hackney Showroom is a DIY space that hosts cabaret, live art, variety, circus 
and performances: from Lasana Shabazz, Plains Plough, and theDisco Loco festival
 <https://www.facebook.com/discolocouk> to weird bits of drag. What I love 
about the place is that 10 years ago when I started out on the scene there were 
a lot of places like that about, when you didn’t have to work so hard to find a 
space to set up a show. Hackney Showroom is doing this at a time when venue 
space is scarce and prices are high. It’s a 70s queer utopia, like back when 
they were first thinking about how to create spaces like this, but Sam and Nina 
have come along and done it. You can go anytime and find queer and drag shows 
and emerging artists from Hackney. The crowd is mixed, you get the usual bunch 
who go to the all the drag and cabaret shows, but they also do £1 tickets for 
people on the local estate. It doesn’t have regular nights, so you have to 
check what’s on before you go. But you can always get cheap beer, which I love, 
hot patties and delicious ice-cream. I like that it’s a bit of a knees up – you 
can get your tea, then see a show.

Unfortunately, queer spaces are disappearing in London, but one place that is 
still standing and remains the lynchpin of the scene is the Royal Vauxhall 
Tavern. Every Saturday I go to Duckie. I’ve seen every type of performance you 
can imagine on that stage. Duckie programmes the most innovative live artists. 
I’ve watched go-go dancers, opera singers, drag kings, a sexualised 
re-imagining of the Nativity by Lucy McCormick, and this summer I finally got 
to perform on it too. I was part of Duckie Homosexualist Summer School and I 
got to MC our showcase as a terrifying buffoon called the Matron – dressed head 
to toe in leather, a huge tumour bottom, a mop for a head and eight-inch high 
heels – shouting and swearing at the Duckie audience; an audience of drag 
kings, queens, students, regulars and people who hadno idea what to expect. It 
was fantastic. I would not usually feel confident enough to try that sort of 
comedy character at other venues, but at Duckie difference is embraced. It’s 
all about inclusiveness. I’m now about to launch a comedy night as the Matron 
at new queer space Her Upstairs in Camden. I wouldn’t have had the opportunity 
to, or confidence to, if it hadn’t been for Duckie.

When I first moved to London I was desperate to start a comedy night here. A 
chance encounter walking home one night caused me to end up in Paper Dress 
Vintage. It’s a boutique vintage dress shop and cocktail bar and is what Miss 
Haversham’s house might have looked like if she’d been brought up in the 1960s 
and had better social skills. A conversation with the barmaid and two emails 
later PDV became the home of the Secret Comedians (2012-15) and my late-night 
go to. The owners Steve and Hannah book an eclectic mix of music, burlesque and 
comedy and you can guarantee something off the wall will be on. At its 
Shoreditch address, the performances would take place in the shop window. The 
acts would perform amid the mannequins and vintage gowns and audiences would 
spill out onto the street. It was all about experimentation and doing something 
different -the Story Beast 
<https://twitter.com/thestorybeast?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor>
 hosted a seance, Spencer Jones used the mannequins for a set piece, another 
comedian re-enacted the lives of the Brontë sisters using the old wedding 
dresses hanging from the ceiling. The venue has since moved to Hackney Wick and 
now has its own Twin Peaks performance space upstairs that still hosts loads of 
comedy.

The Box is a real experience, with its diverse, high-end and eclectic erotic 
entertainment. But with an A-List clientele and an exclusive guestlist be sure 
to wear your most interesting and most alluring attire if you want to get in. 
People go there to paint the town a very dark shade of red (they don’t go here 
to let loose – they go bat-shit crazy) and to be shocked and amazed by the 
intimate dancers, the beautiful staircases and the dimly lit, DJ-dominated 
dancefloor. The night will then take a turn and feature an incredibly powerful 
singer on one side of the room, followed by an airborne dancer on the other, 
and end with a performance.

The White Swan, Limehouse
 Photograph: White Swan Pub 
Limehouse’s gay micro-scene is a bit of a timewarp: snooker at the Old Ship, 
pie atthe Grapes <http://www.thegrapes.co.uk/> (Ian McKellen’s pub), a dip at 
Sailor’s Sauna <http://www.sailorssauna.com/> and then the White Swan, which is 
open until 5am on weekends. Michael Barrymore came out, on stage, there in 1995 
– I was a child in Melton Mowbray and can still remember my mum gasping at the 
telly! It’s a corner pub that used to have a large outdoor beer garden and 
notorious toilets. It had blacked-out windows back when policemen did raids. 
Now it’s been cut in half: one half is a tacky lap-dancing club with security 
men, and the other half is a gay club with an astonishing mock art deco 
interior reminiscent of an arcade on a drive-on ferry – the handful of lorry 
drivers included. Resident drag queen Saucy Sophie has hosted every week for 
more than 30 years; she’s like a living Cindy Sherman masterpiece and her dream 
is to live in Gran Canaria. Sophie’s one-liners arefatal. I once took an older 
ex there and she asked on the mike if it was a cast reunion for Last of the 
Summer Wine. Another time I kissed this boy wearing flip-flops, and she said 
his toenails looked like quavers. Amateur Strip Contest there is achingly funny 
too.
