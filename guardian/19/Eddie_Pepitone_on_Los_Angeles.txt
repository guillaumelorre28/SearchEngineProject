LA is a hard city to accept reality in. If you suffer a personal setback or an 
illness, you think, “How can I be sick in this gorgeous setting?” I had to move 
from Santa Monica, on the beach, because I wasn’t getting any work done. I just 
wanted to sit by the ocean and look at the sunsets.

 Eddie Pepitone is comefortable being a teetotal, vegan comedian in a city of 
excess 
It’s really hard to sit inside and watch Alfred Hitchock’s Psycho when it is 
constantly blaringly sunny outside. I know people who tape their windows with 
canvas bags to keep out the light, so they can pretend it’s overcast.

It’s like being on a set in The Truman Show, where everything is fake. The 
city exists in a white, bright landscape. I often wish for clouds so I can call 
the day a wash and sit inside. My wife loves it when it is overcast: we are 
like, “Oh my god honey, look – clouds!”

There are so many people writing screenplays in LA coffee shops. My friend 
used to say if you finish your second act here you should get your second 
coffee free. There is a beautiful independent coffee shop calledMarie et Cie 
<http://cafemarieetcie.com/> not far from me in Valley Village.

Being a non-drinker in a city of excess makes me feel a bit like I can’t 
really be part of the nightlife, but I’m comfortable with it. There are a lot 
of people who have quit, so I hang out with those people instead.

 The Iliad Bookshop 
The Iliad Bookshop <http://www.iliadbooks.com/> in North Hollywood is a 
mellow, beautiful place.It has been there a long time and has all these old 
Hollywood books. The owner always has a couple of cats in there, too.Nerdmelt 
<http://nerdmeltla.com/> is a comic book store on Sunset Boulevard with comedy 
shows in the back. Go on a Thursday to see Dana Gould or Arden Myrin. At the 
weekend you get more casual comedy fans; the real die-hard fans go during the 
week.

The LA comedy scene is really vibrant. People come from all over the country 
to get into film and TV, so you perform with famous comedians and very good, 
very driven younger ones.Largo <http://www.largo-la.com/> is a big venue, but 
lots of smaller places are sprouting up.

A perfect day in LA is when I don’t have to get in a car. I moved here from 
New York but I never expected the traffic to be so intense. I was also 
surprised to realise that even though it seems big and sprawling, it’s made up 
of all these little neighbourhoods. You see people with their kids and dogs, up 
against all this huge impersonal traffic.

Most people here are trying to be something else. I walk my dog in this dog 
park and three out of five people I meet are saying: “I have a script. Can you 
get it to one of your friends?” I’m like, “I’m just trying to walk my dog!”

Griffith Park is a huge state park with a hiking trail up to the Hollywood 
sign.The whole town is about chasing fame and fortune, but meanwhile we’re just 
trying to relax on this hiking trail. I love the great views of the city from 
here – it’s always beautiful at night.
 Vegan-friendly Hugo’s Tacos 
LA is in the middle of a horrible drought, yet everybody is still watering 
their lawns. They’ve actually said there’s only a year’s worth of water left, 
and no one, not even the governor, takes it seriously. It’s one of my pet 
peeves about the city. That and the unchanging canvas of the sun.

LA has all these great restaurants in places you’d never expect. In New York 
the restaurants are pretty well known but here they are tucked away. I met one 
guy who keeps a little black book of all the little restaurants he’s found.

 Sage Organic Bistro 
Hugo’s Tacos <http://www.hugostacos.com/> in Valley Village is a great 
vegan-friendly restaurant. My wife and I are now vegan, and the city as a whole 
caters well for us. Even in regular restaurants I’m noticing more and more 
vegan options. Some places are all vegan, likeSage 
<http://www.sageveganbistro.com/> in Echo Park, and we also love this Indian 
place calledGangadin <http://www.order.gangadin.com/> in Studio City.

You have to be tough to live in LA. There are so many people who’ve been in a 
pilot but then the pilot fails and the show disappears. It is hard to insult 
people out here: everyone has such a deep sense of humour about it all.
