The Mid

Given Chicago's history of electronic music, it's no surprise that a venue 
like The Mid would carry that energy over to a new generation of clubgoers. 
Since opening in 2010, the near-downtown club has quickly connected with a 
young crowd, with headliners both established and emerging, includingSkrillex 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeNSzJ2-Jw>, Green Velvet, Afrojack 
<http://www.afrojack.com/>, Avicii, James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, Richie 
Hawtin,Knife Party <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-IWRmpefzE> and more.

Metro
 Metro, Chicago 
When it comes to Chicago's live music venues, perhaps no room has been 
mythologised quite like Metro. Just north of the Chicago Cubs' Wrigley Field 
ballpark, Metro has seen countless musical legends grace its stage, from Bob 
Dylan to James Brown, Prince to Nirvana, and hosted the first live appearance 
of the Smashing Pumpkins as a four-piece, back in 1988. In 2012, the 
1,150-capacity club marked its 30th anniversary with sets byGuided By Voices 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN9x6zckn18>, Afghan Whigs 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYa3nZ5UYRY>, Bob Mould 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvDxhOxOPls>, and more. And the show that 
started it all, back in 1982? A new band from Georgia, called REM.

Smart Bar
 Smart Bar, Chicago 
Underneath the Metro, meanwhile, is a darker and more beat-driven space, 
featuring cutting-edge electronic talent. Past visitors include Chicago house 
pioneerFrankie Knuckles <https://myspace.com/fkalways/music/songs>, Paul 
Oakenfold <http://pauloakenfold.com/?session=0qeobi15kdveq8sm3nn97i4ru2>, Trent 
Reznor, Richie Hawtin, the Front 242 DJs, and countless others, playing the 
finest in authentic house, disco, funk and more. Just don't try using a fake ID 
to get in: the 21+ club is merciless when it comes to phoney credentials.

The Hideout 
 The Hideout, Chicago 
Perhaps the most aptly titled venue in Chicago, clubhouse-like The Hideout is 
tucked away in an industrial corner of the city. It's an intimate venue (it 
holds fewer than 200 people) and specialises in bringing in indie acts both new 
and notable, with superstar names such as the White Stripes,Neko Case 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbjnS_RTj_o&list=TL7d_7IdiZSJA> and Wilco 
<http://wilcoworld.net/#!/> stopping by in years past. Chicago legend Mavis 
Staples <http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12387-live-hope-at-the-hideout/> 
even recorded a live album here a few years back.

Schubas
 Schubas, Chicago 
One of two clubs in Chicago owned by the Schuba brothers, Mike and Chris; 
Schubas hosts cutting-edge talent in an upscale and intimate setting. Since its 
doors opened in 1989, it has helped break up-and-coming talent both indie and 
mainstream, and even played host to one of the first-everDave Matthews Band 
<http://davematthewsband.com/> shows. Catch their like here, before they go on 
to play the club's sister venue,Lincoln Hall

If Schubas nabs the underdogs, the larger Lincoln Hall is where the current 
class of buzz bands often perform upon subsequent visits to Chicago. The club, 
which opened in 2009, is one of the cleanest and best lit in the city, and is 
in Chicago's family-friendly Lincoln Park neighbourhood. Mumford & Sons,Fiona 
Apple <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIlLq4BqGdg> and M83 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE> have graced the stage in recent 
years.

Buddy Guy's Legends
 Buddy Guy's Legends, Chicago 
In the city's emerging South Loop neighbourhood, this blues venue was founded 
by Buddy Guy in 1989, and every January he holds court with a 16-night 
residency. Fellow legends such as Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Lou Rawls, 
David Bowie and BB King have played here over the years. Check out a wealth of 
artist memorabilia, including Grammys and guitars, as well as the club's Cajun 
menu.

Double Door

A dark and gritty clubhouse for similarly dark and gritty rock, Double Door is 
located at ground zero of Chicago's Wicker Park, a neighbourhood in the midst 
of changing over from hipster-haven to stroller-central. Though known for 
showcasing new artists, the venue has surprised audiences with unannounced 
superstar headliners: in 1997 the Rolling Stones and the Smashing Pumpkins 
performed secret shows. Other notable visitors include Sonic Youth, Muse and a 
last-minuteRise Against <http://www.riseagainst.com/longforgottensongs/order/> 
show, in 2003, for only 300 people.

Reggies 
 Reggies, Chicago 
Just a short stretch south of Buddy Guy's Legends is Reggies, which sports a 
more raw aesthetic. Though the room has seen its fair share of diverse acts 
across multiple genres, Reggies is renowned for a strong showing of punk and 
metal events, as well as local hip-hop talent likeRockie Fresh

,Chance the Rapper <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWZBchgVSvc>, and the 
now-defunct Kids These Days, who all performed here on their way up. Also 
housed in the building is a record shop on the second floor and a restaurant in 
the next room.
