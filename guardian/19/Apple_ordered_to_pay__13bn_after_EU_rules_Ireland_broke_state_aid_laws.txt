Apple has warned that future investment by multinationals in Europe could be 
hit after it was ordered to pay a record-breaking €13bn (£11bn) in back taxes to
Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland>.

The world’s largest company was presented with the huge bill after the 
European commission <https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission> 
ruled that a sweetheart tax deal between Apple and the Irish tax authorities 
amounted to illegal state aid.

The commission said the deal allowed Apple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> to pay a maximum tax rate of 
just 1%. In 2014, the tech firm paid tax at just 0.005%. The usual rate of 
corporation tax in Ireland is 12.5%.

“Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is 
illegal under EU state aid rules,” said the European competition commissioner,
Margrethe Vestager <https://www.theguardian.com/world/margrethe-vestager>, 
whose investigation of Apple’s complex tax dealings has taken three years.

Vestager’s ruling prompted an angry response from Apple and from Ireland and 
is likely to spark a political row between the US and the EU. The US Treasury 
said the ruling threatened to damage “the important spirit of economic 
partnership between the US and the EU”.

In a letter to customers, Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, claimed the 
ruling could deal a blow to big companies investing in Europe: “Beyond the 
obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling 
will be on investment and job creation in Europe. Using the commission’s 
theory, every company in Ireland and acrossEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> is suddenly at risk of being 
subjected to taxes under laws that never existed.”

The commission said Ireland’s tax arrangements 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple>
 with Apple between 1991 and 2015 had allowed the US company to attribute sales 
to a “head office” that only existed on paper and could not have generated such 
profits.

The result was that Apple avoided tax on almost all the profit generated from 
its multi-billion euro sales of iPhones and other products across the EU’s 
single market. It booked the profits in Ireland rather than the country in 
which the product was sold.

Apple and Ireland said they intend to appeal against the ruling. 

The figure of €13bn plus interest is 40 times the previous record for such a 
case and the equivalent of the annual budget for Ireland’s health service. 
Irish campaigners called for the windfall to be invested in public housing.

The taxable profits of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe 
did not correspond to economic reality, the commission said.

Vestager said: “The commission’s investigation concluded that Ireland granted 
illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax 
than other businesses over many years.”


Vestager suggested other countries, including the US, might now examine how 
Apple did business within their borders. These other jurisdictions might then 
claim a share of the unpaid tax from Apple for the same period. This would 
reduce the bill owed to Ireland.

Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said the commission was rewriting Apple’s 
record in Ireland <http://www.apple.com/ie/customer-letter/>, overriding Irish 
law and disrupting the international tax system. He said Apple chose the Irish 
city of Cork as its European base 30 years ago and had expanded from 60 workers 
to almost 6,000 in Ireland.

He said Apple would appeal and that he was confident of winning.

Cook said: “We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. We now 
find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay 
additional taxes to a government that says we don’t owe them any more than 
we’ve already paid.”

The commission’s decision is a rebuff to US efforts to persuade it to drop the 
case after warnings of retaliation from Washington. 

Apple, which changed its tax arrangements with Ireland in 2015, should easily 
be able to pay the huge tax bill because it has a cash mountain of more than 
$230bn (£176bn) of cash and securities, mostly held outside the US. The tech 
group keeps the money outside the US because it would be forced to pay US tax 
charges if it repatriated the money.

The €13bn figure covers only the 10 years before the commission first 
requested information in 2013. The commission, which does not have the 
authority to go back any further, said it was up to Ireland to collect the tax 
from Apple.

The Irish government, however, wants the ruling reversed because it wants to 
preserveits status as a low-tax base for overseas companies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/ireland-attracts-soaring-level-of-us-investment>
.

Ireland’s finance minister, Michael Noonan, said Dublin would appeal against 
the ruling. He said: “The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet 
approval to appeal. This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax 
system, to provide tax certainty to business and to challenge the encroachment 
of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation.”

A cabinet meeting will be held in Dublin on Wednesday to discuss the fallout 
from the ruling. At the heart of the Fine Gael-led administration’s objections 
is that it would cause Ireland reputational damage in the eyes of other mainly 
US multinationals thinking of establishing their European base in the Republic.

Fine Gael, the main opposition party Fianna Fáil, and a host of independent 
deputies serving as ministers in the coalition government support the low-tax 
regime for multinationals because it has created hundreds of thousands of jobs.

Richard Murphy, a tax campaigner and a professor in international political 
economy at City University in London, said: “This is a great day for the 
sovereignty of the EU’s nations when it comes to tax. They will now be able to 
choose their own tax policies knowing another state should not be consciously 
undermining them when doing so. The Irish state has for too long been committed 
to tax abuse, unfair competition and secrecy, all of which are designed to 
undermine fair competition and increase inequality.”


Prof Louise Gracia of Warwick University business school said: “This ruling is 
a serious attempt at curtailing the power large multinationals have in avoiding 
their tax liabilities, and sends a warning to countries that facilitate 
hard-edged corporate tax minimisation strategies.”

She added: “It also shines a spotlight on the paltry levels of corporate tax 
that large multinationals are actually paying. Even if we accept the job and 
wealth creation arguments put forward by multinationals as mitigation against 
tax liability, this has to be within reason.”

Toby Quantrill, Christian Aid’s principal adviser on economic justice, said: 
“The staggering amount of money at stake here suggests that millions of 
citizens are paying a painfully high price for multinationals’ cosy tax deals 
with certain governments.

“This is not a one-off situation – it is part of a damaging race to the bottom 
in which governments are competing on who can offer multinationals the lowest 
tax bill. It’s time to get multinationals’ tax affairs out in the open, so we 
can all see how much they are actually contributing to the rest of society.”

In the US Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory 
Group, said it was not yet clear which side would ultimately prevail, but that 
the ruling was a watershed moment. “There’s no telling whether the verdict will 
stand on appeal, but we know that the landscape is changing for US corporations 
in the EU.”

He described Vestager’s ruling as “just the tip of the spear – an enormously 
important ruling” because US-based companies “have traditionally used the EU as 
a way of circumventing a higher US corporate tax code.”

Apple’s share price, however, was largely unmoved. In a note to investors, 
Gene Munster, analyst at Piper Jaffray, said the €13bn potential bill was not a 
big deal for the huge company.“While the penalty is large in absolute terms, it 
represents a small portion of AAPL’s [Apple’s] overall valuation.”

It is not yet clear which side will be backed by either of the 2016 
presidential candidates. Republican Donald Trump has said he would force US 
companies, Apple in particular, tomove manufacturing jobs within the nation’s 
own borders 
<http://www.wired.com/2016/03/trump-wont-get-apple-make-iphones-shouldnt/>, 
rather than allowing them to seek cheaper labour overseas. He has also said he 
would lower the US corporate tax rate.

His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has also hinted that she might lower 
the corporate tax rate. She has closer ties to Apple than Trump. Cook helda 
fundraiser for Clinton
