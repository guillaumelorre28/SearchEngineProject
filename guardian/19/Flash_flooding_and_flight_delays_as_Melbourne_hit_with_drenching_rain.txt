<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> – after one of the 
hottest nights on record – causing flash-flooding and delaying flights.

Melbourne <https://www.theguardian.com/weather/melbourne> Airport received 
more than 40mm of rain by 4.10pm on Thursday. Flights were delayed when ground 
crews were called back inside just before 3pm as lightening passed overhead, an 
airport spokesman said.

The delays – caused by ground crews being recalled due to heavy rain – would 
continue until conditions improved, the spokesman said. In Melbourne online 
footage of the storm shows gutters at the popular shopping strip of Chapel 
Street covered by rising water, while diners along the street watch.

The city centre had about 12mm rain fall in a very short time starting just 
before 3pm, and there was more in some suburbs, the Bureau of Meteorology said. 
In St Kilda some of the nature strips looked like small rivers.

“Some parts of Melbourne have had as much as 18mm in about 10 minutes,” senior 
forecaster Dean Stewart said.

Train lines have also been affected, with Metro saying there were major delays 
on the Frankston line. The SES had a spike in calls from 3pm, with many people 
struggling with damage and flooding from the sudden downpour.

“Now the calls coming in are more for flooding, so mainly homes homes where 
roofs or gutters can’t take the load,” an SES spokeswoman said.

People also told 3AW radio that flash-flooding had affected traffic on the 
streets of Carnegie and on an off ramp on the Westgate freeway.
