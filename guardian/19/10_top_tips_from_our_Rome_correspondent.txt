Park it … like a local

Apart from a visit to the museum and gallery 
<http://galleriaborghese.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/1/home> in Villa 
Borghese, tourists don’t tend to flock to any of Rome’s wonderful parks. Of 
these, Villa Pamphili, the largest public park in Rome, is probably the most 
beautiful and well-kept, with its wide open vistas and wonderful views of 
towering pines. Go there for a walk – or a jog – and get a sense of where 
Romans escape to. Start or end your walk atVivi Bistrot 
<http://www.vivibistrot.com/> for a cappuccino or a glass of wine and just soak 
in Rome’s natural beauty.

 Students at Mamà – Laboratori di Cucina 
Food is obviously a huge part of Italian life and culture. I suggest taking in 
a cooking class that is attended by Italians looking to perfect some classics, 
including acacio e pepe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2016/nov/03/how-to-make-the-perfect-cacio-e-pepe>
 that will make your friends at home envious (hint: use enough water). I really 
enjoyed a visit to Mamà – Laboratori di Cucina near the Salaria. Classes are 
taught in Italian, so it helps to speak some or bring a friend who does. But 
even if you don’t you’re bound to learn something just watching and playing 
along. And there’s prosecco to drink while you’re doing it. Lots of it.

 Sculpture at Parco dei Mostri, Bomarzo. Photograph: Alamy 
If you have time, there’s one destination I highly recommend that requires a 
car and a sense of adventure. Get yourself to the Parco dei Mostri, or Monster 
Park as we call it, in the town of Bomarzo. This is a private park dating back 
to the 16th century, when an eccentric prince, Vicino Orsini, commissioned a 
series of amazing grand statues of mythical figures – lots of monsters and 
dragons – that are peppered throughout the park. It’ll be unlike anything 
you’ve seen and will delight children. Then, go for lunch at a cosy nearby 
trattoria, Ristorante Piccolo Mondo, (via Madonna del Piano 27, +39 0761 
924466) for the best fresh pasta you’ve ever had.

If, after a few days in Rome, a break from eating pasta twice a day is 
required, then check out Salotto 42, a lounge bar in Piazza di Pietra, one of 
my favourite spots in central Rome. While it is known for its cocktails, 
Salotto 42 also serves a delicious €12 buffet lunch – offering a variety of 
delicious and hearty salads that are light on meat and heavy on spelt, 
vegetables, barley, and other grains. It’s a good spot for vegetarians, though 
not ideal for young kids. I’d recommend it especially for the tired tourist who 
wants to sit back in a comfy chair, tuck in and listen to Sinatra while 
contemplating their next move.

 Pump it up … shoes from Marta Ray, Rome 
Ray is a former model and engineering student whose signature design is her 
amazing flat shoes made in really supple leather, with a special sole that 
helps with back pain that ballet flats can give you, and an awesome array of 
colours. Ray also has gorgeous handbags: they’re simple, stylish, with a clean, 
linear style. The flats are reasonably priced … but the bags aren’t cheap.

If you have enough time for a day trip, get out to the beautiful beach town of 
Sperlonga, which is about an hour’s train ride from Rome’s Termini station (get 
out at Fondi-Sperlonga, then get a short connecting bus to Sperlonga). There’s 
a seaside restaurant calledLido Rocco <http://www.lidorocco.it/> that is worth 
a visit. The food is simple but the view is stunning and you can spend the rest 
of the afternoon on the beach, not quite believing you are just an hour from 
the capital of Italy.

Your visit to Rome must include authentic Roman food: that means a real 
bucatini all’amatriciana (when done correctly it can be messy trying to twist 
the al dente bucatini around your fork, but it’s worth the splattering of 
tomato sauce on your shirt) and a carbonara. If they’re in season, you’ll eat 
plenty of artichokes (harvested from February to April), either braised alla 
romana-style or deep friedalla giudìa. My favourite spot for these classic 
dishes is La Matricianella on Via del Leone in central Rome; sticklers for 
authenticity it only serves products from the Lazio region, including the wine.

I’m not much of a cyclist but one of the most fun things I’ve done since 
moving to Rome has been renting a bike with my brood – husband and two kids. 
I’ve hired a (motorised) bicycle – well, more like a rickshaw – and pedalled 
around Villa Borghese. There’s a place to rent them near the entrance of the 
zoo, which is called theBioparco <http://www.bioparco.it/english/>. The park is 
mostly closed to traffic and has wide roads crossing it, so it’s a great 
location to pedal around, dodgy brakes and all.

 Cream of the crop … La Strega Nocciola on Via della Vite. Photograph: Lorenzo 
Evangelisti 
Eating gelato is just part of life in Rome. There are plenty of really good 
gelaterias that are also quite touristy, such asGiolitti 
<http://www.giolitti.it/en/> on Via Uffici del Vicario. I suggest trying it for 
the experience, but there’s another gelateria very close to Via Condotti – and 
therefore the Spanish Steps – that’s worth checking out if you are in the 
neighbourhood. La Strega Nocciola on Via della Vite has great-quality gelato 
and a friendly staff. Remember to say “yes” topanna (whipped cream) – you’ll be 
walking a lot so don’t worry about the calories – then go and sit on the 
Spanish Steps. So what if you look like a tourist?

 Sant’Eustachio Il Caffe, at night. Photograph: Alamy 
OK, so Sant’Eustachio is not exactly a hidden gem: it’s a bustling coffee bar 
that will require you to push and shove and potentially use your elbows to get 
your order in during busy periods. This is not Starbucks, you won’t be sitting 
there for hours – you won’t be sitting at all. The coffee, however, is top 
quality and the experience is pure Rome. Remember to pay first, then hold on to 
your receipt and order at the bar. Unlike most bars, sugar will be put in your 
drink automatically unless you ask them not to. It’s to keep the place moving. 
Remember, it’s not Starbucks.
