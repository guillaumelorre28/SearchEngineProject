An uncertain path lies ahead for fans of the dozen clubs preparing for the 
play-offs: a path strewn with undulations and plenty of twists and turns. There 
is nothing straightforward about earning promotion this way. It has become 
known for a particularly acute brand of cruelty for almost 30 years and 
emotions will be laid bare in the coming weeks. Here we take a look at how the 
clubs involved have fared in their previous play-offs appearances.

The Championship

What happened last season: Norwich City beat Middlesbrough 2-0, with goals 
from Cameron Jerome and Nathan Redmond in the first 15 minutes effectively 
settling the final. Norwich became the quickest team to score two goals in a
Championship <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> final on their 
way to the Premier League.


Brighton & Hove Albion: P46 W24 D17 L5 PT89

There is no time for Brighton to feel sorry for themselves after missing out 
on automatic promotion on goal difference to Middlesbrough on the last day of 
the season. The Seagulls’ recent record is not encouraging, having lost 
semi-finals in 2013 to rivals Crystal Palace and being comprehensively beaten 
by Derby in 2014. Their only success was in 2004, when they beat perennial 
play-off failures Bristol City in the Second Division final. They also lost to 
Neil Warnock’s Notts County in 1991. One consolation is that the third-place 
team in the Championship has been promoted three times in last five years, 
including Norwich City last year.

Fact: Their total of 89 points is the second highest to qualify for the 
play-offs after Sunderland’s total of 90 points in 1998, which ended in a 
heartbreaking penalty shoot-out loss against Charlton.

Sheffield Wednesday: P46 W19 D17 L10 PT74

Sheffield Wednesday <https://www.theguardian.com/football/sheffieldwednesday> 
are one of only five teams to have a 100% record in the play-offs alongside 
Dagenham & Redbridge, Doncaster Rovers, Fleetwood Town and Manchester City. If 
they can emulate their 2005 League One triumph against Hartlepool they will 
become the only club to have appeared more than once and won on both occasions. 
Their Portuguese manager, Carlos Carvalhal, will be attempting to become the 
third manager born outside the British Isles to succeed in the play-offs after 
Ossie Ardiles with West Brom in 1993 and Gudjon Thordarson with Stoke City in 
2002. Wednesday have been out of the top division since 2000.

Fact: Sheffield Wednesday are the only team to have scored in all four halves 
of a play-offs final that has gone to extra time.

Hull City: P46 W24 D11 L11 PT83

Dean Windass will be forever assured of a warm welcome on Humberside because 
of his magnificent goal in the 2008 Championship final. As a hometown boy, the 
39-year-old’s fulminating strike against Bristol City remains one of the iconic 
moments in play-offs history. Hull’s only other foray into the play-offs was a 
damp squib by comparison, ending in a semi-final loss against Leyton Orient in 
2001. Manager Steve Bruce tasted victory with Birmingham in 2002 in his only 
play-offs final to date. This would be Hull’s third promotion to the Premier 
League in the space of eight years.

Fact: Hull’s 6-1 aggregate victory over Watford in the 2008 semi-finals is the 
joint highest win in the Championship play-offs. Chelsea beat Blackburn in 1988 
and Leicester overcame Cambridge in 1992 with the same scoreline.

Derby County: P46 W21 D15 L10 PT78

This will be Derby County’s sixth appearance in the play-offs, making them the 
most experienced of the four Championship clubs. Although their most recent 
memory is the painful defeat to 10-man QPR in the 2014 final in a game they 
dominated until Bobby Zamora scored a late winner. Their captain, Richard 
Keogh, will be especially keen to lay to rest the ghost of that goal as his 
slip allowed Zamora the chance to strike. Their only success was under Billy 
Davies in 2007, when they overcame West Brom 1-0. If they do prevail they will 
hope to perform better than that season in the Premier League, when they 
mustered a meagre 11 points.

Fact: All three of Derby’s previous appearances in play-offs finals have been 
decided by a one-goal margin.

League One 

What happened last season: Preston North End broke their play-offs hoodoo 
after nine unsuccessful attempts when they thrashed Swindon Town 4-0 thanks to 
Jermaine Beckford’s hat-trick – only the third play-offs hat-trick at Wembley.


Walsall: P46 W24 D12 L10 PT84

Alongside Bradford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/bradford>, Walsall 
are the only team of 2016 semi-finalists to have won the play-offs twice. In 
1988, when the finals were two-legged contests, they had to go to a replay with 
Bristol City, which they won convincingly 4-0. Their only loss was in a 
semi-final in 1993 in which they were hammered by Crewe. In 2001 they triumphed 
at the Millennium Stadium, beating Alan Pardew’s Reading 3-2 after extra time.

Fact: Their 9-3 aggregate defeat to Crewe in 1993 remains the highest loss of 
all 174 semi-finals.

Barnsley: P46 W22 D8 L16 PT74

Barnsley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> have never lost a 
play-offs semi-final and started with a bang by beating Birmingham 4-0 at St 
Andrews in 2000 before losing 4-2 to Ipswich in the final, which was the last 
club game at Wembley before it was rebuilt. In their second final in 2006 they 
beat Swansea on penalties after a 2-2 draw in the last Play-Offs match played 
at the Millennium Stadium.

Fact: Their 4-0 victory over Birmingham in the first leg of 2000 semi-final is 
the biggest victory for an away team in all 348 semi-final matches.

Millwall: P46 W24 D9 L13 PT81

The Lions have a chequered play-offs history, having won promotion once in 
2010 against Swindon after five failures, the last of which was in 2009 against 
Scunthorpe.Millwall <https://www.theguardian.com/football/millwall> are one of 
seven clubs to have bounced back from defeat in the final to win the following 
year. Manager Neil Harris played in the 2009 and 2010 finals. They have enjoyed 
a strong second half of the season – just as they did in 2010 – picking up from 
ninth place at the turn of the year to finish comfortably in the play-offs, so 
they will be hoping that the similarity continues six years on.

Fact: Millwall did not win any of their first four play-offs semi-finals at 
home, losing three and drawing one.

Bradford City: P46 W23 D11 L12 PT80

Bradford have won their last two play-offs finals, in 1996 and 2013, with the 
only blemish on their record their defeat to Middlesbrough in the First 
Division semi-finals in 1988. Phil Parkinson was in charge of the Bantams in 
their previous final in 2013 when they beat Northampton 3-0. Three of the back 
four who played that day have been regulars this season – Stephen Darby, Rory 
McArdle and James Meredith. McArdle scored the second goal in the 2013 final, 
following this season’s leading scorer, James Hanson’s opener. Bradford are 
aiming to reach the second tier of English football for the first time since 
2004.

Fact: After Bradford City overcame a two-goal deficit from the home leg of 
their 1996 semi-final against Blackpool with a 3-0 win at Bloomfield Road, Sam 
Allardyce was sacked by Owen Oyston while Oyston was in prison.

League Two

What happened last season: Southend United beat Wycombe Wanderers 7-6 on 
penalties after the final had finished 1-1. This was the 11th play-offs final 
to be decided on penalties.

Accrington Stanley: P46 W24 D13 L9 PT85

Stanley were cruelly denied by Bristol Rovers, having occupied an automatic 
promotion spot throughout the last day of the season until Rovers’ 92nd-minute 
winner. Alongside Portsmouth,Accrington Stanley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/accringtonstanley> are the only club in 
this year’s play-offs to have played in them and failed to win a match. In 
their only appearance in 2011 they failed to score a goal in their semi-final 
with Stevenage and suffered the ignominy of having two players sent off in as 
many minutes during the second leg. John Coleman is in his second stint as 
manager, having previously taken them into the Football League in 2006. He has 
said that their promotion this season would emulate Leicester’s much-lauded 
Premier League title as “it is not feasible” given their relative lack of 
resources – they have the smallest budget in League Two.

Fact: Accrington have collected more red cards (two) than they have scored

AFC Wimbledon: P46 W21 D12 L13 PT75

Aside from Accrington and Leicester, the story of AFC Wimbledon’s rise to the 
fringe of League One must be up there for sheer unpredictability and a dash of 
romance. Formed out of the rump of the club that upped sticks and ended up as 
MK Dons,AFC Wimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/afc-wimbledon> were 
founded in May 2002 and have made a rapid rise up the league pyramid. If they 
win the play-offs, this will be their sixth promotion in their brief existence. 
They are the first club to be formed in 21st century to participate in the 
Football League play-offs. They have been promoted twice before via non-league 
play-offs, including securing their Football League status in 2011 when they 
pipped Luton Town on penalties after a goalless draw in the Conference Premier 
final. Current manager Neal Ardley took over in October 2012 during their 
second season in League Two and this will also be his first taste of the 
vagaries of the Football League play-offs as either manager or player.

Fact: They are the only club competing this year with no Football League 
play-offs experience.

Plymouth Argyle: P46 W24 D9 L13 PT81

This will be Plymouth’s fourth appearance in the play-offs and they will be 
hoping to recreate the spirit of 1996, when Neil Warnock led them to victory 
over Darlington thanks to Ronnie Mauge’s goal. They stumbled at the semi-finals 
stage of their two other appearances: in 1994 to Burnley and in 2015 to Wycombe 
Wanderers. They are the only club competing in the 2016 play-offs who were 
involved last season. They are also the only club among the four League Two 
semi-finalists to have tasted play-offs success in the Football League. They 
are led by Derek Adams, who, likePortsmouth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> manager Paul Cook is in his 
first season in charge. Adams took over from John Sheridan last June.

Fact: Neil Warnock is the most successful play-offs manager, having won them 
four times in the space of seven years. After his triumph with Plymouth in 1996 
he won it in successive years with Notts County 1990 and 1991, and then with 
Huddersfield Town in 1995.

Portsmouth: P46 W21 D15 L10 PT78

Their only experience of the play-offs was way back in 1993 when they lost to 
Leicester in the First Division semi-finals. Having plummeted down the leagues 
since winning the FA Cup in 2008 and having suffered two damaging 
administrations in the space of two seasons, they have been in League Two since 
2013. The club has been resurrected under the fan ownership of the Pompey 
Supporters Trust and are now hoping to go back up from whence they came, 
starting with facingPlymouth Argyle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/plymouthargyle> in the semi-finals. Paul 
Cook joined Portsmouth straight after leading Chesterfield to the League One 
play-offs last season when they were beaten by the eventual winners Preston in 
the semi-finals.

Fact: It is 23 years since they lost to Leicester in the First Division 
semi-finals, making it the longest gap between appearances of all 12 clubs 
competing in this year’s play-offs.
