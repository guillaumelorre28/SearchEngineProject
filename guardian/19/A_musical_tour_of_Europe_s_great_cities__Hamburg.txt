This week’s stop on our tour of Europe’s great musical centres is the northern 
German city ofHamburg <http://english.hamburg.de/>, the country’s second 
largest, the eighth biggest in the EU and – Wikipedia tells me 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg> – the second biggest port in Europe.

Wikipedia is less useful when it comes to music: the entry for Hamburg leads 
with the fact that the German premiere ofCats 
<https://www.youtube.com/user/catsmusical> took place there 30 years ago. But 
the city is also the birthplace ofJohannes Brahms 
<http://www.brahms-hamburg.de/en/museum.html> and where the Beatles cut their 
teeth <https://www.beatlesbible.com/1960/08/17/live-indra-club-hamburg/> 
between 1960 and 62. It is also big in heavy metal and hip-hop.

Hamburg is one of those great cities that creeps in under the tourist radar. 
Musically, it’s going to get much more exciting in January, with the opening of 
a state-of-the-art music venue on the banks of the River Elbe . Designed by 
Swiss architectsHerzog & de Meuron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jun/21/how-we-made-tate-modern-herzog-de-meuron-nicholas-serota>
, theElbphilharmonie <https://www.elbphilharmonie.de/en/> looks like a vast 
galleon floating down the Elbe and, in keeping with the city’s eclectic musical 
heritage, is promising something for everyone, with pop, world music and jazz 
alongside classical.

But back to Brahms. He was born in the city in 1833, the son of an 
impoverished musician. The prodigiously talented teenager was forced to 
supplement the family’s income by playing the piano in taverns and other, 
dubious institutions: an early immersion in the Hamburg nightworld that has led 
to various psychological theories about the bearing this might have had on his 
commitment-phobic attitude to women.

Brahms’s early works were composed in this city, including his Piano Sonata No 
1 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuW2WJFFh4c>, written in 1853 and his first 
work to be given an opus number. His second sonata had been completed earlier, 
but he thought this work superior so made it his Opus 1. As he became more 
famous, Brahms gravitated to Vienna, but after his death in 1897 he was made an 
honorary citizen of Hamburg and there is amuseum devoted to him 
<http://www.brahms-hamburg.de/en/museum.html> close to his birthplace.

 Listen to Brahms’s first piano sonata 
Felix Mendelssohn was also born here, in 1809, though in rather more 
prosperous circumstances – his father was a banker. But the city can’t quite 
claim ownership of Mendelssohn as his family moved to Berlin two years after 
his birth. Still, any excuse will do to play the incidental music to A 
Midsummer Night’s Dream. Theoverture 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUDvZaMl4RU>, which he wrote when he was 16 
and incorporated into the later extended work, is the greatest piece of music 
by someone so young. Felix’s intensely musical sister Fanny, a notable composer 
in her own right, was also born in the city.

Two other composers inextricably linked with Hamburg are Georg Philipp Telemann
 <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Georg-Philipp-Telemann>, who became 
director of music in the city’s principal churches in 1721 at the age of 40, 
and his godsonCarl Philipp Emanuel Bach 
<https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Philipp-Emanuel-Bach>, son of 
Telemann’s friend JS Bach. CPE Bach succeeded his godfather as music director 
in Hamburg.

The indispensable @abkquan <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13885567> 
has come up with appropriate works by each: Telemann’s delightful suite
Hamburger Ebb und Fluth (Hamburg ebb and flood) 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFBwntoMNkA>, written in 1723, and CPE Bach’s 
six Hamburg symphonies. @abkquan 
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13885567> says he loves the latter, 
with their “wild modulations and dramatic structure”.

 Listen to CPE Bach’s Hamburg symphonies 
@Grishnakh <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3569686> also puts in an 
appeal for Telemann, and in particular his operaPimpinone 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPX_F2QfA4>, which was premiered in Hamburg 
in 1725. Telemann had a fraught second marriage: the opera’s portrait of a 
couple at war may have drawn on painful personal experience.

@PositivistDinosaur <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4376557> cites 
several other opera premieres in the city, including ErichKorngold’s Die Tote 
Stadt <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGQ56c-6z5k> – competition between 
German opera houses to stage the premiere was so intense that it was first 
performed on the same day, 4 December 1920, in Hamburg and Cologne – andHans 
Werner Henze’s Der Prinz von Homburg 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHRfhG_-AzY 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqzOxMJ9SR8>, premiered in 1960. 

@thesecretorganist <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15303784>, who 
despite his protestations I do think of as heroic for his contributions, 
suggests the Russian composerSofia Gubaidulina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/31/sofia-gubaidulina-unchained-melodies>
, who has made Hamburg her home for the past two decades. Since we have already 
established Hamburg’s connection with the Bach dynasty, herJohannes Passion 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akk7MuJWIeg>, premiered in 2000 to mark the 
250th anniversary of the death of JS Bach, neatly completes the circle.

Hamburg has proved a congenial city for composers. Gustav Mahler was chief 
conductor at the Hamburg State Opera, Germany’s oldest public opera house, in 
the 1890s. Mahler conducted the German premiere of Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin 
in the city – the composer was in attendance and pronounced Mahler’s conducting 
“astounding” – and worked on his ownsecond 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MPuoOj5TIw> and third 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yr720ftjaA> symphonies while employed at the 
opera house.

 Listen to György Ligeti, Hamburg Symphony 
Almost a century later, Hungarian composer György Ligeti 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/14/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries>
 was professor of composition at the city’s music academy in the 70s and 80s. 
One of his last works was the Hamburg Concerto, for solo horn and chamber 
orchestra.

I might have been born in Liverpool, but I grew up in Hamburg
John Lennon 
Alfred Schnittke 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/apr/29/alfred-schnittke-contemporary-music-tom-service>
 lived in Hamburg for the last eight years of his life – he died in 1998 – and 
his first few years there were, despite chronic ill health, highly productive. 
The works he wrote included the Sixth, Seventh andEighth 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgDwmIGTrhk> symphonies. There was even a Ninth
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYBBe90yJo>, produced after a devastating 
stroke in 1994, though the fact that the score was barely decipherable and has 
had to be reconstructed by other composers has contributed to arguments over 
its critical value.

 Watch video of the Beatles live in Hamburg 
Finally, of course, there are the Beatles. John Lennon once said: “I might 
have been born in Liverpool, but I grew up in Hamburg.” It was where the group, 
who spent long periods there from 1960-62, came of age musically – and indeed, 
in every other way. They went from five members to four while performing in the 
city:Stuart Sutcliffe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/jul/25/beatles-pete-best-stuart-sutcliffe-john-lennon-paul-mccartney-george-harrison-ringo>
 opted out and then died suddenly; they met Ringo Starr, who in 1962 replaced 
drummer Pete Best; and they had their early image defined by Hamburg-based 
photographerAstrid Kirchherr 
<http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Astrid+Kirchherr+beatles+photographs&client=safari&rls=en&tbm=isch&oq=Astrid+Kirchherr+beatles+photographs&gs_l=img.3...7205.12241.0.12466.23.3.2.17.19.1.269.733.2-3.3.0....0...1ac.1.34.img..12.11.481.vsp6BLvEGlc>
, who was engaged to Sutcliffe before his sudden death from a brain haemorrhage.

Hamburg helped make the Beatles just as it helped make Brahms, Mahler and CPE 
Bach. Quite a city. Next time we will traceRome 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/rome>’s musical connections, and once again 
I will rely on your contributions. Please offer your thoughts on Roman musical 
connections below.
