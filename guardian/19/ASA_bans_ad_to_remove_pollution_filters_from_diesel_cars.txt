The rogue practice of removing vital pollution filters from the exhausts of 
diesel vehicles has suffered a blow with theAdvertising Standards Authority 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> (ASA) for the first time banning an 
advert for the service.

However the number of filterless cars on UK roads, pumping out high levels of 
toxic particles, remains unknown and air pollution campaigners say the 
government must investigate and then crack down on the shady practice.

Particulate pollution causes almost 29,000 early deaths each year

, costing £15bn in health costs.Diesel particulate filters 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_particulate_filter> (DPFs) have been 
compulsory in new diesel cars since 2009 but can become clogged and cause 
breakdowns, particularly for city drivers.

Replacing DPFs usually costs more than a £1,000 and, as a result, many garages 
across the country offer to remove the filter completely for a few hundred 
pounds. They exploit a legal loophole which means removing a DPF is not an 
offence, only driving the car afterwards on a public road. Without the filter, 
particulate emissions are likely to soar fivefold.

Friends of the Earth complained to the ASA about an online advert from a 
garage in Bristol which offered to remove DPFs. The advert said: “The only MOT 
regulation regarding the DPF is a simple visual inspection. As long as the DPF 
still appears to be fitted, the vehicle will pass the MOT visual inspection. 
Therefore we only remove the internal core, leaving the outer casing in place. 
The vehicle will appear to have a DPF fitted and will appear unmodified.”

A qualification was included at the bottom of the advert which stated “*Our 
DPF Removal service is sold for off-road use only”. However, the ASA concluded 
on Wednesday that this “was not sufficiently prominent to counter the overall 
impression that vehicles which had their DPF removed could be used on public 
roads” and banned the advert as misleading.

Any future adverts must make “immediately clear with sufficient prominence 
that it is illegal to drive such vehicles on a public road”, the watchdog said.

In 2014, ministers said the “unacceptable” practice of removing the filters 
was “clearly detrimental to people’s health” 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-rules-for-mot-to-test-for-diesel-particulate-filter>
 and introduced a visual check into the MOT. TheGuardian revealed in May this 
had caught 1,188 vehicles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/17/diesel-particulate-filter-removal-air-pollution-department-for-transport>
. But with some garages promising “invisible” DPF removal to beat the MOT test, 
as in the case of the banned advert, the true number of filterless vehicles is 
likely to be much higher.

Diesel vehicles face charges after UK government loses air pollution case

“The more we uncover about diesel vehicles, the dodgier they seem,” said Aaron 
Kiely, at Friends of the Earth. “Removal of pollution filters – which are 
designed to reduce dangerous emissions and protect people’s health – should 
clearly be illegal. The Department for Transport must also investigate the full 
scale of this problem and clamp down on those who are putting people’s lives at 
risk.”

A spokesman for the Department for Transport (DfT) said: “The government is 
firmly committed to improving the UK’s air quality and cutting harmful 
emissions. Changes to the MOT test were implemented in 2014 to ensure that 
particulate filters are fitted where necessary and if not then the vehicle 
would fail the test.”

“Alternative methods of detecting the removal or effectiveness of particulate 
filters are under development and we are examining their suitability for use in 
an MOT,” said DfT spokesman: “Further research is required to ensure potential 
methods accurately determine a pass or fail.”

Almost all diesel cars have also been revealed as emitting far higher levels 
of nitrogen dioxide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/diesel-cars-pollution-limits-nox-emissions>
 than official limits. NO2 levels areillegally high in most of the UK’s air 
quality zones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/21/high-court-ministers-deadline-air-quality-pollution-plan>
 and calls are rising to ban dirty diesel vehicles from British city centres, as
Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/02/four-of-worlds-biggest-cities-to-ban-diesel-cars-from-their-centres>
 have already pledged.

In May, the Guardian also revealed that Google, eBay and Gumtree had refused 
to ban adverts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/02/google-ebay-refuse-ban-ads-offering-remove-car-pollution-filters?CMP=share_btn_tw>
 offering to remove DPFs.
