Depay has struggled to tie down a first-team place at United since a £25m move 
from PSV Eindhoven

 in the summer of 2015 and looks set to be on his way out of Old Trafford.

Lyon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lyon> have emerged as leading 
candidates for the 22-year-old’s signature and the French club’s coach Génésio 
admitted at a press conference on Friday that he is keen to bring the Holland 
international on board.

However, he also said there were various other things to consider – including 
the player’s price tag.

Asked about his Lyon’s transfer activities in January, Génésio was quoted as 
saying on Lyon’s website: “Things are progressing. We keep on working. It takes 
time, discussions ... because recruiting a player now is not easy. I trust the 
president to get things done quickly.

“I have put a priority on Memphis Depay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/memphis-depay>. He is a powerful player 
who scores goals and is good at set-pieces. Rachid [Ghezzal] has left for the 
Africa Nations Cup and Memphis knows how to play out wide.

“He is a young player with great international experience and a lot of 
potential. This is my number one priority.

“I’m a fan of this player, he has an interesting profile for us, especially as 
we risk losing Rachid at the end of the season. But there are several things to 
consider, including the price.”
