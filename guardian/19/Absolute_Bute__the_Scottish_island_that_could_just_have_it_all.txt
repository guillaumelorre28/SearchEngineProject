Once the beach resort of choice for fashionable Glaswegians, the Isle of Bute 
lies in the Firth of Clyde, a short distance from Scotland’s biggest city. This 
year, it became more famous as the placerefugees from Syria said they wanted to 
leave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/30/bute-refugees-dream-sun-syrian-families-resettled>
. Focusing on a run-down economy familiar to many British seaside resorts, the 
UK press painted Bute as a place with no future.

But Bute turned the corner years ago, and many of the Syrian refugees have 
talked about their love for the island. When we visited this summer, the 
seafront squares in Rothesay, the port town, had just been renovated. The art 
deco Pavilion will reopen next summer, after a £3m makeover, as an 
international arts venue. Old Victorian shops have been turned into stylish 
boutiques and upcycled furniture emporiums. There’s a vegetarian cafe (Musicker 
<http://www.musicker.co.uk/>) that sells guitars and books, and a bookshop that 
sells coffee (Print Point <https://www.facebook.com/PrintPointRothesay/>, West 
Princes Street), as well as old-style pubs and ice-cream makers.

The council’s decision to house refugees in unused accommodation here has 
mainly gone down well: most of the Syrians say they like life on this little 
island, and most of the locals have welcomed them with open arms. Dropping into 
the Rothesay shops to pick up groceries, I overheard an elderly Buteman 
greeting one of the dads with a broad smile. “As-salaam-alaikum,” said the 
Buteman, over the boxes of Scottish Blend teabags and tablet. “Hey,” said the 
Syrian dad.

On a long weekend in Bute, my boyfriend and I stayed in a self-catering 
converted stable on the Mont Stuart estate – a chic and cosy place with slate 
floors, tweed sofas and a woodburning stove.

Mount Stuart was the ancestral home of Bute’s landowners, built by a Marquess 
of Bute who also happened to be the richest man in Britain at the time. More of 
a palace, the Victorian Gothic house was designed by Robert Rowand Anderson, 
and stacks arch upon marble arch, so entering its main hall feels like stepping 
into a cathedral, flecked with light and colour. The decor revolves around 
religion and the stars. Perhaps when a person has immense wealth, they need to 
be assured that their good fortune is part of the order of the universe. At any 
rate, constellations rush across the ceiling, while signs of the zodiac bloom 
on the stained-glass windows. The stars are clear prisms casting balls of 
rainbow light on the floor below. In other rooms, Tintorettos, Titians and 
Veroneses fill the walls.

Academics come from the universities of Oxford and Yale to work on the 
collections in Mount Stuart’s libraries. This year, an original Shakespeare 
folio turned up there: it’s on display upstairs. But I got just as much 
pleasure from the house itself. I found a rose engraved on the hinge-plate of a 
door, and bees carved into a pillar wreathed in oak leaves and acorns. Every 
nook is crammed with hand-worked detail. It’s like exploring Rivendell, with 
pieces of history thrown in – Bonnie Prince Charlie’s pistols, family portraits 
of the Tudors.

Those staying on the estate get a free pass to visit the house. When the house 
is closed to visitors, they can wander down through its quiet lawns and 
tree-lined walks to the rocky shore. We loved watching the seals bask in the 
evening sunshine here.

Bute has a rare blend of worldliness and wilderness. Beyond the up-and-coming 
town of Rothesay are peaceful, windswept Hebridean vistas. The West Island Way 
runs the length of the island, providing good, waymarked footpaths through the 
hills. At Kingarth, near the southernmost tip of Bute, I passed the ruined 
monastery of Saint Blane, hidden in a green fold in the hills: among stone 
arches sit the graves of monks slaughtered by Viking raiders. Forking down to 
the road, I stopped for a picnic on a bench under a wind-blown tree. The ridges 
of a prehistoric hill fort jutted against the sea, with the mountains of Arran 
rising mistily in the distance.

We spent another day touring the island’s beaches. There’s Ettrick, the most 
popular, with its busy tea-room, where we bought lovely ice-cream cones; St 
Ninians, where I picked rose quartz pebbles from the beach – there’s also a 
small campsite here; Scalpsie, a broad bay shimmering with wildflowers; and 
Kilchattan, with its steep hill and friendly pub at Kingarth.

The island is big on renewables, and self-sufficiency. Local charity Fyne 
Futures <http://www.fynefutures.org.uk/blog/tag/charity/> runs a large organic 
market garden in Rothesay, where knowledgeable young men cultivate several 
local heritage vegetables, plenty of kale and raspberries, and even a healthy 
looking kiwi vine. I took a bag of produce home, but boxes can be ordered for 
delivery during your stay.

We also bought island lamb from Macqueens 
<https://www.scottish-island-quality-meats.com/> butchers on Bishop Street in 
Rothesay. Nearby,Ritchie’s <http://www.ritchiesofrothesay.co.uk/> smokehouse 
sells smoked fish and cheese, and theBute Brew Company 
<http://www.butebrewco.co.uk/contactvisit-us/> provides a range of beers. It 
was fun to prepare meals in the kitchen of our converted stable on the estate. 
Because half of the stables are in use, our meals were punctuated by visits 
from the chickens, and a gentle soundtrack of snorting pigs.

There are some good eating out options, too. Sunday lunch (£16) at the Mount 
Stuart restaurant was superb: smoked salmon mousse with apple jelly, roast 
chicken with veg, and a cranachan millefeuille with lemon curd. All the dishes 
used local produce and were served in a modernist glass room that felt like a 
treehouse, situated above the new visitor centre at the entrance to the estate. 
Some of the island’s younger residents arrived from Syria work here.

 Liz’s Diner, on the seafront in Rothesay 
In Rothesay, my favourite place was Liz’s Diner 
<https://www.facebook.com/Lizs-Diner-197458330594604/>, by the seafront. It’s 
an American-style diner with tasty burgers (£3), apple pie milkshakes (£3), and 
great service.

I’ll look forward to coming back to Bute again, and seeing how it’s changed. 
For all its ancient monuments and rich Victorian heritage, it seems like a 
place that’s happy to face 21st-century challenges with a smile.

Way to go
