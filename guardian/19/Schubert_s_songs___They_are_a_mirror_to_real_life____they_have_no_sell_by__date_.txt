The song that means the most to you
In Aldeburgh in 1977, some months after Benjamin Britten’s death, Sir Peter 
Pears sang Schubert’s Die Taubenpost (D965) for which Britten had often been 
the tenor’s matchless pianist. Schubert’s last song is about a faithful 
carrier-pigeon, a poetic metaphor for the singer’s longing. On the final page 
we hear the word “Sehnsucht” twice, the second inflected with a change of 
harmony that breaks the heart. At this point, 12 bars from the end, Pears 
suddenly stopped; overcome, he left the stage in tears. The music remained 
suspended in the air, beautiful beyond description, yet incomplete, eerily 
symbolic of the foreshortening of two great composers’ lives.
Schubert’s Die Taubenpost, Peter Pears and Benjamin Britten 
Which Schubert song do you find the most technically challenging?
The little-known Schober setting Schiffers Scheidelied D910. The accompaniment 
bristles with stormy oscillations of semiquavers in both hands that rarely 
desist. It is sheerly a question of wrist and arm stamina (the song has nine 
long verses, not all of which even Fischer-Dieskau recorded). Compared to this, 
Erlkönig is a doddle.
Schubert’s Schiffers Scheidelied D910, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Gerald 
Moore 
... and is there a hidden gem you’d like to recommend?
Die Gebüsche D649 to a poem by Friedrich von Schlegel that stands at the core 
of German romanticism – Schumann quotes a verse of it at the head of his great 
C major piano Fantasie. The melody is not one of Schubert’s great tunes, at 
first the gently arpeggiated accompaniment seems of little import, but the song 
encompasses a wealth of harmonic subtlety and emotional depth. Easy to 
underestimate, difficult to get right, this is pantheistic Schubert, mystical 
and enraptured.

What’s your most poignant memory performing or listening to a Schubert song?
Schubert’s songs are a mirror to real life. There really is nothing highbrow 
about this music, the songs have no sell-by date with respect to the human 
condition either. Manners and culture change endlessly over time. Human nature 
never will. A song will affect me most of all when it resonates with my own 
little round life. Marriage: the death of a friend. The birth of a child. A 
walk in the forest. Watching the sky; the moon... All life, and the daily 
business of living, falls within the remit of Schubert’s towering genius. I 
might choose An den Mond in einer Herbstnacht. Each new theme ambushes the ear 
and the heart alike. A discourse which, like a finger on a wine glass, sings 
out to my gypsy life. They say that philosophy is only common-sense in a 
tail-cat. To look up at a starry night. To contemplate our existence and all 
the what-ifs in between. The gentle meanderings of this song, musing on the 
privilege of being on this beautiful Earth.
Schubert’s An Den Mond D193, Christian Gerhaher and Gerold Huber 
Which of his songs do you find most technically challenging?
The beauty and the curse, of all performing arts is that each performance is 
as different from another as night from day. What may be the smoothest of casts 
one year, is a bird’s nest the next! The hardest part for me, is to project a 
simple song, but still to allow the emotional undercurrents: codes and 
messages, to course-along, just beneath the surface. To that end, I might elect 
An mein Klavier. Thanking the “silent partner”, as it were, the piano, for her 
unstinting partnership.

Which hidden gem should we listen to?
‎Im Haine. This wind-up music-box of a song puts me in mind of a day’s walk in 
the mountains. Whistling a happy and aimless tune in time to my laboured 
breathing. The little mechanical melody reels-on to two false summits. A 
resolution is always just out of sight.
Schubert’s Im Haine D738, Simon Keenlyside and Malcom Martineau

What’s your most poignant memory performing or listening to a Schubert song?
Schubert’s songs can be poignant at different moments as the subject matter of 
the poetry is so diverse. I’ve always found Der Vater mit dem Kind very 
touching as it deals unusually with the bond between a father and baby in a 
very sensitive way; Schubert’s response is sublime.
Schubert’s Der Vater mit dem Kind D906, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Gerald 
Moore 
Which song do you find the most technically challenging?
Sometimes the simplest looking songs can be the most challenging; trying to 
achieve the perfect diminuendo at the top of the scale in Du bist die Ruh can 
be testing – not least because it happens twice.

Which hidden gem should we listen to?
I can discover songs by accident when trying to fill a specific gap in a 
recital programme. Researching the seasons of the year, I found one I’d not 
previously encountered – Der Winterabend. I couldn’t believe that I’d never 
heard it before – it’s tender, heartfelt and beautiful. But I also know there 
are so many other songs left for me to discover and I look forward to the 
journey.

What’s your most poignant memory performing or listening to a Schubert song?
I was introduced to lieder by a wonderful teacher in Cape Town who read us the 
poem Gute Nacht and played the opening from Winterreise where Schubert set the 
poem to music. From that moment I was hooked. Gute Nacht in particular will 
always hold a special place for me, as it was my introduction to this magical 
world.

Which Schubert song do you find the most technically challenging?
A seemingly simple song like Frühlingsglaube, D686 which opens with a very 
simple, hymn-like, beautiful melody is actually hugely technically demanding. 
Creating a seamless, luxurious and fluid legato on the piano takes a lot of 
control and hard work, but in the end you get to play a glorious melody, so the 
hard work is more than worth it!
Schubert’s Frühlingsglaube D686, Anneliese Rothenberger and Gerald Moore 
Which hidden gem should we listen to?
An mein Klavier. D342 is a magical little song and a charming poem. It is a 
hymn of thanks to the mellow-toned piano. I guarantee you it will make you 
smile.
Schubert’s An mein Klavier D342, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Geoffrey Parsons

What’s your most poignant memory performing or listening to a Schubert song?
His songs always have the potential to surprise me however well I know them 
each time singing and sometimes listening to Schubert songs contains the 
greatest moment if you find it in yourself

Which of his songs do you find the most technically challenging?
Some of his very early songs demand a rather unrealistic vocal range which 
even with today’s high technical singing standards cannot easily be satisfied.

Which hidden gem should we listen to? 
Die Vögel, where it says: “Die Menschen sind töricht sie können nicht fliegen” 
– people are silly, they cannot fly.
Schubert’s Die Vögel D691, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Gerald Moore 
Ian Bostridge

What’s your most poignant memory performing or listening to a Schubert song?
Schubert song has a lot of death in it, and long before he himself became 
mortally ill. It’s partly a question of cultural norms, and partly one of 
personal predisposition. His music, even or perhaps especially his music with 
words, speaks of the unsayable in the most extraordinary way. So of course, I 
remember singing some of the songs for friends who have died. Most recently, 
Nacht und Träume.

Which song do you find the most technically challenging? 
Du bist du Ruh is a beautiful song, one of the most beautiful, but it ends 
with a sustained decrescendo on a rising high note. Really quite tricky.
Schubert’s Du bist die Ruh D776, Ian Bostridge and Julius Drake 
Which hidden gem should we listen to? 
Another song about death – Schwestergruss. One of Schubert’s friends had a 
sister who died. The friend wrote a poem about her revisiting earth as a spirit 
- rather mawkish to modern taste - and Schubert made of it one of his most 
sublime songs. There’s a wonderful recording by Janet Baker.
Schubert’s Schwestergruß D762, Janet Baker and Gerald Moore

What’s your most poignant memory performing or listening to a Schubert song? 
I was deeply moved by my first all-Schubert song recital recently with Ian 
Bostridge at the Schubertiade in Austria. It felt to me like this could be all 
I do in my future artistic life. Other than that I still have strong memories 
of being introduced to Winterreise at school. It made me addicted to this 
incredible work for life.

Which Schubert song do find the most technically challenging?
I’m speaking as pianist of course: Definitely Erlkönig. What a nightmare!
Schubert’s Erlkönig D328, Thomas Quasthoff and Charles Spencer 
Which hidden gem would you suggest we listen to? 
Maybe not such a hidden gem for real Schubertians, but for me it was a rather 
recent discovery: Einsamkeit D620. What an incredible attempt at describing all 
the emotional factors of life in one work.

What’s your most poignant memory performing or listening to a Schubert song? 
Feodor Chaliapin singing Death and the Maiden in Russian and with a big 
orchestra. It is from a Schubert song collection from 1890-1940: it’s wonderful 
to see how free singers were in their interpretation in those days.
Schubert’s Der Tod und das Mädchen D531, Feodor Chaliapin 
Which Schubert song is most technically challenging to you, and why? 
Probably Die Sterne, because musically somehow you never touch ground but 
still you have to stay physically connected in order to get into this floating 
mode!!

Which hidden gem should we listen to? 
My personal favourite is Florio. It’s a very simple song but it came into my 
life when I just happened to be open to its poetry and Schubert’s incredible 
harmonic journey.
Schubert’s Lied des Florio D857, Angelika Kirchschlager and Helmut Deutsch
