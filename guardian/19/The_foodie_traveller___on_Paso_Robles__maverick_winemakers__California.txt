In a warehouse south of downtown Paso Robles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/17/california-paso-robles-wine-route-top-10-guide>
, California, Stewart McLennan is serving wine straight from the barrel, his 
voice echoing across the concrete floors as he pours a generous splash of 
cabernet.

The atmosphere isn’t what you’d find among the oak-shaded vineyards and 
elegant tasting rooms more typical of California’s central coast. But it’s 
here, in an industrial zone called Tin City, that some of the area’s most 
intriguing, often experimental, wines are being created by ultra-small-batch 
producers.

Down by the train tracks, McLennan’s winery produces a line called Golden 
Triangle <http://goldentrianglewines.com/>, with cab franc, syrah, and cabernet 
grapes sourced from vineyards on Paso Robles’ westside.

I rarely turn down a glass of red, but I’m no wine expert. Even so, the tastes 
McLennan serves me are diverse and exciting, far from the typical tasting-room 
fare.

Paso is a town with a pioneer spirit, so it’s not surprising that independent, 
renegade winemakers are flourishing here. Most, like McLennan, offer tastings 
by appointment, but if you’d like to see what’s being produced in warehouses 
and small family-owned vineyards across the region, more than 50 tiny wineries 
will unite for the annualGaragiste Festival <http://californiagaragistes.com/>, 
from November 5-7, which McLennan co-founded five years ago.

Ryan Pease from winery Paix Sur Terre <http://www.paixsurterrewines.com/> will 
be pouring his line of mourvèdre at this year’s event, and he says the festival 
is unique in bringing together “people who have built things from the ground 
up,” whether they’re making wine on the side while working a full-time job or 
are professionals using top-notch facilities.

 Paso Robles wine country 
Garagiste is a French term originally used in Bordeaux to describe independent 
winemakers working in garages or other rustic facilities. Paso’s garagistes 
aren’t really working in their garages, but all are very small (producing fewer 
than 1,500 cases a year) and many are breaking away from industry traditions.

 Some experiment with unusual techniques, like whole-stem inclusion or 
extended macerations. Others produce “blends you wouldn’t normally find and 
that aren’t permitted,” McLennan says, like the unorthodox 2010 Deno 
Grenache-Zinfandel blend that will be served at the festival’s opening-night 
winemaker dinner – a wine McLennan assures me is “awesome.”
