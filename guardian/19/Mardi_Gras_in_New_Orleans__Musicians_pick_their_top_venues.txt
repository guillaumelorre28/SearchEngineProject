As recommended by blues and funk legend Ernie Vincent 
This Frenchmen Street staple is a local favourite. The wood-panelled bar has a 
Caribbean shack vibe about it and there's an extensive craft beer list and 
whisky selection scribbled on the chalkboard. Music stars from country singer 
Jimmy Buffet to Stevie Wonder have graced the stage, as have bands such asHot 8 
Brass Band <http://www.hot8brassband.com>, who featured in Spike Lee's film 
When the Levees Broke <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqCQVVvNASE>. It's an 
intimate venue where the performers will share a drink with you between sets. 
The place is packed with locals of all ages, especially old rockers who've been 
coming here for years. Head to the dance floor and dance the night away.

As recommended by composer and performer Harold Battiste Jr, who penned hits 
for Sam Cooke and set up the first black owned record label in the South, AFO 
records
Pull up at the bar for an authentic jazz experience with music legend Ellis 
Marsalis <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6RFV_nMf88>, who plays most Fridays 
and was inducted into theLouisiana Music Hall of Fame <> in 2008. Arrive early 
to enjoy the creole style food, from the Snug Harbor gumbo to a shrimp po-boy 
(a baguette filled with fried fish and a rich sauce). There are music greats on 
stage every night, such asDavell Crawford 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhLoZFeQEag>, "the Piano Prince of New 
Orleans", who is a regular crowd puller. The two-level seating makes it easy to 
watch the TV screens at the bar, or upstairs where it's happening live. The 
building's allure lays in its rustic charm, with wooden chairs and signs, a 
world away from the neon lights and cheesy cover bands that are found a few 
blocks up on Bourbon Street.

Irvin Mayfield Jazz Playhouse
 Irvin Mayfield on stage at the Jazz Playhouse 
As recommended by trombonist Glen David Andrews who was born and raised on 
traditional jazz in Treme
Duck under the hotel's traditional southern-style balconies with French 
shutter windows and head into this charming, dim-lit lounge bar. While the 
Playhouse is only about four years old, the land dates back to the 1700s, and 
it's quite fitting that it used to be a brewery.
The Grammy award-winning trumpeter who plays here, Irvin Mayfield 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiIRvoAULVo>, co-owns the bar and even though 
it's on Bourbon Street it's unlike most of its neighbouring bars, with their 
cheesy cover bands and cheap drink deals. If you get here early, head for the 
best seats right by the edge of the stage, where you can see the baby grand 
piano up close. If Irvin's not in town, don't worry, local up-and-coming 
artists as well as legends like theLeroy Jones Quintet 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woRQf6rByXw> play here. The performers rarely 
take breaks, so you are encouraged to tip well, which you won't mind because 
there is no cover, but there is a one-drink minimum. Also, the no-cover fee can 
make it tricky to get a seat sometimes, but you can always head to the mini 
dance floor by the stage. The décor-rich, dramatic draped maroon curtains help 
make the show feel intimate and the performers love to chat – this is not a 
stuffy venue.

VASO club

As recommended by singer Zena Moses, born and raised in New Orleans
Come for the music. This venue is located on the corner of Frenchmen Street, 
which is packed with great music bars frequented by locals. It hosts the 
Thursday residency for the band -Zena Moses and Rue Fiya 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlvViUsIzDU>, who play a mix of soul, funk and 
blues. It's a large space, with French windows that open on to the street so 
the blend of sounds from the green back-lit stage pour out. Inside it's a 
crumbling, exposed brick wall venue where local musicians offer a mixed bag of 
sounds from rap to jazz – like the city's gumbo you never know what flavour you 
will get on any given night. Better still, it has no cover charge.
• 500 Frenchmen Street, no website, open daily 11am-3pm then Wed 9pm-3am. 
Thurs 8pm-3am, Fri- 6pm-4.30am, Sat 7pm- 4.30am

A second line parade

As recommended by Nine Times Social & Pleasure Club, a 9th Ward musical 
community group
Locals need no excuse to party; the regular year-long second lines and parades 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TviGgyEGDFs> are a great example of this. Set 
up by various social aid and pleasure clubs, the parades that travel through 
different designated areas of the city are all about singing and dancing. Each 
club has a colour, decorated parasols and plume feathers which are waved 
alongside the brass bands, followed by hundreds of revellers. The second line 
parades also reinforce a real sense of community. This specific club goes 
through the Ninth Ward, raising funds for rebuilding efforts while putting on 
an amazing show.
• Upcoming Parades include: Treme Sidewalk Steppers Parade on Sun 17 Feb from 
2pm-4pm and Cross The Canal Steppers Parade Sun 24 Feb from 12pm-4pm. For more
