Gayle, 36, had just been dismissed having scored 41 off 15 balls in the 
Melbourne Renegades’ victory over the Hobart Hurricanes in theBig Bash League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/big-bash-league> when he was approached for 
comments by the Network Ten journalist Mel McLaughlin.

She began by asking him about his innings but he quickly steered the 
conversation away from cricket, saying: “I just wanted to have an interview 
with you as well, that’s why I batted so well.”

He then added: “Your eyes are beautiful, hopefully we can win this game and 
then we can have a drink after as well. Don’t blush, baby.”

McLaughlin attempted to laugh off the invitation by saying: “I’m not blushing.”

Gayle’s attitude attracted a welter of criticism on Twitter, though Network 
Ten did not help the situation when it described the West Indian batsman’s 
approach as “smooth” in a tweet that was then deleted.

On Tuesday morning Channel 10 boss David Barham told Melbourne’s 3AW radio 
station 
<http://www.3aw.com.au/news/west-indian-cricket-star-chris-gayle-is-under-fire-for-controversial-comments-20160104-glzbd5.html>
 Gayle’s comments had left McLaughlin angry and upset .

“She was a bit angry … angry and upset I suppose,” Barham said. “She was 
asking him legitimate questions about cricket and he ended up talking about her 
eyes.”

Anthony Everard, the head of the Big Bash League, tweeted to say 
<https://twitter.com/BigBashLeagueHQ/status/683988698367528960>: “I heard 
Chris’s comments and they’re disrespectful and simply inappropriate. We’ll 
certainly be talking to him and the Renegades about it. This league is all 
about it’s appeal to kids, families and females. There’s just no place in the 
BBL – or for that matter cricket anywhere – for that sort of behaviour.”

The Renegades chief executive, Stuart Coventry, said. “We’ll certainly be 
talking to him in association with Cricket Australia about it. There’s just no 
place for that sort of behaviour.”

Andrew Flintoff, a Ten commentator, was also unimpressed, tweeting 
<https://twitter.com/flintoff11/status/683969638204571648>: “Well played 
@Mel_Mclaughlin !! Big fan of @henrygayle but made himself look a bit of a chop 
there @tensporttv #bbl05.”

Australian sports journalists posted mostly scathing reactions to Gayle’s 
comments, including Fox Sports broadcaster Neroli Meadows, a former colleague 
of McLaughlin.

Not clever. Not funny. Not original. How about just let a fine broadcaster do 
her job.

Carly Adno, a sports journalist with Sydney’s Daily Telegraph, and the veteran 
ABC broadcaster Debbie Spillane were similarly unimpressed.

Not smooth or clever from @henrygayle <https://twitter.com/henrygayle>. Just 
going for cheap laughs.@Mel_Mclaughlin <https://twitter.com/Mel_Mclaughlin> 
wasn't playing. Her professionalism re-inforced.

But Gayle found at least one defender in the TV presenter Piers Morgan.
Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) 
I'm absolutely outraged that everyone's so absolutely outraged by @henrygayle 
<https://twitter.com/henrygayle> being a bit cheeky to a female TV reporter.
