Pochettino has watched in amazement as leading players have signed for clubs 
in China – and many more have been the subject of lucrative offers, including 
Costa.

Chelsea fear the striker has been tempted by the proposal from an unnamed 
Chinese club, which would pay him £30m a year and Antonio Conte left him out of 
the squad who won at Leicester City on Saturday. Conte insisted after the game 
that it wasbecause Costa had a back injury

.

Pochettino said the Chinese had “broken” the market with their ability to make 
such extraordinary offers and he suggested that when such money was on the 
table it was difficult to refuse. Thankfully for him, none of his players has 
been  targeted.

“Have there been any offers from China for my players? No,” Pochettino said. 
“My reaction to the Costa story was indifference because, luckily, it is not my 
problem. What can you do when an offer like this arrives from a country that is 
like this? It’s crazy money. It looks like they broke the market. If the offer 
to Costa is true, it’s unbelievable, unbelievable. But we will see what 
happens.”

Pochettino believes the atmosphere he has created at Spurs means his players 
are focused on the prize of the Premier League trophy and nothing else.

behind the leaders, Chelsea.

“We are together, every player is happy and part of our Tottenham family, and 
we have a very good atmosphere around the club,” Pochettino said.

“Our supporters are amazing and there is a very good mix between the 
supporters, the players and the staff. It’s amazing, day by day, how we feel 
and how we live at the training ground – that is an important thing, in the 
end, to try to win big things. It’s an advantage for us.”

Pochettino will take his team to Manchester City on Saturday in confident 
mood, saying Spurs fear no one. “We are showing after 21 games we can compete 
with everybody and we are in a very good position,” he said. “It is true the 
gap with Chelsea is still big but there are a lot of games ahead until the end 
of the season.”
