PS: It’s also worth noting that the oil price has hit a one-month high, with 
Brent crude trading around $48.12 per barrel. Persistent speculation that the 
OPEC cartel might actually agree a production freeze are the main factor.City

London stock market closes at 14-month high.

Hello again. Just popping back to record that Britain’s FTSE 100 closed at a 
new 14-month high tonight. The index of blue-chip shares ended the day 25 
points higher, at 6,941 - as the weak pound benefited international firms like 
mining group Anglo American (up 1.8%) and Glaxo (up 1.2%).

Newsflash: the Bank of England has successfully bought £1.17bn of UK 
government bonds, as part of its new stimulus programme.

So, no repeat of last week’s failed reserve auction, when the BoE couldn’t 
prise enough long-dated bonds out of their owners’ clutches.

However.... today’s auction was for bonds of 3 to 7-years maturity, not the 
longer dated stuff. That auction is taking place tomorrow....

US Empire survey misses forecasts

A closely watched survey of US business confidence in the New York area has 
come in way below forecasts, giving us another reason to worry.


The Empire Manufacturing index slumped to -4.21 this month, down from +0.55 in 
July. Economists had expected it to rise to 2.00; instead, firms in the area 
warned that work conditions have weakened.

Lloyds passes rate cut onto mortgage holders (and savers are next....)

Remember Mark Carney’s warning on 4 August that lenders had no excuses not to 
pass on the cut in interest rates to 0.25% to borrowers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/lenders-svr-urged-pass-on-interest-rate-cut-bank-of-england>
?

Lloyds Banking Group has finally responded, saying it will pass on the full 
cut to all mortgage customers on its variable-rates deals.

It’s significant, as Lloyds is the largest lender in the country since the 
takeover of HBOS during the crisis. Here are the new rates:

Halifax Homeowner Variable Rate –3.99% currently - falls to 3.74% as does the 
Halifax Standard Variable Rate and the Lloyds Bank Homeowner Variable Rate. 
This is thought to affect around a third of its 3 million mortgage customers.

The bank, 9% owned by taxpayers, is also warning savers that they will take a 
hit. It is not immediately clear what the scale of the cut will be.

The bank said.


“We will not make any changes to our savings rates for existing customers 
until we have reduced our mortgage reversionary rates (Halifax Homeowner 
Variable Rate, Halifax Standard Variable Rate and Lloyds Bank Homeowner 
Variable Rate) with effect from 1 October 2016”

Pound falls ahead of Brexit healthcheck

The pound is losing ground against the US dollar, as well as the euro.

Sterling just hit a one-month low of $1.2883, as traders hunker down ahead of 
some crucial economic data that may show the impact of the Brexit vote.

Tomorrow we get July’s inflation report, followed by unemployment surveys on 
Wednesday and then July’s retail sales figures on Thursday.

Ana Thaker, Market Economist at PhillipCapital UK, explains why it matters:

This week’s data is a crucial set as it is some of the first to cover the 
entire month of July and take into account the full effect ofBrexit on the UK 
economy.

Sterling looks to have significant downside risk this week as hedge funds 
increase bearish bets on the currency in the futures market with contracts 
topping levels last seen in 1992.

Whilst we cannot always rely on hedge funds to get it right, market sentiment 
has declined for Sterling and may do so further as more economic data is 
released.

Sports Direct workers get £1m backpay

Good news for Sports Direct workers!

The retail chain has coughed up £1m in backpay for employees who received less 
than the minimum wage, due to its policy of compulsory searches after their 
shifts had finished.

The payments, which could be worth £1,000 each, follow a Guardian 
investigation into working practices at Sports Direct’s warehouse - which also 
prompted a parliamentary investigation.

Simon Goodley reports:

The agreement, which is understood to have been struck between the union Unite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite>, the retailer and HM Revenue & 
Customs, includes workers directly employed by Sports Direct and staff hired 
through temporary employment agencies. Two agencies, The Best Connection and 
Transline, provide most of the 3,000 workers in the company’s warehouse in 
Shirebrook, Derbyshire.

Payments are expected to begin to be made from the end of this month.

Those familiar with the deal, however, say that 1,700 Transline agency workers 
may initially receive half the back pay they are owed, because the agency is 
refusing to refund unpaid wages from before it took over contracts from a rival 
agency two years ago.

Market pushed up by stimulus talk

The prospect of fresh government action to stimulate economic growth has 
pushed global stocks higher.

Britain’s FTSE 100 has settled at a new 14-month high, while other European 
markets are at their best levels since the EU referendum.

Only Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> is missing out on the 
rally, following its disappointing growth figures.
 European stock markets today Photograph: Thomson Reuters  Asian stock markets

The mood in the City is pretty quiet, frankly, as we’re now deep into the 
August slowdown.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says that the prospect of yet more 
central bank action is pushing money into shares:


The month of August typically exhibits the lowest volumes of the summer and 
given the fact that today marks assumption day across Europe, we are looking 
likely to see a more unpredictable day.

With the Bank of England’s recent QE programme, coupled with heightened 
expectations of action from the Bank of Japan, there is a clear underlying 
bullish sentiment for stocks, with investors favouring stocks in this low 
interest rate environment.

Pound hits three-year low against the euro

The pound has slipped to a new three-year low against the euro this morning, 
as Brexit angst continues to weigh it down.

Sterling fell to €1.1555 against the single currency, its lowest level since 
2013.

That means it has shed almost 12% since Britain voted to leave the EU - 
something for holidaymakers to ponder as they head over the Channel....

Apart from that, the foreign exchange markets are pretty quiet:

Santander halves 123 interest rate

Customers at banking giant Santander are waking up to the news that their 123 
current account just became rather less lucrative.


Santander has slashed the interest rate on the account to 1.5%, from 3%, 
following the Bank of England’s decision to slash benchmark borrowing costs to 
0.25%.

PS: It’s also worth noting that the oil price has hit a one-month high, with 
Brent crude trading around $48.12 per barrel. Persistent speculation that the 
OPEC cartel might actually agree a production freeze are the main factor.City

Hello again. Just popping back to record that Britain’s FTSE 100 closed at a 
new 14-month high tonight. The index of blue-chip shares ended the day 25 
points higher, at 6,941 - as the weak pound benefited international firms like 
mining group Anglo American (up 1.8%) and Glaxo (up 1.2%).
 
OK, we seem to have run out of news for the day. And it’s sunny out there. So 
I’m wrapping up for the day, but we’ll be back it anything important happens....

Newsflash: the Bank of England has successfully bought £1.17bn of UK 
government bonds, as part of its new stimulus programme.

So, no repeat of last week’s failed reserve auction, when the BoE couldn’t 
prise enough long-dated bonds out of their owners’ clutches.

However.... today’s auction was for bonds of 3 to 7-years maturity, not the 
longer dated stuff. That auction is taking place tomorrow....
 
The US stock market has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading, 
despite the weak Empire manufacturing report.

The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all ticked up to 
new all-time highs, expending last week’s rally.

A closely watched survey of US business confidence in the New York area has 
come in way below forecasts, giving us another reason to worry.


The Empire Manufacturing index slumped to -4.21 this month, down from +0.55 in 
July. Economists had expected it to rise to 2.00; instead, firms in the area 
warned that work conditions have weakened.

Remember Mark Carney’s warning on 4 August that lenders had no excuses not to 
pass on the cut in interest rates to 0.25% to borrowers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/lenders-svr-urged-pass-on-interest-rate-cut-bank-of-england>
?

Lloyds Banking Group has finally responded, saying it will pass on the full 
cut to all mortgage customers on its variable-rates deals.

It’s significant, as Lloyds is the largest lender in the country since the 
takeover of HBOS during the crisis. Here are the new rates:

Halifax Homeowner Variable Rate –3.99% currently - falls to 3.74% as does the 
Halifax Standard Variable Rate and the Lloyds Bank Homeowner Variable Rate. 
This is thought to affect around a third of its 3 million mortgage customers.

The bank, 9% owned by taxpayers, is also warning savers that they will take a 
hit. It is not immediately clear what the scale of the cut will be.

The bank said.


“We will not make any changes to our savings rates for existing customers 
until we have reduced our mortgage reversionary rates (Halifax Homeowner 
Variable Rate, Halifax Standard Variable Rate and Lloyds Bank Homeowner 
Variable Rate) with effect from 1 October 2016”
 
The pound is losing ground against the US dollar, as well as the euro.

Sterling just hit a one-month low of $1.2883, as traders hunker down ahead of 
some crucial economic data that may show the impact of the Brexit vote.

Tomorrow we get July’s inflation report, followed by unemployment surveys on 
Wednesday and then July’s retail sales figures on Thursday.

Ana Thaker, Market Economist at PhillipCapital UK, explains why it matters:

This week’s data is a crucial set as it is some of the first to cover the 
entire month of July and take into account the full effect ofBrexit on the UK 
economy.

Sterling looks to have significant downside risk this week as hedge funds 
increase bearish bets on the currency in the futures market with contracts 
topping levels last seen in 1992.

Whilst we cannot always rely on hedge funds to get it right, market sentiment 
has declined for Sterling and may do so further as more economic data is 
released.
 
Good news for Sports Direct workers!

The retail chain has coughed up £1m in backpay for employees who received less 
than the minimum wage, due to its policy of compulsory searches after their 
shifts had finished.

The payments, which could be worth £1,000 each, follow a Guardian 
investigation into working practices at Sports Direct’s warehouse - which also 
prompted a parliamentary investigation.

Simon Goodley reports:

The agreement, which is understood to have been struck between the union Unite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite>, the retailer and HM Revenue & 
Customs, includes workers directly employed by Sports Direct and staff hired 
through temporary employment agencies. Two agencies, The Best Connection and 
Transline, provide most of the 3,000 workers in the company’s warehouse in 
Shirebrook, Derbyshire.

Payments are expected to begin to be made from the end of this month.

Those familiar with the deal, however, say that 1,700 Transline agency workers 
may initially receive half the back pay they are owed, because the agency is 
refusing to refund unpaid wages from before it took over contracts from a rival 
agency two years ago.

The prospect of fresh government action to stimulate economic growth has 
pushed global stocks higher.

Britain’s FTSE 100 has settled at a new 14-month high, while other European 
markets are at their best levels since the EU referendum.

Only Japan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan> is missing out on the 
rally, following its disappointing growth figures.

The mood in the City is pretty quiet, frankly, as we’re now deep into the 
August slowdown.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says that the prospect of yet more 
central bank action is pushing money into shares:


The month of August typically exhibits the lowest volumes of the summer and 
given the fact that today marks assumption day across Europe, we are looking 
likely to see a more unpredictable day.

With the Bank of England’s recent QE programme, coupled with heightened 
expectations of action from the Bank of Japan, there is a clear underlying 
bullish sentiment for stocks, with investors favouring stocks in this low 
interest rate environment.
 
The pound has slipped to a new three-year low against the euro this morning, 
as Brexit angst continues to weigh it down.

Sterling fell to €1.1555 against the single currency, its lowest level since 
2013.

That means it has shed almost 12% since Britain voted to leave the EU - 
something for holidaymakers to ponder as they head over the Channel....

Apart from that, the foreign exchange markets are pretty quiet:

Customers at banking giant Santander are waking up to the news that their 123 
current account just became rather less lucrative.


Santander has slashed the interest rate on the account to 1.5%, from 3%, 
following the Bank of England’s decision to slash benchmark borrowing costs to 
0.25%.
