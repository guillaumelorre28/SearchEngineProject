Root vegetables are cheap and abundant in winter, but they’re often underrated 
and, as a result, underused. They are the less showy cousins of our summery veg 
stars, full of fibre and very versatile. This week, I’ve been cooking with 
parsnips, which are one of my favourite parts of Christmas lunch: caramelised, 
chewy, soft and sweet after a good roasting nestled in among the potatoes. But 
they’re good for everyday cooking, too: bake them in cream for a gratin, and 
serve them with something appley – their perfect match. Or grate them raw and 
use in a salad or in a gloriously moist sponge cake with an indecently good 
burnt butter icing.

Parsnip gratin with apple allioli

The apple brings a hint of sweetness to this rich and velvety allioli, which 
melts all over the piping-hot, creamy gratin. Serves six.

750g parsnips, peeled
1 garlic clove, peeled and halved
15g butter
125ml double cream
125ml creme fraiche
200ml whole milk
6 sprigs thyme, leaves picked
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
75g ground almonds
1-2 tbsp extra-virgin olive (or rapeseed) oil, to drizzle

For the apple allioli
2 apples, peeled, cored and cut into chunks
2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
3 tbsp cider vinegar
200ml mild olive oil

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Thinly slice two-thirds of the peeled 
parsnip (use a mandoline, if you have one) and coarsely grate the rest. Rub 
both cut sides of the garlic around a medium-sized baking dish, then smear it 
all over with the butter. Arrange the parsnip slices in rows over the base of 
the dish, overlapping slightly. Once you’ve used up all the slices, scatter the 
grated parsnip on top.

In a bowl, whisk the cream, creme fraiche, milk and thyme leaves, then season 
with a teaspoon of salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Pour this 
over the parsnips, making sure they’re just submerged, then sprinkle the ground 
almonds all over the top. Drizzle with oil, cover the dish with foil and roast 
for 15 minutes. Remove the foil, lower the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and 
cook another half-hour, until the cream has been absorbed, the top is golden 
and the parsnips are tender.

While the parsnips are roasting, make the allioli. Put the apple chunks in a 
small pan, cover with water and cook on a medium heat for about eight minutes, 
until the fruit is soft. Drain, then transfer to a food processor with the 
garlic and vinegar, and whizz to a puree. With the motor running, start adding 
the oil a drop at a time, until you’ve added about a third, then increase your 
speed of pouring, first to a trickle and then to a slow, steady stream, until 
you have used up all the oil. Season generously to taste and serve in a bowl 
alongside the gratin.

The burnt butter in the icing gives it a salty, nutty richness that is a 
lovely counterbalance to the sweet sponge. Serves 10.

250g unsalted butter, softened
250g caster sugar
4 eggs
275g parsnips, peeled and finely grated 
1 apple, peeled and finely grated
250g white spelt flour, sifted
2 heaped tsp baking powder
1 tsp ground mixed spice
1 tsp salt

For the icing
250g unsalted butter
Juice of ½ lemon
250g icing sugar
50ml milk
6 tbsp maple syrup
50g roast hazelnuts, roughly chopped

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4, and butter and line a 23cm cake tin.

In a food processor or mixer, beat the butter and sugar until pale and light. 
Beat in the eggs one at a time, then fold in the parsnips and apple, followed 
by the flour, baking powder, mixed spice and salt. Pour into the tin and bake 
in the middle of the oven for 40-45 minutes, until golden and a skewer comes 
out clean.

Meanwhile, make the icing. Melt the butter in a light-coloured saucepan (so 
you can see the base and keep track of it changing colour) on a medium heat. 
Cook, swirling the pan now and then, for eight to 14 minutes (the timing will 
depend on the size of the pan) and watching it like a hawk after about five 
minutes. When the butter begins to foam up, turn from golden to toast-brown and 
smell a bit nutty, take the pan off the heat and squeeze in the lemon to stop 
it cooking further (it’ll bubble up a little, so take care). Pour into a bowl 
to cool, then chill until solid.

With an electric whisk, beat the solid butter until fluffy and pale, then 
incorporate the icing sugar and milk bit by bit, alternating the two.

When the cake is completely cool, cut it in half through the middle and 
drizzle the cut sides with two tablespoons each of maple syrup. Spread half the 
icing over the bottom half of the cake and top with the other half of cake. 
Spread the remaining the icing on top, then drizzle with the remaining two 
tablespoons of syrup. Before serving, scatter over the hazelnuts. This cake 
stays moist for longer than the average sponge, but it’s still best eaten 
within a few days.

And for the rest of the week…

Leftover gratin is easily reheated, but it’s also good cold from the fridge. 
The allioli is delicious with crisp chicken bits, and also adds a lovely, 
garlicky sweetness to a dressing for a bitter chicory salad (thin it with 
vinegar and olive oil). If you have excess parsnips, cut them into paper-thin 
slices and toss them into a winter salad – with watercress, shallots and 
wafer-thin slices of apple, for example. And leftover burnt butter is delicious 
tossed through steamed spinach.
