Andrew Whitehead has the final word: “Hi Tim, I’m a British Tico living in 
Costa Rica. You have to admit that in another match USA could easily be down to 
nine men as well as 4-0 down. I think it is better to give Costa Rica a bit 
more credit for this score instead of blaming theUSA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> defence!! You wouldn’t 
blame the defence if it was Messi, now, would you?!!

“Can’t be bad - Watching England beat their old enemy 3-0 and now Costa Rica 
beating their enemy 4-0.


“Vamos Ticos!!!!!!!”

Quite so. Good night!

Well, how about that! USA have been given a pasting here. Costa Rica were much 
better, andUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> just 
capitulated in the second half, which means Klinsmann’s team are now bottom of 
the Hex after two games.

An all-round rotten performance from USA, and Costa Rica were wholly clinical. 
USA were OK for an hour, but then it turned into a defensive horror show: 
Brooks, Chandler, Gonzalez and Besler were all culpable at various points. 
Costa Rica were good, but they didn’t have to be amazing. Two goals for Joel 
Campbell, the substitute, one for Bolanos, and one for Venegas, who did very 
well. But that’s a humiliating defeat for USA, and Jürgen will have to answer 
some tough questions.

80 min USA are in disarray here. What an abysmal 15 minutes. They were in the 
game at 1-0, and all of a sudden it’s a thrashing. Campbell streaks clear 
again, but this time Guzan saves. This is awful fromUSA

78 min This is amazing. No pressure on the ball in midfield, Matarrita chipped 
it over the top of the defence, Campbell timed his run perfectly, and he had 
all the time in the world to take a touch and, again, pass it beyond Guzan. 
This is really embarrassing forUSA

75 min It was just a long hump forward, but Brooks didn’t deal with it all. He 
miscontrolled badly, and Campbell was on to it – he nutmegged Brooks, and 
suddenly he was away, clear on goal … and he just passed it into the net. 
Three-nil, and much, much too easy.

69 min Ruiz went clear on the left – but where was Besler? Ruiz crossed with 
the outside of his left foot, Bolanos got ahead of Chandler, and pushed a 
header past Guzan, who couldn’t keep it out. A big 20 minutes for Klinsmann’s 
team.

64 min USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> still not 
quite there yet. But it’s better.

Here’s James Stevenson: “I watched the pre-match pictures from the stadium and 
the crowd was the closest I’ve seen to any group of people come to expressing 
the notion of “well-being”. I know Costa Rica is supposed to be a great place 
and all, but this was really something. They all looked like lovely people 
having a lovely time. It could just be that I’m here in post-truth USA feeling 
sorry for myself, but I don’t think so. I think they have a some kind of life 
secret over there and I want to know what it is … It’s surely more than just 
having a pretty decent football team. Anyone?”

Pura vida, James. Pura vida

56 min Oh, Venegas! That could have been two! It was just a long ball, but 
Venegas got the better of Chandler, and again Guzan kept it out! Poor defending 
from the right-back – his goalie got him out of jail.

47 min USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> could do with 
a little more from their big-time players: Bradley and Jones in particular. 
Venegas goes down the right side for Costa Rica, but it fizzles out.

Gonzalez having to constantly cover out wide. In this case, poorly!”

And here’s Clive Graham: “You are not alone, though I do wonder how many folk 
are following? Slow sports night – but I wasn’t up for pay for view. You are a 
good, cheap date. Thanks for the service – from a newly minted Guardian 
supporter!”

Thanks Clive, you old charmer.

Pretty entertaining stuff, but what a disappointing end to the half from USA. 
Bolanos and Venegas did really well to combine, but Gonzalez and Brooks will be 
unhappy with their contributions: Gonzalez didn’t get close enough to stop the 
cross, and Brooks let Venegas get away from him. Costa Rica have been the 
better team, on balance, but USA were doing fine. Then a couple of sloppy bits 
of play, and they have it all to do. Pulisic looks good, though –USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> should try to feed him as 
often as possible. He’s got the beating of Salvatierra.

See you in a mo for the second half.

44 min Well, Costa Rica, are ahead, and you have to say they deserve it. USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> coughed it up in 
midfield, and Azofeifa switched it to Bolanos on the left side of the box. 
Gonzalez didn’t close the ball quickly enough, Bolanos swung it in, and Venegas 
got ahead of Brooks to flick a header past Guzan. Game on!

41 min Oh, so close! Bobby Wood skinned Waston on the right side, and fired 
one right across the goal – but no one was there to turn it in! It actually 
went behind Navas: Wood just slashed it across the goalline. All it needed was 
a touch.

At the other end, Venegas heads over! Alan Gordon would have buried that.

go long for Bolanos, but it’s out of play on the left side.

37 min Lovely skill from Pulisic to move forward, but a posse of Ticos are 
back to win it off him. Now Jones is booked, and he’ll miss the next match.

Andrew Whitehead has the final word: “Hi Tim, I’m a British Tico living in 
Costa Rica. You have to admit that in another match USA could easily be down to 
nine men as well as 4-0 down. I think it is better to give Costa Rica a bit 
more credit for this score instead of blaming theUSA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> defence!! You wouldn’t 
blame the defence if it was Messi, now, would you?!!

“Can’t be bad - Watching England beat their old enemy 3-0 and now Costa Rica 
beating their enemy 4-0.


“Vamos Ticos!!!!!!!”

Quite so. Good night!
 
Well, how about that! USA have been given a pasting here. Costa Rica were much 
better, andUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> just 
capitulated in the second half, which means Klinsmann’s team are now bottom of 
the Hex after two games.

An all-round rotten performance from USA, and Costa Rica were wholly clinical. 
USA were OK for an hour, but then it turned into a defensive horror show: 
Brooks, Chandler, Gonzalez and Besler were all culpable at various points. 
Costa Rica were good, but they didn’t have to be amazing. Two goals for Joel 
Campbell, the substitute, one for Bolanos, and one for Venegas, who did very 
well. But that’s a humiliating defeat for USA, and Jürgen will have to answer 
some tough questions.
 
That’s the whistle! And a famous win for the Ticos!
 
90 min Two minutes of stoppage time.
 
89 min Wood tries to reach Zusi’s cross, but he’s whistled for a foul. I can’t 
rememberUSA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> really 
testing Navas in this second half.
 
87 min USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> look as 
though they can’t be bothered, which is damning. Not good enough, frankly.
 
85 min Gooch does well to go past Waston, but the ball had gone behind for a 
goal kick. Campbell, meanwhile, is holding his groin.
 
83 min Bryan Ruiz has been excellent, and he’s replaced by Rodney Wallace. 
It’s been amateur hour from theUSA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> in this half.
 
82 min Brooks gets up well from Zusi’s corner, but heads wide. Kljestan is on 
for Jones, incidentally.
 
80 min USA are in disarray here. What an abysmal 15 minutes. They were in the 
game at 1-0, and all of a sudden it’s a thrashing. Campbell streaks clear 
again, but this time Guzan saves. This is awful fromUSA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam>.
 
78 min This is amazing. No pressure on the ball in midfield, Matarrita chipped 
it over the top of the defence, Campbell timed his run perfectly, and he had 
all the time in the world to take a touch and, again, pass it beyond Guzan. 
This is really embarrassing forUSA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> now.
 
Amazing! Campbell again!
 
76 min Fabian Johnson is replaced by Graham Zusi.
 
75 min It was just a long hump forward, but Brooks didn’t deal with it all. He 
miscontrolled badly, and Campbell was on to it – he nutmegged Brooks, and 
suddenly he was away, clear on goal … and he just passed it into the net. 
Three-nil, and much, much too easy.
 
Oh my! Campbell embarrasses John Brooks, and that’s game over.
 
72 min USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> still haven’t 
created anything of note in this second half. Can they find a way past the 
excellent Keylor Navas?
 
70 min Lynden Gooch is in for Pulisic, and Yeltsin Tejada is on for Azofeifa. 
Now Altidore is booked, andUSA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> are just losing it a 
little here.
 
69 min Ruiz went clear on the left – but where was Besler? Ruiz crossed with 
the outside of his left foot, Bolanos got ahead of Chandler, and pushed a 
header past Guzan, who couldn’t keep it out. A big 20 minutes for Klinsmann’s 
team.

Two-nil Costa Rica! Bolanos!
 
67 min Venegas can’t continue, and Joel Campbell is in. Not a bad player to 
bring off the bench.
 
66 min Costa Rica sitting much deeper than they were in the first half. 
Venegas is down, and the medical staff are on.
 
64 min USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> still not 
quite there yet. But it’s better.

Here’s James Stevenson: “I watched the pre-match pictures from the stadium and 
the crowd was the closest I’ve seen to any group of people come to expressing 
the notion of “well-being”. I know Costa Rica is supposed to be a great place 
and all, but this was really something. They all looked like lovely people 
having a lovely time. It could just be that I’m here in post-truth USA feeling 
sorry for myself, but I don’t think so. I think they have a some kind of life 
secret over there and I want to know what it is … It’s surely more than just 
having a pretty decent football team. Anyone?”

Pura vida, James. Pura vida 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Costa_Rica#Pura_vida>.
 
61 min This is at least more energetic from USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> since half-time. More of 
the game is being played in the Costa Rica half.
 
59 min Another chance for USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> from the free kick, and 
another waste from Bradley! Straight out of play. Mon dieu!
 
56 min Oh, Venegas! That could have been two! It was just a long ball, but 
Venegas got the better of Chandler, and again Guzan kept it out! Poor defending 
from the right-back – his goalie got him out of jail.
 
55 min USA counter-attack, and black shirts stream forward on the left side, 
but Jones can’t quite connect with the shot. It’s deflected, though, andUSA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> will have a corner, which 
is totally wasted.

54 min Bradley is booked for a cynical foul on Ruiz.
 
53 min Bradley takes, and it’s out for a throw in. Oh dear.
 
52 min Corner for USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam>. 
The big men come forward.
 
51 min Acosta is late on Altidore, and he’s rightly booked.
 
50 min Bradley plays a long free kick into the Costa Rican box, but the 
whistle goes for offside.
 
47 min USA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> could do with 
a little more from their big-time players: Bradley and Jones in particular. 
Venegas goes down the right side for Costa Rica, but it fizzles out.

Here’s Barrett Madden: “Chandler? Chandler? Anyone? Chandler? (Buehler?) Ticos 
tearing up their left side because Chandler is just slow in transition. 
Gonzalez having to constantly cover out wide. In this case, poorly!”
 
46 min We’re back. No changes from either side.
 
And here’s Clive Graham: “You are not alone, though I do wonder how many folk 
are following? Slow sports night – but I wasn’t up for pay for view. You are a 
good, cheap date. Thanks for the service – from a newly minted Guardian 
supporter!”

Thanks Clive, you old charmer.

Pretty entertaining stuff, but what a disappointing end to the half from USA. 
Bolanos and Venegas did really well to combine, but Gonzalez and Brooks will be 
unhappy with their contributions: Gonzalez didn’t get close enough to stop the 
cross, and Brooks let Venegas get away from him. Costa Rica have been the 
better team, on balance, but USA were doing fine. Then a couple of sloppy bits 
of play, and they have it all to do. Pulisic looks good, though –USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> should try to feed him as 
often as possible. He’s got the beating of Salvatierra.

See you in a mo for the second half.
 
That’s the half. 
 
44 min Well, Costa Rica, are ahead, and you have to say they deserve it. USA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/usfootballteam> coughed it up in 
midfield, and Azofeifa switched it to Bolanos on the left side of the box. 
Gonzalez didn’t close the ball quickly enough, Bolanos swung it in, and Venegas 
got ahead of Brooks to flick a header past Guzan. Game on!
 
This time he got it right! Venegas puts the Ticos ahead!

Gonzalez/AFP/Getty Images  
41 min Oh, so close! Bobby Wood skinned Waston on the right side, and fired 
one right across the goal – but no one was there to turn it in! It actually 
went behind Navas: Wood just slashed it across the goalline. All it needed was 
a touch.

At the other end, Venegas heads over! Alan Gordon would have buried that.
 
39 min Altidore is whistled for a foul, and he’s exceedingly upset. Costa Rica 
go long for Bolanos, but it’s out of play on the left side.
 
37 min Lovely skill from Pulisic to move forward, but a posse of Ticos are 
back to win it off him. Now Jones is booked, and he’ll miss the next match.
