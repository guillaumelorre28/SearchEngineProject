European markets end lower

A slide in the oil price following a bigger than expected rise in US crude 
inventories helped put European markets under pressure, although banking shares 
were boosted by a number of positive signs from the UK economy and talk of 
possible mergers following comments from the boss of Deutsche Bank.

Investors were also cautious thanks to the continuing uncertainty about 
whether - or when - the US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. Friday’s 
non-farm payroll numbers will be the key figures ahead of the next Fed meeting. 
The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 fell 39.28 points or 0.58% to 6781.51 but still managed a 
0.85% gain on the month 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 0.61% to 10,592.69 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.43% to 4438.22 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB finished down 0.31% at 16,943.38 
 * But Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.36% at 8716.8 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 2.31% to 577.39 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 108 points 
or 0.59%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

The slide in the oil price has dragged stock markets lower, with the 
commodity-heavy FTSE 100 now down around 30 points or 0.4%. Joshua Mahony, 
market analyst at IG, said:

Tumbling commodity prices have once more proven the undoing of the FTSE, with 
a late slide in crude prices adding to the woes of an index heavily weighted 
towards commodity companies. While some respite has been provided by the 
slowing rise of the US dollar, it is clearly not enough, with markets now 
looking towards the possibility of a 2016 rate hike which would drive the 
dollar sharply higher.

Yet again it has been the weekly EIA oil figures that have sparked this market 
back into life. This week’s rise of 2.3 million barrels was almost as large as 
the preceding week’s increase in stockpiles, putting fresh downward pressure on 
crude oil and taking stock markets with it.

The ghost of oversupply has not been laid to rest, indeed it seems to be 
returning with a vengeance. A rising US dollar and falling oil prices would 
potentially be a dangerous combination, threatening to unwind the gains made in 
equity markets over the summer. OPEC needs to do something, and quickly, but 
given their inability to reach a compromise, any action is still unlikely.

OPEC and other producers are due to meet next month, with continuing 
uncertainty over whether they will be able to agree on measures to support the 
falling crude price.

US crude stocks rise

Oil prices have come under renewed pressure on further signs of falling demand 
and increased production.

US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week according to the Energy 
Information Administration, up by 2.3m barrels compared with expectations of a 
921,000 increase.

Distillates - diesel and heating oil - rose unexpectedly, up by 1.5m barrels 
rather than showing a 157,000 drop. But gasoline stocks fell by 691,000 barrels 
although analysts had forecast a 1.2m decline.

Meanwhile a Reuters survey shows that output from the OPEC oil producers rose 
by 40,000 barrels a day in August, with increases among Middle Eastern 
countries making up for losses from Africa.

So Brent crude is not far from its lows of the day, down 1.9% at $47.43 a 
barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 1.7% at 
$45.52.

The Apple tax receipts could help Ireland cut its goverment debt to around 85% 
of GDP, according to ratings agency Standard & Poor’s.

But it said there was a danger the government’s policy approach could be 
destabilised by the ruling, and its business model could be put to a legal test.

But the US housing market is recovering to judge by the latest figures.

The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index rose 
1.3% to 111.3 in July after two months of decline. This is the second highest 
reading in the last ten years. Lawrence Yun, the association’s chief economist 
said:

More home shoppers having success is good news for the housing market heading 
into the fall, but buyers still have few choices and little time before 
deciding to make an offer on a home available for sale. There’s little doubt 
there’d be more sales activity right now if there were more affordable listings 
on the market.

Back with the US jobs data

, and economist James Smith at ING Bank says the ADP figures may not be much of 
a guide to Friday’s non-farm payroll numbers:

The latest ADP payrolls estimate came in a touch above consensus at 177,000. 
The key thing to know about ADP’s model is that is predominantly a function of 
last month’s official employment data, which means that ADP’s own up-to-date 
payrolls data plays only a minor role in generating the estimate. This means 
that the directional accuracy of ADP as a lead indicator of non-farm payrolls 
(ie higher or lower growth than last month) is around 50%. We are therefore 
none-the-wiser ahead of Friday’s number, even if at face value, it supports the 
consensus call of 180,000.

We expect job creation to fall short of expectations (ING forecast 150,000), 
following two months of remarkably strong non-farm payrolls. But... the FOMC 
would probably be content with such a figure, even if markets may view it as 
slightly disappointing. As the pool of available labour evaporates, job 
creation need only keep pace with increases in the overall size of the labour 
force. Some FOMC speakers have said that they would be comfortable with 
sub-150,000 non-farm payroll numbers, most notably Vice Chair Fischer who has 
indicated that 75-150 thousand would be acceptable.

Ryanair's O'Leary: Ireland should tell EU to f**k off over Apple
 Michael O’Leary 
The Guardian’s Rob Davies has been at a Ryanair press conference, where he 
found chief executive Michael O’Leary in typically talkative form.

O’Leary was announcing the budget airline’s new routes to Strasbourg and Faro, 
but commented on a number of subjects...

1. On Brexit, O’Leary said he expects UK passenger numbers to be five million 
lower in the next financial year than they would otherwise have been.


There’s an awful lot of rubbish being talked over here about how there’s been 
no effect. The effect is never going to be immediate.

The UK is going to suffer some significant economic damage when they get into 
the entrails of the Brexit decision. We hope the UK does well out of it but I’d 
be very concerned. The UK is going to end up looking pretty stupid.

2. On the EU’s state aid ruling on Apple’s tax affairs in Ireland:

The Irish government shouldn’t even appeal the decision. They should just 
write a letter toEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and 
tell them politely to f**k off with themselves. Which is what they need to be 
told.

3. On new runways:


(O’Leary wants a new runway at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.)

The way to finally deal with this is the government doing something 
intelligent for a change and saying you can all build a new runway, God speed. 
It’s not in my interest to advocate three runways but it’s what the UK needs to 
do.

4. On Theresa May:

EasyJet and BA were invited for tea and muffins at...what’s the country house? 
Chequers. We’re the biggest airline in the UK and weren’t invited. I’d love to 
be invited to Chequers. I’ve never been invited to Downing Street either.

I wouldn’t want to invite a peasant like me to either of those two august 
institutions. Being Irish, I’d be trying to nick the silver or something 
else...though we shouldn’t engage in national stereotypes, even if it is 
slagging off the Micks.

US job creation slows in August (but it's better than expected)
 The boardwalk in North Wildwood, New Jersey. The US services sector drove job 
creation in August. 
The private sector in the US created 177,000 jobs in August according to the 
monthlyADP report 
<http://www.adpemploymentreport.com/2016/August/NER/NER-August-2016.aspx>.

It was lower than the 194,000 jobs added in July, but better than the 175,000 
predicted by economists.


The increase in August was largely driven by new jobs in the service industry:

The ADP report comes before Friday’s keenly awaited non-farm payrolls report. 
As the last report before the Fed’s September policy meeting, investors will be 
scanning it for clues as to whether the next rate hike will come in September 
or later.


Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics>, says the ADP report suggests 
non-farm payrolls will show a gain of 188,000.

If the ADP turns out to be off the mark and non-farm payrolls increase by 
250,000 or more, as they did in both June and July, then a September rate hike 
would become a real possibility.

It is more likely that payrolls will come in below 200,000, however, which 
would probably persuade the Fed to hold off on the next rate hike until 
December.

Florian Hense, economist at Berbenberg, says low eurozone inflation of 0.2% in 
August is concerning for the European Central Bank:

August, just like the first seven months, does not provide much evidence for a 
material shift in price dynamics. This remains an ongoing source of concern for 
the ECB.

But whether today’s numbers cause headache to the central bankers in Frankfurt 
remains to be seen. Whereas market-based gauges remained close to record lows, 
survey-based indicators had shown more resilience.

Next week’s governing council meeting (8 September) will unlikely bring big 
news.Mario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> will 
continue to stress that the ECB keeps all options open.

There is some chance that the ECB will already announce an extension of asset 
purchases beyond the end of March 2017, but that is more likely to come in 
December when the ECB knows more about the Brexit impact and political risks in 
the US andEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

A slide in the oil price following a bigger than expected rise in US crude 
inventories helped put European markets under pressure, although banking shares 
were boosted by a number of positive signs from the UK economy and talk of 
possible mergers following comments from the boss of Deutsche Bank.

Investors were also cautious thanks to the continuing uncertainty about 
whether - or when - the US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. Friday’s 
non-farm payroll numbers will be the key figures ahead of the next Fed meeting. 
The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 fell 39.28 points or 0.58% to 6781.51 but still managed a 
0.85% gain on the month 
 * Germany’s Dax dropped 0.61% to 10,592.69 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.43% to 4438.22 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB finished down 0.31% at 16,943.38 
 * But Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.36% at 8716.8 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 2.31% to 577.39 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 108 points 
or 0.59%.

It received offers worth 3.19 times the number of bonds it wanted to buy.
 
The slide in the oil price has dragged stock markets lower, with the 
commodity-heavy FTSE 100 now down around 30 points or 0.4%. Joshua Mahony, 
market analyst at IG, said:

Tumbling commodity prices have once more proven the undoing of the FTSE, with 
a late slide in crude prices adding to the woes of an index heavily weighted 
towards commodity companies. While some respite has been provided by the 
slowing rise of the US dollar, it is clearly not enough, with markets now 
looking towards the possibility of a 2016 rate hike which would drive the 
dollar sharply higher.

Yet again it has been the weekly EIA oil figures that have sparked this market 
back into life. This week’s rise of 2.3 million barrels was almost as large as 
the preceding week’s increase in stockpiles, putting fresh downward pressure on 
crude oil and taking stock markets with it.

The ghost of oversupply has not been laid to rest, indeed it seems to be 
returning with a vengeance. A rising US dollar and falling oil prices would 
potentially be a dangerous combination, threatening to unwind the gains made in 
equity markets over the summer. OPEC needs to do something, and quickly, but 
given their inability to reach a compromise, any action is still unlikely.

OPEC and other producers are due to meet next month, with continuing 
uncertainty over whether they will be able to agree on measures to support the 
falling crude price.
 
Oil prices have come under renewed pressure on further signs of falling demand 
and increased production.

US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week according to the Energy 
Information Administration, up by 2.3m barrels compared with expectations of a 
921,000 increase.

Distillates - diesel and heating oil - rose unexpectedly, up by 1.5m barrels 
rather than showing a 157,000 drop. But gasoline stocks fell by 691,000 barrels 
although analysts had forecast a 1.2m decline.

Meanwhile a Reuters survey shows that output from the OPEC oil producers rose 
by 40,000 barrels a day in August, with increases among Middle Eastern 
countries making up for losses from Africa.

So Brent crude is not far from its lows of the day, down 1.9% at $47.43 a 
barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 1.7% at 
$45.52.
 
The Apple tax receipts could help Ireland cut its goverment debt to around 85% 
of GDP, according to ratings agency Standard & Poor’s.

But it said there was a danger the government’s policy approach could be 
destabilised by the ruling, and its business model could be put to a legal test.
 
But the US housing market is recovering to judge by the latest figures.

The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index rose 
1.3% to 111.3 in July after two months of decline. This is the second highest 
reading in the last ten years. Lawrence Yun, the association’s chief economist 
said:

More home shoppers having success is good news for the housing market heading 
into the fall, but buyers still have few choices and little time before 
deciding to make an offer on a home available for sale. There’s little doubt 
there’d be more sales activity right now if there were more affordable listings 
on the market.
 
More US data, and disappointing data at that. The latest Chicago manufacturing 
purchasing managers index has come in below expectations in August, after a 
strong performance in the previous two months.

, and economist James Smith at ING Bank says the ADP figures may not be much of 
a guide to Friday’s non-farm payroll numbers:

The latest ADP payrolls estimate came in a touch above consensus at 177,000. 
The key thing to know about ADP’s model is that is predominantly a function of 
last month’s official employment data, which means that ADP’s own up-to-date 
payrolls data plays only a minor role in generating the estimate. This means 
that the directional accuracy of ADP as a lead indicator of non-farm payrolls 
(ie higher or lower growth than last month) is around 50%. We are therefore 
none-the-wiser ahead of Friday’s number, even if at face value, it supports the 
consensus call of 180,000.

We expect job creation to fall short of expectations (ING forecast 150,000), 
following two months of remarkably strong non-farm payrolls. But... the FOMC 
would probably be content with such a figure, even if markets may view it as 
slightly disappointing. As the pool of available labour evaporates, job 
creation need only keep pace with increases in the overall size of the labour 
force. Some FOMC speakers have said that they would be comfortable with 
sub-150,000 non-farm payroll numbers, most notably Vice Chair Fischer who has 
indicated that 75-150 thousand would be acceptable.

The Guardian’s Rob Davies has been at a Ryanair press conference, where he 
found chief executive Michael O’Leary in typically talkative form.

O’Leary was announcing the budget airline’s new routes to Strasbourg and Faro, 
but commented on a number of subjects...

1. On Brexit, O’Leary said he expects UK passenger numbers to be five million 
lower in the next financial year than they would otherwise have been.


There’s an awful lot of rubbish being talked over here about how there’s been 
no effect. The effect is never going to be immediate.

The UK is going to suffer some significant economic damage when they get into 
the entrails of the Brexit decision. We hope the UK does well out of it but I’d 
be very concerned. The UK is going to end up looking pretty stupid.

2. On the EU’s state aid ruling on Apple’s tax affairs in Ireland:

The Irish government shouldn’t even appeal the decision. They should just 
write a letter toEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and 
tell them politely to f**k off with themselves. Which is what they need to be 
told.

3. On new runways:


(O’Leary wants a new runway at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.)

The way to finally deal with this is the government doing something 
intelligent for a change and saying you can all build a new runway, God speed. 
It’s not in my interest to advocate three runways but it’s what the UK needs to 
do.

4. On Theresa May:

EasyJet and BA were invited for tea and muffins at...what’s the country house? 
Chequers. We’re the biggest airline in the UK and weren’t invited. I’d love to 
be invited to Chequers. I’ve never been invited to Downing Street either.

I wouldn’t want to invite a peasant like me to either of those two august 
institutions. Being Irish, I’d be trying to nick the silver or something 
else...though we shouldn’t engage in national stereotypes, even if it is 
slagging off the Micks.

<https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/770956368178188288>   The boardwalk in North Wildwood, New Jersey. The US services sector drove job 
creation in August. 
The private sector in the US created 177,000 jobs in August according to the 
monthlyADP report 
<http://www.adpemploymentreport.com/2016/August/NER/NER-August-2016.aspx>.

It was lower than the 194,000 jobs added in July, but better than the 175,000 
predicted by economists.


The increase in August was largely driven by new jobs in the service industry:

The ADP report comes before Friday’s keenly awaited non-farm payrolls report. 
As the last report before the Fed’s September policy meeting, investors will be 
scanning it for clues as to whether the next rate hike will come in September 
or later.


Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics>, says the ADP report suggests 
non-farm payrolls will show a gain of 188,000.

If the ADP turns out to be off the mark and non-farm payrolls increase by 
250,000 or more, as they did in both June and July, then a September rate hike 
would become a real possibility.

It is more likely that payrolls will come in below 200,000, however, which 
would probably persuade the Fed to hold off on the next rate hike until 
December.
 
Florian Hense, economist at Berbenberg, says low eurozone inflation of 0.2% in 
August is concerning for the European Central Bank:

August, just like the first seven months, does not provide much evidence for a 
material shift in price dynamics. This remains an ongoing source of concern for 
the ECB.

But whether today’s numbers cause headache to the central bankers in Frankfurt 
remains to be seen. Whereas market-based gauges remained close to record lows, 
survey-based indicators had shown more resilience.

Next week’s governing council meeting (8 September) will unlikely bring big 
news.Mario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> will 
continue to stress that the ECB keeps all options open.

There is some chance that the ECB will already announce an extension of asset 
purchases beyond the end of March 2017, but that is more likely to come in 
December when the ECB knows more about the Brexit impact and political risks in 
the US andEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.
