While she was recuperating from a skiing accident in 2013, Angela Merkel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel> picked up a 1,500-page tome 
on the 19th century by the historian Jürgen Osterhammel called The 
Transformation of the World. The book left an impression. A few months later 
she invited Osterhammel to her 60th birthday party, not just to celebrate but 
to give an hour-long lecture.

The theme was “history and time”, and those familiar with Osterhammel’s work 
detect his influence in Merkel’s worldview, particularly where he covers 
globalisation, migration and technology.

The admiration is mutual. “Even though I am not a member of the CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union] and an old SPD [Social Democratic party] voter, I am a 
personal fan of the chancellor,” Osterhammel said in an email exchange with the 
Guardian.

“Few people are likely to have read my book from beginning to end,” 
Osterhammel admits. “They don’t have to, and I hope the chancellor didn’t. 
There are many other important books to learn from. The amazing thing is that 
senior politicians do read history books at all.”

The historian rejects the idea that his book has had a direct influence on 
Merkel’s policies. But many sections of the work – on globalisation, migration 
and technology, to name a few pertinent topics – read differently in the light 
of decisions she has made since reading it, such as the treatment of Greece at 
the height of the eurozone crisis.

If Europe was able to pull ahead of China economically in the 19th century, 
Osterhammel argues, it was because the Chinese empire was hampered by a 
“chaotic dual system” of silver and copper coins, while much ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> had created a “de facto single 
currency” with the Latin monetary union of 1866.

From a few brief conversations with Merkel, Osterhammel says he can see “she 
is very serious about the way world order (or disorder) has been evolving in 
the long run. She seems to understand, for instance, that migration and 
mobility have a historical dimension.”

The 19th century is often described as an era of rising nationalism, a period 
in which states across Europe first began to develop distinct ideas about their 
identity. Osterhammel, a professor at Konstanz University, who wrote his 
dissertation on the British empire’s economic ties with China, instead recasts 
the century as one marked by globalisation, with 1860-1914 in particular “a 
period of unprecedented creation of networks” that were later torn apart by two 
world wars.

First published in 2009 and translated into English in 2014, The 
Transformation of the World charts how technological innovations, such as the 
first telegraph cable being laid across the Channel in 1851, inspired the rise 
of investigative reporting that in turn changed the dynamics of politics.

Although his magnum opus is in effect a history of early globalisation, 
Osterhammel is cautious about using the word. “I rather prefer to talk of 
globalisations in the plural, meaning that different spheres of life undergo 
processes of extension at varying speeds, and with specific reach and 
intensity,” he says.

“If we cling to the concept of ‘globalisation’, we should not see it as a 
continuous and uninterrupted march toward an imaginary ‘global modernity’. It 
is a bundle of contradictory developments.

“While the economy or information may have been globalised, it has not led to 
a corresponding generalisation of a cosmopolitan morality, if we disregard the 
tiny layer of an educated and mobile elite.

“Globalisation is not a smooth and benign master process such as 
‘modernisation’ used to be construed 50 years ago. It is always uneven, 
discontinuous, reversible, contradictory, producing winners and losers, no 
force of nature but manmade.”

The Transformation of the World shows how free movement between states and 
continents grew continuously in the first two-thirds of the 19th century, and 
passports, border controls and trade tariffs were only invented as Europe 
approached 1900.

Ironically, given that Merkel would spend much of 2014 with a British prime 
minister lobbying her tohem in immigration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/02/angela-merkel-warns-david-cameron-german-chancellor-uk-prime-minister-unskilled-migrants>
 across the EU, Osterhammel’s book would have emphasised to her at the start of 
the year that Britain had resisted continental Europe’s xenophobic turn at the 
end of the 19th century, allowing foreigners to enter the country without 
having to register with the police.

Osterhammel, who spent four years at the German Historical Institute in 
London, finds many positive words for Britain’s part in developing global 
networks in the 1800s in general. While he says he would never go as far as 
saying the British empire was a good thing, “it is impossible to imagine 
history minus empires and imperialism”.

“The British empire was a major engine of global change in modern history. 
When you condemn all empires with equal vehemence, you miss at least two 
important points. First, the British empire was a bit less murderous than the 
empires ofGermany <https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> and Japan in the 
1930s and 1940s. And secondly, it transferred the idea and practice of 
constitutional government, and the rule of law, to quite a few parts of world. 
A brief look at present-day Hong Kong will quickly elucidate this point,” he 
says.

One of the book’s recurring themes is that differentiating between occident 
and orient is often of little use when trying to understand the 19th century, 
and, as an invention of the 20th century, the distinction is increasingly 
irrelevant again. “Both the nouveau riche vulgarity of oil-exploiting societies 
and the atrocities at Aleppo, Baghdad and Kabul put an end to any romantic 
‘east’,” he says.

“And the ‘west’ as a transatlantic cultural formation is disintegrating before 
our eyes. It is being reduced to [Vladimir] Putin’s and [Recep Tayyip] 
Erdoğan’s bogeyman.”

If Merkel finds herself eyeing the social disruption created by digitalisation 
as the defining theme of a potential fourth term as chancellor, Osterhammel 
warns that there are “very few lessons” she would be able to find in previous 
eras. “Many major innovations of the 19th century took decades to mature; 
today, change can be incredibly rapid, not just in IT but also in 
biotechnology,” he says.

Political diatribes against experts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2016/nov/02/no-the-public-hasnt-had-enough-of-experts-or-evidence>
 and academics like him, he suggests, may be born not so much of genuine 
disdain but the realisation that politicians are more reliant on them than 
ever. “Politicians find it difficult to grasp the implications of these 
changes. They have to rely on experts who, in turn, they deeply distrust – 
Angela Merkel, as a trained research chemist, less than other leaders,” he says.
