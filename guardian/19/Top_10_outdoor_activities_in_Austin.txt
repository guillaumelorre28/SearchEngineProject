See a Sunset at Mount Bonnell

It's easy to get lost in the outdoors without leaving Austin's city limits, 
but it's worth taking a five-minute drive west from downtown to get an 
awe-inspiring aerial view of the entire surrounding hill country. It's a short 
hike from the street side parking spaces to the 236m limestone mountain's 
summit, known as Covert Park, which lends an eagle's eye view of the 
Pennybacker Bridge, Lake Austin and the undulating green hills beyond. It's 
perfect for a family picnic, scenic photo shoot or romantic sunset tryst.

Swim at Barton Springs Pool
 Photograph: Cheri Lucas/writingthroughthefog.com 
Sixty-eight degrees (20 Celsius) might seem a bit chilly for a swim, but here 
in the land of seemingly endless summers, this natural spring-fed pool, which 
maintains that brisk temperature year round, is Austin's most popular place to 
cool off. Lounge on the grassy green slopes framing the idyllic three-acre 
pool, always crowded on a sunny day with high schoolers playing hookey, hippies 
from the city's heyday and everyone in between. And while the park is 
family-friendly, nudity is optional, so don't be surprised to see a 
bare-breasted young lady twirling a hula hoop in time to the beat of a nearby 
drum circle.

Take a Stand-Up Paddleboarding Lesson
 Paddleboarding, Austin, Texas 
Austinites will do just about anything to enjoy downtown's Lady Bird Lake 
<http://www.texasoutside.com/townlake.htm>, and the latest exercise phenomenon 
to hit the city is stand-up paddleboarding. It may seem odd at first, but the 
casual watersport is a pleasantly easy way to admire the skyline from the lake, 
and getting a surprisingly active core workout at the same time. Austin Paddle 
Sports,Texas Rowing Centers <http://www.texasrowingcenter.com/> and SUP ATX 
<http://www.supatx.com/> all offer lessons for beginners and independent hourly 
rentals via their lakeside docks. Don't forget your sunscreen: the peaceful 
paddling might keep you out on the water longer than you think.

Hit the Trail

Locals might be proud of the "Everything is Bigger in Texas" slogan, but 
Austin, consistently ranked as one of the Top 10 Fittest Cities in the US, is 
proud to keep slim. The 10-mile Ann and Roy Butler Hike and Bike Trail, 
commonly known as The Trail, creates a full circuit around the serene 
inner-city shores of Lady Bird Lake and is Austin's most popular recreational 
attraction, with more than 1.5 million annual visitors. Both long-term 
residents and downtown tourists enjoy the proximity and beautiful scenery of 
the lakeside paths, whether they're training for a mountain bike race at 5am, 
walking their dog at lunchtime or jogging.

Wander Through the Cathedral of Junk

Forget the Sistine Chapel. Austin has its own cathedral (and, yes, it's 
weird). In the lovely Bouldin Creek neighbourhood (in between hotspot 
thoroughfares South Congress and South 1st), famed local "yardist" Vince 
Hannemann has created a self-proclaimed Cathedral of Junk – a three-storey 
structure made from an otherworldly collection of more than 60 tonnes of 
reclaimed bicycle and auto parts, record players, mismatched pairs of crutches 
and just about everything else you could imagine. It's a Spike Jonze-esque 
amalgamation that enchants children and the young at heart alike. Pose for a 
picture in the "Throne Room" (a mismatched microcosm of the cathedral's unique 
miscellany) for a uniquely Austin keepsake.

Explore the Barton Creek Greenbelt
 Photograph: Evan Bench/flickr 
Austin has more than 190 miles of hike and bike paths crisscrossing various 
greenbelts, or heavily wooded scenic riverside stretches. And the Barton Creek 
Greenbelt, just a few minutes from downtown, has just about the best of 
everything for the rugged outdoorsman or woman. Hike through the myriad trails 
found in the 809-acre nature reserve, and discover gorgeous natural swimming 
holes, waterfalls and native vegetation surrounding limestone cliffs (popular 
with adventuresome swimmers and mountain climbers). Locals have their 
designated favourite swimming holes (some with a picturesque rope swing), but 
find your own personal hideaway by accessing any of the numerous entrances.

Austin is the live music capital of the world. And there are plenty of 
opportunities to catch great open-air performances, whether it's at the city's 
largest open-air venue, Stubb's (801 Red River St, +1 512 480 8341,
stubbsaustin.com <http://stubbsaustin.com/>), Mohawk (912 Red River St,no phone,
mohawkaustin.com <http://www.mohawkaustin.com/>) a local favourite 
indoor/outdoor space that hosts some of the city's best shows, and popular 
annual events such as the Misprint Beard and Moustache Competition, or even 
Austin City Hall (301 W 2nd St,austintexas.gov/government/city-hall 
<http://www.austintexas.gov/government/city-hall>) for the "Live from the 
Plaza" concert series. Every Friday, local musicians perform free, so spread 
out on the city hall's tiered amphitheatre-style seating area and lawns.

Join a social ride

Austin is incredibly cycling-savvy, but you don't have to be a fan of hometown 
(anti-)hero Lance Armstrong or hipster fixed gears to get in on the action. 
Local organisation Social Cycling Austin ("putting butts on bikes since 2009") 
presents a diverse series of free, weekly social rides for any type of rider, 
from Heavy Metal Fitness rides to Saturday Caffeine Cruises and Hump Day 
Nooners on Wednesdays. Its most popular ride, the Thursday Night Social Ride, 
attracts around 500 cyclists, who hobnob on-the-go to locations including 
swimming holes and patio bars, for some truly active socialising. And in 
upcoming news: Austin's first citywide bike-sharing programme is scheduled to 
launch in spring 2013.

Visit Red Bud isle
 Photograph: Patrick Meredith/flickr 
The calm western waters of Lady Bird Lake surrounding Red Bud's 13 acres of 
prime lakeside are ideal for canoeing, kayaking or a leisurely swim. The island 
is the westernmost launch site on Lady Bird Lake, but visitors can rent a kayak 
or canoe by the hour (from $10 and $20, respectively) at the Rowing Dock (2418 
Stratford Dr, +1 512 459-0999,rowingdock.com <http://www.rowingdock.com/>) and 
paddle west to enjoy the particularly tranquil stretch of the lake's west end. 
Red Bud boasts scenic shores (popular with local fishermen), a tree-lined 
half-mile trail, and the most popular off-leash dog park in the city, so dog 
lovers can run ashore to play with the city's happiest four-legged residents 
before paddling back downstream.
