The forward was shown two yellow cards by the referee, Michael Oliver, during 
the FA Cup quarter-final defeat at Goodison Park. The second caution came for a 
clash with Gareth Barry six minutes from time and, having appeared to make his 
peace with the Everton midfielder, Costa was outraged to be dismissed for the 
first time in hisChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> career.

His reluctance to leave the pitch, and reaction at the referee’s decision, has 
earned him a further ban, a £20,000 fine and a warning as to his future conduct.

Costa is serving the second game of his original two-match suspension at Aston 
Villa on Saturday having incurred a one-game ban for the red card and a further 
match given it was effectively his second red card offence of the season 
followingretrospective sanction over a clash

 with Arsenal’s Laurent Koscielny and Gabriel in September.

The striker will now also sit out the match at Swansea City on 9 April. Costa 
was found to have no case to answer over suggestions he had bitten Barry, or 
made an inappropriate gesture towards Everton supporters.
