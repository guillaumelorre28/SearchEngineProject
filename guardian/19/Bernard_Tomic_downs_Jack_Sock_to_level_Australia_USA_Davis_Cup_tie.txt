Tomic looked on target for a comfortable win but lost his way in the searing 
Melbourne heat to allow Sock back into the match. The pair went toe-to-toe in 
the fourth set before Tomic broke Sock at 4-4, with world No20 Tomic serving 
out the match.

Tomic said he found it difficult adjusting to the conditions on the temporary 
grasscourt after arriving earlier in the week from Mexico. “It was tough for me 
the last three days coming on grass,” Tomic said after beating the world No24. 
“The conditions were so tough.”

Sock had won their previous two meetings and, with the Cup tie effectively 
hanging on the result, Tomic said he didn’t want to let downDavis Cup

and Bob Bryan on Saturday in the doubles rubber.
