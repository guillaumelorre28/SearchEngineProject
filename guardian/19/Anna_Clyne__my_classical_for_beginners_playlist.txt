One of the first pieces of classical music that I heard live, and which I 
found deeply moving, wasBeethoven 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2015/jun/09/beethoven-african-roots-beethoven-was-black>
’s Violin Concerto, composed in 1806 for solo violin and orchestra. As the 
music unravels, the solo violin soars above the orchestra with such tenderness 
and intensity – from its entry at 3:20.

A couple of years later, I heard on the radio Arvo Pärt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/16/gerhard-richter-arvo-part-odd-couple-manchester-international-festival-mif>
’s Fratres for solo violin, string orchestra and piano, and was immediately 
captivated by its meditative quality. Pärt has arranged the work for several 
different instrumentations – such as solo cello and piano – since the original 
version in 1977.

Many of today’s composers are exploring new ways to write for traditional 
instruments. For example,Caroline Shaw’s Partita, composed between 2009-2012 
for eight voices, explores a whole new sound palette for the voice.

 Movement 4 – Passacaglia 
In Kaija Saariaho 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/jul/09/kaija-saariaho-contemporary-music-guide>
’s Graal Théâtre, composed in 1994 for solo violin and chamber orchestra, the 
solo violin adopts a very different character to the Beethoven and Pärt, really 
exploring the extreme sonorities of the instrument and how it interacts with 
the ensemble. I first heard this piece in a live performance and was struck by 
the physicality of the music – especially for the soloist.

The physicality of music is something that I am often inspired by when I’m 
writing a new work – especially if it is in collaboration with a choreographer. 
Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring is a wonderful example of the synergy between 
music and movement, especially in the earthy rhythms that we hear at 3:00 of 
this video, which is the Joffrey Ballet’s reconstruction of Nijinsky’s 
choreography for the original 1913 premiere.

Classical music does not require a full orchestra to create a dramatic impact 
– the intimacy of a solo instrument can also be deeply moving – such asSatie’s 
Gymnopédie No 1 <https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU> or the presto from 
Bach’s Violin Sonata No 1 in G minor, heard here in its original form...
