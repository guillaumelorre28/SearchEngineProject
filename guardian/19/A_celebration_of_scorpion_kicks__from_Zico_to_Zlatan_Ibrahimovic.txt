Anthony Knockaert (Huddersfield v LEICESTER CITY) 
<https://youtu.be/zHF4qWUDXac?t=12>

The winger’s first goal of the game was a wondrous 25-yard effort but his 
second was even better. Anthony Knockaert, now of Brighton and Hove Albion, 
nonchalantly flicked the ball past a hapless Alex Smithies in the Huddersfield 
goal from Paul Konchesky’s cross from the left.

Zico (KASHIMA ANTLERS) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RRGeIketm4>


“The best goal I ever scored, I scored in Japan,” said Zico, the former Brazil 
midfielder. “I went ahead of the ball, it was coming from behind me and I 
didn’t know what to do but I threw myself forward to hit the ball with my heel. 
I got the ball and hit it. It was perhaps the finest piece of play in my entire 
life.”

Festus Baise (Sun Hei v CITIZEN AA) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2011/dec/19/best-own-goal-ever-video>

A glorious own goal by Festus Baise, in Hong Kong’s first division. Citizen AA 
fail to snuff the ball out time and again and eventually Baise does his bit to 
put his team well and truly out of their misery. The 36-year-old now plays for 
Chinese side Guizhou Zhicheng.

René Higuita (England v COLOMBIA) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRj3dKKp9tI>

Think René Higuita, think scorpion kick. The former Colombia goalkeeper wowed 
the crowd at the old Wembley with his clearance in a friendly against England 
in 1995. Higuita, nicknamedEl Loco, has since been widely crowned the inventor 
of the scorpion kick.

Alexandre Coeff (FRANCE v United States) <https://youtu.be/pfJr8FoEMDI?t=57>

France’s squad at the Under-20 Toulon Tournament was full of burgeoning 
talent, including Paul Pogba and Geoffrey Kondogbia, but it was Alexandre 
Coeff, currently on loan at Ligue 2 Brest, who will be remembered for this 
moment of magic. Coeff, a centre-back by day, backheeled the ball magnificently 
beyond the United States goalkeeper from a free-kick.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAtyxTZgLsA>) 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAtyxTZgLsA>

After some crisp buildup play, with the goal gaping, why sidefoot or hammer it 
home when you can showboat in front of your team-mates like this? Cue the wild 
celebrations too. A promising start for young Luciano, at the same Brazilian 
club where Ronaldinho started his career.

Charles-Edouard Coridon (PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN v Porto) 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skzj-aI6PU0>


The Parc des Princes is quite the footballing arena at the best of times, but 
it lit up when Charles-Edouard Coridon found the net in considerable style in 
the Champions League. Coridon got the ball rolling against Porto, with PSG 
legend Pauleta tapping home a second goal a minute later. It was a moment to 
cherish for Coridon, who featured just 19 times for the club before moving to 
Turkish side Ankaragucu.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE5seaxgZyw>

How do you make an impression when on loan at a club? Just ask Skrabb, the 
Finnish youngster who ended up celebrating this strike by covering his face in 
embarrassment – or pure joy. All of his team-mates joined him, mobbing him to 
celebrate.

Dmytro Ulyanov (AVANHARD KRAMATORSK v Ternopil) 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUJLXzJ3fLI>

Scoring from a scorpion kick is doubtless a fond memory for those fortunate 
enough to ripple the net in such a fashion – even more so when it’s your first 
career goal. Dmytro Ulyanov never gives up on this attacking move and he pops 
up at the far post to the delight of himself and his team-mates.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0B2IKXRs3Y>


Imagine a list of magical goals without even a doff of the cap to Zlatan 
Ibrahimovic <https://www.theguardian.com/football/zlatan-ibrahimovic>. It’s 
just not possible. Whether Hervin Ongenda’s flick to Ibrahimovic is intentional 
or not, the striker manages to find the net during a convincing 4-0 league win. 
Ibrahimovic hit four goals in a 5-0 win over Anderlecht four days later.

Edinson Cavani (NAPOLI v Juventus) 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87gGX9J3dRs>

Again, at the back post, Edinson Cavani, at speed, flies on to the end of a 
cross and duly does the honours. The Uruguayan’s goal record at Napoli was 
impressive – 78 goals in 97 league starts – but few will have felt sweeter than 
this effort as part of a hat-trick against Juventus at Stadio San Paolo.

Carsten Kammlott celebrates in jubilation, astounded at what he’s just done, 
after impeccably meeting a cross from the right flank.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=K8OYrPoop2g>

Full marks for audacity and accuracy for Ricardo Fernandes, who nestles the 
ball in the top-right corner with this sublime effort in the Cypriot league. 
Fernandes has played for 19 clubs in his career – the John Burridge of 
continental Europe. The 38-year-old is now back in his homeland at Trofense, 
who play in the Portuguese third tier.

replicated the skill shown by his countryman, Higuita, trying his luck after 
being picked out from the right flank.
