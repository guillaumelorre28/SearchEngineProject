On stage, the old-time band is rollicking along: banjo, guitar, fiddle and 
double bass prompting the audience to show off their flat-foot dancing. An 
elderly guy in dungarees, battered felt hat and work boots twirls his partner. 
A spectator leans towards me: “That’s actually what he wears. It’s not an act,” 
she says, before diving off to find a partner of her own. It’s the Friday Night 
Jamboree at FloydCountry <https://www.theguardian.com/music/country> Store in 
Virginia’s Blue Ridge mountains – and you can forget about lonesome pines. This 
joint is jumping.

The store, which dates from around 1910, really is a store: traditional beamed 
frontage, unfussy wooden interior and exactly the rural, small-town America 
image I pictured before starting my road trip along theBlue Ridge Parkway 
<http://www.blueridgeparkway.org/>. For seven days a week it serves the town of 
Floyd (population about 400, just the one stoplight) and Floyd County with 
everything from pots and pans and work clothes to ice-cream and candy. But 
old-time, bluegrass, Americana and the Appalachian sound is so pervasive that 
the store has also become integral to the music scene – and a key stop onthe 
Crooked Road <https://www.myswva.org/tcr>, Virginia’s Music Heritage Trail. 

The Jamboree sprang up in the 1980s because the store’s owners at the time 
were musicians and, rather than being interrupted by inquisitive locals while 
jamming, they opened the doors and let the snoopers become their audience. Now 
every Friday night is the Jamboree ($5 entry), every Saturday is Americana 
afternoon (free), Tuesday Tunes is a songwriters’ get-together (free), and once 
a month, on a Saturday evening, you can attend theFloyd Radio Show 
<http://www.floydcountrystore.com/radio-show> ($12 in advance, $15 on the 
door), which is also broadcast live online and available as a podcast later.

 The man in the dungarees – Leo Weddle, right 
Although this is moonshine country, the store doesn’t serve alcohol – but that 
doesn’t stop the Jamboree from being a rattling good night out. The crowd is 
lively, the welcome warm and no one criticises your moves on the dancefloor. 
Between acts, co-owner Heather Krantz – who, with husband Dylan Locke, took 
over the store in 2014 – gets on stage and, with a prize up for grabs, asks who 
has come the furthest to be here. I miss out to a couple whose “Scotland” 
narrowly defeats my “Nottingham”.

 Street musicians perform in a bay along Floyd’s main street, outside the 
Country Store 
Stepping outside for a brief banjo breather, I see another aspect of Floyd’s 
musical cool as bands, buskers and friends play in designated bays along the 
main street. The night air now has a chill but the lights of the store burn on 
and a group is singingParadise by John Prine 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEy6EuZp9IY>. It’s not quite the perfect title 
… but it’s not far off if you love the music of these mountains.
