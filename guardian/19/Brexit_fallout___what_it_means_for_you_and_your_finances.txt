It’s just two weeks since the UK voted to leave the EU, but in that time the 
pound has hit 31-year lows, stock markets have fallen and, in the main, bounced 
back, and the governor of the Bank of England,Mark Carney, has signalled that 
an interest rate cut could be on the horizon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/interest-rate-cut-likely-brexit-bank-of-england-mark-carney>
. For individuals this is already starting to have an impact on their finances.

Jobs and earnings

Data from information services company CEB shows a steep fall in the number of 
job vacancies advertised online, down by almost half in the week after the 
referendum. In the week before the vote it found 1.5m UK-based posts being 
advertised, dropping to 820,000 the following week. Over the same period a year 
earlier the number remained at around 1.5m.

“This is an early indication that UK-based companies are pulling back from 
hiring following the EU referendum result,” said CEB’s HR practice leader, 
Brian Kropp. “At this stage it is unclear if this is an early shock reaction 
from employers and whether this trend will continue. However, if recruitment 
budgets do contract and open headcounts are frozen, it will certainly have a 
negative impact on the UK economy.”

Job losses have been reported at architects’ practices 
<http://www.bdonline.co.uk/architects-shed-jobs-as-brexit-fallout-begins/5082489.article>
 in the wake of the vote, as worries about the commercial property market have 
started to have an impact. And theOECD has warned that the UK’s short-term 
labour market prospects are likely to be negatively affected 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/07/oecd-weak-wage-growth-brexit-uk-workers>
 by the decision, saying that Brexit “represents a cloud over the UK’s recent 
ability to create jobs”.

Prices

The collapse in the pound means it has become more expensive to import goods, 
and some of these increases are already being passed on to consumers in the 
tech world.Dell has increased prices on some of its products for business 
customers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/07/computers-and-chocolate-set-to-get-pricier-after-brexit-vote>
, while smartphone maker OnePlus said it would be raising the price of one of 
its models for consumers from £309 to £329 with effect from 11 July.

“While we’ve held off action for as long as we can, the sharp drop witnessed 
in the currency markets following the Brexit decision has forced us to 
re-evaluate the OnePlus 3’s pricing in the UK at a time of significant demand,” 
it said on its website. “Given the effects of the unstable markets on our 
extremely thin margins, we’re reluctantly going to have make some small changes 
to our pricing structure for the device.”

Anyone turning to a bar of chocolate for comfort could soon be in for a 
surprise as cocoa prices for UK buyers have surged to their highest level since 
1977. The increase has yet to filter through to the consumer, but don’t be 
surprised if your sweets start to shrink again.

Savings and investments


Savings rates were already in freefall before the Brexit vote. “Nothing has 
changed – it’s what we’re already used to, and what we’re used to is an awful 
lot of rate reductions,” said Susan Hannums, co-founder of websiteSavings 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/savings> Champion.

The Funding for Lending scheme which the government introduced after the 
financial crisis meant banks and building societies were no longer keen to 
attract savers’ cash, and they have been making their accounts less and less 
attractive ever since. However, talk of a cut to the Bank of England base rate 
has made the outlook even worse.

“Providers don’t need a base rate reduction to lower rates, but I would be 
surprised if they didn’t pass it on,” said Hannums. “There are lots of accounts 
that couldn’t even take a 0.25% cut as rates are so low.”

Accounts that are closed to new customers tend to have higher returns, and 
Hannums said banks and building societies would be keen to reduce what they 
were paying on them. Cash accounts are, however, likely to remain popular as 
savers want to shield their money from volatile stock markets.

Those in property funds have had the gates locked or the value of their 
investments reduced.After Standard Life closed its doors to withdrawals on 
Monday, the other big funds followed and by the end of Wednesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/07/property-fund-turmoil-continues-as-legal-and-general-foreign-and-colonial-reveal-cut-in-value>
half of the sector had suspended trading. Several funds are still open but 
anyone taking out money will get less than before the Brexit vote. Aberdeen 
Asset Management cut the value of its fund by 17%, while Legal & General 
followed a 5% cut with a further 10% reduction.

Property and mortgages

There is no data yet showing mortgage approval numbers or what has happened to 
house prices since the referendum – figures for the whole of June should start 
arriving at the end of July, but the first full post-referendum numbers will 
not come until late summer.

In the meantime, anecdotal evidence suggests some jitters. Some estate agents 
have reported falling inquiries, and there are examples of deals falling 
through and sellers cutting prices to try to secure a sale. Price cuts of 
around 10% seem typical. Some builders are pausing projects while they wait to 
see what happens to the market – for example, consultancy firm Arcadis said on 
Thursday that two of its clients had put residential building projects on hold.

For anyone looking for money to buy or remortgage, there has been good news. 
Mortgage rates have started to fall following the vote, as the flight to safe 
investments such as government bonds has had a knock-on effect on the cost of 
funding fixed-rate mortgages. Several lenders have cut rates on fixed-rate 
mortgages, withthe lowest ever 10-year deal – a rate of just 2.39% 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/06/coventry-building-society-lowest-10-year-mortgage-fixed-rate>
 – on offer from Coventry building society from Friday.

If, as is expected, the Bank of England base rate falls from its current level 
of 0.5%, anyone on a mortgage linked to it will also see the cost of borrowing 
drop. At Woolwich and C&G there are borrowers with rates at 0.17 percentage 
points for the whole of the mortgage term.

Holiday money

A year ago articles were explaining how Brits could make the most of a strong 
pound 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/17/how-will-the-interest-rate-rise-affect-my-holiday>
 but this summer anyone planning a trip overseas stands to have a more 
expensive holiday than they bargained for. The pound has remained at a 31-year 
low against the dollar since 23 June and the exchange rate against the euro is 
down on 12 months ago. While in 2015, £1 would have got you $1.56, now you get 
around $1.28. Holidaymakers travelling to Europe can get €1.18 for £1 – they 
got €1.44 in July 2015.

The fall will have an impact on any spending people plan to do abroad but any 
hotels or activities that have already been paid for won’t be hit.

Petrol prices

The cost of filling your tank with petrol has edged up, but this was already 
in train before the vote. According to the RAC, the average price of petrol 
increased by 1.5p a litre to 112.17p in June, while the price of diesel rose by 
1.66p to 112.39p a litre. This was the fourth month running that it had 
recorded a rise.

However, Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, told 
the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/03/does-eu-exit-mean-higher-food-prices-and-staff-shortages>
 that the price of diesel was up by 2.6p a litre since the referendum. He added 
that if the pound continued its decline against the dollar and reached some 
banks’ predictions of just $1.15, this could add 5p to pump prices, as oil is 
priced in dollars.
