I was born in Chicago. It’s an amazing city. It feels alive, it has an 
identity, and I feel connected here. I started playing blues professionally in 
1974, with an old boogie-woogie piano player, Jimmy Walker. By the following 
year I was in the band of the great Willie Dixon, who wrote classics such as 
Hoochie Coochie Man, I Just Want to Make Love to You and Little Red Rooster. He 
was an important mentor for me. As a city, Chicago is probably unique for 
musicians in that you could just work within it and make a living playing blues.

Blues is on the tourist trail now, but that doesn’t mean the money always 
trickles down to the musicians. For a taste of the old South Side, check out 
the Odyssey Lounge East at 99th Street and Torrence Avenue. It used to belong 
to the husband of the “queen of the blues”, Koko Taylor. It has a jam session 
on Sundays with a house band, a group who play solid Chicago R&B, including 
Sidney Joe Qualls, a great singer in the Al Green mould.

On the road with Willie Dixon, it didn’t matter how late it was, what you were 
up to, or who you were with, he’d call up and tell you to come on over. You’d 
have to drop everything and work with him on a song. He was always writing. He 
would keep time on his notebook with his pencil, like a snare drum.

There is so much music here – not just blues. There’s jazz, classical, folk, 
country and ethnic, from Puerto Rican to Irish. There’s a real sense of 
identity in the neighbourhoods, of belonging. It’s not unusual for me to be 
playing and someone will come up and say, “I knew your mother as a little 
girl,” or, “I went to school with your father.” Everybody knows everybody.

Chicago has probably the most extensive parks of any major US city. If you go 
into the hood you’re still going to find a nice, well-maintained park. Recently 
I played at theGarfield Park Conservatory <https://garfieldconservatory.org/>, 
a magnificent place on the West Side, with botanical gardens and a giant 
greenhouse, trees, flowers and plants, and it’s in the heart of the ghetto. The
Lakefront Trail 
<http://www.choosechicago.com/articles/view/the-lakefront-trail/454/> runs all 
the way from 71st Street in the South Side up to 5800 North Sheridan. That’s 18 
miles, all along the Lake Michigan shore. I’ve got a mountain bike, but I need 
to get something faster – I’m getting overtaken by old ladies.

The architecture in the Loop, downtown, is spectacular. And there’s the Bean – 
it’s actually called Cloud Gate, byAnish Kapoor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/kapoor>. People love it. The Art 
Institute <http://www.artic.edu/>has a world-class collection, and it’s walking 
distance from theAdler Planetarium 
<http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/#G25tow3WDyfTL6sE.97>, the Shedd Aquarium 
<http://www.sheddaquarium.org/> and the Field Museum 
<https://www.fieldmuseum.org/>. Down at Hyde Park there’s the Museum of Science 
and Industry <http://www.msichicago.org/>, which has a second world war U-Boat 
<http://www.msichicago.org/explore/whats-here/exhibits/u-505-submarine/on-board-tour/>
. That amazes me – we’re 800 miles from the sea.

Young musicians get experience by sitting in with bands. I sat in with Muddy 
Waters a few times, and with BB King and John Lee Hooker. These days I’ll sit 
with African or Mexican artists, at places like theCity Winery 
<http://www.citywinery.com/chicago/> or the Old Town School of Folk Music 
<https://www.oldtownschool.org/>.

Chicago winters can be brutal. We lived in a high-rise around 32nd Street and 
King Drive, and I remember one time, walking to school, the wind was blowing so 
hard I was literally going backwards on the ice. I was like Michael Jackson 
doing the moonwalk.

Even people from Italy say Chicago pizza is the best in the world. Try 
Edwardo’s <http://edwardos.com/> or Giordano’s <https://giordanos.com/>. I 
often go with my wife Rosa toThai 55 <http://www.thai55restaurant.com/>, on the 
South Side near where we live – it’s convenient, affordable, you can bring your 
own wine and the food is great. I perform regularly atThe Promontory 
<http://promontorychicago.com/>, which is a relatively new venue. People say 
the food is good there, but it’s a little eclectic for me – when I look at my 
dinner I don’t want it looking back at me.

I started my Blues in Schools programme 
<http://www.billybranch.com/blues-in-schools.html> here in Chicago in 1978, and 
I now teach Blues in schools all over the world. I get invited in to teach, 
perform and educate the kids about the blues as the root of all American music. 
Sometimes we give the kids harmonicas – it’s not unusual to have up to 600 kids 
in an auditorium or a gym, and believe it or not, more often than not, it is 
not chaotic. At the ribbon-cutting of theBB King Museum 
<http://bbkingmuseum.org/> down in Mississippi back in 2008 I had 1,500 kids 
with harmonicas marching down the street.

There is a tight sense of community among Chicago’s blues musicians. They did 
a fundraiser for Howlin’ Wolf saxophonist Eddie Shaw atB.L.U.E.S 
<http://www.chicagobluesbar.com/> recently and we were all there – every 
musician who was anybody. I said onstage that I was glad we were able to do 
this while he’s here to witness it: usually when we see each other en masse 
we’re at a funeral.
