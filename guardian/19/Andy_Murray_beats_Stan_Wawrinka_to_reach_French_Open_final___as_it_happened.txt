In the Eurosport studio, they’re calling this Andy Murray’s best ever 
performance on clay. It was some effort to beat the defending champion and 
although he lost the third set, the reality is Murray thrashedStan Wawrinka 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/stanislas-wawrinka> today to reach the final 
Sunday at Roland Garros for the first time, dismantling him the quality, 
intelligence and consistency of his tennis. All he’s got to do now is beat 
Novak Djokovic in the final. Ah. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye!

Andy Murray speaks. “I knew today if I wanted to win i was going to have to 
play one of my best claycourt matches,” he says. “He was playing better every 
match here. I played one of my best matches here and I’m looking forward to the 
final now. I’m extremely proud. I never expected to reach the final here. I 
always struggled on the clay and in the last two years I’ve had some great 
results.” His voice is wobbling a bit here. I think he’s trying not to cry.

Andy Murray beats Stan Wawrinka 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2!

Serving for the match, Murray grabs the first point, charging the net and 
watching as a blocked return from Wawrinka drifts wide. He moves into a 30-0 
lead with a forehand winner and earns three matches points when a crisp 
forehand into the corner forces a scampering Wawrinka to chip long. One more 
point. That’s all he needs. One more point. One more point! He approaches the 
net and he looks like he’s in trouble with the ball on Wawrinka’s backhand. But 
Wawrinka’s had enough. He’s checked out mentally. He more or less tees Murray 
up with an awful lob and it’s all over with a simple smash! That’s it!Andy 
Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> has reached his first 
French Open final after a superb performance to knock out the defending 
champion!

Fourth set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 5-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka’s 
heading for trouble when he drops the first two points of this game. Murray 
skims the line with a lengthy backhand, before Wawrinka nets an off-balance 
forehand for 0-30. Another forehand into the net presents Murray with three 
break points and these are effectively match points. Wawrinka saves the first 
but he sends a forehand into orbit on the second. Murray, the more consistent 
player, breaks and will serve for a place in the final.

Fourth set: Murray* 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 4-2 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray 
starts this game messily, setting Wawrinka up for a smash for 0-15 with a poor 
smash and a poor lob. He doesn’t want to give Wawrinka an inch. And he’s lucky 
that he doesn’t get punished for an inviting second serve, Wawrinka spanking a 
forehand long for 15-all. From there, Murray serve-volleys for 30-15. It’s 
30-all when Murray surprisingly nets a backhand down the line with Wawrinka 
stranded; 40-30 when Wawrinka nets a forehand and Murray holds with a pinpoint 
forehand down the line.

Fourth set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 2-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): The game 
goes to 30-all. What Murray would give to break again here and he earns a break 
point with an astonishing, spinning, teasing, snaking drop shot. He can’t 
convert it, though, Wawrinka overwhelming him and forcing an error for deuce. 
Murray carves out another opportunity with a stunning lob but he steers a 
backhand wide off a second serve. Eventually Wawrinka holds with a searing 
forehand. Murray’s still got a job to finish off.

Fourth set: Murray* 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 2-0 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray 
consolidates the break. He holds to 15 but it wasn’t as easy as it sounds. 
Wawrinka is still hitting the ball venomously. “The crowd seem, if not 
anti-Murray, then certainly pro-Wawrinka,” says Simon McMahon.” No doubt it 
will be the same on Sunday should Andy make the final. Not that he cares, but 
he’ll never be the darling of the crowd wherever he goes I expect.”

Fourth set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 1-0 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Desperate 
to shake that loss of concentration out of his system, Murray is roaring after 
winning an immense rally for a 0-30 lead at the start of the fourth set. 
Wawrinka follows that up gifting him three break points with a wayward 
backhand. Yet Murray can’t take the first two. Wawrinka finds his serve again. 
But not for long. Murray trades shots from the baseline and Wawrinka blinks 
first, losing focus and sending a forehand too long. Another twist.

Stan Wawrinka wins the third set 6-4; Andy Murray leads 6-4, 6-2, 4-6!

A huge slice of luck for Wawrinka on the first point as a return skims the 
line, making it difficult for Murray. Wawrinka wins it with a smash for 0-15 
and Murray needs to be careful here. The next point is tense. Murray’s drop 
shot is a touch long. But Wawrinka slices past the baseline to make it 15-all. 
“Let’s go!” Murray shouts after winning the next point as well, grinding out a 
lengthy rally for 30-15. He gets to 40-15. But then he nets two forehands to 
make it deuce - and Wawrinka is two points away from forcing a third set. Make 
that one. Murray gifts Wawrinka a set point with a sloppy forehand. Murray 
should save it. But he’s Murray. He directs a smash straight at Wawrinka. Then 
he nets a backhand. Oh dear. We’re heading into a fourth set. Never simple.

Third set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 4-5 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Murray gets a 
little too excited on the first point, putting too much behind a forehand that 
zooms past the baseline. “Allez!” cries Wawrinka, who might just be remembering 
that he won this bloody thing last year. He holds to 15 and Murray will serve 
to stay in the third set.

he generates absurd speed on a forehand for a 40-15 lead. He holds thanks to

Third set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 3-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka pours 
some frustration into an enormous forehand winner for 15-0. Soon it’s 30-0. 
Then Murray manages to whip a forehand past Wawrinka despite colliding with a 
sign behind the baseline. Wawrinka applauds, before making it 30-all with a 
wayward forehand. He badly needs to win this point; he snatches it with a 
gorgeous, wrongfooting backhand down the line for 40-30 and he holds to 30.

Third set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 1-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka was 
broken at this point in both of the first two sets. Does lightning strike 
thrice? A crisp backhand return from Murray forces an error from Wawrinka for 
0-15. Then Wawrinka batters a angst-ridden forehand into the net for 0-30. 
Wawrinka is entering extremely choppy waters. He starts to swim to safety when 
Murray drops a backhand lob wide before Wawrinka makes it 30-all with a well 
executed volley. Yet Murray hangs on in the next rally, mixing up his defensive 
shots, and Wawrinka gives up a break point with an errant forehand. Is this the 
moment? No. Wawrinka serves brilliantly for deuce. Then Wawrinka punishes 
Murray for a lame drop shot with a backhand down the line and he holds with a 
trademark backhand. Onwards and upwards. Make no mistake, this is far from over.

Third set: Murray* 6-4, 6-2, 1-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): The stats show 
that Murray had a 92% success rate on his first serve in the second set. You 
suspect he’ll win this in straight sets if he keeps that going. After Wawrinka 
wildly misses a forehand on the first point, Murray bangs down consecutive aces 
for a 40-0 lead. He holds to love.

Third set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 0-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): It seems likely 
that Wawrinka is going to need a vastly different approach if he’s to fight 
back from this miserable position. Either that or just start playing like he 
did in last year’s final. Just hit winner after winner. It’s not beyond him. 
Don’t be surprised if he forces a fourth set at least. He begins the third by 
holding to 15.

Andy Murray wins the second set to lead 6-4, 6-2!

Wawrinka’s not going away without a fight, mind you, and he wins the first 
point here by setting himself up for a volleyed winner after a big backhand. 
But Murray wins the next three points - more errors from Wawrinka - to bring up 
two set points and he takes the first with a serve out wide that’s framed by 
the Swiss. Murray is two sets up and I have to admit that I didn’t see this 
coming. Certainly not this easily.

Second set: Murray 6-4, 4-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka’s 10th 
unforced error on the backhand side makes it 30-all and Murray earns a break 
point with a backhand missile down the line. Murray could take a huge step 
towards a two-set point here; but Wawrinka comes up with a nerveless forehand 
winner to force deuce. Murray earns himself another chance, though, achieving 
just another power with a backhand pass to force Wawrinka to stretch and net a 
volley. This time, there’s no escape. Wawrinka pounces on a short ball but he 
blinks and hits a forehand straight at Murray, who’s not about to miss with a 
backhand pass down the line. This is outstanding tennis from the world No2. Can 
he maintain this level?

Second set: Murray* 6-4, 3-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray’s entered The 
Zone. A fearsome backhand down the lawn draws appreciative applause from the 
crowd and a thumbs up from Wawrinka. And nothing’s going right for Wawrinka 
right now. He reaches a drop shot at 40-15 but hits the tape with a forehand 
and sees his shot deflect wide.

Second set: Murray 6-4, 2-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Murray absolutely 
batters the fuzz off the ball with a backhand to make it 0-15. He’s pushing 
Wawrinka around here and that’s leading to errors from the defending champion, 
who’s soon facing three break points. Murray is moving so smoothly and Wawrinka 
looks uncertain. He tries to drop shot his way out of trouble but his effort 
rolls meekly into the net. Murray breaks.

Second set: Murray* 6-4, 1-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Wawrinka should win 
the first point here. He doesn’t. Murray emerges triumphant at the net and then 
he makes it 30-0 with a cracking drop shot. He volleys with poise to make it

Andy Murray wins the first set 6-4!

With Murray serving for the first set, the first two points are shared, both 
players making errors. Then Murray nails a huge serve to make it 30-15, before 
he loses an awesome rally, netting a forehand on the run after a searing 
backhand from Wawrinka. It’s 30-all, a massive point, but Murray brings up a 
set point with a big forehand that Wawrinka can only turn into the net. But 
this isn’t done yet. Wawrinka returns well from a second serve and sets himself 
up for a forehand winner down the middle for deuce and then he earns a break 
point, flaying a backhand past Murray, who’s given a time violation warning 
before the next serve. That fires him up sufficiently to hammer down a big 
serve, Wawrinka blocking long. “Let’s go!” Murray roars. But then it’s 
Wawrinka’s return to roar as he brings up a second break point with a monstrous 
forehand. Murray saves it again. Yet he’s facing a third. Wawrinka slams a 
backhand down the line and Murray nets a forehand volley. This is bubbling now 
and Murray denies Wawrinka again, serving firmly out wide, before earning a 
second set point with a forehand approach, Wawrinka hitting a backhand long and 
wide on the run. Can he take this one? He can! Another massive serve draws 
another error from Wawrinka and the first set is Murray’s!

First set: Murray 5-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka can hardly believe 
it after walloping an easy smash well past the baseline at 15-0. My word. That 
was like one of mine. But he gets it out of his system by holding to 15 with an 
ace down the middle to ensure that Murray will have to serve for the first set.

First set: Murray* 5-3 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray is trying to get the 
umpire to remove the overhead camera during play. I suspect he’ll get his way 
eventually. But it doesn’t seem to be affecting him as he sweeps into a 40-0 
lead here and he holds to love. He’s a game away from taking the opening set.

First set: Murray 4-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka begins the game 
with a double-fault for 0-15, his first of the match. His first serve 
percentage isn’t what it could be at the moment and he’s starting to suffer a 
little, rushing a forehand volley wide for 0-30. He steadies himself and wins 
the next two points, his backhand beginning to fire, but then he drags a 
forehand wide to hand Murray a break point. He misses a first serve. Healmost 
misses a second. But a backhand down the line saves a break point. A splendid 
return from Murray earns a second break point but he can’t beat the net with a 
forehand down the line and Wawrinka eventually holds and keeps alive his hopes 
of taking this set.

First set: Murray* 4-2 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Wawrinka was complaining 
about something during the changeover. It’s not clear what he’s unhappy about, 
though, and the umpire isn’t too interested, so on we go. Murray’s quickly into 
a 30-0 lead thanks to two innocuous Wawrinka returns and he makes it 40-0 by 
dropping a backhand down the line with his opponent stranded at the net. He 
holds to 15. “Come on!” he barks.

First set: Murray 3-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka glides to 40-0

nonetheless. This is warming up nicely.

First set: Murray* 3-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Looking to consolidate the 
break, Murray makes a scratchy start, knocking a backhand long for 0-15 and 
Wawrinka senses an opportunity, attacking with a forehand, finishing off the 
next point with a pinpoint volley. Murray clatters back to 30-all with two 
fierce forehands. He moves to 40-30 when Wawrinka nets a slice and Murray holds 
to 30, catching the Swiss out with a forehand lob. This is very impressive from 
Murray at the moment.

First set: Murray 2-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Murray wins his first point 
on the Wawrinka serve, the Swiss netting a forehand for 0-15, before an 
excellent backhand return from Murray draws an error for 15-30. All of a 
sudden, Murray has two break points, pushing Wawrinka back with some heavy 
hitting and forcing him to miss another backhand. He can’t take the first - but 
he’s ruthless on the second. He opens up the court for a forehand down the 
line. Wawrinka just gets it back. Murray drop shots. Wawrinka lobs. But it’s 
not high enough. Murray leaps into a devastating overhead backhand and Wawrinka 
can’t stoop low enough to make his volley. Murray breaks!

First set: Murray* 1-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Wawrinka dictates much of 
the first point here, but he loses it when he sends a backhand down the line 
wide for 15-0. But he wins the next two points. Murray pushes a forehand long 
and Wawrinka takes control of the next rally with a big forehand down the line. 
The defending champion looks confident, strong and inspired here. Beating him 
will require a monumental effort, that’s already clear. But Murray’s not shy of 
hard or painful work. He forces an error to make it 30-all before acing for 
40-30. Yet the game goes to deuce. Murray is struggling to finish this game off 
and he’s facing a break point after carelessly netting a forehand. Yet he saves 
it brilliantly, dragging Wawrinka forward with a drop shot before punching a 
backhand volley down the line for deuce. Eventually Murray holds, cracking a 
backhand from left to right. He’ll be relieved to emerge unscathed.

First set: Murray 0-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Stan Wawrinka won the toss 
and elected to serve first. They begin by lobbing boulders over the net at each 
other, before Murray nets a forehand to make it 15-0. Wawrinka has started 
ominously well, moving into a 40-0 lead thanks to a couple of deft volleys and 
he holds thanks to a dreamy drop shot. He couldn’t have played that any better. 
“I feel like we’ve been cheated over the last 5 years of GS matches between 
Stan and our boy,” says Adam Hirst. “It just looks like the best, most 
interesting match-up in tennis. Stan will be constantly going for the lines, 
and he’ll have to to beat our new Clay-More Murray.”

Bonjour! Perplexing against Radek Stepanek and Mathias Bourgue, comfortable 
against Ivo Karlovic and John Isner, sloppy then inspired over the course of 
four sets against Richard Gasquet, now Andy Murray needs to produce his best 
tennis on a consistent basis if he is to reach his first French Open final. A 
confrontation withStan Wawrinka 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/stanislas-wawrinka> beckons and while Murray 
leads their head-to-head record 8-7, he has lost both of their meetings on clay 
and will not have forgotten the defending champion bundling him out of the US 
Open in straight sets in 2013. Wawrinka has won their previous three matches; 
Murray hasn’t beaten him since London 2012, when the Swiss was a slightly 
chubbier animal, still to rid himself of his puppy fat.

The world No2 has rarely found it easy against Wawrinka, even before the Swiss 
began to make the most of his vast talent, culminating in his breakthrough 
triumph at the Australian Open in 2014 and his upset of Novak Djokovic in last 
year’sFrench Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/frenchopen> final. 
Wawrinka, always unpredictable, isn’t exactly a model of athleticism despite 
his improved fitness and his form on clay has been patchy this year. But he is 
one of the strongest men on the tour, capable of mainlining winners off both 
wings when the mood takes him, and other than a first-round wobble against 
Lukas Rosol, the 31-year-old has mostly been untroubled in Paris.

The third seed and world No4 has recorded grand-slam victories over each 
member of the Big Four since surging up the rankings in 2013, while Murray 
hasn’t beaten anyone seeded higher than seven at a slam since winning 
Wimbledon. That run will have to change today if he’s to capitalise on the 
excellent form on clay that has brought him three titles and victories over 
Djokovic and Nadal on the red stuff in the past 12 months. If Murray has any 
doubts, he only needs to remember that he beat Djokovic in the final in Rome 
two weeks ago. Even so, this one is too tight to call. Whatever happens, 
though, the next two, three or four hours are unlikely to be dull.

Play begins: soon.

French Open 2016: Andy Murray marches into final
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/03/french-open-2016-andy-murray-stan-wawrinka-match-report> 
In the Eurosport studio, they’re calling this Andy Murray’s best ever 
performance on clay. It was some effort to beat the defending champion and 
although he lost the third set, the reality is Murray thrashedStan Wawrinka 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/stanislas-wawrinka> today to reach the final 
Sunday at Roland Garros for the first time, dismantling him the quality, 
intelligence and consistency of his tennis. All he’s got to do now is beat 
Novak Djokovic in the final. Ah. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye!
 
Andy Murray speaks. “I knew today if I wanted to win i was going to have to 
play one of my best claycourt matches,” he says. “He was playing better every 
match here. I played one of my best matches here and I’m looking forward to the 
final now. I’m extremely proud. I never expected to reach the final here. I 
always struggled on the clay and in the last two years I’ve had some great 
results.” His voice is wobbling a bit here. I think he’s trying not to cry.
 
Serving for the match, Murray grabs the first point, charging the net and 
watching as a blocked return from Wawrinka drifts wide. He moves into a 30-0 
lead with a forehand winner and earns three matches points when a crisp 
forehand into the corner forces a scampering Wawrinka to chip long. One more 
point. That’s all he needs. One more point. One more point! He approaches the 
net and he looks like he’s in trouble with the ball on Wawrinka’s backhand. But 
Wawrinka’s had enough. He’s checked out mentally. He more or less tees Murray 
up with an awful lob and it’s all over with a simple smash! That’s it!Andy 
Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> has reached his first 
French Open final after a superb performance to knock out the defending 
champion!

Fourth set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 5-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka’s 
heading for trouble when he drops the first two points of this game. Murray 
skims the line with a lengthy backhand, before Wawrinka nets an off-balance 
forehand for 0-30. Another forehand into the net presents Murray with three 
break points and these are effectively match points. Wawrinka saves the first 
but he sends a forehand into orbit on the second. Murray, the more consistent 
player, breaks and will serve for a place in the final.

Fourth set: Murray* 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 4-2 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray 
starts this game messily, setting Wawrinka up for a smash for 0-15 with a poor 
smash and a poor lob. He doesn’t want to give Wawrinka an inch. And he’s lucky 
that he doesn’t get punished for an inviting second serve, Wawrinka spanking a 
forehand long for 15-all. From there, Murray serve-volleys for 30-15. It’s 
30-all when Murray surprisingly nets a backhand down the line with Wawrinka 
stranded; 40-30 when Wawrinka nets a forehand and Murray holds with a pinpoint 
forehand down the line.
 
Fourth set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 3-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka 
hits the tape twice in this game - and still holds to love. There’s life in 
this one yet.
 
Fourth set: Murray* 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 3-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray 
makes it 30-0 with another preposterous drop shot before making it 40-0 with 
some precise tennis. He holds to 15. Three more of those and he’ll be in the 
final.
 
Fourth set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 2-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): The game 
goes to 30-all. What Murray would give to break again here and he earns a break 
point with an astonishing, spinning, teasing, snaking drop shot. He can’t 
convert it, though, Wawrinka overwhelming him and forcing an error for deuce. 
Murray carves out another opportunity with a stunning lob but he steers a 
backhand wide off a second serve. Eventually Wawrinka holds with a searing 
forehand. Murray’s still got a job to finish off.
 
Fourth set: Murray* 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 2-0 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray 
consolidates the break. He holds to 15 but it wasn’t as easy as it sounds. 
Wawrinka is still hitting the ball venomously. “The crowd seem, if not 
anti-Murray, then certainly pro-Wawrinka,” says Simon McMahon.” No doubt it 
will be the same on Sunday should Andy make the final. Not that he cares, but 
he’ll never be the darling of the crowd wherever he goes I expect.”

Fourth set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 1-0 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Desperate 
to shake that loss of concentration out of his system, Murray is roaring after 
winning an immense rally for a 0-30 lead at the start of the fourth set. 
Wawrinka follows that up gifting him three break points with a wayward 
backhand. Yet Murray can’t take the first two. Wawrinka finds his serve again. 
But not for long. Murray trades shots from the baseline and Wawrinka blinks 
first, losing focus and sending a forehand too long. Another twist.
 
A huge slice of luck for Wawrinka on the first point as a return skims the 
line, making it difficult for Murray. Wawrinka wins it with a smash for 0-15 
and Murray needs to be careful here. The next point is tense. Murray’s drop 
shot is a touch long. But Wawrinka slices past the baseline to make it 15-all. 
“Let’s go!” Murray shouts after winning the next point as well, grinding out a 
lengthy rally for 30-15. He gets to 40-15. But then he nets two forehands to 
make it deuce - and Wawrinka is two points away from forcing a third set. Make 
that one. Murray gifts Wawrinka a set point with a sloppy forehand. Murray 
should save it. But he’s Murray. He directs a smash straight at Wawrinka. Then 
he nets a backhand. Oh dear. We’re heading into a fourth set. Never simple.

Third set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 4-5 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Murray gets a 
little too excited on the first point, putting too much behind a forehand that 
zooms past the baseline. “Allez!” cries Wawrinka, who might just be remembering 
that he won this bloody thing last year. He holds to 15 and Murray will serve 
to stay in the third set.
 
Third set: Murray* 6-4, 6-2, 4-4 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray chirps as 
he generates absurd speed on a forehand for a 40-15 lead. He holds thanks to 
more solid serving.

Third set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 3-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka pours 
some frustration into an enormous forehand winner for 15-0. Soon it’s 30-0. 
Then Murray manages to whip a forehand past Wawrinka despite colliding with a 
sign behind the baseline. Wawrinka applauds, before making it 30-all with a 
wayward forehand. He badly needs to win this point; he snatches it with a 
gorgeous, wrongfooting backhand down the line for 40-30 and he holds to 30.
 
Third set: Murray* 6-4, 6-2, 3-3 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray is yet to 
lose a point on his first serve in this set. He holds to love.
 
Third set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 2-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka is 
definitely improving. He’s hitting the spot more with his first serve now and 
it’s bringing him some free points. He holds to 15.

Third set: Murray* 6-4, 6-2, 2-2 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Wawrinka has won 
from two sets down before. He’s done it six times overall, four times at Roland 
Garros. But not since beating Richard Gasquet 6-7, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 8-6 here in 
2013. As for this game, Murray holds to love.
 
Third set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 1-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka was 
broken at this point in both of the first two sets. Does lightning strike 
thrice? A crisp backhand return from Murray forces an error from Wawrinka for 
0-15. Then Wawrinka batters a angst-ridden forehand into the net for 0-30. 
Wawrinka is entering extremely choppy waters. He starts to swim to safety when 
Murray drops a backhand lob wide before Wawrinka makes it 30-all with a well 
executed volley. Yet Murray hangs on in the next rally, mixing up his defensive 
shots, and Wawrinka gives up a break point with an errant forehand. Is this the 
moment? No. Wawrinka serves brilliantly for deuce. Then Wawrinka punishes 
Murray for a lame drop shot with a backhand down the line and he holds with a 
trademark backhand. Onwards and upwards. Make no mistake, this is far from over.
 
Third set: Murray* 6-4, 6-2, 1-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): The stats show 
that Murray had a 92% success rate on his first serve in the second set. You 
suspect he’ll win this in straight sets if he keeps that going. After Wawrinka 
wildly misses a forehand on the first point, Murray bangs down consecutive aces 
for a 40-0 lead. He holds to love.
 
Third set: Murray 6-4, 6-2, 0-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): It seems likely 
that Wawrinka is going to need a vastly different approach if he’s to fight 
back from this miserable position. Either that or just start playing like he 
did in last year’s final. Just hit winner after winner. It’s not beyond him. 
Don’t be surprised if he forces a fourth set at least. He begins the third by 
holding to 15.
 
Wawrinka’s not going away without a fight, mind you, and he wins the first 
point here by setting himself up for a volleyed winner after a big backhand. 
But Murray wins the next three points - more errors from Wawrinka - to bring up 
two set points and he takes the first with a serve out wide that’s framed by 
the Swiss. Murray is two sets up and I have to admit that I didn’t see this 
coming. Certainly not this easily.

Second set: Murray 6-4, 5-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka begins the 
game by sneezing a forehand long; he makes up for it with a couple of vicious 
forehands that make it 40-15 and he holds when Murray drifts a forehand long. 
Murray will serve for the second set.
 
Second set: Murray* 6-4, 5-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray holds to love. 
What he’s done particularly well is absorb and neutralise Wawrinka’s power. 
Wawrinka will serve to stay in the second set.
 
Second set: Murray 6-4, 4-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka’s 10th 
unforced error on the backhand side makes it 30-all and Murray earns a break 
point with a backhand missile down the line. Murray could take a huge step 
towards a two-set point here; but Wawrinka comes up with a nerveless forehand 
winner to force deuce. Murray earns himself another chance, though, achieving 
just another power with a backhand pass to force Wawrinka to stretch and net a 
volley. This time, there’s no escape. Wawrinka pounces on a short ball but he 
blinks and hits a forehand straight at Murray, who’s not about to miss with a 
backhand pass down the line. This is outstanding tennis from the world No2. Can 
he maintain this level?

Second set: Murray* 6-4, 3-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray’s entered The 
Zone. A fearsome backhand down the lawn draws appreciative applause from the 
crowd and a thumbs up from Wawrinka. And nothing’s going right for Wawrinka 
right now. He reaches a drop shot at 40-15 but hits the tape with a forehand 
and sees his shot deflect wide.
 
Second set: Murray 6-4, 2-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Murray absolutely 
batters the fuzz off the ball with a backhand to make it 0-15. He’s pushing 
Wawrinka around here and that’s leading to errors from the defending champion, 
who’s soon facing three break points. Murray is moving so smoothly and Wawrinka 
looks uncertain. He tries to drop shot his way out of trouble but his effort 
rolls meekly into the net. Murray breaks.

Second set: Murray* 6-4, 1-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Wawrinka should win 
the first point here. He doesn’t. Murray emerges triumphant at the net and then 
he makes it 30-0 with a cracking drop shot. He volleys with poise to make it 
40-0 and holds to 15. Fears that Murray’s intensity might dip look unfounded.
 
Second set: Murray 6-4, 0-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): That was such a 
brilliant first set, perhaps the highest standard we’ve seen in this tournament 
so far. Wawrinka has started this one confidently too, holding to 15.
 
With Murray serving for the first set, the first two points are shared, both 
players making errors. Then Murray nails a huge serve to make it 30-15, before 
he loses an awesome rally, netting a forehand on the run after a searing 
backhand from Wawrinka. It’s 30-all, a massive point, but Murray brings up a 
set point with a big forehand that Wawrinka can only turn into the net. But 
this isn’t done yet. Wawrinka returns well from a second serve and sets himself 
up for a forehand winner down the middle for deuce and then he earns a break 
point, flaying a backhand past Murray, who’s given a time violation warning 
before the next serve. That fires him up sufficiently to hammer down a big 
serve, Wawrinka blocking long. “Let’s go!” Murray roars. But then it’s 
Wawrinka’s return to roar as he brings up a second break point with a monstrous 
forehand. Murray saves it again. Yet he’s facing a third. Wawrinka slams a 
backhand down the line and Murray nets a forehand volley. This is bubbling now 
and Murray denies Wawrinka again, serving firmly out wide, before earning a 
second set point with a forehand approach, Wawrinka hitting a backhand long and 
wide on the run. Can he take this one? He can! Another massive serve draws 
another error from Wawrinka and the first set is Murray’s!

First set: Murray 5-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka can hardly believe 
it after walloping an easy smash well past the baseline at 15-0. My word. That 
was like one of mine. But he gets it out of his system by holding to 15 with an 
ace down the middle to ensure that Murray will have to serve for the first set.
 
First set: Murray* 5-3 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Murray is trying to get the 
umpire to remove the overhead camera during play. I suspect he’ll get his way 
eventually. But it doesn’t seem to be affecting him as he sweeps into a 40-0 
lead here and he holds to love. He’s a game away from taking the opening set.
 Murray returns. Photograph: Christophe Ena/AP  
First set: Murray 4-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka begins the game 
with a double-fault for 0-15, his first of the match. His first serve 
percentage isn’t what it could be at the moment and he’s starting to suffer a 
little, rushing a forehand volley wide for 0-30. He steadies himself and wins 
the next two points, his backhand beginning to fire, but then he drags a 
forehand wide to hand Murray a break point. He misses a first serve. Healmost 
misses a second. But a backhand down the line saves a break point. A splendid 
return from Murray earns a second break point but he can’t beat the net with a 
forehand down the line and Wawrinka eventually holds and keeps alive his hopes 
of taking this set.
 
First set: Murray* 4-2 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Wawrinka was complaining 
about something during the changeover. It’s not clear what he’s unhappy about, 
though, and the umpire isn’t too interested, so on we go. Murray’s quickly into 
a 30-0 lead thanks to two innocuous Wawrinka returns and he makes it 40-0 by 
dropping a backhand down the line with his opponent stranded at the net. He 
holds to 15. “Come on!” he barks.
 
First set: Murray 3-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Wawrinka glides to 40-0 
thanks to three well constructed points. He briefly threatens to let Murray 
back into it but holds to 15. Wawrinka hasn’t done a lot wrong but he’s behind 
nonetheless. This is warming up nicely.
 
First set: Murray* 3-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Looking to consolidate the 
break, Murray makes a scratchy start, knocking a backhand long for 0-15 and 
Wawrinka senses an opportunity, attacking with a forehand, finishing off the 
next point with a pinpoint volley. Murray clatters back to 30-all with two 
fierce forehands. He moves to 40-30 when Wawrinka nets a slice and Murray holds 
to 30, catching the Swiss out with a forehand lob. This is very impressive from 
Murray at the moment.

First set: Murray 2-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Murray wins his first point 
on the Wawrinka serve, the Swiss netting a forehand for 0-15, before an 
excellent backhand return from Murray draws an error for 15-30. All of a 
sudden, Murray has two break points, pushing Wawrinka back with some heavy 
hitting and forcing him to miss another backhand. He can’t take the first - but 
he’s ruthless on the second. He opens up the court for a forehand down the 
line. Wawrinka just gets it back. Murray drop shots. Wawrinka lobs. But it’s 
not high enough. Murray leaps into a devastating overhead backhand and Wawrinka 
can’t stoop low enough to make his volley. Murray breaks!
 
First set: Murray* 1-1 Wawrinka (*denotes server): Wawrinka dictates much of 
the first point here, but he loses it when he sends a backhand down the line 
wide for 15-0. But he wins the next two points. Murray pushes a forehand long 
and Wawrinka takes control of the next rally with a big forehand down the line. 
The defending champion looks confident, strong and inspired here. Beating him 
will require a monumental effort, that’s already clear. But Murray’s not shy of 
hard or painful work. He forces an error to make it 30-all before acing for 
40-30. Yet the game goes to deuce. Murray is struggling to finish this game off 
and he’s facing a break point after carelessly netting a forehand. Yet he saves 
it brilliantly, dragging Wawrinka forward with a drop shot before punching a 
backhand volley down the line for deuce. Eventually Murray holds, cracking a 
backhand from left to right. He’ll be relieved to emerge unscathed.

First set: Murray 0-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes server): Stan Wawrinka won the toss 
and elected to serve first. They begin by lobbing boulders over the net at each 
other, before Murray nets a forehand to make it 15-0. Wawrinka has started 
ominously well, moving into a 40-0 lead thanks to a couple of deft volleys and 
he holds thanks to a dreamy drop shot. He couldn’t have played that any better. 
“I feel like we’ve been cheated over the last 5 years of GS matches between 
Stan and our boy,” says Adam Hirst. “It just looks like the best, most 
interesting match-up in tennis. Stan will be constantly going for the lines, 
and he’ll have to to beat our new Clay-More Murray.”

Bonjour! Perplexing against Radek Stepanek and Mathias Bourgue, comfortable 
against Ivo Karlovic and John Isner, sloppy then inspired over the course of 
four sets against Richard Gasquet, now Andy Murray needs to produce his best 
tennis on a consistent basis if he is to reach his first French Open final. A 
confrontation withStan Wawrinka 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/stanislas-wawrinka> beckons and while Murray 
leads their head-to-head record 8-7, he has lost both of their meetings on clay 
and will not have forgotten the defending champion bundling him out of the US 
Open in straight sets in 2013. Wawrinka has won their previous three matches; 
Murray hasn’t beaten him since London 2012, when the Swiss was a slightly 
chubbier animal, still to rid himself of his puppy fat.

The world No2 has rarely found it easy against Wawrinka, even before the Swiss 
began to make the most of his vast talent, culminating in his breakthrough 
triumph at the Australian Open in 2014 and his upset of Novak Djokovic in last 
year’sFrench Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/frenchopen> final. 
Wawrinka, always unpredictable, isn’t exactly a model of athleticism despite 
his improved fitness and his form on clay has been patchy this year. But he is 
one of the strongest men on the tour, capable of mainlining winners off both 
wings when the mood takes him, and other than a first-round wobble against 
Lukas Rosol, the 31-year-old has mostly been untroubled in Paris.

The third seed and world No4 has recorded grand-slam victories over each 
member of the Big Four since surging up the rankings in 2013, while Murray 
hasn’t beaten anyone seeded higher than seven at a slam since winning 
Wimbledon. That run will have to change today if he’s to capitalise on the 
excellent form on clay that has brought him three titles and victories over 
Djokovic and Nadal on the red stuff in the past 12 months. If Murray has any 
doubts, he only needs to remember that he beat Djokovic in the final in Rome 
two weeks ago. Even so, this one is too tight to call. Whatever happens, 
though, the next two, three or four hours are unlikely to be dull.

Play begins: soon.
