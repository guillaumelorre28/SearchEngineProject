Banks help push European shares higher

A surge in the banking sector has helped lift European markets, as investors 
once again shrugged off the Italian referendum result and the resignation of 
prime ministerMatteo Renzi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-renzi>. 
Hopes that the country’s parliament might pass a budget on Wednesday provided 
some support, as did the continuing optimism that investors might rescue 
struggling Monte dei Paschi. If that does not happen, there was growing talk 
that a state bailout could take place this weekend.

The idea that the bank would be recapitalised one way or another pushed the 
Italian banking index 9% higher, its best one day performance since 8 July. 
Monte dei Paschi itself added 1%, while Unicredit climbed 13%.

Elsewhere Deutsche Bank jumped 8% while in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland rose 
nearly 6% and Barclays 4.5%.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 33.01 points or 0.49% at 6779.84 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.85% to 10,775.32 
 * France’s Cac climbed 1.26% to 4631.94 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB jumped 4.15% to 17,757.80 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 2.64% higher at 8893.3 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.36% to 622.52 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 19 points or 
0.1%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Back with Boeing, and Donald Trump’s tweet  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/06/italy-monte-dei-paschi-rescue-markets-relaxed-business-live?page=with:block-5846c659e4b056d3d56adf49#block-5846c659e4b056d3d56adf49>
saying the company was charging too much to build the new Air Force One - $4bn 
- and should lose the contract.

Boeing has now responded with a statement 
<http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2016-12-06-Boeing-Statement-on-Air-Force-One>, 
saying:

We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities 
of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the 
President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air 
Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best 
planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.

Ratings agency Fitch has moved its outlook on Italian banks from stable to 
negative for 2017, in the wake of the referendum vote and worries about their 
ability to recapitalise. Fitch said:

The Negative Outlook for the Italian banking sector reflects its increased 
vulnerability to shocks following the asset-quality deterioration in legacy 
portfolios... A step-up in pressure from authorities and market participants on 
the sector to reduce the very high levels of impaired loans has increased 
urgency and risks for Italian banks.

Profitability in the sector is frail. Disposals of non-performing loan 
portfolios could lead to losses that require additional capital. These are some 
of the factors driving the 2017 Outlook to Negative from Stable. Problems for a 
small number of distressed banks raising capital have added to these pressures

The “No” vote at the constitutional referendum has further heightened 
political uncertainty and possibly reduced the capacity to implement economic 
reforms. The risks from political instability were one factor that contributed 
to our revision of the Outlook on Italy’s ‘BBB+’ sovereign rating to Negative 
in October.

The referendum result could also damage the recapitalisation plans of some 
Italian banks, most notably Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and UniCredit, and 
have negative implications for the broader banking sector, whose attractiveness 
with investors has already reduced significantly during 2016. The sector’s 
ability to access the institutional markets for funding and capital, which has 
become more difficult and expensive this year, could deteriorate further...

Significant disposals that materially improve asset quality could be positive 
for ratings. However, the disposals are likely to result in further 
provisioning and possibly more capital shortfalls for the banks involved. 
Portfolio sales could also result in risk-weighted assets rising for the 
remaining loans if the sales affect loss-given-default estimates at banks using 
internal rating models.

Capitalisation will remain under pressure in 2017 with a weak earnings outlook 
limiting banks’ ability to build capital. Low interest rates, tepid economic 
growth and fierce competition for healthy borrowers are challenges for 
earnings. Profitability could also be dented by restructuring costs as banks 
focus on cost-cutting.

We also believe regulators could require higher capital buffers from Italian 
banks to compensate for the risk in their large non-performing loan portfolios 
and for the large portion of Italian sovereign debt held. This could result in 
additional capital requirements at some banks.

The Italian referendum proved a non-event for markets, including emerging 
markets, because it had effectively been priced in, and at the same time 
suggested the European Central Bank might well extend its quantitative easing 
programme this week. So says David Rees of Capital Economics. But he adds:

Nonetheless, the political situation in Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, and indeed the rise of populism in 
Europe more generally, is something to keep an eye on in the months ahead. 
Italy’s economy and banking sector are weak, and if the Five Star Movement’s 
momentum continues to build, it may not be long before an exit from the euro 
becomes a more realistic concern for investors....Similar fears have rocked 
emerging market equities in the past, when the Greek debt crisis first came to 
the fore and Spanish and Italian bonds came under fire in 2012.

Italy’s banking sector continues to recover, helped by talk that the country’s 
parliament might approve its budget on Wednesday, and there could be a state 
bailout of troubled Monte dei Paschi this weekend.

The country’s banking index is currently up more than 7%, its best daily 
performance since the middle of July.

The overall European banking index is up 3%, hitting its highest level since 
the middle of January.

Rupert Jones

More fallout from Donald Trump’s election - this time affecting UK mortgage 
rates. Rupert Jones reports:

The first evidence has emerged that the era of record-low fixed-rate mortgages 
may be coming to an end after HSBC withdrew its “cheapest-ever” deal and 
increased rates on other products.

HSBC had been offering a mortgage that allowed customers to lock in for two 
years at a rate of 0.99%, but this deal has been pulled with immediate effect. 
The bank’s new mortgage offers are coming in at up to 0.5% higher.

The move follows warnings from mortgage brokers that a number of factors, 
including Donald Trump’s US election win,were set to push up the cost of new 
fixed-rate home loans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/19/mortgage-rates-fixed-deals-brexit-trump>
.

David Hollingworth at broker London & Country Mortgages 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages> said: “The bottom of the market 
may have been hit. This [announcement] and the broader changes from HSBC, which 
has been very aggressively priced in the fixed-rate market, could spell the end 
of the sub-1% fixed rate, but also signals a potential turning point for fixed 
mortgage rates.”

Donald Trump may be casting doubt on Boeing’s Air Force One order, but 
elsewhere US manufacturers are doing well.

New orders for US factory goods rose 2.7% in October, the biggest increase for 
nearly a year and a half and just above expectations of a 2.6% improvement. The 
September figure was revised upwards from a gain of 0.3% to 0.6%. The latest 
figures mark the fourth straight month of increases.

But there could be clouds ahead, given the strength of the dollar following 
Trump’s election victory. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said:

US factory orders surged... in October, providing manufacturers with plenty of 
optimism in what has been a turbulent year.

Uncertainty surrounds the sector, though, amid renewed strength of the dollar 
and the incoming president’s trade policy, particularly his approach to China.

Donald Trump’s promised fiscal stimulus and the increasing likelihood of 
raising interest rates has fuelled a greenback rally, and that could starve off 
exports and hit US factories hard in the new year.

Trump tweet sends Boeing shares down 1%

Along with the Oval Office, the nuclear codes and the attention of the whole 
world, winning a US presidential election gives you the power to move the 
markets.

And airline maker Boeing just saw that for itself.

Shares in Boeing fell by 1% at the start of trading in New York, after Donald 
Trump declared on Twitter (where else?) that the firm was charging too much to 
build the new Air Force One, and should lose the contract.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but 
costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!

Greek government welcomes debt relief moves, but clashes loom

Helena Smith

Over in Greece this morning there has been much merriment over the euro 
group’s decision last night todefine the contours of a debt relief agreement 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-eurogroup-idUSKBN13T0ZN> for 
the country long at the centre of Europe’s financial crisis.

 Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens

For the first time since economic crisis engulfed Greece just over seven years 
ago, a sitting government in Athens has felt fit to describe a decision taken 
in Brussels as a “national success.”

The positive spin and brave faces that have greeted the three bailouts rolled 
out for Greece, so far, have today been superseded by a genuine sense of relief 
at the announcement of short-term measures to lighten the country’s mountainous 
debt load.

Many in Syriza, the governing left-wing party, said the move by euro zone 
partners to shave €45bn euros off the pile – the equivalent of 22 percent of 
GDP – by extending the repayment period and adjusting interest rates - exceeded 
“every expectation.”

Addressing reporters today the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos 
described the decision both as a “significant achievement” and “decisive step 
for the stabilisation of the Greek economy and complete restoration of 
confidence.”

anniversary rally marking the 2008 police shooting of 15-year-old student,

But as Greece’s political opposition was quick to point out the victory was 
bittersweet.

 This might be the first time that the nation’s unmanageable debt burden has 
been addressed head-on – and as such can only be seen as rich reward for prime 
minister Alexis Tsipras - but it comes against a backdrop of calls for Athens 
to adopt yet more austerity once its current bailout programme expires in 
mid-2018.

Amid signs of a looming showdown with the International Monetary Fund, which 
says further belt-tightening is the only way to plug the looming fiscal gap and 
thus ensure its own participation in Greece’s third bailout to date, the 
spokesman called the demands “irrational.”

Athens, he insisted, would neither accept the German proposal for Greece to 
achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % through 2028 nor the IMF’s demands for extra 
measures in 2019 and 2020. Both are expected to dominate talks when auditors 
representing creditor institutions return to continue negotiating a second 
review of policy measures set as the price of bailout funds.

 “Greek society cannot endure more measures,” said Interior minister Panos 
Skourletis hinting at the battle that is brewing. “The Greek economy can’t 
endure them either.”

But shares are now pushing higher again, following a report that the 
parliament might approve the 2017 budget on Wednesday, in a confidence vote.

That’s sent the FTSE MIB index back up to its earlier highs, gaining 1.7% 
today.

Italian election in February 2017 predicted

Over in Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, a political leader 
has suggested that fresh general elections could be held next February.

Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, whose centre-right party is part of Matteo 
Renzi’s coalition, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that:


“I forecast there will be the will to go to elections in February.”

Significantly, Alfano was speaking after having met with Renzi (whose 
resignation was put on hold by the country’s president last night).

Here’s Reuters’ take:

One fundamental problem with Italian banks is that there are too many of them, 
says Kathleen Brooks of City Index.

She argues that closing some branches would help make the sector competitive, 
and free up capital for other uses:

Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> has more bank branches than 
pizzerias, in the future it desperately needs more pizza and less banks!

She also explains why Monte dei Paschi’s future matters, especially if its 
cash call fail this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/06/italy-monte-dei-paschi-rescue-markets-relaxed-business-live?page=with:block-5846798ae4b056d3d56add9f#block-5846798ae4b056d3d56add9f>
.

It’s certainly not as systemically important as other banks, for example 
Italy’s Unicredit, but Monte dei Paschi’s main problem is that it has become 
symbolic of Italy’s rotten banking sector that now relies on foreign capital 
for life support.

If the Qatari’s decide against investing in it then it gives a terrible signal 
to the world about the ‘investability’ of Europe’s banks. Interestingly, in 
Europe it is not the systemically important banks that are the biggest risk to 
the financial sector, but the glut of mid-size banks that hold billions in bad 
debts that could endanger the health of the bigger banks in Europe, if 
contagion is to spread.

Business confidence in Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> is 
likely to be hurt by the political uncertainty created by Sunday’s referendum 
result, and the struggles in the banking sector.

Ana Boata, economist at trade insurance firm Euler Hermes, believes 0.3 
percentage points could be knocked off growth next year, taking the annual rate 
down from 0.9% to 0.6%.

She predicts that foreign investment will be hit, and Italian firms could 
suffer high financing costs if their banks remain weak:

While there is no need to panic, the resounding ‘No’ result and political 
turmoil that has followed could cause a mild confidence crisis in 2017. Even 
without any spill over to banks or the bond market, we expect -0.3pp of Italian 
GDP could be shaven off, leaving the economy with the prospect of a mere 0.6% 
growth next year.

“It will be Italian companies that bear the brunt of a confidence shock, 
albeit a mild one, which are already contending with some of the worst cash 
flow conditions in the world – businesses are waiting on average for 88 days 
for payment for goods and services. We are likely to see divestment from abroad 
and tougher financing conditions mean that inward investment levels will stay 
flat, compared to 2% growth we previously predicted for 2017, and hamper the 
economy’s chances of recovery.”

Bank shares rally on Italian bailout hopes

European banking shares are rallying this morning, as traders look for silver 
linings in the Italian political upheaval.

Almost every bank in the index of major European banks, the Stoxx 600, has 
gained ground.

The prospect of Monte dei Paschi (-2.6%) receiving a dose of state aid this 
weekend 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/06/italy-monte-dei-paschi-rescue-markets-relaxed-business-live?page=with:block-5846798ae4b056d3d56add9f#block-5846798ae4b056d3d56add9f>
 is calming the markets, as this would remove the risk that it might simply 
collapse.
 The Stoxx 6000 this morning Photograph: Thomson Reuters 
Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, has taken his eye of his company’s 
plunging share price 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/06/italy-monte-dei-paschi-rescue-markets-relaxed-business-live?page=with:block-58468c30e4b049350cc966b0#block-58468c30e4b049350cc966b0>
 to explain all:

One of the biggest worries surrounding the referendum was the impact it could 
have upon the nation’s banking system, with the likes of Unicredit and Monte 
dei Paschi in the midst of a recapitalisation and bank rescue plan.

Plans to raise substantial funds at Monte dei Paschi have hit the buffers 
after the ‘No’ vote and while a likely government bailout may not be the ideal 
otucome for the bank, it will mitigate the risk of a collapse and contagion in 
the region, hence the widespread gains across the financial sector today.

A surge in the banking sector has helped lift European markets, as investors 
once again shrugged off the Italian referendum result and the resignation of 
prime ministerMatteo Renzi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-renzi>. 
Hopes that the country’s parliament might pass a budget on Wednesday provided 
some support, as did the continuing optimism that investors might rescue 
struggling Monte dei Paschi. If that does not happen, there was growing talk 
that a state bailout could take place this weekend.

The idea that the bank would be recapitalised one way or another pushed the 
Italian banking index 9% higher, its best one day performance since 8 July. 
Monte dei Paschi itself added 1%, while Unicredit climbed 13%.

Elsewhere Deutsche Bank jumped 8% while in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland rose 
nearly 6% and Barclays 4.5%.

The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 33.01 points or 0.49% at 6779.84 
 * Germany’s Dax rose 0.85% to 10,775.32 
 * France’s Cac climbed 1.26% to 4631.94 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB jumped 4.15% to 17,757.80 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended 2.64% higher at 8893.3 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.36% to 622.52 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 19 points or 
0.1%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Back with Boeing, and Donald Trump’s tweet  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/06/italy-monte-dei-paschi-rescue-markets-relaxed-business-live?page=with:block-5846c659e4b056d3d56adf49#block-5846c659e4b056d3d56adf49>
saying the company was charging too much to build the new Air Force One - $4bn 
- and should lose the contract.

Boeing has now responded with a statement 
<http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2016-12-06-Boeing-Statement-on-Air-Force-One>, 
saying:

We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities 
of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the 
President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air 
Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best 
planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.
 
Ratings agency Fitch has moved its outlook on Italian banks from stable to 
negative for 2017, in the wake of the referendum vote and worries about their 
ability to recapitalise. Fitch said:

The Negative Outlook for the Italian banking sector reflects its increased 
vulnerability to shocks following the asset-quality deterioration in legacy 
portfolios... A step-up in pressure from authorities and market participants on 
the sector to reduce the very high levels of impaired loans has increased 
urgency and risks for Italian banks.

Profitability in the sector is frail. Disposals of non-performing loan 
portfolios could lead to losses that require additional capital. These are some 
of the factors driving the 2017 Outlook to Negative from Stable. Problems for a 
small number of distressed banks raising capital have added to these pressures

The “No” vote at the constitutional referendum has further heightened 
political uncertainty and possibly reduced the capacity to implement economic 
reforms. The risks from political instability were one factor that contributed 
to our revision of the Outlook on Italy’s ‘BBB+’ sovereign rating to Negative 
in October.

The referendum result could also damage the recapitalisation plans of some 
Italian banks, most notably Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and UniCredit, and 
have negative implications for the broader banking sector, whose attractiveness 
with investors has already reduced significantly during 2016. The sector’s 
ability to access the institutional markets for funding and capital, which has 
become more difficult and expensive this year, could deteriorate further...

Significant disposals that materially improve asset quality could be positive 
for ratings. However, the disposals are likely to result in further 
provisioning and possibly more capital shortfalls for the banks involved. 
Portfolio sales could also result in risk-weighted assets rising for the 
remaining loans if the sales affect loss-given-default estimates at banks using 
internal rating models.

Capitalisation will remain under pressure in 2017 with a weak earnings outlook 
limiting banks’ ability to build capital. Low interest rates, tepid economic 
growth and fierce competition for healthy borrowers are challenges for 
earnings. Profitability could also be dented by restructuring costs as banks 
focus on cost-cutting.

We also believe regulators could require higher capital buffers from Italian 
banks to compensate for the risk in their large non-performing loan portfolios 
and for the large portion of Italian sovereign debt held. This could result in 
additional capital requirements at some banks.
 
The Italian referendum proved a non-event for markets, including emerging 
markets, because it had effectively been priced in, and at the same time 
suggested the European Central Bank might well extend its quantitative easing 
programme this week. So says David Rees of Capital Economics. But he adds:

Nonetheless, the political situation in Italy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, and indeed the rise of populism in 
Europe more generally, is something to keep an eye on in the months ahead. 
Italy’s economy and banking sector are weak, and if the Five Star Movement’s 
momentum continues to build, it may not be long before an exit from the euro 
becomes a more realistic concern for investors....Similar fears have rocked 
emerging market equities in the past, when the Greek debt crisis first came to 
the fore and Spanish and Italian bonds came under fire in 2012.



 
Italy’s banking sector continues to recover, helped by talk that the country’s 
parliament might approve its budget on Wednesday, and there could be a state 
bailout of troubled Monte dei Paschi this weekend.

The country’s banking index is currently up more than 7%, its best daily 
performance since the middle of July.

The overall European banking index is up 3%, hitting its highest level since 
the middle of January.
 
More fallout from Donald Trump’s election - this time affecting UK mortgage 
rates. Rupert Jones reports:

The first evidence has emerged that the era of record-low fixed-rate mortgages 
may be coming to an end after HSBC withdrew its “cheapest-ever” deal and 
increased rates on other products.

HSBC had been offering a mortgage that allowed customers to lock in for two 
years at a rate of 0.99%, but this deal has been pulled with immediate effect. 
The bank’s new mortgage offers are coming in at up to 0.5% higher.

The move follows warnings from mortgage brokers that a number of factors, 
including Donald Trump’s US election win,were set to push up the cost of new 
fixed-rate home loans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/19/mortgage-rates-fixed-deals-brexit-trump>
.

David Hollingworth at broker London & Country Mortgages 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages> said: “The bottom of the market 
may have been hit. This [announcement] and the broader changes from HSBC, which 
has been very aggressively priced in the fixed-rate market, could spell the end 
of the sub-1% fixed rate, but also signals a potential turning point for fixed 
mortgage rates.”

Donald Trump may be casting doubt on Boeing’s Air Force One order, but 
elsewhere US manufacturers are doing well.

New orders for US factory goods rose 2.7% in October, the biggest increase for 
nearly a year and a half and just above expectations of a 2.6% improvement. The 
September figure was revised upwards from a gain of 0.3% to 0.6%. The latest 
figures mark the fourth straight month of increases.

But there could be clouds ahead, given the strength of the dollar following 
Trump’s election victory. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said:

US factory orders surged... in October, providing manufacturers with plenty of 
optimism in what has been a turbulent year.

Uncertainty surrounds the sector, though, amid renewed strength of the dollar 
and the incoming president’s trade policy, particularly his approach to China.

Donald Trump’s promised fiscal stimulus and the increasing likelihood of 
raising interest rates has fuelled a greenback rally, and that could starve off 
exports and hit US factories hard in the new year.
 
And here’s a video clip of Donald Trump outlining his unhappiness with Boeing.

Over in Greece this morning there has been much merriment over the euro 
group’s decision last night todefine the contours of a debt relief agreement 
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-eurogroup-idUSKBN13T0ZN> for 
the country long at the centre of Europe’s financial crisis.

 Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens

For the first time since economic crisis engulfed Greece just over seven years 
ago, a sitting government in Athens has felt fit to describe a decision taken 
in Brussels as a “national success.”

The positive spin and brave faces that have greeted the three bailouts rolled 
out for Greece, so far, have today been superseded by a genuine sense of relief 
at the announcement of short-term measures to lighten the country’s mountainous 
debt load.

Many in Syriza, the governing left-wing party, said the move by euro zone 
partners to shave €45bn euros off the pile – the equivalent of 22 percent of 
GDP – by extending the repayment period and adjusting interest rates - exceeded 
“every expectation.”

Addressing reporters today the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos 
described the decision both as a “significant achievement” and “decisive step 
for the stabilisation of the Greek economy and complete restoration of 
confidence.”

anniversary rally marking the 2008 police shooting of 15-year-old student,

But as Greece’s political opposition was quick to point out the victory was 
bittersweet.

 This might be the first time that the nation’s unmanageable debt burden has 
been addressed head-on – and as such can only be seen as rich reward for prime 
minister Alexis Tsipras - but it comes against a backdrop of calls for Athens 
to adopt yet more austerity once its current bailout programme expires in 
mid-2018.

Amid signs of a looming showdown with the International Monetary Fund, which 
says further belt-tightening is the only way to plug the looming fiscal gap and 
thus ensure its own participation in Greece’s third bailout to date, the 
spokesman called the demands “irrational.”

Athens, he insisted, would neither accept the German proposal for Greece to 
achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % through 2028 nor the IMF’s demands for extra 
measures in 2019 and 2020. Both are expected to dominate talks when auditors 
representing creditor institutions return to continue negotiating a second 
review of policy measures set as the price of bailout funds.

 “Greek society cannot endure more measures,” said Interior minister Panos 
Skourletis hinting at the battle that is brewing. “The Greek economy can’t 
endure them either.”

Over in Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, a political leader 
has suggested that fresh general elections could be held next February.

Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, whose centre-right party is part of Matteo 
Renzi’s coalition, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that:


“I forecast there will be the will to go to elections in February.”

Significantly, Alfano was speaking after having met with Renzi (whose 
resignation was put on hold by the country’s president last night).

Here’s Reuters’ take:

Italian bonds are still looking stable as traders head for lunch:

One fundamental problem with Italian banks is that there are too many of them, 
says Kathleen Brooks of City Index.

She argues that closing some branches would help make the sector competitive, 
and free up capital for other uses:

Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> has more bank branches than 
pizzerias, in the future it desperately needs more pizza and less banks!

She also explains why Monte dei Paschi’s future matters, especially if its 
cash call fail this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/06/italy-monte-dei-paschi-rescue-markets-relaxed-business-live?page=with:block-5846798ae4b056d3d56add9f#block-5846798ae4b056d3d56add9f>
.

It’s certainly not as systemically important as other banks, for example 
Italy’s Unicredit, but Monte dei Paschi’s main problem is that it has become 
symbolic of Italy’s rotten banking sector that now relies on foreign capital 
for life support.

If the Qatari’s decide against investing in it then it gives a terrible signal 
to the world about the ‘investability’ of Europe’s banks. Interestingly, in 
Europe it is not the systemically important banks that are the biggest risk to 
the financial sector, but the glut of mid-size banks that hold billions in bad 
debts that could endanger the health of the bigger banks in Europe, if 
contagion is to spread.

Business confidence in Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> is 
likely to be hurt by the political uncertainty created by Sunday’s referendum 
result, and the struggles in the banking sector.

Ana Boata, economist at trade insurance firm Euler Hermes, believes 0.3 
percentage points could be knocked off growth next year, taking the annual rate 
down from 0.9% to 0.6%.

She predicts that foreign investment will be hit, and Italian firms could 
suffer high financing costs if their banks remain weak:

While there is no need to panic, the resounding ‘No’ result and political 
turmoil that has followed could cause a mild confidence crisis in 2017. Even 
without any spill over to banks or the bond market, we expect -0.3pp of Italian 
GDP could be shaven off, leaving the economy with the prospect of a mere 0.6% 
growth next year.

“It will be Italian companies that bear the brunt of a confidence shock, 
albeit a mild one, which are already contending with some of the worst cash 
flow conditions in the world – businesses are waiting on average for 88 days 
for payment for goods and services. We are likely to see divestment from abroad 
and tougher financing conditions mean that inward investment levels will stay 
flat, compared to 2% growth we previously predicted for 2017, and hamper the 
economy’s chances of recovery.”

European banking shares are rallying this morning, as traders look for silver

 to explain all:

One of the biggest worries surrounding the referendum was the impact it could 
have upon the nation’s banking system, with the likes of Unicredit and Monte 
dei Paschi in the midst of a recapitalisation and bank rescue plan.

Plans to raise substantial funds at Monte dei Paschi have hit the buffers 
after the ‘No’ vote and while a likely government bailout may not be the ideal 
otucome for the bank, it will mitigate the risk of a collapse and contagion in 
the region, hence the widespread gains across the financial sector today.
