Bacary Sagna has been asked to explain himself by the Football Association 
following a social media post which may have questioned referee Lee Mason’s 
integrity.

The Manchester City full-back wrote “10 against 12.. but still fighting and 
winning as a team” on Instagramafter Monday’s hard-fought 2-1 victory over 
Burnley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/manchester-city-burnley-premier-league-match-report>
 at the Etihad Stadium. The post was later amended to read “still fighting and 
winning as a team”.

Sagna trying to cover his tracks. Claimed it was "10 against 12" (implying ref 
was against City) but he's amended post. FA may be interested

Press Association Sport understands the FA has asked Sagna for his 
observations and has until 5pm on Friday to respond. A decision on whether a 
charge follows will be made in due course.

City were annoyed by some of Mason’s decisions during the game. The first 
major talking point was the sending off of Fernandinho after 32 minutes while 
City also felt Burnley’s goal should have been disallowed for a foul on Claudio 
Bravo.

The FA <https://www.theguardian.com/football/fa> has rules in place concerning 
social media and participants are not permitted to question the integrity of 
officials.
