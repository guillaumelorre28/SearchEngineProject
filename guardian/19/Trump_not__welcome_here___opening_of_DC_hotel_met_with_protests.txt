Sitting at the Turkish onyx bar in a red Make America Great Again baseball 
cap, lawyer Ben Garmer looked around the spacious atrium of the newly opened 
Trump International Hotel in Washington on Monday and proclaimed it “gorgeous”.

Such hats are a rare sight in Washington, and even rarer in its most august 
hotels. But this is now effectively the Republican presidential candidate’s 
sovereign territory, the embassy of Trumpistan, planted just half a dozen 
blocks from the White House. Win or lose in November’s presidential election, 
his name is spelled out in gold letters on Pennsylvania Avenue, arguably the 
most famous street in the nation.

Inside the historic former post office, the taste is restrained by Trump 
standards. Yes, there are chandeliers, gold rails and gold-rimmed glass tables 
evocative of the blingy hotels that Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi used to build. 
There is The Spa by Ivanka Trump. But the gaudy flamboyance of Las Vegas or 
Palm Beach has been dialled down to cream and grey walls – as befits 
understated Washington.

The hotel opened its doors at 2pm on Monday after a two-year, $200m 
renovation. There was little fanfare: Trump and his family will attend a 
predictably grand opening ceremony next month. While the tycoon himself stayed 
away, there was a typical menu of divisiveness and surrealism.

By 4.30pm, some 38 protesters had lined up outside the hotel to form a human 
wall in response to Trump’s promise to build a wall on the Mexican border. They 
made speeches through a megaphone, chanted “No Trump, no KKK, no racist USA!” 
and hoisted placards and banners that said, “We’ll build a wall against racism 
& bigotry” and “Immigrants & Muslims are welcome here – Trump Hotel is NOT!”

In a district where Trump was badly beaten by Marco Rubio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/marco-rubio-trounces-donald-trump-in-washington-dc-presidential-primary>
 and John Kasich in the Republican primary, some passing motorists tooted their 
horns in support of the protesters. Nearby, Savas Mendoza, a Mexican-born US 
citizen, continued to work on the building’s exterior and said he was being 
paid $40 an hour.

A handful of Trump supporters had also turned up. Johnny Rice, 49, wearing a 
T-shirt emblazoned with the candidate’s face, blew a shofar (ram’s horn). A 
woman in a cowboy hat positioned herself in front of the protesters and held 
box lids scrawled with the words “I’m a deplorable” (referencing a recent 
Clinton gaffe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump>
) and “There’s a new sheriff in town and his name is Donald Trump.” Two burly 
security guards told her to leave.

Meanwhile, most bizarrely, a man in a full-length duck suit with bright orange 
hair prowled the scene. So did a man in tuxedo, bow tie and pig mask. Watching 
it all was a statue of founding father Benjamin Franklin, who now finds himself 
in permanent close proximity to the Trump brand.

As this hot and anguished street scene played out against a backdrop of sawing 
and sandpapering, the inside of the hotel provided an air-conditioned refuge 
for the 1%. Liveried staff, racially diverse, glided under industrial steel 
girders and the dramatically high glass roof with canapés and sparkling Trump 
wine. Of the hotel management, an affable Frenchman and urbane Irishman chatted 
to journalists. A steady trickle of guests arrived at check-in with luggage but 
were less willing to be interviewed about their first impressions.

The hotel is nine stories tall and has 263 rooms, including 35 suites. Rooms 
start at an average of $895 a night. For the presidential inauguration in 
January of either Trump or Hillary Clinton, the biggest suite will cost $12,000 
per night and must be booked for a minimum of five nights. Whether the 
presidential ballroom gets used that night probably depends on the outcome.

Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, helped negotiate a 60-year lease with the US 
government and oversaw the building’s revamp and design. It is housed in 
Washington’s third-tallest building, the 1899 Old Post Office, built in the 
Romanesque Revival architectural style. The interior still contains an old 
brass letter box and some framed handwritten correspondence from that era amid 
lilies, TV screens and shiny marble floors. The clock tower is 315ft (96m) high 
and will offer tourists panoramic views.

Garmer, the lawyer in the Make America Great Again hat, said: “Transforming 
this building from what it was to now is amazing. I was here a couple of years 
ago. There was a lousy food court downstairs.”

Of the protesters, he said: “I was a little nervous walking across the street 
wearing this hat. It’s just noise, that’s all.”

This is aspirational, one-day-you-can-be-rich-too Trump. In one corner stands 
a Brioni suit store. The room service menu includes a 12oz prime-aged New York 
strip steak for $59, large Maryland jumbo lump crab cakes for $49 and housemade 
warm cookies and milk for $14.

Managing director Mickael Damelincourt <https://twitter.com/mdamelincourt>, 
40, a Parisian who has worked at Trump hotels for a decade, was working the 
room and looked relatively calm. “I’ve been amazed by his business acumen to do 
things no one else can do,” he said. “A year ahead of schedule, they have 
transformed this building into one of the best hotels in the world.”

Hotels <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/hotels> should fit the city and 
preferably the area that surrounds them, Damelincourt added, and this was 
designed to match Washington. “There’s nothing we’ve done that hasn’t been 
approved, and I think the end product is phenomenal and honours what this 
building used to be in 1899.”

Rod Blair, a 69-year-old oil and gas executive from Calgary, Canada, had 
dropped in for a look. “It’s overwhelmingly positive,” he said. “The hotel is a 
magnificent old building. In the lobby they’re doing a marvellous job of 
renovating it. It’s restful.”

But back outside in the afternoon humidity, restful was not the mood. Radhika 
Miller, 36, a lawyer and protest organiser for the Answer Coalition, said: “As 
if it wasn’t despicable enough that Trump built a high-rise commercial tower, 
he’s now taken over a historic federal building. Trump actually gets a chunk of 
Pennsylvania Avenue.”

The avenue has hosted countless processions, funeral corteges and protest 
marches, including those by women demanding the right to vote. Miller added: 
“This is a historic route, and for Trump to take it over through wheeling and 
dealing behind closed doors is disgusting. We don’t want his name emblazoned on 
Pennsylvania Avenue.
