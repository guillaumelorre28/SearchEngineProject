A senior executive in Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> could face jail for 
skipping jury duty to attend meetings linked to his company’s initial public 
offering.

The Victorian supreme court on Wednesday granted the juries commissioner’s bid 
to penalise Powerwrap chief financial officer, Sean Slattery, for not attending 
jury service in 2016.

Justice John Forrest warned Slattery he could face up to three months 
imprisonment or more than $4,000 in fines.

“There is a real prospect that I am considering imprisonment,” Justice Forrest 
said.

Slattery does not dispute he did not turn up for jury duty in October, but 
told the court there were circumstances that prevented him from attending.

“I’m a chief financial officer of a company that is about to conduct an 
initial public offer,” he said.

Slattery was scheduled to meet with potential investors on 12 October, the 
same day he was due to attend court.

“I was required to attend these meetings,” he said.

Justice Forrest says many people have work commitments.

“Why would that differ from a plumber who makes arrangements?” he told 
Slattery.

“There are many members of the community who put aside work commitments to 
attend.”

The judge said court “cannot operate on the whims of commercial interests”.

“A fundamental requirement of a democratic society is that members of the 
public participate in jury service,” Justice Forrest said.

The judge advised Slattery, who represented himself in court on Wednesday, to 
seek legal advice before the court hears submissions about penalties. The case 
returns to court on Monday.
