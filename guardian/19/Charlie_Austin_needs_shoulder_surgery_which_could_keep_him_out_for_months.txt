Claude Puel says that Charlie Austin needs shoulder surgery and will be out 
for between three and four months. TheSouthampton

during last Thursday’s Europa League tie at home to Hapoel Be’er Sheva.

The confirmation that Austin faces a lengthy lay-off is a bitter blow. The 
shoulder is the same one that he dislocated three times in 14 months at 
Burnley. It has been operated on twice previously.

Puel said it was now essential his other forwards stepped up. “It’s difficult 
to play without Charlie because he scores a lot of goals for us but it’s 
important to look forward with other players – for example, Jay Rodriguez. He 
played very well againstMiddlesbrough 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough>, with intensity and 
quality. He deserved a goal.

“We can also see Shane Long and Nathan Redmond, who played a very good 
second-half. It’s important that the other players take the place of Charlie. 
It’s a strong disappointment, of course, for Charlie.”
