Exploring the Baja peninsula, Mexico

With water temperatures of 27C, the Sea of Cortez is so warm that, as SwimTrek 
puts it, “you’ll feel like you’re swimming in the bath”. Expect to feel 
comfortable out of the water too, spending a week sleeping in glamping-style 
bell tents with solar-heated showers, and enjoying fresh local food and 
cocktails rustled up by your team chef. Each day the swim covers 6km, passing 
the cliff faces and beaches of this Unesco-protected area, with plenty of 
opportunity to borrow sea kayaks, paddleboards or snorkels and immerse yourself 
in the diverse marine life.

The Big Blue Swim spent two years planning this series of swims that involves 
a six-day sea safari along the wild coastline of south Crete: a landscape that 
forms the backdrop to well-known myths and history. Starting in the village of 
Sfakia the journey is eastwards along rugged coastline, exploring caves and 
remote beaches and passing ancient ruins and churches – loading up on energy 
with delicious meals at local tavernas. There’s also the option of receiving 
filmed swimming analysis and coaching sessions, as well as the chance to hone 
your breathing technique with the help of a yoga specialist.

is that it’s about putting in the hard lengths. Actually, this trip is aimed at 
those training for eventsand those new to open-water swimming who want try it 
in the warmer ripples of the Mediterranean. The seven-night break is based on 
the Saronic island of Poros, 50km south-west of Athens, and includes seven 
swims under the guidance of a professional trainer, as well as two video 
analysis sessions focusing on technique. Daily breakfasts are provided, as well

The motto of this weekend break – based at the Locanda Riviere hotel on the 
shores of Lago d’Orta in northern Italy – is “good food, beautiful surroundings 
and glorious, relaxed swimming”. It sounds a perfect mix. The swimming aspect 
comes with one-to-one coaching, video analysis, plus guides (and a safety boat) 
on hand. Swimming distances are increased over the duration of the trip, from 
800m up to 2km and the weekend finishes with a swim around the island of Orta 
San Giulio: the Basilica di San Giulio and the mid-19th century seminary on the 
island were transformed into a Benedictine monastery in 1976.

swimming break 
The Musandam peninsula in the Persian Gulf is a glorious wilderness, with 
dramatic red rock formations and dark blue waters, and has earned the nickname 
“the Norway of Arabia”. This adventurous tour explores that wilderness, with 
its many sea inlets, where you’re more likely to run into a dolphin than a 
fellow tourist. And how many swim tours come with your own dhow to have lunch 
on?

The coastline of Montenegro is stunning and this tour takes in the 
Unesco-protected Gulf of Kotor, the clear waters of the Blue Grotto cave and 
Mamula island, known as the Montenegrin Alcatraz. There are also visits to 
picturesque towns found among the mountains on this week-long trip, which 
offers 4km of swimming a day and accommodation in a four-star hotel. 
Non-swimmers can join in a kayak, and beginners can combine shorter swims with 
walking and sightseeing. With this in mind, it’s a great compromise if you or 
your partner is less keen to commit to a holiday that’s completely swim-focused.

yourself to put in proper distances, like some of the swimmers who use it to 
prepare for triathlons or swimming the Channel.Fritton Lake Outdoor Centre 
<http://www.frittonlakeoc.co.uk/> is in the grounds of Fritton Lake country 
park, itself part of the 5,000-acre Somerleyton Hall estate, and hosts weekly 
swim sessions – year-round, for those who want a winter swim. Pay-as-you-go 
swim sessions cost £6 once you’ve paid a £10 registration fee (which includes 
one free swim), but pre-pay for multiple sessions and the price drops. Effort 
expended, it may be a tempting book intothe Fritton Arms 
<http://www.frittonarms.co.uk/> at the lakeside (doubles from £130 B&B). The 
hotel has nine bedrooms, is surrounded by parkland, and holds out the promise 
of an Italian wood-fired oven, which the kitchen says can roast anything from 
fresh pizza to Porterhouse steaks.

Swimquest has a range of indulgent swimming holidays, including six days 
swimming around islets in Thailand and a swim tour around the coral reefs of 
the Maldives with a 32-metre yacht as a base. A bit more accessible, with 
perhaps a chance to meet more like-minded people, is its trip to Lake Annecy in 
France, where on this four-day trip you’ll take on the 14.6km swim across the 
huge glacial lake, either as a solo swimmer or in a relay, depending on your 
ability. And there’s time to relax in the tranquil Alpine surroundings either 
side of the marathon swim.
