Until half a century ago, Mexico City was known as the Paris of the New World. 
Ample boulevards were lined with palm trees and French-style mansions. Crisp 
blue skies provided spectacular views of the surrounding snow-capped mountains. 
The arts flourished. Then the urban decay that would plague many cities around 
the globe began to take its toll. The second half of the 20th century saw a 
huge increase in population and the metropolis struggled to cope. In 1985, a 
devastating earthquake took an enormous toll.

But the tide has turned. A progressive municipal government has made great 
advances in cleaning up the city. Swaths of the historic centre, once 
considered unsafe, have been repaved and pedestrianised, and shoppers and 
evening revellers now abound in the revitalised area.

Architecturally important neighbourhoods 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/may/03/mexico-city-colonia-juarez-regeneration-bars-restaurants>
, such as eclectic Colonia Roma and Condesa, known for its art deco 
architecture, have been restored. Creative entrepreneurs have flocked to this 
energetic metropolis, opening shops, galleries, hotels and restaurants. Over 
the past few years, the city has become an internationally recognised culinary 
destination. From street food to fine dining venues, featuring traditional and 
“Modern Mexican” cooking, the city is like a big open kitchen.

Tour the Dolores Olmedo Museum, Xochimilco

Dolores Olmedo was a muse, collector and intimate of Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo

beautiful estate into a museum to house her fine pre-Hispanic sculptures, 
paintings and drawings by Rivera, and the world’s largest collection of Kahlo 
paintings. Peacocks and hairless dogs roam the extensive gardens. This is one 
of the world’s great museums and shouldn’t be missed.

Lucha libre is a curious form of Mexican wrestling in which men, and 
occasionally women, dress in flashy Vegas-style costumes and horror movie masks 
and proceed to stomp, throw, bend, crush, squeeze and mangle one another around 
a ring, while the crowd roars its approval. A match at one of the two old 
arenas is a headlong leap into popular Mexican culture. Tickets (from £5) are 
available at the door but can sell out; buy in advance through

Tacos al carbón are meats cooked over coals on an open grill. Los Parados 
(which implies standing-room-only, ie no tables), has been grilling beef and 
pork at the same corner for over 40 years. Locals line up for the smokycostilla 
(rib),chuleta (pork chop) and chorizo. The winner, however, is the rib-eye; bit 
pricier, but pesos well spent for tender succulence. Another not-to be-missed 
offering is thequeso fundido, a mini ceramic cazuela filled with Oaxaca cheese 
and melted over the grill. And the brightly coloured hand-mashed salsas are 
superior.

This spacious 19th-century salon with a graceful, old-world atmosphere bills 
itself as an Argentinian/Mexicanparrilla (grill), and the grilled meat such as 
arrachera (skirt steak) is excellent, but it also does many Mexican dishes, 
such as enchiladas and tortilla soup, and typical Mexican breakfasts withhuevos 
rancheros (fried eggs with spicy tomato sauce), sweet rolls and frothy, milky 
coffee. Don Toribio is the best budget restaurant in the historic centre: lunch 
costs under £4.

Two brilliant young chefs, Israel Montero and Alfredo Chávez, have combined 
their talents at this underrated venue in the upmarket Polanco district. The 
ambience is relaxed and food is decidedly Mexican with a modern twist. The 
weekly changing menu is chosen according to what is in the market. Montero 
says: “Ours is a free, spontaneous and creative cuisine – we are an 
experimental, investigative laboratory whose project is to bring to light a 
great range of little-known edible products, inspired by our own experiences in 
the kitchen.” Atostada – crispy-fried, house-made corn tortilla – comes topped 
with smoked trout from nearby mountain streams, fresh fava beans, wild greens 
and edible flowers. This might be followed by a rich, spicy, toasted chipotle
mole, containing pork belly and fennel. The 10-course tasting menu, including 
dessert, is £34.

A fonda is like a bistro or trattoria – homey, intimate, a family affair. The 
fashionable Fonda Fina is those things but isfina” (refined), as well. That’s 
because the compact kitchen is in the capable hands of chef Juan Cabrera, who 
reproduces his favourite classic Mexican dishes with a personal touch and 
reinvents other less-known ones.Peneques are small quesadillas, filled with 
tangy, freshrequesón cheese (Mexican ricotta), dipped in light batter and 
fried. They’re served with apipian (pumpkin seed) sauce. The combination of 
earthy flavours – corn, pumpkin seed and chilli – hits all the marks. Thin 
slices of meltingly tenderlengua (tongue) are served with a complex wild 
mushroom sauté and a fruity, darkadobo sauce. Divine. Lunch from about £20 a

Nexo is an unassuming locale whose kitchen crew bursts with youthful audacity. 
Two chefs share the helm: Diego Niño and César Vázquez. The dishes they turn 
out, based on Spanish, French and Mexican traditions, are creative but 
accessible. The Spanish classicarroz negro pays homage to both old country and 
new: instead of the standard squid ink and fish stock, it’s made with crab 
bisque andchilmole (the blackened chilli sauce of the Yucatán) and crowned with 
calamari stuffed with pork scratchings. It’s ingenious and delicious. 
Three-course menu £21, five-course £28.

La Casa de los Tacos is a deceptively ordinary-looking place. This 
neighbourhood lunch spot was taken over by two creative types with a vision: 
Hector Ramos, a photographer who runs an art gallery upstairs; and Alejandro 
Escalante, author of the renowned Tacopedia cookery book and editor of online 
gastronomic journalanimalgourmet.com <http://www.animalgourmet.com/>. A menu 
entitledtacos prehispánicos offers a far-reaching conflagration of edible 
insects, such as sautéed grasshoppers,gusanos de maguey (grubs found in agave 
plants), and crispy fried black beetles calledcocopaches. There are artfully 
made “normal” beef, fish and pork tacos as well, for the less adventurous.

Limantour, a proud member of the World’s 50 Best Bars 
<http://www.worlds50bestbars.com/> list since 2014, is a temple to modern 
cocktails. The concept is simple: designer drinks made with dynamic ingredients 
including fresh herbs, flowers, fruits, syrups, shrubs, spices and rare foreign 
spirits. The results are stunning in presentation and precise in flavour 
combination. Two locations, in Roma and Polanco, have a laid-back vibe and 
modernist decor. Themargarita al pastor plays with ingredients found in the 
classical pastor (shepherd-style) tacos. The result is a tequila-based drink 
with pineapple, coriander and a touch of serrano chilli.
• Álvaro Obregón 106, Roma; Oscar Wilde 9, Polanco, see limantour.tv 
<http://limantour.tv/> for opening times

Cantina El Tio Pepe, Centro

Like a traditional English pub, a cantina is a place for locals to hang out. 
This friendly one opened in 1870, conserves its original art nouveau bar and 
has been the scene of many political discussions over the years. It is a good 
alternative to the more touristy and expensive Bar Opera a few blocks away. 
Beer and tequila are the drinks of choice here.
• Independencia 26, daily noon-11pm

Café La Habana, Centro 

This spacious, lively cafe pays homage to Cuba – black and white photos of 
Havana line the walls – though the rest is Mexican. It is a few blocks south of 
the Alameda park and is known as a hangout for journalists at the city’s large 
daily newspapers. The Mexican food is nothing to write home about but the 
coffee, served with frothy hot milk, is.
• Morelos 62, open daily 7am-11pm (10pm Sun)

WHERE TO SHOP

Vértigo Galería, Colonia Roma

Vértigo is an art gallery specialising in graphics by many of the top young 
contemporary artists and artisans in Mexico. Spaces are dedicated to exhibits 
of such genres as design, illustration, surrealism and pop; prices are 
affordable: an original signed print for around £85.

This renowned designer is very much in touch with her Mexican roots. Her men’s 
and women’s clothing, textiles and household objects are striking, avant-garde 
and forward-looking yet lovingly based on indigenous craft. There are two 
locations, in Roma and Centro. Dresses start at £130.

Everything from cheap clothing to food is sold at this huge, popular market 
area. On Sundays, the few blocks on the east side of Paseo de la Reforma and 
down Calle Jaime Nuno become the premier antique and flea market – Grandma’s 
attic is emptied and bargains can be had with a bit of haggling.
• North of Metro stop Garibaldi, Sundays 9am-5pm
