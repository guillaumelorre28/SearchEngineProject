<http://www.cnn.com/video/shows/anthony-bourdain-parts-unknown/> TV series has 
fuelled interest in the area, which claims to have the highest concentration of

What's new?


Train
A brilliant new service from rail-booking website Loco2.com is making it 
easier to travel by train to thousands of European destinations. Instead of 
booking separate tickets with each country's rail operator, you can enter your 
local station and your destination and the site will work out which trains you 
need and book them, all in one transaction. There are no booking fees, so it is 
no more expensive than doing all the hard work yourself.
• Launches 12 Nov. To preview the service, sign up now at loco2.com
