Joe's Stone Crab

Joe's, an old-time Miami Beach institution since 1913, is famous for stone 
crabs, a local delicacy that can often cost more than $50 a plate. So what is 
it doing on a budget dining list? Scan the menu closely, and you'll find 
something that may not have changed since 1913: fried chicken, a half of a 
bird, for only $5.95. It's not only one of the best bargains in town; it's some 
of the best fried chicken in town, too. And if you want to sample stone crabs 
without breaking the bank, here's another insider secret: the smaller-sized 
claws may be a bit more work than the jumbos, but they're much less expensive – 
and they taste better.

El Mago de las Fritas
 Ortelio Cardenas at El Mago de las Fritas 
The sandwich cubano <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_sandwich> may be the 
first thing visitors think of to eat in Miami, but it is just one of Cuba's 
many contributions to Miami's sandwich universe. Another is thefrita, a 
hamburger assertively spiced with Spanish paprika, sometimes with the addition 
of chorizo in the blend, topped with chopped onions and crispy shoestring 
potato fries. Possibly the best example can be found at El Mago de las Fritas, 
where El Mago (the Magician), Ortelio Cardenas, pictured, has been serving them 
since 1984. The base model will set you back just $3.50. Make it afrita caballo
, with an egg on top, for just another dollar; or do as President Obama did 
when he visited, and get it with cheese for an extra 25 cents (now dubbed the
frita presidencial con queso).
• 5828 SW 8th St, West Miami, +1 305 266 8486, elmagodelasfritas.com

Open Mon-Sat from 8am-8pm

La Camaronera
 Sandwich's galore at La Camaronera 
For another variation on the Cuban sandwich theme, pay a visit to La 
Camaronera. The Garcia family opened a fish market in Miami in the 1960s; about 
10 years later they added fryers to cook and serve some of their catch on site. 
You could only eat standing at a counter, but a few months ago they finally 
installed chairs and tables. A cup of thesopa de cherna (grouper soup) is 
fresh, hearty and flavourful. The fish in thepan con minuta (snapper sandwich) 
goes nearly straight from the boat to the bun, with its tail still intact. Or 
for an extra dollar, splurge on thecamaronera sandwich with crispy breaded 
shrimp.
• + 1952 West Flagler St, 1 305 642 3322, garciabrothersseafood.com

El Rey del Chivito
 Latin-American influences about at El Rey del Chivito 
Miami's Latin-American influences are not limited to Cuba: from Uruguay comes 
El Rey del Chivito, where the speciality is thechivito (little goat) sandwich. 
Actually, there's no goat in this mammoth sandwich, but there is just about 
everything else you could imagine: grilled steak, bacon, ham, cheese, a fried 
egg, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, all piled onto a lightly toasted bun. 
It's like breakfast, lunch and dinner all at once, plus a side of fries, all 
for under $10. For even heartier appetites, theparrillada, or mixed grill, "for 
two" – with three different cuts of grilled steak, short ribs, chorizo and 
blood sausages, sweetbreads, and chicken – can probably easily feed twice as 
many people ($31.90).
• 6987 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, +1 305 864 5566, elreydelchivito.com 
<http://elreydelchivito.com/>. Dishes $3-$20. Open Mon-Tue midday-11.30pm,

B&M Market
 t 
It's not in the greatest of neighbourhoods. And it's more of a take-out place 
than an actual restaurant, – unless you want to perch on a rickety stool and 
eat from a Styrofoam box precariously balanced on a shallow ledge along the 
wall. But if you want a real taste of the Caribbean in Miami, you can find it 
at B&M Market. Walk past the various canned goods and sundries and you'll 
stumble into the small open kitchen, where you can get plates of jerk chicken, 
tender braised oxtails, or aromatic curried goat, usually served with steamed 
cabbage and a helping of beans and rice.
• 219 NE 79th St, +1 305 757 2889, no website. Dishes $5-$10. Open daily 
9.30am-8pm

Dairy Belle, Dania Beach
 Poutine, a Dairy Belle speciality 
Journey just a bit out of Miami and you'll enter a different world, where the 
influences come from the north rather than the south. Snowbirds from Montreal 
make Dania beach their second home, and while they may not miss the cold 
weather, they do miss their food. Dairy Belle, a roadside shack with a covered 
awning over picnic tables, helps fill the void. Here, you'll find an authentic 
rendition ofpoutine, a Quebec speciality that features French fries topped with 
cheese curds and rich gravy ($5.95 for a small serving). It also makes a fine 
club sandwich that is perfect in its simplicity, plus delicious old-fashioned 
ice-cream and milkshakes.
• 118 North Federal Highway, Dania Beach, +1 954 920 3330, 
dairybelleicecream.com <http://dairybelleicecream.com/>. Dishes from $2.50-$15. 
Open Tue-Sun 11am-10pm

Bulla
 Tapas-focus at gastrobar Bulla Ritzy 
Ritzy Coral Gables is not usually the best neighbourhood to go deal-hunting, 
and the recently remodelled Bulla (pronounced BOO-ya) wouldn't seem a likely 
place to find a bargain. But this Spanish gastrobar, with a tapas-focused menu, 
is surprisingly reasonably priced. The small plates, such ascroquetas with 
Iberico ham, codfishbuñuelos, pintxos morunos (juicy grilled pork skewers 
drizzled with salsa verde and Greek yogurt), and its signature huevos Bulla (a 
fried egg served over crispy potato chips with Serrano ham and potato foam) are 
mostly under $10 an order. If small plates aren't enough to fill you up, split 
thearroz a banda with a friend; it's creamy bomba rice cooked with an 
assortment of fish and seafood ($36 for two).
• 2500 Ponce De Leon Boulevard, +1 305 441 0107, bullamiami.com 
<http://bullamiami.com/>. Tapas $4-$15. Open Sun-Thu midday-11pm, Fri-Sat 
midday-midnight

Sakaya Kitchen
 Spoilt for choice at Sakaya Kitchen 
Miami has not been immune to the "new Asian fusion" trend, and one of the 
city's best exponents is Sakaya Kitchen. The combination of bold flavours, 
local, organic ingredients and in-house preparations is a winning formula, 
while fast-food style counter service and minimalist decor help keep prices 
low. Don't miss thebanh mi buns with kurobuta pork belly, pâté, house-made mayo 
and pickles; the chunk'd cheesy tater tots topped with chopped kalbi beef and 
spicygochujang sauce; or the honey and orange glazed baby back ribs, served 
with gingered Brussels sprouts and jasmine rice.
• 3401 N Miami Ave (also at 125 SE 3rd Ave), + 1 305 576 8096,

midday-10pm, Thu-Sat midday-11pm

Su Shin Izakaya
 Drink and dine at Su Shin Izakaya 
Izakayas – Japanese bars serving small plates that tend to go well with 
drinking – seem to be the latest trend. But Su Shin Izakaya, which opened in 
1992, was way ahead of the curve. The lengthy menu ranges from sushi to ramen 
with lots of stops in between. One of the best is a dish called porque Mt Fuji? 
– incongruously listed among the sushi rolls, it's actually a rice bowl topped 
with grilled salmon, salmon roe, avocado,daikon sprouts, and shredded tamago 
(omelette) andnori (seaweed). Be sure to check the chalkboard on the wall 
opposite the sushi bar, where about a dozen daily specials are usually listed.
• 159 Aragon Avenue, +1 305 445 2584, izakayarestaurant.com 
<http://izakayarestaurant.com/>. Dishes $4-$15. Open Mon-Fri 11.30am-3pm 
(lunch), Mon-Sat 6pm-11pm (dinner)

The River Seafood & Oyster Bar
 Oyster overload at The River Seafood & Oyster Bar 
Sometimes it's not just a question of where you dine, but when. The River 
Oyster Bar has one of the broadest selections of bivalves you can find in 
Miami, as many as a dozen varieties from both east and west coasts. It also has 
some of the freshest oysters around, as steady business ensures high turnover. 
So when you can sample them during the River's daily afternoon happy hour, when 
all oysters are half price, you're getting a real bargain. Put together an 
assortment of different types for about $15-18 a dozen, choose from several 
wine and beer specials for about $5-7 a glass, and feast like the Walrus and 
the Carpenter.
