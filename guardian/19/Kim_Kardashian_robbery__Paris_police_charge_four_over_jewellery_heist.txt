French authorities have filed the first charges against four suspects in the 
armed jewellery robbery of Kim Kardashian West, with more charges expected to 
follow.

Robbers are believed to have forced their way into the private apartment where 
Kardashian West was staying during Paris Fashion Week in October 2016, tied up 
the reality TV star and stolen more than $10m worth of jewellery. Authorities 
said they suspected an inside job.

A 63-year-old suspect, named by Paris prosecutors only as Yunice A, was on 
Thursday handed preliminary charges of armed robbery in an organised gang, 
kidnapping and criminal association.

Complicity charges in the alleged robbery and kidnapping, as well as a 
preliminary criminal association charge, were filed against 44-year-old Florus 
H, the prosecutors’ office added.

A third suspect, 64-year-old Marceau B, faced preliminary charges of handling 
stolen goods and criminal association.

All three remained in detention.

Complicity charges and a preliminary criminal association charge were filed 
for 27-year-old Gary M, the prosecutors’ office said. He was released from 
custody to be kept under judicial supervision.

Gary Madar, 27, is the brother of Kardashian West’s Paris chauffeur, Michael 
Madar. Both worked for the same car service company but Michael Madar was freed 
earlier in the week.

Six other people remained in custody and could face preliminary charges on 
Friday.
Earlier, French authorities released three men and a woman who were among 17 
suspects detained on Monday.

The robbery generated more unwanted publicity for Paris, which has had its 
image damaged by terror attacks in 2015 and last year. Luxury hotel bookings and
foreign tourist arrivals
