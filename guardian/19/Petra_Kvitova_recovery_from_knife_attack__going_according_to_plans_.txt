Tejkal said the two-times Wimbledon champion has gradually started doing 
exercises with her injured fingers and “all have been going according to the 
plans and expectations”.

Kvitova had surgery

 on 20 December following injuries on her left hand in the attack at her home 
in the town of Prostejov the same day. She is expected to be out for up to six 
months.

Kvitova’s fellow players from the Prostejov tennis club have offered a reward 
of 100,000 Czech crowns (£3,150) for information leading to the arrest of the 
attacker, who still remains at large.
