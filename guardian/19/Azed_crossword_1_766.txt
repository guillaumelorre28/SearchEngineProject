Each clue, except 8 Down, is a passage from which the printer has removed a 
hidden answer, closing the gap and sometimes taking liberties with the 
punctuation, but not disturbing the orderof the remaining letters.
Example: Vaulting above tunnel entrance appears inane, scary.
Answer: PESTO. Undevilled version: Vaulting above tunnel entrance appears in 
an escape story. Every passage, when complete, makes sense.

Competitors should submit with their solutions a 'PD' clue to replace the 
simple definition at 8 Down.
NB Preference is given to PD clues in which breaksbefore and after the word 
omitted (before and after omission) do not occur at the ends or beginnings of 
words in the clue. Please give the full undevilled version of your clue as well 
as theclue itself.
