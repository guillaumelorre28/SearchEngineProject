Take a fresh look at Christmas lights
Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire

When darkness falls at the 19th-century Waddesdon Manor, the grand house and 
gardens provide the perfect canvas for some of Britain’s most exciting light 
art. The wizards at Woodroffe Bassett Design, the lighting designers who lit up 
the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, have created a light-and-sound show 
for the facade of the house. Best of all is light artist Bruce Munro’s piece 
Field of Light – an ethereal “meadow” of 9,000 fibre-optic glass spheres that 
bloom as you wander through them in the darkness.

Get a messiah complex
Nationwide

As much a Christmas tradition as overdosing on mince pies and TV, Handel’s 
Messiah is the only choral work many of us pay attention to all year. For an 
even closer experience, join in with the tradition of singalong, or “scratch”, 
Messiahs, where audience members (some more prepared than others) belt out the 
oratorio alongside people who know what they are doing. The big event, now in 
its fifth decade, is at the Royal Albert Hall. Even with space for 3,500 
voices, singing tickets have already sold out (there may be returns on the day; 
audience seats are still available). That said, there are a handful of more 
modest, but no less joyful or triumphant, events organised by choral societies 
around the country.

Unleash your inner poet
Writers’ Centre, Norwich

Feel inspired by Christmas and the beauty of winter and want to convey 
something a bit more complex than the words to Jingle Bells? Take a six-hour 
poetry workshop led by poet and academic George Szirtes in Norwich’s 
atmospheric medieval Dragon Hall. Participants will have a chance to hone their 
own work, but also to explore poetry related to Christmas and the festive 
season.

Celebrate Gonzo Dickens and Kermit Cratchit 
Camden People’s theatre, London, then touring

For some unusual souls, the ultimate Christmas film is It’s a Wonderful Life. 
For the rest of us, The Muppet Christmas Carol represents all that is good in 
the world at this time of year. Punky performance artists Louise Mothersole and 
Rebecca Biscuit (aka Sh!t Theatre(pictured right) lead a screening of the 
film with an alternative joyful Christmas singalong, offering a counterweight 
to traditional carol services. Don’t know the words to the Muppet songs? The 
film has witty subtitles, and there are interactive extras including a drinking 
game (it’s an adults-only evening). Their mini-tour hits London, Colchester, 
Norwich and Cambridge.

Step inside a lifesized advent calendar 
Edinburgh

If opening small doors only to discover a disappointing chunk of cheap 
chocolate doesn’t do it for you any more, try this innovative way to count down 
to Christmas. The Edinburgh Christmas festival, along with the Festival of 
Architecture and the Royal Incorporation of Architects Scotland, is running 
24 Doors of Advent. Each day, a door to an interesting building – or one 
normally closed to the public – is opened to visitors. Among the 24 buildings 
taking part are the Scottish parliament, a modernist chapel and Riddle’s Court, 
a 16th-century building that is currently being restored.

Banish blurry snaps of candlelit parties, learn what long exposure really 
means and capture the sparkle of Christmas with this night shoot. Professional 
photographer Tom Arber is running the workshop, which starts after dark, at 
The Hepworth Wakefield. Snappers go on a photography trail around the area, 
honing their low-light skills, before heading back to the gallery for a hot 
drink and a look at everyone’s pictures.
