Fort Point

At the foot of the Golden Gate bridge is Fort Point, built from 1853 to 1861 
to protect the Bay from naval attacks. It is constructed in the multi-tiered
Third System <http://www.nps.gov/goga/historyculture/american-third-system.htm> 
military style, with a design allowing cannons to hit enemy ships at water 
level; Fort Point is the only one of its kind in the west. Though never used in 
battle, the national historic site is an example of impressive masonry. Stop 
for coffee at The Warming Hut (built in 1909 as a US Engineer Storehouse), then 
make your way across that beautiful big red bridge – and don't forget a jacket!

Mission Dolores and The Mission District

Spanish missionaries settled Yerba Buena (later renamed San Francisco) on 29 
June 1776, five days before the Declaration of Independence was signed. Visit 
the spot where it all began: Mission Dolores, the city's oldest intact 
building, and one of only two cemeteries remaining in the city. The 
neighbourhood, originally populated by theOhlone 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohlone_people> people, is a vibrant Latino arts 
community – don't miss the Clarion Alley and Balmy Alley murals – and a foodie 
paradise. But no visit to San Francisco is complete until you've patronised a 
taquería (taco shop) and tasted your first Mission burrito.

The Old Ship Saloon

When California struck gold, some 300,000 fortune hunters stormed the state, 
many travelling by sea and abandoning their boats. The Old Ship Saloon is built 
on the remains of The Arkansas, which ran aground on Alcatraz in 1849. Two 
years after being towed in, an enterprising Englishman cut a hole in the hull 
and began serving spirits, and it's operated as a saloon, brothel, rooming 
house, or shanghai den ever since. The term "shanghaied" originates here: 
unlucky patrons downed drug-spiked liquor and woke up on a ship at sea. Today, 
this locals' hangout is fairly innocuous, but the Pisco Punch still packs a 
wallop.

Cable Car Museum

In 1869, during the American industrial age, Andrew Smith Hallidie witnessed a 
carriage accident that killed five horses. He decided something had to be done. 
Enter San Francisco's iconic transportation system. Before riding one of the 
three lines still in operation, visit the Cable Car Museum, where you can even 
watch the engines and winding wheels pulling the cables. Then hop aboard and 
regale fellow passengers with all you've learned about grips, tracks and 
brakes. A local's tip: instead of waiting in line, walk to the next stop and 
board en route, wherever you see the brown and white cable-car sign.
• Cable Car Museum, 1201 Mason Street, cablecarmuseum.org 
<http://www.cablecarmuseum.org/>. Open daily 1 Apr-30 Sept 10am-6pm and 1

Cliff House and Sutro Baths

A daytime excursion to Cliff House is a must. Go for the panoramic ocean 
views, martinis, oysters,Crab Louis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Louie> – 
and the stories. Built in 1863, the Cliff House was levelled by fire twice, in 
1894 and 1907 (just a year after surviving the great earthquake), and rebuilt 
and renovated again and again. While there, visit the Camera Obscura (fashioned 
after Leonardo da Vinci's 15th-century design), and explore the ruins of the 
colossal Sutro Baths, which once accommodated up to 10,000 swimmers.

The Fairmont Hotel

The 1906 earthquake 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake> was one of the 
worst natural disasters in American history, reducing much of San Francisco to 
rubble. But not the Fairmont, which "stood Parthenon-like at the top of the 
hill". Suffering only structural damage, the brand-new hotel opened one year 
later and has since hosted the first United Nations meeting, every president 
sinceWilliam Howard Taft 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/oct/15/us-presidents-listed>, 
and Tony Bennett, who crooned I Left My Heart in San Francisco there. Maybe you

Angel Island

More tourists visit Chinatown annually than the Golden Gate bridge, but you'll 
find the real story at Angel Island where, from 1910-1940, hundreds of 
thousands of Chinese immigrants were detained – sometimes for months or years. 
What is often referred to as the Ellis Island of the west was built after the 
1882 Chinese Exclusion Act was passed, a response to xenophobia and resentment 
toward Gold Rush-era immigrants. Now it's a museum preserving the history, 
including 100-plus Chinese poems found etched into the walls. The hilly island 
also offers spectacular views, beaches, cycling and hiking trails, Segway 
tours, campsites, a cafe and a weekend oyster bar.
• Angel Island, angelisland.com <http://www.angelisland.com/>. Open daily 
April-October, March Wed-Sun. Guided tours $7 adults, $5 kids. Self-guided 
tours also available. Round-trip ferry ticket from San Francisco $17 adult

City Lights Bookstore

Nothing symbolises the 50s beat generation like this historic landmark and 
local gem, founded in 1953 in North Beach. City Lights gained national 
recognition when ownerLawrence Ferlinghetti 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/01/featuresreviews.guardianreview10>
 was charged with obscenity for publishingAllen Ginsberg's Howl 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/23/allen-ginsberg-howl-poem-film> – 
and prevailed. When you're finished browsing the shop's three levels of books, 
bring your new acquisition across the street to Vesuvio and raise a glass to 
the ghosts of Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady, who frequented the legendary 
watering hole. And while you're in Little Italy, stop for an afternoon espresso 
at Café Trieste, where Frances Ford Coppola reportedly wrote the Godfather 
screenplay.

Haight Ashbury and Golden Gate park

If you missed the Summer of Love and your inner flower child wants out, head 
to the Upper Haight, where echoes of the bohemian counterculture that drew 
hundreds of thousands of hippies in the 1960s – shifting the nation's political 
climate forever – are inescapable. Nurse a pint at Magnolia Gastropub and 
Brewery, formerly Magnolia Thunderpussy (named for the burlesque performer who 
owned the restaurant in the 60s), which once offered an all-night delivery 
service and erotic desserts. Hit a head shop, buy some fringed velvet pants at 
a consignment shop, then cross the street into Golden Gate park, the site of 
the first "Human Be-In <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Be-In>".

The Castro Theater and neighbourhood

The Castro Theater is one of only a few American 1920s-era movie palaces still 
in operation. Plan your trip around a sing-along night (think Sound of Music, 
Little Mermaid, Grease) and arrive early to catch the live Wurlitzer organ 
performance. Then, visit the sidewalk plaque outside the former site ofHarvey 
Milk <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Milk>'s camera store and campaign 
centre, the hub of the gay community in the 70s. Finally, have a nightcap at 
Twin Peaks Tavern, a historic landmark believed to be the nation's first gay 
bar with full-length, plate-glass windows, which allowed patrons to see out and 
the public to see in.
