So there you have it. Three times Roger Federer found himself match point down 
in the fourth set; three times he found the right answers just when he most 
needed them. It’s been the story of his career, and it earns the Swiss his 11th 
appearance in the last four at Wimbledon. How much it’s taken out of him 
physically remains to be seen; plenty, his semi-final opponent Milos Raonic 
will be hoping. But that’s a question for Friday. For now, we should spare a 
thought for Marin Cilic, who played some brilliant tennis and, at two sets to 
the good, looked set fair for his first appearance in a Wimbledon semi-final. 
He couldn’t get over the line – Federer wouldn’t let him – and defeat at this 
stage for a third successive year will make the result especially hard to bear 
for the Croatian. That’s it from me for today, thanks for reading – and for all 
your emails – and enjoyAndy Murray against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga

Ecstatic, eh? I wonder how often Roger Federer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> has used that word to 
describe a victory. That will be remembered as one of the great Wimbledon

“It was an incredible match,” Federer continues. “The last three sets were 
really good and, as the match went on, I was improving … my legs were there, my 
back was there … this is going to give me a hell of a boost. I’m ecstatic I was 
able to come through.”

“It was great fun playing against Marin, he’s one of the nicest guys on the 
tour,” says Federer, who says he is excited by the prospect of facing Milos 
Raonic in the last four. Reflecting on the match, he says: “On the return he 
was reading my serve, I couldn’t read his … it was about staying in the match.”

Game, set and match Federer!

Fifth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 Cilic (*denotes server)

What a comeback! Having stared defeat in the face and decided he didn’t much 
fancy it,Roger Federer <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> is 
through to his 11th Wimbledon semi-final. A final, triumphant ace provides the 
cue for Federer to thrust his arms aloft in victory. But pity Marin Cilic; a 
semi-final place seemed his for the taking, but it was prised from his grasp.

Fifth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 5-3 Cilic* (*denotes server)

“You’re a genius, Roger!” cries a spectator as Federer conjures another 
wonderful backhand pass down the line at 0-30. Poor footwork from Cilic on the 
next point leads to a forehand error from the Croatian, and it’s 30-30. Federer 
then whips a superb forehand pass beyond Cilic to bring up break point and, 
although the Croatian hits back with a forehand winner of his own, at deuce the 
Swiss finds another sweeping, unanswerable forehand to bring up another. 
Incredible. The gauntlet thrown, Cilic stoops to accept – only to send a 
forehand fractionally wide. Federer to serve for the match.

Anything you can do, Marin. Federer sends down a 124mph ace to hold. 
Meanwhile, over on Court One, Milos Raonic has won in four against Sam Querrey 
and Tomas Berdych has just started his quarter-final against Lucas Pouille.

Fifth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 3-3 Cilic* (*denotes server)

Another breathtaking backhand pass – struck at at full tilt, yet guided down 
the line with an almost tender touch – carries Federer to 15-30 on the Cilic 
serve. The Croatian claws himself back to 30-30 only for Federer to land 
another mighty blow off the backhand wing, the scurrying Cilic unable to get 
the ball back in play. Break point. Cilic, though, as he has done so often this 
afternoon, finds his best serving when it matters. Much to Federer’s 
frustration, the ninth seed hits back to see out the game with a 123mph ace.

What better way to celebrate the passing of the three-hour mark than to fire 
down a 122mph ace? Roger clearly thinks there’s none, because that’s just what 
he does. “Fantastic match,” writes Dino Holmes. “That tie-break was SO tense. I 
wouldn’t be able to hold a racket. It is physical chess we’re watching … 
grandmaster stuff.” Couldn’t have put it better, Dino.

Understandably, after the drama of the previous set, the energy out on Centre 
Court has ebbed somewhat. That goes for the crowd as well as the players. You 
get the sense that everyone is steeling themselves for one final push. And, as 
Cilic holds to stay on terms, it won’t be long in the coming. Which way will it 
go?

Fifth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 2-1 Cilic (*denotes server)

Federer concludes a sturdy hold in summary fashion, snuffing out a brief 
exchange of backhands with the deftest of drop shots. Now there’s a man whose 
wits are still very much about him.

Cilic holds for 1-1. After the nail-biting tension of that dazzling fourth

taking in what they’ve just seen.

Fifth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 1-0 Cilic (*denotes server)

A break in the opening game of the fifth would have been very much what the 
doctor ordered for Cilic. He comes close, reaching deuce, but it’s Federer who 
takes the lead in the match, knifing a sliced backhand into the turf to draw a 
backhand error from Cilic.

Roger Federer wins the fourth set 7-6 to level the match!

Amazing, astonishing, remarkable. Cilic fires what looks an unstoppable 
backhand down to Federer’s forehand corner. Somehow, though, the Swiss 
scrambles the ball back into play, and finally Cilic breaks down, driving the 
ball into the alley. Set point Federer again at 10-9. And this time it proves 
decisive: on the next point, Cilic misses a forehand to leave us all square 
after two hours and 44 minutes of unrelenting drama!

The Swiss works his way forward again, but Cilic finds a wonderful backhand 
pass down the line. 8-8. Goran looks like he’s about to eat his fist. And he 
may just do that, because now Federer has set point on his own serve at 9-8!

No way! Federer works his way to the net with some wily play, and stabs away a 
backhand volley to reach set point …

Cilic slams down an unanswerable serve. It’s 7-6 in the Croatian’s favour. A 
third match point. But he nets a forehand return off another ridiculously fast 
Federer second serve. 7-7.

What do you do at 1-0 down in a tiebreak? Why, bang down an 111mph second 
serve, of course. That one leaves Goran slumped in his seat. But at 1-1 another 
Federer shank gives Cilic a mini-break. Federer hits back as his opponent goes 
long: 2-2. Big serves from both players: 3-3. They change ends. The tension is 
palpable. Federer sends down a violently sliced first serve, wide to the deuce 
court, for 4-3. Then, more drama: a backhand return is called long, but it’s 
close enough to challenge. Turns out it clipped the line! Good old Hawk-Eye. 
5-3 Federer. Defiantly, Cilic slaps a forehand winner. But a mistake on the 
next point gives Federer two set points at 6-4. He misses the first, on his own 
serve, with a mistimed forehand approach. Then Cilic slams down an ace. My 
goodness, this is tense …

Fourth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 6-6 Cilic (*denotes server)

It’s Cilic’s turn to enjoy some luck as a net cord gets him to 15-30 on the 
Federer serve. The Swiss hits back only to miscue a backhand on the next point. 
Match point again for Cilic. But Federer refuses to give in. His serve gets him 
back in the game, and a cool-as-you-like drop shot that he follows in to the 
net paves the way for the tiebreak when Cilic goes long. Utterly compelling 
theatre.

Fourth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 5-6 Cilic* (*denotes server)

The gods smile on Federer when he shanks an off backhand for a clean winner on 
the opening point. Cilic counters to reach 15-15, but Federer then fires a 
forehand winner for 15-30. Cilic responds in kind. There’s no quarter given or 
asked here. A dramatic baseline exchange at 30-30 is won by Cilic with a 
forehand so powerful that Roger almost ends up doing the splits to retrieve it. 
He makes it, but the reply barely clears the net and Cilic guides it away. 
Another rumbling off forehand from Cilic on game point draws the mistake from 
Federer, and the former champion’s resolve will be tested again.

Fourth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 5-5 Cilic (*denotes server)

Are second serves edible? I think they must be, because Cilic absolutely 
devours a 105mph second serve from Federer on the opening point, slamming the 
ball with frightening velocity. At 30-30, he does the same off a backhand, 
sending Federer sliding to his right. Match point to the Croatian. But he can’t 
find the court off another second serve from Federer, who quickly recovers to 
stay alive. The tension is almost unimaginable.

Fourth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 4-5 Cilic* (*denotes server)

A reminder that on Court One, Milos Raonic is in action against Sam Querrey. 
The Canadian is two sets to one up and you can follow that onehere

. Frankly, though, I wouldn’t go anywhere just yet. Because Cilic has just held 
and that means Federer will have to serve to stay in the match.

Fourth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 4-4 Cilic (*denotes server)

On the opening point, Federer sends his opponent flailing fruitlessly to his 
left with a penetrating serve down the middle. Still his wife, Mirka, looks 
pensive up in Federer’s box. Perhaps he senses it, because he races through the 
remainder of the game with the frantic air of a man who has a bus to catch. 
We’re level again.

“These guys are frighteningly good!” writes Dean Kinsellla. “Andy has still 
got a lot of great tennis to play to win this championship.” I should say, 
Dean. That last serve from Cilic, all 132mph of it, threatened the integrity of 
Roger Federer’s left hip. The quality from both men is simply breathtaking.

Can this match never end? Please don’t let it end. Correct me if I’m wrong, 
but I don’t recall seeing better tennis – with both players competing at or 
near the very top of their respective games – over the past fortnight, 
certainly not in the men’s draw at least. Federer underlines the quality on 
show with a second service ace on game point to draw level once more.

Fourth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 2-3 Cilic*(*denotes server)

Sometimes, the merest trick of the racket head, the most fleeting of contact 
between strings and ball, is enough. Hell, if you’reRoger Federer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> it’s often more than enough. 
And it certainly is on the second point here, the Swiss flicking an audacious 
backhand winner down the line. He repeats the trick with a booming backhand 
drive at 15-30, and from nowhere he has two break points. How does Cilic 
respond? Why, with four consecutive aces of course. Goran – who pretty much 
invented that trick – looks on approvingly. Extraordinary serving from the 
Croatian.

Fourth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 2-2 Cilic (*denotes server)

Frustration from Federer as he responds to steering a forehand wide at 15-15 
with a swish of his racket. He probably feels a lot worse when he mistimes a 
backhand on the next point to gift Cilic two break points. He saves the first 
with a cracking body serve that Cilic fails to negotiate on his forehand, and 
the second with a 106mph – 106mph! – second serve. A Cilic groundstroke error 
brings up game point, and Federer thumps down a 120mph ace – unsuccessfully 
challenged by Cilic – to stay on level terms. Brilliant recovery play from the 
seven-time champion.

Fourth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 1-2 Cilic* (*denotes server)

“I think I’m right in saying that if Federer goes out, this will be the first 
Grand Slam since the 2004 French Open in which not one of Federer, Nadal nor 
Djokovic made it to the last four,” writes Greg Phillips. You may well be 
right, Greg. If so, that’s food for thought. Is the old order finally changing? 
Cilic would like to think so as he holds again.

Fourth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 0-1 Cilic* (*denotes server)

The psychological balance of this match is poised on a knife edge. Cilic, who 
holds by pouncing on a weak return at 40-30 to strike an unanswerable forehand 
into the open court, knows he has the beating of Federer. He has the shots, he 
has the lead, and he has the knowledge that he has beaten the Swiss on the big 
stage before. But right now, Federer has the momentum and the crowd. You simply 
can’t take your eyes off the action.

Third set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 5-3 Cilic* (*denotes server)

Ladies and gentlemen, Roger Federer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> is in the building! As the 
Swiss looks to carry on from where he left off in the previous game, Goran 
Ivanisevic wears a worried look up in the players’ box. He has just cause, for 
his man is 0-30 down and the Centre Court crowd is really getting behind 
Federer. Cilic hits back with some thunderous serving, hitting the 136mph point 
at one stage. But Federer, buoyed by a suddenly electric atmosphere, works his 
way to a rare break point, and Cilic double-faults. Game on.

frightening velocity. Amid the onslaught, a shellshocked Federer falls 0-40 
behind. The Centre Court crowd gasps. There’s an awed silence around the old 
arena; people can barely believe what they’re seeing from Cilic. What they see 
next is rather more familiar, however: a brilliant Federer fightback, his full 
dazzling repertoire on display as he claws his way back to hold, roaring in 
triumph as he goes. Could this be the start of something?

Third set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 3-3 Cilic* (*denotes server)

He may be two sets down, but you still have to stand and admire Roger Federer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> at times. At 40-0 on the 
Cilic serve, the Croatian moves like the proverbial gazelle to run down a short 
ball. How he gets there I’ll never know, but he does. Momentarily taken aback, 
Federer responds by reaching behind him to flick a backhand half-volley for a 
winner. It might be his last hurrah, but still – what a shot.

Third set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 3-2 Cilic (*denotes server)

“Hi Les,” writes John McEnerney. “This wasn’t in the script: no Novak in the 
quarter-finals and Federer two sets down. We could say, “Let’s see what this 
Federer lad has,” but we know what he’s got. But this may be a tad too much, 
even for the GOAT.” I hear you, John. This may prove a challenge too far for 
the great man. Still, serving first in this set should help him, always 
assuming he can keep his nose in front – which he does here with something to 
spare.

Third set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 2-2 Cilic* (*denotes server)

Remember Federer’s “Sabr” – that’ll be “sneak attack by Roger”, for those who 
don’t speak acronym – routine at last year’s US Open? Well, he tries one here 
and it reaps dividends in the form of an outright winner. That lays the 
foundations for him to reach break point and, although Cilic denies him the 
breakthrough with some more mammoth serving, it perhaps offers a clue as to 
what he could do differently to make a greater impression off the return. Not 
that making an impression with 130mph bombs coming your way is easy, mind.

Federer moves ahead again, thanks largely to his 10th and 11th aces. But a 
sinew-straining rally that has both players at full stretch offers some idea of 
what the Swiss is up against, with Cilic demonstrating his extraordinary 
wingspan to lunge for a forehand and guide it home. There’s danger at every 
turn here for Federer.

Roger Federer into Wimbledon semis after seeing off Cilic from two sets down
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/06/roger-federer-marin-cilic-wimbledon-semi-final-raonic> 
So there you have it. Three times Roger Federer found himself match point down 
in the fourth set; three times he found the right answers just when he most 
needed them. It’s been the story of his career, and it earns the Swiss his 11th 
appearance in the last four at Wimbledon. How much it’s taken out of him 
physically remains to be seen; plenty, his semi-final opponent Milos Raonic 
will be hoping. But that’s a question for Friday. For now, we should spare a 
thought for Marin Cilic, who played some brilliant tennis and, at two sets to 
the good, looked set fair for his first appearance in a Wimbledon semi-final. 
He couldn’t get over the line – Federer wouldn’t let him – and defeat at this 
stage for a third successive year will make the result especially hard to bear 
for the Croatian. That’s it from me for today, thanks for reading – and for all 
your emails – and enjoyAndy Murray against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga

.
 
Ecstatic, eh? I wonder how often Roger Federer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> has used that word to 
describe a victory. That will be remembered as one of the great Wimbledon 
comebacks.
 
“It was an incredible match,” Federer continues. “The last three sets were 
really good and, as the match went on, I was improving … my legs were there, my 
back was there … this is going to give me a hell of a boost. I’m ecstatic I was 
able to come through.”
 
“It was great fun playing against Marin, he’s one of the nicest guys on the 
tour,” says Federer, who says he is excited by the prospect of facing Milos 
Raonic in the last four. Reflecting on the match, he says: “On the return he 
was reading my serve, I couldn’t read his … it was about staying in the match.”
 
“Without a doubt, we are watching one of the greatest – not just tennis 
players – but sportsmen of all time. Never, ever doubt The Fed,” writes Jon 
McEnerney. You’re not kidding, John.
 
Fifth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 Cilic (*denotes server)

What a comeback! Having stared defeat in the face and decided he didn’t much 
fancy it,Roger Federer <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> is 
through to his 11th Wimbledon semi-final. A final, triumphant ace provides the 
cue for Federer to thrust his arms aloft in victory. But pity Marin Cilic; a 
semi-final place seemed his for the taking, but it was prised from his grasp.

Fifth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 5-3 Cilic* (*denotes server)

“You’re a genius, Roger!” cries a spectator as Federer conjures another 
wonderful backhand pass down the line at 0-30. Poor footwork from Cilic on the 
next point leads to a forehand error from the Croatian, and it’s 30-30. Federer 
then whips a superb forehand pass beyond Cilic to bring up break point and, 
although the Croatian hits back with a forehand winner of his own, at deuce the 
Swiss finds another sweeping, unanswerable forehand to bring up another. 
Incredible. The gauntlet thrown, Cilic stoops to accept – only to send a 
forehand fractionally wide. Federer to serve for the match.
 
Fifth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 4-3 Cilic (*denotes server)

Anything you can do, Marin. Federer sends down a 124mph ace to hold. 
Meanwhile, over on Court One, Milos Raonic has won in four against Sam Querrey 
and Tomas Berdych has just started his quarter-final against Lucas Pouille.
 
Fifth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 3-3 Cilic* (*denotes server)

Another breathtaking backhand pass – struck at at full tilt, yet guided down 
the line with an almost tender touch – carries Federer to 15-30 on the Cilic 
serve. The Croatian claws himself back to 30-30 only for Federer to land 
another mighty blow off the backhand wing, the scurrying Cilic unable to get 
the ball back in play. Break point. Cilic, though, as he has done so often this 
afternoon, finds his best serving when it matters. Much to Federer’s 
frustration, the ninth seed hits back to see out the game with a 123mph ace.

What better way to celebrate the passing of the three-hour mark than to fire 
down a 122mph ace? Roger clearly thinks there’s none, because that’s just what 
he does. “Fantastic match,” writes Dino Holmes. “That tie-break was SO tense. I 
wouldn’t be able to hold a racket. It is physical chess we’re watching … 
grandmaster stuff.” Couldn’t have put it better, Dino.

Understandably, after the drama of the previous set, the energy out on Centre 
Court has ebbed somewhat. That goes for the crowd as well as the players. You 
get the sense that everyone is steeling themselves for one final push. And, as 
Cilic holds to stay on terms, it won’t be long in the coming. Which way will it 
go?

Federer concludes a sturdy hold in summary fashion, snuffing out a brief 
exchange of backhands with the deftest of drop shots. Now there’s a man whose 
wits are still very much about him.

Fifth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 1-1 Cilic* (*denotes server)

Cilic holds for 1-1. After the nail-biting tension of that dazzling fourth 
set, the tempo of the match has eased a little. It feels like everyone is still 
taking in what they’ve just seen.



 
Fifth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 1-0 Cilic (*denotes server)

A break in the opening game of the fifth would have been very much what the 
doctor ordered for Cilic. He comes close, reaching deuce, but it’s Federer who 
takes the lead in the match, knifing a sliced backhand into the turf to draw a 
backhand error from Cilic.
 
Amazing, astonishing, remarkable. Cilic fires what looks an unstoppable 
backhand down to Federer’s forehand corner. Somehow, though, the Swiss 
scrambles the ball back into play, and finally Cilic breaks down, driving the 
ball into the alley. Set point Federer again at 10-9. And this time it proves 
decisive: on the next point, Cilic misses a forehand to leave us all square 
after two hours and 44 minutes of unrelenting drama!

A brief, cagey rally ensues, won by Cilic when Federer drags a forehand into 
the net. 9-9 as they change ends again.
 
The Swiss works his way forward again, but Cilic finds a wonderful backhand 
pass down the line. 8-8. Goran looks like he’s about to eat his fist. And he 
may just do that, because now Federer has set point on his own serve at 9-8!
 
No way! Federer works his way to the net with some wily play, and stabs away a 
backhand volley to reach set point …
 
Cilic slams down an unanswerable serve. It’s 7-6 in the Croatian’s favour. A 
third match point. But he nets a forehand return off another ridiculously fast 
Federer second serve. 7-7.
 
What do you do at 1-0 down in a tiebreak? Why, bang down an 111mph second 
serve, of course. That one leaves Goran slumped in his seat. But at 1-1 another 
Federer shank gives Cilic a mini-break. Federer hits back as his opponent goes 
long: 2-2. Big serves from both players: 3-3. They change ends. The tension is 
palpable. Federer sends down a violently sliced first serve, wide to the deuce 
court, for 4-3. Then, more drama: a backhand return is called long, but it’s 
close enough to challenge. Turns out it clipped the line! Good old Hawk-Eye. 
5-3 Federer. Defiantly, Cilic slaps a forehand winner. But a mistake on the 
next point gives Federer two set points at 6-4. He misses the first, on his own 
serve, with a mistimed forehand approach. Then Cilic slams down an ace. My 
goodness, this is tense …
 
Fourth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 6-6 Cilic (*denotes server)

It’s Cilic’s turn to enjoy some luck as a net cord gets him to 15-30 on the 
Federer serve. The Swiss hits back only to miscue a backhand on the next point. 
Match point again for Cilic. But Federer refuses to give in. His serve gets him 
back in the game, and a cool-as-you-like drop shot that he follows in to the 
net paves the way for the tiebreak when Cilic goes long. Utterly compelling 
theatre.

Fourth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 5-6 Cilic* (*denotes server)

The gods smile on Federer when he shanks an off backhand for a clean winner on 
the opening point. Cilic counters to reach 15-15, but Federer then fires a 
forehand winner for 15-30. Cilic responds in kind. There’s no quarter given or 
asked here. A dramatic baseline exchange at 30-30 is won by Cilic with a 
forehand so powerful that Roger almost ends up doing the splits to retrieve it. 
He makes it, but the reply barely clears the net and Cilic guides it away. 
Another rumbling off forehand from Cilic on game point draws the mistake from 
Federer, and the former champion’s resolve will be tested again.
 
Fourth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 5-5 Cilic (*denotes server)

Are second serves edible? I think they must be, because Cilic absolutely 
devours a 105mph second serve from Federer on the opening point, slamming the 
ball with frightening velocity. At 30-30, he does the same off a backhand, 
sending Federer sliding to his right. Match point to the Croatian. But he can’t 
find the court off another second serve from Federer, who quickly recovers to 
stay alive. The tension is almost unimaginable.

A reminder that on Court One, Milos Raonic is in action against Sam Querrey. 
The Canadian is two sets to one up and you can follow that onehere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/jul/06/sam-querrey-milos-raonic-wimbledon-latest-score>
. Frankly, though, I wouldn’t go anywhere just yet. Because Cilic has just held 
and that means Federer will have to serve to stay in the match.

Fourth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 4-4 Cilic (*denotes server)

On the opening point, Federer sends his opponent flailing fruitlessly to his 
left with a penetrating serve down the middle. Still his wife, Mirka, looks 
pensive up in Federer’s box. Perhaps he senses it, because he races through the 
remainder of the game with the frantic air of a man who has a bus to catch. 
We’re level again.

“These guys are frighteningly good!” writes Dean Kinsellla. “Andy has still 
got a lot of great tennis to play to win this championship.” I should say, 
Dean. That last serve from Cilic, all 132mph of it, threatened the integrity of 
Roger Federer’s left hip. The quality from both men is simply breathtaking.
 
Fourth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 3-3 Cilic (*denotes server)

Can this match never end? Please don’t let it end. Correct me if I’m wrong, 
but I don’t recall seeing better tennis – with both players competing at or 
near the very top of their respective games – over the past fortnight, 
certainly not in the men’s draw at least. Federer underlines the quality on 
show with a second service ace on game point to draw level once more.
 
Fourth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 2-3 Cilic*(*denotes server)

Sometimes, the merest trick of the racket head, the most fleeting of contact 
between strings and ball, is enough. Hell, if you’reRoger Federer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> it’s often more than enough. 
And it certainly is on the second point here, the Swiss flicking an audacious 
backhand winner down the line. He repeats the trick with a booming backhand 
drive at 15-30, and from nowhere he has two break points. How does Cilic 
respond? Why, with four consecutive aces of course. Goran – who pretty much 
invented that trick – looks on approvingly. Extraordinary serving from the 
Croatian.
 
Fourth set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 2-2 Cilic (*denotes server)

Frustration from Federer as he responds to steering a forehand wide at 15-15 
with a swish of his racket. He probably feels a lot worse when he mistimes a 
backhand on the next point to gift Cilic two break points. He saves the first 
with a cracking body serve that Cilic fails to negotiate on his forehand, and 
the second with a 106mph – 106mph! – second serve. A Cilic groundstroke error 
brings up game point, and Federer thumps down a 120mph ace – unsuccessfully 
challenged by Cilic – to stay on level terms. Brilliant recovery play from the 
seven-time champion.

“I think I’m right in saying that if Federer goes out, this will be the first 
Grand Slam since the 2004 French Open in which not one of Federer, Nadal nor 
Djokovic made it to the last four,” writes Greg Phillips. You may well be 
right, Greg. If so, that’s food for thought. Is the old order finally changing? 
Cilic would like to think so as he holds again.

Federer responds with a swift hold. It’s nip and tuck.



 
Fourth set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 0-1 Cilic* (*denotes server)

The psychological balance of this match is poised on a knife edge. Cilic, who 
holds by pouncing on a weak return at 40-30 to strike an unanswerable forehand 
into the open court, knows he has the beating of Federer. He has the shots, he 
has the lead, and he has the knowledge that he has beaten the Swiss on the big 
stage before. But right now, Federer has the momentum and the crowd. You simply 
can’t take your eyes off the action.

Oh, Roger, you old smoothie. Having claimed his first break of the match, the 
Swiss maestro steers home the silkiest of backhand winners on set point. What 
timing. What a player. What a contest!

Ladies and gentlemen, Roger Federer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> is in the building! As the 
Swiss looks to carry on from where he left off in the previous game, Goran 
Ivanisevic wears a worried look up in the players’ box. He has just cause, for 
his man is 0-30 down and the Centre Court crowd is really getting behind 
Federer. Cilic hits back with some thunderous serving, hitting the 136mph point 
at one stage. But Federer, buoyed by a suddenly electric atmosphere, works his 
way to a rare break point, and Cilic double-faults. Game on.

Blimey. Is Marin Cilic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/marin-cilic> 
actually Thor in disguise? I think he might be. He’s sending down absolute 
thunderbolts off his forehand side, hammering the ball past Federer at 
frightening velocity. Amid the onslaught, a shellshocked Federer falls 0-40 
behind. The Centre Court crowd gasps. There’s an awed silence around the old 
arena; people can barely believe what they’re seeing from Cilic. What they see 
next is rather more familiar, however: a brilliant Federer fightback, his full 
dazzling repertoire on display as he claws his way back to hold, roaring in 
triumph as he goes. Could this be the start of something?

He may be two sets down, but you still have to stand and admire Roger Federer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer> at times. At 40-0 on the 
Cilic serve, the Croatian moves like the proverbial gazelle to run down a short 
ball. How he gets there I’ll never know, but he does. Momentarily taken aback, 
Federer responds by reaching behind him to flick a backhand half-volley for a 
winner. It might be his last hurrah, but still – what a shot.

“Hi Les,” writes John McEnerney. “This wasn’t in the script: no Novak in the 
quarter-finals and Federer two sets down. We could say, “Let’s see what this 
Federer lad has,” but we know what he’s got. But this may be a tad too much, 
even for the GOAT.” I hear you, John. This may prove a challenge too far for 
the great man. Still, serving first in this set should help him, always 
assuming he can keep his nose in front – which he does here with something to 
spare.
 
Third set: Federer 6-7, 4-6, 2-2 Cilic* (*denotes server)

Remember Federer’s “Sabr” – that’ll be “sneak attack by Roger”, for those who 
don’t speak acronym – routine at last year’s US Open? Well, he tries one here 
and it reaps dividends in the form of an outright winner. That lays the 
foundations for him to reach break point and, although Cilic denies him the 
breakthrough with some more mammoth serving, it perhaps offers a clue as to 
what he could do differently to make a greater impression off the return. Not 
that making an impression with 130mph bombs coming your way is easy, mind.
 
Third set: Federer* 6-7, 4-6, 2-1 Cilic (*denotes server)

Federer moves ahead again, thanks largely to his 10th and 11th aces. But a 
sinew-straining rally that has both players at full stretch offers some idea of 
what the Swiss is up against, with Cilic demonstrating his extraordinary 
wingspan to lunge for a forehand and guide it home. There’s danger at every 
turn here for Federer.
