Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange 


La La Land’s opening scene is a six-minute dance number to the song Another 
Day of Sun, that plays out amid LA’s notoriously bad traffic. It’s also where 
the film’s protagonists, struggling actress Mia (Emma Stone) and jazz pianist 
Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), first encounter each other – albeit in a road rage 
incident. The scene is said to have been filmed over two hot days in a ramp at 
this interchange between the carpool lanes of the 105 (Century) and 110 
(Harbor) freeways in south LA. The downtown skyline and surrounding mountains 
can be seen in the distance.

SmokeHouse Restaurant, Burbank

This is the setting for the scene in which Mia discovers Sebastian’s talent 
for the piano. The fictional Lipton’s restaurant – where jazz purist Sebastian 
grudgingly agrees to play Christmas music – is in reality a venerable eatery 
long frequented by actors, producers and other showbiz types. It has been on 
this spot, across the street from the Warner Bros studio, since 1949. In the 
film, the exterior of Lipton’s is the You Are the Star mural, which features 
Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin and others, which is on the corner of Hollywood 
Boulevard and Wilcox Avenue in Hollywood.

Cathy’s Corner, Mount Hollywood Drive

“Not much to look at, huh?” Sebastian cracks about the gorgeous city view. 
“I’ve seen better,” Mia replies. This section of the road that winds through 
Griffith Park is the setting of the duo’s six-minute song-and-dance number, A 
Lovely Night, after they reconnect at a Hollywood Hills party. It overlooks the 
San Fernando Valley and features prominently on the film posters. Cathy’s 
Corner is near famed Mulholland Drive, but prepare for disappointment if you’re 
expecting a park bench and street lamps. They only exist in the movie.

Mia works at the studio’s coffee shop, where Sebastian comes to meet her. As 
they wander the studio’s lot, Mia points out “the window that Humphrey Bogart 
and Ingrid Bergman looked out in Casablanca”. It’s one of the film’s numerous 
nods to movie history. Warner Bros is still a working studio, with 35 sound 
stages, 14 exterior sets, postproduction services and visitor tours. La La Land 
was also filmed in part at Hollywood Center Studios in Los Angeles.

The Lighthouse Cafe, Hermosa Beach

Sebastian introduces Mia to “pure jazz” at this nightclub, which has been a 
hot spot for jazz since 1949, and shares with her his dream of opening his own 
club. He later gets a job here as a piano player. Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, 
Cannonball Adderley and Dizzy Gillespie are among the legends who have 
performed here. Today, the Lighthouse is no longer a jazz-only club; it hosts 
salsa, country and reggae, too. Nearby is Hermosa Beach Pier, where Sebastian 
first sings City of Stars, a recurring song in the film.

Jar is the retro-modern restaurant where Mia abandons her boyfriend, Greg 
(Finn Wittrock), by walking out on a double date. Opened in 2001, this 
restaurant has featured in TV series such asRay Donovan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/03/watching-ray-donovan-drama-tv>
 and Modern Family as well as 2009 Paul Rudd rom-comI Love You, Man 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/17/i-love-you-man-film-review>. 
Noted for its steaks, Jar has been ranked among the city’s best restaurants by 
local food critics. Shortly after Mia leaves the restaurant – to swelling music 
– she walks north on Harper Avenue.

The lovers meet here to watch a 10pm screening of Rebel Without a Cause. 
Dating from 1925 and described by theLos Angeles Times 
<http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-rialto-theater-sold-20150109-story.html>
 as “an odd mashup of Spanish baroque and Egyptian kitsch”, it is listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places. This single-screen cinema, one of the 
last of its kind in southern California, seats 1,300 people and once hosted 
vaudeville shows. Michael Jackson’s Thriller video was filmed here, as were 
parts of The Player and Scream 2. It closed in 2007, though there areplans to 
reopen it <https://www.facebook.com/FriendsoftheRialto/>.

From Cathy’s Corner, Mia and Sebastian continue their date at this 1935 art 
deco landmark and tourist attraction, named for Welsh industrialist and 
philanthropist Griffith J Griffith. Though his reputation was marred when he 
was prosecuted in 1903 for shooting his wife, the observatory named after him 
is well-loved and offers popular planetarium shows and spectacular views of the 
city and the nearby Hollywood sign. It was also the site of the knife fight 
scene in 1955’s Rebel without a Cause, commemorated by a bust of its star, 
James Dean.

This is where Sebastian plays keyboards for the Messengers, a pop-jazz group 
fronted by his old acquaintance Keith (John Legend). It’s the first big sign 
that his music career is taking off. Opened in 1936, graceful, art deco El Rey 
was a cinema and a dance club before becoming a music venue in the 1990s. With 
a capacity of 770, it has hosted myriad indie bands, including Yo La Tengo, as 
well as Bob Dylan and former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. Rock agent Tom 
Windish reportedly called El Rey one of “the best mid-sized venues in LA”.

The Blind Donkey, Long Beach


This bar is the setting of Seb’s jazz club at the end of the film – where Mia 
and Sebastian have their final, bittersweet encounter. In real life, expect 
whiskey, wine and beer instead of jazz. Also in Long Beach is the nearby 
setting of Mia’s pink apartment, shown earlier in the film. Built in 1928 in 
Spanish colonial style,Rose Towers  <http://domaproperties.com/rose-towers/>
