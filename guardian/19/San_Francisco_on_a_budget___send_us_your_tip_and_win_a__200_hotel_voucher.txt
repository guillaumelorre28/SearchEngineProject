Rents have risen harshly in San Francisco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco> over the past few years, 
pricing out the smaller businesses and eccentric neighbourhoods that made The 
City unique. If you know a hidden dumpling-shop in Chinatown, an unusual 
neighbourhood museum in Nob Hill or a cheap and friendly hotel in The Mission, 
send us tip.

Send us your tips via GuardianWitness <https://witness.theguardian.com/> 
including as much detail as you can inaround 100 words (along with website, 
menu details and prices etc, if possible).


The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
from Hotels.com, allowing you to stay in more than 260,000 places worldwide. 
Submit your tip by clicking the blue button and using the text tab.
