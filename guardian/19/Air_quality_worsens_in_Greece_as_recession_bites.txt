Greece’s financial recession is leaving its footprint on the environment. This 
follows twenty years of huge improvements in Greece’s air pollution. While most 
European countries struggle with the consequences of failure to control exhaust 
pollution from diesel vehicles,Greece <https://www.theguardian.com/world/greece>
 benefitted from long-standing bans on diesel cars in the two biggest cities, 
Athens and Thessaloniki.

This allowed the country to reap the full benefits of technologies to control 
petrol exhaust, without these being offset by the poor performance of diesel 
cars. As a consequencenitrogen dioxide from traffic

 approximately halved alongside Greek roads between 1996 and 2006, in contrast 
to the lack of improvement elsewhere in Europe.

acted as a huge incentive for those struggling with travel costs. Amongst new 
car sales diesels leapt from less than 20% (around zero in Thessaloniki) to 
over 60%, but, so far, economic pressures have reduced traffic volumes averting 
a possible deterioration in air pollution.

However, a tripling in the cost of heating oil brought about larger changes as 
hard-pressed Greeks have switched to burning wood. Wintertime particlepollution 
increased by around 30% in Thessaloniki in 2013

 and air toxicity worsened on evenings when fires were lit. Analysis of 
wintertime air in Athens shows that it is not just logs that are being burnt. 
Along withchemicals from wood burning

, scientists found lead, arsenic and cadmium particles, showing that people are 
burning painted and treated wood, and also their rubbish, to keep warm.
