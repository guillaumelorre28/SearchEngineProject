Special instructions


Each numbered square in the diagram is surrounded by eight blank squares. All 
clues lead to answers of eight letters, and these are to be entered around 
their appropriate numbers, clockwise or anticlockwise, beginning anywhere. 
Solvers must determine where each begins and the direction in which it is to 
go. The twelve unchecked letters at the corners of the completed diagram could 
form A FINE VERBENA.

Every answer is in The Chambers Dictionary (2014), except one proper name and 
the adjectival form at 28, which is attested on the Internet.
