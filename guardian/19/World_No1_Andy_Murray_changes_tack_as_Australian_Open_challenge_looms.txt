Andy Murray, the world No1, returns to the court in Abu Dhabi on Friday hoping 
a change of preparations can help deliver an elusiveAustralian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> title next month.

The Scot ended the 2016 tour at the top of the ATP rankings after winning both 
the Wimbledon and Olympic titles. He then defeated the previous No1, Novak 
Djokovic, to win the year-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London.

More than a month on from that victory, Murray faces David Goffin of Belgium 
in the semi-finals of the Mubadala World Championship, which Rafael Nadal and 
Milos Raonic have also entered. He will contest the Qatar Open next week, after 
deciding to enter a Tour event prior to the Australian Open.

It is the first time in three years Murray has elected to take such an 
approach and his hope is that it can help him be victorious in Melbourne, where 
he is a five-times runner up. “This year I just fancy doing something 
different,” he told The National newspaper. “It hasn’t worked for me at the 
Aussie Open in the last few years. Probably nothing to do with my preparations, 
but it [going to Doha] splits the journey a little bit as well.

“So to split that trip up from doing one long trip to Australia might help. 
But I have enjoyed playing in Abu Dhabi and Doha in the past. I have had some 
success in Doha, so hopefully it will work well for me. It seems to have worked 
well for Novak as well over the years; hopefully it works for me too.”

Murray has been busy with winter training in Florida as usual, where he 
received his BBC sports personality of the year award by videolink the week 
before Christmas.
