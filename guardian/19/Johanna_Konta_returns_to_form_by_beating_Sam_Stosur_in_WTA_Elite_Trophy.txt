The British No1 has had an outstanding year and narrowly missed out on 
qualifying for the WTA Finals in Singapore last week. She would very likely 
have made it had she not been sidelined by an abdominal injury but there were 
no signs of any physical problems as she brushed aside her Australian opponent 
Stosur 6-4, 6-2.

Konta opened up 4-0 leads in both sets, and victory against Caroline Garcia on 
Friday would send the top seed through to the semi-finals. The 25-year-old is 
guaranteed to become the first British woman to finish a season ranked inside 
the top 10 since Jo Durie in 1983.

Petra Kvitova continued her fine run of form by defeating Roberta Vinci 6-1, 
6-2 in 47 minutes. The two-time Wimbledon champion has won 19 of her past 24 
matches and will qualify for the last four if she beats Barbora Strycova on 
Friday.

Timea Bacsinszky kept alive her hopes of reaching the semi-finals, bouncing 
back from defeat by Zhang Shuai in her opening group match by beating Timea 
Babos 6-4, 6-2.
