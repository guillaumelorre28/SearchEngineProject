The New Yorker Boutique Hotel

The New Yorker, a classic motel designed in 1953 and protected by the city's 
Historic Preservation Board <http://www.historicpreservationmiami.com/>, could 
serve as the set for a Miami episode of Mad Men. A careful restoration in 2009 
breathed new life into the 55-room property. Today, the historic boutique hotel 
is a stylish centrepiece of Miami's Modern Architectural District (MiMo), also 
known as "MiMo on BiBo", referring to its location on Biscayne Boulevard north 
of the popular Design District. The owners have maintained plenty of retro 
details: the powder blue and white colour scheme, the original "New Yorker 
Motel" neon sign, while updating guest rooms and invigorating the petite 
outdoor garden and swimming pool.

Whitelaw Hotel and Lounge
 Stiff drinks … is just part of the motto at the Whitelaw Hotel and Lounge.

A hipster favourite in the centre of the Art Deco District of South Beach, 
this flamboyant boutique hotel has a tongue-in-cheek slogan: "Clean sheets, hot 
water, stiff drinks." Which isn't to say that the Whitelaw lacks an aesthetic: 
the decor mixes 60s-style mod and Victorian opulence, with fanciful crystal 
chandeliers and a rainbow-inspired colour palette. Guest rooms, featuring 42in 
plasma screens, goose-down duvets and marble bathrooms stocked with "most 
forgotten accessories" are on the small side. That fact is generally irrelevant 
to the party crowd that frequent the place – they're more likely to spend their 
time downing free cocktails at the nightly happy hour, before heading out to 
South Beach.

Freehand Miami

It's no small undertaking to reinvent a hotel as iconic as the 1930s-era 
Indian Creek Hotel, an art-deco building that boasted one of the city's first 
elevators. But the team behind Freehand Miami, the cool new hostel now 
inhabiting the historic space, has pulled it off, enlivening the place with a 
modern aesthetic and a hipster-friendly edge. Notable additions include 
handcrafted interior design by the sought-after New York firmRoman and Williams 
<http://www.romanandwilliams.com/>, and the Broken Shaker cocktail bar 
<http://thefreehand.com/venues/the-broken-shaker/>, where the mixologist uses 
herbs grown in the adjacent garden. Choose between shared or private 
accommodations. The on-site bike rental kiosk and a gorgeous swimming pool, 
surrounded by tropical foliage are open to all guests.

The Clay Hotel
 Spanish-style, Florida sun … The Clay Hotel. Photograph: Alamy 
Dating from 1925, this historic Spanish-style inn is fraying around the edges 
– but if you're looking for a slice of old Miami, you won't find much better. 
The Clay was the headquarters of Al Capone's gambling ring in the 30s, and the 
place whereDesi Arnaz <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desi_Arnaz> (of I Love Lucy 
fame) first popularised rumba in Miami. Did we mention scenes from the pilot of 
Miami Vice were filmed here? Today, apart from the glamorous back story, the 
hotel's primary selling point is its fantastic location in South Beach at the 
foot of Española Way, a charming pedestrian thoroughfare lined with outdoor 
bars and restaurants.

Miami River Inn
 Miami River Inn 
If party-around-the-clock South Beach isn't your scene, try the old-fashioned 
(and eco-friendly) Miami River Inn, which proudly bills itself "Miami's only 
B&B". On the National Register of Historic Places, the place dates from 1910, 
and looks the part: the house is filled with antique furnishings and oil 
paintings, while outside, there's a croquet green and a small swimming pool 
where hotel guests gather for freshly baked pastries in the morning and a glass 
of wine in the evening. In Miami's downtown, dominated by high-rise business 
hotels, this historic B&B is one of the few accommodation options offering a 
good dash of local character.

Circa 39
 Cocktail hour … Play Bar & Lounge, Circa 39 
This down-to-earth boutique hotel offers all the style of the Art Deco 
District, but with a Miami Beach location that's slightly removed from the 
South Beach frenzy. The impressive range of on-site amenities includes a 
swimming pool and sun deck complete with teak chaise lounges and canopied 
private cabanas, a fitness centre, a nightly happy hour at thePlay Bar & Lounge 
<http://www.circa39.com/bistro-bar-lounge/> and casual dining at the 
good-looking Bistro 39. Best of all, Circa 39 is across the street from the 
beach, and the hotel provides complimentary beach umbrellas and chairs. After 
fun in the sun, retreat to one of the sleek guest rooms done up in crisp white, 
apple green and polished hard wood.

Hotel Shelley

Fashionable but low-key, this boutique hotel hits a lot of the right notes: 
the look is simple and casually elegant, and the crowd is relaxed, congregating 
for complimentary happy hour drinks on the patio or around the fireplace every 
evening. The setting is ideal, too – Hotel Shelley occupies an ivory and 
lilac-hued art-deco building a block away from the ocean in South Beach. Of 
course, there's a trade-off. Guest rooms are generally small, and there's no 
swimming pool but Hotel Shelley is still solid value. It's one of the quieter 
options ofSouth Beach Group <http://www.southbeachgroup.com/>'s hotels – the 
budget-minded hotel conglomerate offering welcome perks such as a free airport 
shuttle service.

Shalimar Motel
 Shalimar Motel 
Like the more illustrious New Yorker Boutique Hotel, the Shalimar Motel, built 
in 1955, is part of the burgeoning MiMo district. From the outside, it looks 
like a standard bi-level mid-century motel, complete with a kitschy facade; 
inside, many guest rooms have been renovated to feature crisp white linens, 
smooth tile floors and contemporary bathrooms. Note that renovations are still 
underway – so be sure to ask for one of the newer rooms – and that the 
surrounding area feels slightly sketchy at night, though the atmosphere is 
slowly gentrifying. Free parking makes the Shalimar convenient for travellers 
with rental cars, which end up being an expensive headache if you're staying in 
more touristy South Beach.

SoBe Hostel
 Making tracks … the SoBe offers on-site bike rental 
This recently revamped boutique hostel is the backpacker's pick in South 
Beach. It features all of the usual amenities –four- and eight-bed dorms, small 
private rooms, lounge space, a communal kitchen, laundry facilities, an 
internet cafe – plus an outdoor terrace, a bijou cinema, on-site bicycle 
rental, a tour desk, free continental breakfast and a complimentary airport 
shuttle. The scene is youthful, international and social: the popular hostel 
bar stays open until 5am, running frequent drink specials and hosting pool 
tournaments. SoBe Hostel is located a few blocks from the ocean at the 
southernmost end of South Beach.

Habitat Residence
 Habitat Residence 
This contemporary "condo hotel" offers travellers a chance to live like a 
Miami local – well, at least the sort of local who lives downtown in a luxury 
high-rise building. Sleek and eco-friendly, these fully-equipped apartments are 
best suited to travelling families and longer-term visitors who are willing to 
trade standard hotel services – say, the concierge desk and continental 
breakfast – for extra living space, a full kitchen and a parking space. Each 
apartment also includes wireless internet, a flatscreen TV, laundry facilities, 
a private balcony and access to a rooftop terrace with views over the Miami 
skyline.
