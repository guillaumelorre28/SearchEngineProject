If Cinderella got to go to the ball, then so shall you, and where better for a 
twirl around the dancefloor than Vienna, the home of the waltz?

The Austrian capital has hundreds of balls during the three-month season, 
starting with the Imperial Ball (or Kaiserball) at the Hofburg on New Year's 
Eve and including the fabulously glamorous Opera Ball on 31 January.

Tickets for both of these don't come cheap (from €130, without a seat) and 
sell out months in advance, but almost every profession in the city has a ball 
of its own - the hunter (Jagerball), the coffee-maker (Kaffeesiederball), the 
confectioner (Zuckerbackerball) - and you can pick up tickets for many of these 
on the door.

You'll need to dress to impress, but you can rent a gown from several 
boutiques in Vienna (trywww.flossmann.at <http://www.flossmann.at>). 

Want to dance but don't want to tread on anyone's toes? Take a waltzing lesson 
at the city's Tanzschule Elmayer (www.elmayer.com <http://www.elmayer.com>), 
which charges €58 per couple for 50 minutes' tuition.
