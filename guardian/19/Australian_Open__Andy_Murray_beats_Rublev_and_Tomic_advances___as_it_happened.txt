leads 6-5 in the fourth set and has secured a second tie-break at the very

Both players are showing nerves of steel in this fourth set and Victor 
Estrella Burgos holds for a 5-4 lead. Bernard Tomic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> will serve to stay in the set 
and the potential for this to turn into a dark day for Australian tennis is 
growing. Remember, Nick Kyrgios has already managed to lose from two sets up 
today. Tomic looks determined not to follow in his compatriot’s footsteps, 
though, and holds to level it at 5-5.

Victor Estrella Burgos earns a set point and he takes quite brilliantly, 
standing up to an array of stinging forehands fromBernard Tomic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> before reaching a drop volley 
from the Australian and pinging a forehand down the line that’s too hot to 
handle. The Dominican deserves that. He trails 7-5, 7-6, 4-6 and he’s

There’s only one match left today and Bernard Tomic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> is desperately trying to wrap 
it up in straight sets against Victor Estrella Burgos, who’s proving to be a 
stubborn opponent.Tomic leads by two sets, but they’re locked at 4-4 in the 
third.

Andy Murray is through to the third round despite that injury scare when he 
rolled his right ankle at the start of the third set. Andrey Rublev sends a 
backhand return long and Murray, who had squandered two match points, seals a 
6-3, 6-0, 6-2 win in an hour and 37 minutes. He’ll meet Sam Querrey on Friday. 
Murray was excellent. His priority now will be ensuring that his ankle hasn’t 
suffered any lasting damage.

Ivan Lendl is on his feet in the stands, watching as the trainer manipulates 
Murray’s ankle.Murray’s coach has a stony expression on his face, but that’s 
not really news. The trainer doesn’t stay for long. It’s just an assessment and 
Murray’s back on his feet, ready to serve.

Andy Murray’s ankle injury can’t be that bad. He breaks to lead 6-3, 6-0, 2-1. 
Andrey Rublev is the one who feels sore now, although Murray has called for the 
trainer.

“Not good,” Murray appears to say to his box. He’s feeling wobbly. He’ll 
presumably have the trainer on at the end of this game. Rublev is serving at 
1-1 in the third set.

Andy Murray tumbles at the back of the court and appears to turn his right 
ankle. He’s grimacing a lot. Kim, watching in his box, looks concerned, her 
hand over her mouth. He’s up again, but he is limping a bit. Watch this space.

At the third time of asking, Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> gobbles up a set point to 
confirm the bagel. The world No1 leads 6-3, 6-0 against Andrey Rublev and he’s 
a set away from a third-round match against Sam Querrey. He’ll be able to thank 
Querrey for beating Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last year.

It’s turning into a torrid experience for poor Andrey Rublev on Rod Laver 
Arena. He smacks a forehand against the net post and Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> breaks for a third time in the 
second set to lead 6-3, 5-0.

Andy Murray’s famous scampering skills are enough to draw a preposterous error 
on a break point from Andrey Rublev, who completely shanks a gimme of a smash 
at the net to drop his serve for a second time in the second set.Murray is 
cruising at 6-3, 3-0.

“Went shopping in the middle and never expected to find the modest but great 
stayer Seppi win Kyrgios, nor Dan Evans , as you say always unexpected and 
entertaining, knock out Cilic, who in turn seemed to be playing really well at 
the beginning,” says Diana Badder. “You absolutely never can tell with tennis.”
That’s the beauty of sport, Diana, its unpredictability. Although it doesn’t 
seem that a surprise is likely on Rod Laver Arena, whereAndy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> has a firm grip on proceedings 
against Andrey Rublev. He leads by a set and a break.

In more routine news from a British perspective, Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> has won the first set 6-3 
against Andrey Rublev. There haven’t been too many blows for the world No1 to 
absorb yet, even though he’s up against the son of a boxer.

Dan Evans, who will face either Bernard Tomic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> or Victor Estrella Burgos 
next, speaks and immediately references his agonising defeat to Stan Wawrinka 
in New York in September. “I didn’t finish the job on the last time in the big 
occasion. To come through, on the last match point, was pretty pleasing for me. 
I struggled [in the first set], his pace on the ball was pretty quick. Just 
hang in and see what happens.”

Serving to stay in the match at 5-3 down in the fourth set, Marin Cilic whacks 
a horrible forehand into the net to hand Dan Evans three match points.This is a 
huge moment in the curious career of Dan Evans, never predictable, always 
interesting. He saves the first, however, then the second. More tension. But he 
doesn’t save the third! Cilic rushes a forehand into the net and Evans has 
beaten the seventh seed 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-3 to reach the third round! He’s 
ecstatic and so’s his team! It’s easily the biggest win of the 26-year-old’s 
career. He celebrates by immediately whipping out his phone to check his 
messages and send a few.

Nick Kyrgios’s Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> is over in typically 
complicated circumstances. He’s lost 1-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-2, 10-8 to Andrea Seppi 
and has some serious thinking to do after yet another hugely damaging defeat, 
one that is unlikely to do much for his notoriously fragile morale. Expect the 
schadenfreude to flow.

As for Dan Evans, he’s not allowing himself to become weighed down by 
adversity at all. Broken in the previous game, he earns a break point in the 
fifth game of the fourth set and converts for a 3-2 lead when Marin Cilic 
tamely nets a forehand. Once again, it’s Evans’s match to lose. Can he hold?

He was a break down – but the first set goes to Bernard Tomic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> on Margaret Court Arena. 
Three straight games for the 27th seed and he takes it 7-5 against Victor 
Estrella Burgos.

But wait, Dan Evans’s level dips at a bad time and he fails to consolidate the 
break.A gorgeous drop volley from Marin Cilic is enough for him to break 
straight back for 2-2 in the fourth set. That was outrageous from the Croatian.

He saves eight break points in one game, he breaks to 30 in the next. Dan 
Evans, everyone. Cilic saves two break points, but he double-faults on the 
third, and Evans breaks to lead 2-1 in the fourth set. The biggest victory of 
his career is really on the cards now.

Bernard Tomic bites back straight away. He breaks to love against Victor 
Estrella Burgos to level the first set. The Dominican served for it, but Tomic 
is serving at 5-all now.

Marin Cilic are the main story at the moment, though, with the Croatian

Jack Sock’s feeling good about life after a fine 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Karen 
Khachanov on Court 8.The 23rd seed has a tough third-round match, though, and 
he’ll have to be at his absolute best to defeat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

Dan Evans maintains his composure brilliantly, forceful aggressive tennis 
earning him three set points.Cilic’s game has gone to pot and he’s being given 
the runaround by Evans, who pings a wondrous forehand away to lead 3-6, 7-5, 
6-3! The British underdog is a set away from beating the seventh seed and 
former US Open champion. This would be the biggest win of his career, although 
it’s unlikely there won’t be a hefty response from Cilic, who was looking so 
relaxed a set and a half ago.

Serving at 5-2 down in the third set, Marin Cilic saves two set points and 
holds to keep his head above water.Dan Evans will serve for the set and he’ll 
need to be wary of the sudden increase in intensity from Cilic.

Dan Evans holds to 15 to lead 5-2 in the third set. He’s playing gloriously. 
Cilic looks confused. In other news, Bernard Tomic’s match against Victor 
Estrella Burgos is underway on Margaret Court Arena.

Coco Vandeweghe won’t be entirely happy with herself given how she twice 
failed to serve out the match against Pauline Parmentier, who broke back from 
5-2 down to force a second set tie-break.But the American has avoided a 
calamity by securing a 6-4, 7-6 victory. It wasn’t as comfortable as it 
shouldn’t have been, but she’s booked her place in round three and an 
intriguing match against Eugenie Bouchard.

Dan Evans has neatly inserted himself into Marin Cilic’s head and he’s the 
dominant force in this match now, breaking to 15 to lead 3-1 in the third set.
Hawkeye was on his side as he challenged a Cilic ball that looked wide but was 
called in by the line judges. Everything’s going Evans’s way at the moment.

The Nick Kyrgios experience has taken another surreal turn. Two sets up 
against Andrea Seppi and playing lights out tennis, he’s somehow allowed the 
Italian to take their match into a deciding fifth set.

A tight first set, a breeze of a second and Australia’s Ashleigh Barty marches 
on after beating the USA’s Shelby Rogers 7-5, 6-1. Into the third round of slam 
for the first time in her short career, Barty’s next opponent is Mona Barthel, 
who’s just wrapped up an impressive 6-4, 6-4 win over Monica Puig, the 29th 
seed.

Dan Evans sprays a stunning one-handed backhand from left to right, picking 
off Marin Cilic’s approach to earn two set points!Cilic is all over the place, 
ballooning a wild forehand miles past the baseline, and we’ve got a real match 
on our hands now, which looked an unlikely prospect when Evans trailed by a set 
and a break. He’s been outstanding since dropping his serve, though, and his 
tricky game is beginning to mess with Cilic’s head. He takes the second set 
7-5. It’s one set apiece and it’s all to play for!

Victor Estrella Burgos fends off a late Bernard Tomic

leads 6-5 in the fourth set and has secured a second tie-break at the very 
least. What’s Tomic made of?
 
Both players are showing nerves of steel in this fourth set and Victor 
Estrella Burgos holds for a 5-4 lead. Bernard Tomic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> will serve to stay in the set 
and the potential for this to turn into a dark day for Australian tennis is 
growing. Remember, Nick Kyrgios has already managed to lose from two sets up 
today. Tomic looks determined not to follow in his compatriot’s footsteps, 
though, and holds to level it at 5-5.
 
Victor Estrella Burgos appears to be pouring heart and soul into every shot. 
He’s grinding away from the baseline and threatening to wear downBernard Tomic

Bernard Tomic needs to be careful. There’s a spring in Victor Estrella 
Burgos’s step and he leads 3-2 in the fourth set, which is still going with 
serve. Both men have served strongly so far.

Victor Estrella Burgos earns a set point and he takes quite brilliantly, 
standing up to an array of stinging forehands fromBernard Tomic

handle. The Dominican deserves that. He trails 7-5, 7-6, 4-6 and he’s 
definitely not out of this yet.
 
Estrella Burgos holds to lead 5-4. Tomic will serve to stay in the third set.
 
There’s only one match left today and Bernard Tomic

third.
 
Andy Murray is through to the third round despite that injury scare when he

Andy Murray’s famous scampering skills are enough to draw a preposterous error 
on a break point from Andrey Rublev, who completely shanks a gimme of a smash 
at the net to drop his serve for a second time in the second set.Murray is 
cruising at 6-3, 3-0.
 
“Went shopping in the middle and never expected to find the modest but great 
stayer Seppi win Kyrgios, nor Dan Evans , as you say always unexpected and 
entertaining, knock out Cilic, who in turn seemed to be playing really well at 
the beginning,” says Diana Badder. “You absolutely never can tell with tennis.”
That’s the beauty of sport, Diana, its unpredictability. Although it doesn’t 
seem that a surprise is likely on Rod Laver Arena, whereAndy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> has a firm grip on proceedings 
against Andrey Rublev. He leads by a set and a break.
 
In more routine news from a British perspective, Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> has won the first set 6-3 
against Andrey Rublev. There haven’t been too many blows for the world No1 to 
absorb yet, even though he’s up against the son of a boxer.
 
Dan Evans, who will face either Bernard Tomic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> or Victor Estrella Burgos 
next, speaks and immediately references his agonising defeat to Stan Wawrinka 
in New York in September. “I didn’t finish the job on the last time in the big 
occasion. To come through, on the last match point, was pretty pleasing for me. 
I struggled [in the first set], his pace on the ball was pretty quick. Just 
hang in and see what happens.”

Serving to stay in the match at 5-3 down in the fourth set, Marin Cilic whacks 
a horrible forehand into the net to hand Dan Evans three match points.This is a 
huge moment in the curious career of Dan Evans, never predictable, always 
interesting. He saves the first, however, then the second. More tension. But he 
doesn’t save the third! Cilic rushes a forehand into the net and Evans has 
beaten the seventh seed 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-3 to reach the third round! He’s 
ecstatic and so’s his team! It’s easily the biggest win of the 26-year-old’s 
career. He celebrates by immediately whipping out his phone to check his 
messages and send a few.
 
Nick Kyrgios’s Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> is over in typically 
complicated circumstances. He’s lost 1-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-2, 10-8 to Andrea Seppi 
and has some serious thinking to do after yet another hugely damaging defeat, 
one that is unlikely to do much for his notoriously fragile morale. Expect the 
schadenfreude to flow.
 
Andy Murray does break. The world No1 leads 4-2 against young Andrey Rublev on 
Rod Laver Arena.

Dan Evans survives a double-fault at 30-15, wills his way to 40-30 and holds 
to lead 4-2 in the fourth set. He’s two games away from beating Marin Cilic. 
MeanwhileAndy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> leads 3-2 
in the first set against Andrey Rublev on Rod Laver Arena and is threatening to 
land the first break.
 
As for Dan Evans, he’s not allowing himself to become weighed down by 
adversity at all. Broken in the previous game, he earns a break point in the 
fifth game of the fourth set and converts for a 3-2 lead when Marin Cilic 
tamely nets a forehand. Once again, it’s Evans’s match to lose. Can he hold?
 
He was a break down – but the first set goes to Bernard Tomic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> on Margaret Court Arena. 
Three straight games for the 27th seed and he takes it 7-5 against Victor 
Estrella Burgos.
 
But wait, Dan Evans’s level dips at a bad time and he fails to consolidate the 
break.A gorgeous drop volley from Marin Cilic is enough for him to break 
straight back for 2-2 in the fourth set. That was outrageous from the Croatian.
 
He saves eight break points in one game, he breaks to 30 in the next. Dan 
Evans, everyone. Cilic saves two break points, but he double-faults on the 
third, and Evans breaks to lead 2-1 in the fourth set. The biggest victory of 
his career is really on the cards now.

Dan Evans maintains his composure brilliantly, forceful aggressive tennis 
earning him three set points.Cilic’s game has gone to pot and he’s being given 
the runaround by Evans, who pings a wondrous forehand away to lead 3-6, 7-5, 
6-3! The British underdog is a set away from beating the seventh seed and 
former US Open champion. This would be the biggest win of his career, although 
it’s unlikely there won’t be a hefty response from Cilic, who was looking so 
relaxed a set and a half ago.

Arena.She’ll serve for the match at 6-4, 5-4 against Samantha Crawford.

Cilic looks confused. In other news, Bernard Tomic’s match against Victor 
Estrella Burgos is underway on Margaret Court Arena.
 
Coco Vandeweghe won’t be entirely happy with herself given how she twice 
failed to serve out the match against Pauline Parmentier, who broke back from 
5-2 down to force a second set tie-break.But the American has avoided a 
calamity by securing a 6-4, 7-6 victory. It wasn’t as comfortable as it 
shouldn’t have been, but she’s booked her place in round three and an 
intriguing match against Eugenie Bouchard.
 
Dan Evans has neatly inserted himself into Marin Cilic’s head and he’s the 
dominant force in this match now, breaking to 15 to lead 3-1 in the third set.
Hawkeye was on his side as he challenged a Cilic ball that looked wide but was 
called in by the line judges. Everything’s going Evans’s way at the moment.

against Andrea Seppi and playing lights out tennis, he’s somehow allowed the 
Italian to take their match into a deciding fifth set.

Dan Evans sprays a stunning one-handed backhand from left to right, picking 
off Marin Cilic’s approach to earn two set points!Cilic is all over the place, 
ballooning a wild forehand miles past the baseline, and we’ve got a real match 
on our hands now, which looked an unlikely prospect when Evans trailed by a set 
and a break. He’s been outstanding since dropping his serve, though, and his 
tricky game is beginning to mess with Cilic’s head. He takes the second set 
7-5. It’s one set apiece and it’s all to play for!
