What’s your musical guilty pleasure?


There is no guilt. I will answer with one song lyric line: “you’re innocent 
when you dream. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmidakwf6I>”

If you had time to learn a new instrument, what would it be?

The viola da gamba <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP0YrMKZhkM>.

Did you ever consider a career outside of music? 

I would love to be a film director.

What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert?

I would put inspiration on the musicians performing music. Deep emotions and 
heart giving to the audience is the only thing I would add.

If you had to pick one work to introduce someone to the wonders of classical 
music, what would it be?

What’s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member?

By far the most significant music experience for me was the Good Friday night

were truly sacred moments blessed by the music.
