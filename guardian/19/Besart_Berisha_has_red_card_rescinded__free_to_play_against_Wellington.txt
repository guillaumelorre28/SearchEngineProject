striker Besart Berisha is free to play against Wellington on Tuesday after his 
controversial A-League red card against Brisbane was rescinded.


Berisha was issued a straight red 59 minutes into Friday night’s five-goal 
thriller for a perceived arm to the face of Roar defender Luke DeVere.

Referee Chris Beath acted on the word of the linesman, who signalled to stop 
play and send Berisha off even though the contact appeared minimal.


After an application from Victory, the match review panel on Sunday ruled the 
decision had been made in “obvious error” and expunged the red card from 
Berisha’s record.


The panel, sitting a day early, came to its decision just in time for the 
Albanian marksman to get on a plane to New Zealand, where Victory will play 
their rescheduled clash with the Phoenix.


Berisha’s absence would have been a massive hit to the second-placed 
title-chasers in their biggest week of the season, with a trip to Perth coming 
just four days later.


Both Victory coach Kevin Muscat and his Roar counterpart John Aloisi agreed he 
shouldn’t have been sent off, with the former revealing DeVere had found him to 
apologise.


“Luke DeVere comes up to me after the game and he was embarrassed,” Muscat 
said. “He said ‘I wasn’t making a meal of it, it was accidental and I told the 
referee that’.

“It was the linesman who made the decision. Bes is really unlucky. I haven’t 
come across anyone who said it was a red card.”
