Each clue requires the addition (at any point) of a single letter before it 
can be satisfactorily solved. The added letters, in clue order, including an 
appropriate one at 27 Across, form a phrase to fit the occasion. A similar 
phrase may be spotted in the completed grid. Competitors should submit with 
their entries a clue to the unclued word at 27 Across (to be deduced) involving 
the required missing letter, like all the other clues. NB Preference will be 
given to clues that make some sense both with and without the missing letter.
