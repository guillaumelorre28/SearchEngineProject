.

David Ferrer said the 14-times Grand Slam winner will definitely travel to 
Brazil while Nadal’s coach and uncle, Toni, was encouraged by Wednesday’s 
hit-out with Andy Murray.

Ferrer told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: “I will travel with Rafa on 
Sunday to Rio. His situation is more delicate. It’s never easy to come back 
after an injury. He will see how he feels.”

Nadal is scheduled to play singles, men’s doubles and mixed doubles in Rio.

Toni Nadal said: “We began to intensify his training in order to be ready in 
time for the first round. Training with Andy Murray was a really hard first 
time with another top player and we are happy. Things worked out well.

“In Rio we will start training with the maximum-level players and see how 
Rafael will respond to the difficulty of the competition.

“There are doubts about his game. I believe that is normal – these are the 
same questions we’ve always had after a period of inactivity. Starting with the 
Olympics is not easy but, if we are lucky in the draw, he can improve step by 
step.”
