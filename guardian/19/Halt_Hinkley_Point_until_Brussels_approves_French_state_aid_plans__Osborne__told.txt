Greenpeace <http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/> has written to George Osborne 
warning him not to allow the Hinkley Point C nuclear project to proceed until 
the European commission approves further planned support from the French state.

The letter, which is signed jointly with the energy supplier Ecotricity 
<http://www.ecotricity.co.uk/>, follows legal advice that plans for state help 
from France’sgovernment to enable EDF to continue with the reactor scheme could 
break European competition rules.

The legal opinion was given to Greenpeace 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace> by three competition 
barristers from Monckton Chambers in London and came as EDF held a board 
meeting on Friday in Paris to discuss once again the controversial £18bn 
project in Somerset.

“The only way Hinkley can be kept alive is on the life support machine of 
state aid. EDF, if it is to stay in business, needs a new vision which is not 
looking backwards,” said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK.

“The UK government needs to stop penalising the UK renewable energy industry 
in favour of propping up an ailing state-owned nuclear industry inFrance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/france>.”

 Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, said it was time for everyone to realise 
that it was the end of the road for Hinkley Point.

 “Illegal state aid is one thing, and we’ll work with Greenpeace to challenge 
that if it happens, but it’s not just financial issues, there are technical 
problems with Hinkley Point too – EDF are yet to build one of these reactors 
and their first two attempts are, between them, 16 years late and billions over 
budget,” he added.

The letter was also sent to Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change 
Secretary. Rudd and Osborne have been key figures in trying to steer investment 
into new nuclear plants.

EDF, which is 85% owned by the French state, is struggling against a mountain 
of debt and has told ministers it will not build Hinkleyunless it obtains help 
from France’s government.

The country’s economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, has talked about taking 
future dividends in shares rather than cash 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/17/french-government-edf-united-front-hinkley-point-money-nuclear-plant-union>
 and a range of other options to lessen the financial burden on EDF.

It is these proposals that the London barristers believe would need clearance 
from Brussels, a process that would subject Hinkley to further delays.

Molly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the area covering the plant, said: “The 
numbers for the Hinkley deal have never stacked up and it is clear that the 
commercial case for this white elephant is dead. We have now a political battle 
where the stakes for both the UK and France are just too high to admit failure. 
But we cannot let this override EU rules on state aid or fair competition.”
