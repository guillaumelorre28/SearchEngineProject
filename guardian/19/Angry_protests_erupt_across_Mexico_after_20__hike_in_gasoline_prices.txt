Demonstrators have blockaded highways, looted shops and forced service 
stations acrossMexico <https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico> to close in a 
wave of angry protest triggered by a hike of more than 20% in the 
government-set price of gasoline.

The announcement of the price increase came on 1 January – when long queues of 
cars were already forming at pumps because national oil giant Pemex was unable 
to supply all gas stations due to problems with oil refining and fuel shortages 
caused by theft.

The so-called gasolinazo – as the price hike is known – added insult to 
injury, and since then, protests have spiraled. Truckers, taxi drivers and 
irate individuals have blocked the main highways into Mexico City and major 
thoroughfares in the capital, prompting bus lines to cancel service.

Pemex warned on Tuesday that blockades had created a “critical situation” in 
at least three Mexican states, while demonstrations in suburban Mexico City 
turned violent as protesters looted at least two department stores.

Outside one gas station in the centre of the captial, Manuel López, a 
mechanic, stood defiantly in front of the pumps. Ironically, López does not own 
a car – he sold it because of Mexico’s ongoing economic downturn – but he said 
the size and shock of thegasolinazo had sent him into the streets.


“It’s an economic issue,” said López, 24. “Salaries are not very good. If 
gasoline goes up, it provokes an inflation in the cost of the items we consume 
daily,” he added, reciting a list of common complaints among Mexicans. “The 
first thing that gets hit are people’s pocketbooks.”

The timing of the protests could prove particularly troublesome as Mexico 
prepares for the impact of US president-electDonald Trump

of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and build a wall on the 
northern border –moves economists warn will throw the country into recession

.


G500, the operator of 1,800 petrol stations, warned that all of its outlets 
could close due to potential insecurity.


Some protesters said pocketbook issues and displeasure with their own 
politicians causes more consternation than anything proposed by Trump.


“We wouldn’t have to worry about Donald Trump if were a stable economy,” said 
Iván Rosales, a protester and trucking company employee. “Corruption here is 
what’s killing us.”


The outrage appears to be boosting the fortunes of populist presidential 
candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who leads polls for the 2018 election – 
and has promised to lower the price of gasoline and electricity and build five 
new refineries.


Officials say the price increase to 15.99 pesos a litre in Mexico City ($0.75) 
is necessary to cover shortfalls in the federal budget, which traditionally 
depends on oil revenues. Prices at the pump will vary across the country and be 
set on a daily basis in the future.


Environment secretary Rafael Pacchiano defended the gasolinazo 
<https://twitter.com/rafaelpacchiano/status/814495284587696128> on Twitter, 
saying the federal government couldn’t continue to subisidise gasoline, which 
mostly benefits rich SUV owners. Higher prices, he added, would encourage the 
use of green energy in Mexico.


Cheap gasoline has caused other consequences including a spike in automobile 
ownership, which has in turn contributed to severe traffic congestion –and an 
associated rise in air pollution

“We (had) a situation where these distortions have created a much greater 
consumption of gasoline over the past 10 years and have greatly increased the 
number of cars,” says David Shields, an energy analyst in Mexico City.


The deregulation in gasoline prices came about as part of an energy reform 
promoted by President Enrique Peña Nieto to reverse declining oil output by 
allowing foreign participation in what was a state-controlled sector.


Peña Nieto sold the reform with the promise of Mexicans paying less for 
energy, and people haven’t forgotten.


“People are mad because gas prices affect them directly, in their pockets,” 
said Carlos Bravo Regidor, professor at the Centre for the Teaching and 
Research in Economics. “It doesn’t matter that the gas subsidy was regressive, 
that cheap gas is bad for the environment, that public finances are under a lot 
of stress. Nothing matters. It affects them at a very direct and individual 
level they don’t seem willing to accept.”
