Juan Carlos Ferrero, who reached the semi-final of the French Open at his 
first attempt last year, further underlined his growing stature on red clay 
yesterday in the final of the Italian Open at the Foro Italico with a 3-6, 6-1, 
2-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over the world No1 Gustavo Kuerten.

It was the 21-year-old Ferrero's fourth title of the year, three of them on 
clay, and by far the biggest prize of his short career.

From the moment he entered the higher levels of the professional circuit two 
years ago, it was obvious he was something special, and last year he was an 
integral component of Spain's victorious Davis Cup team.

There is a level of natural aggression to Ferrero's play that singles him out 
from his fellow Spaniards, and the youngster has already proved himself adept 
both on hard courts and indoors, last year reaching the semi-finals of the 
Paris Indoor Open.

His serve is a formidable weapon and his forehand has the kick of a mule. 
Allied to these strengths is Ferrero's remarkable swiftness around the court, 
of which Ecuador's Nicolas Lapentti, who lost to him in Saturday's semi-final, 
remarked: "You don't have time to take a break during the rallies because Juan 
Carlos is so quick."

This was Kuerten's third successive Italian Open final. In 1999 the two-time 
French Open champion beat Pat Rafter and last year he lost to Magnus Norman, 
whom he went on to beat in the final at Roland Garros.

During the past two years, the Brazilian has been the indisputable king of 
clay and he won recently in Monte Carlo. But on this occasion, despite wrapping 
up the first set in less than half an hour, he was never totally on song, 
notably with his usually lethal backhand.
