Many of rock'n'roll's most famous decadent dalliances have taken place in 
hotels. Sure, some places may have had facelifts since the bad old days, but 
the stories of wanton mayhem hang obdurately in the air. In my book I've tried 
to give a taste of this spirit while also listing newer hotels, each of them 
with their own distinct rock'n'roll swagger. It's part whisky-soaked music 
history, part travel guide for those who'd be delighted to learn that Led 
Zeppelin once drove Harleys through their hotel lobby.

You may no longer be able to throw your TV set out of the window (it's 
probably a flatscreen screwed to the wall) or drive your Roller into the 
swimming pool, but at all these places you're sure to get more than just a 
chocolate on your pillow – and they don't all require a rock star's wallet to 
stay the night.

Rising above Los Angeles' Sunset Strip like a leviathan of Gothic glamour, the 
infamousChateau Marmont is part of the quintessential Hollywood experience (see 
longer piecehere 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/sep/28/rock-n-roll-hotels-chateau-marmont>
). Actors, musicians, writers and the affluent elite have all holed up in this 
legendary, paparazzi-free zone: James Dean hopped through a window to audition 
for Rebel Without a Cause; esteemed record producer Rick Rubin lived here for 
nine months after relocating from New York; John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili 
Peppers took up residence here in 1996, only to descend into a drug hell; 
Anthony Kiedis, also of the Chilis, recorded his vocals for By the Way in his 
room … The list goes on and on. The prices match the outrageous history though:

Andaz West Hollywood, Los Angeles
 Andaz West Hollywood 
"I am a Golden God!" It is 1975, the height of rock's heyday, and Robert 
Plant, Led Zeppelin's debonair vocalist, declares his rock star status from his 
hotel balcony. In mid- to late-70s, Led Zeppelin and their entourage held court 
over as many as six floors at a time, from which TVs and bottles of Dom 
Pérignon were dropped from windows while motorcycles were driven down hallways, 
earning the hotel the name of Riot House. However, the hotel's days of 
attracting music's prime players are not lost to history as it continues to 
attract hip new disciples, from Kelly Osbourne to Slipknot's Corey Taylor.

The Portobello, London

George Michael and the gravelly-voiced Tina Turner are among the pop stars to 
have checked in – Turner was so taken with The Portobello she bought the house 
next door – while goths Siouxsie and the Banshees and Marc Almond maintained 
their ghostly pallor hiding out at the hotel bar. And, in 1988, former 
Britpopper Damon Albarn worked behind it. Just 24 rooms make up this exclusive 
retreat, and each one evinces the possibility of unbridled indulgence. Indeed, 
Johnny Depp and Kate Moss even felt inclined to take a champagne bath together. 
And who can blame them? A freestanding claw-foot bath, embellished with 
numerous Victorian nozzles, is surely more suited for a night of decadent 
trysts than a quick solitary dip.

L'Hôtel, Paris

Chic and decadent furnishings fit for distinguished libertines no doubt lured 
the likes of Jim Morrison and Oscar Wilde, who both checked in here. When Wilde 
arrived at L'Hôtel – then known as Hôtel d'Alsace – in August 1899, it was 
considered to be something of a disreputable place. Finding it less than a 
bastion of sophistication, Wilde is said to have remarked: "Either the 
wallpaper goes, or I do." By the 1960s, however, this now-boutique hotel had 
become something of a draw for the louche upper-crust, and since then 
Al Pacino, Lenny Kravitz, Frank Sinatra and Quentin Tarantino have all passed 
through the lavish lobby.

Backstage Hotel, Amsterdam
 BackStage Hotel, Amsterdam 
Decked out in flightcase furniture and stage spotlights, the hotel has been 
designed to house touring bands in familiar surroundings. The Backstage Hotel 
promises to remain tight-lipped about who's checking in. Those wishing to prise 
the coveted guestbook from the hotel's grasp will have to make do with trying 
to decipher the autographs scrawled on the piano which sits in the 24-hour 
private bar. The Fleet Foxes, TV on the Radio, The Errors and ex-Libertines 
frontman Carl Barât have all scribbled their names round the ivories. The real 
coup for bands here, though, is the service: extended breakfast hours, free 
laundry service and staff who can take on the role of roadies. There's also 
free air guitar rental.

Sanctum Soho, London

Metallica's Kirk Hammett once remarked that he wrote the classic Enter Sandman 
<http://www.metallica.com/videos/the-videos.asp> riff at 3am thrashing at his 
guitar in his hotel room. No doubt many a budding rock star would love to 
experience such a raucous antic. Well, at Sanctum Soho, you can. In fact, you 
don't even need to have your own guitar – you can hire one from reception. 
Professing to be "London's first rock'n'roll boutique hotel", this hideaway for 
rock stars comprises just 30 rooms and is situated in London's West End. And, 
as seen on the BBC documentary Rock'n'Roll Hotel, the open-plan junior suites 
have been road-tested by Iron Maiden's drummer, Nicko McBrain.

Hard Days Night Hotel, Liverpool

As the name suggests, this hotel stands in homage to Liverpool's Fab Four. 
Located in the city's "Beatles Quarter", this Grade II-listed building's 
tribute to the city's musical heroes is evident from the off. Statues of the 
John, Paul, George and Ringo posing with guitars loom large on the Victorian 
frontage, while in the lobby you'll find a funky yellow submarine jukebox. The 
Lennon Suite, adorned with Lennon portraits,comes with white piano as in the 
Imagine video <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b7qaSxuZUg> and a price that 
includes a champagne breakfast for two. Lennon may have sung All You Need Is 
Love, but for this suite you'll need £950 per night.

Heartbreak Hotel, Memphis
 Heartbreak Hotel 
Flaunting Elvis Presley's vivacious flair from the off, the hotel's lobby is 
ablaze with retina-scorching bright reds, purples and blues, topped off with a 
scattering of faux animal prints. In keeping with the unswervingly retro, 
chintzy feel, the Elvis-themed suites have all been arranged in the same 
gung-ho fashion. The Graceland Suite is undoubtedly the most celebrated, given 
that it is an imitation Graceland mansion in diminutive form. Mirroring the 
kitsch decor of Presley's home, the suite comes complete with replica billiard 
room and "jungle room". To see the genuine articles, just cross over the road 
to the Graceland estate in all its white-columned glory.

Sunset Marquis, Los Angeles

Inside this Mediterranean-style retreat, the walls are adorned with signed 
photographs of rock deities, taken on site by famous rock photographerRoss 
Halfin <http://www.rosshalfin.com/home/intro.php>. Of those grinning down on 
us, the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, Aerosmith, Slash, Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top and 
Jeff Beck have all recorded at the hotel's plushNightBird recording studios 
<http://nightbirdrecordingstudios.com/>. Legend has it that Beck was picking 
his way through a few licks in his suite when the hotel's then manager, 
concerned about noise-levels, politely asked him to rock-out beneath the hotel 
in the garage. Said garage is now Studio A. Reaffirming the hotel's rock'n'roll 
mettle, amenities include 24-hour butler service, Jacuzzis, use of the hotel's 
Bentley and a "paparazzi diversion" service.

Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas

Sin City's Hard Rock Hotel is home to a stupefying amount of iconic 
memorabilia: Keith Richards' guitar; motorbikes that once belonged to Mötley 
Crüe's Nikki Sixx and Guns N' Roses's Matt Sorum; Prince's Purple Rain suit; 
Aerosmith's leather jackets; and Madonna's underwear. The hotel's music venue, 
the Joint, frequently has its walls rattled by the classic and the 
contemporary: from the Rolling Stones to the Black Crowes, and from Santana to 
Foo Fighters. The crowning glory, however, is the penthouse suite with its 
private bowling alley and a hot tub that overlooks the Strip.

Phoenix Hotel, San Francisco
 Phoenix Hotel 
Everyone apart from Mötley Crüe make up the motley crew listed in this hotel's 
guest book. David Bowie, REM, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, the Psychedelic 
Furs, Norah Jones, Maxïmo Park, the Killers, Bloc Party, and the Shins have all 
bunked down in one of the 44 rooms that make up this small but perfectly formed 
boutique hotel. The former motor lodge has a touch of the bizarre here and 
there in the form of bamboo xylophones and artwork made from dead birds. The 
dead-bird piece is actually a portrait of musician, actor and director Vincent 
Gallo. It was left outside his room by a smitten but surreptitious fan.

Ibiza Rocks Hotel, Ibiza

Tell your friends that you're heading off to Ibiza to stay in a rock'n'roll 
hotel and you'll probably be met with bemused looks, given that this is where 
the DJ booth has, historically, reigned supreme. Yet, at this hotel the stage 
is set for indie-rock's new shining lights: Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, Vampire 
Weekend and the Klaxons are just some of the bands to have roused the hotel's 
guests, proving this is not merely a novelty boutique hotel but one that is 
luring today's buzz bands. It holds after-show parties (incidentally, the bars 
never shut), boasts its own rehearsal studios and plays host to the bands who, 
of course, stay in the penthouse suite.
• Two night minimum stay, hostel accommodation from €19 a night, doubles from 
€36. The hotel closes on 5 October and reopens on 15 May 2012, 020-8133 3930,

The Joshua Tree Inn, California

Standing in a wild, primitive landscape, Joshua Tree offered an escape for 
rock stars from the pressures of LA's scrutinising glare. Keith Richards, the 
Eagles and Steve Earle are among those to have been lured to the solitary 
plains. However, it is the inn's connection toGram Parsons 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_Parsons> that links Joshua Tree irrevocably 
to rock'n'roll legend. In 1973, in Room 8, Gram overdosed on a 
heroin-and-cocaine speedball at the age of just 26. Just days later, Gram's 
body was already on its way to the airport to be flown to Louisiana when road 
manager and close friend Phil Kaufman elected to steal a hearse, take Gram's 
body and drive it back out to Joshua Tree to watch it burn under the desert's 
star-filled sky, as per Gram's final wishes.

Two dozen roses – half of them red, half white – are left at the door of suite 
1742 every year on the anniversary of John Lennon's death: 8 December. This act 
of veneration is carried out anonymously in remembrance of the Beatle who, from 
the bed in this suite, recorded Give Peace a Chance. Suite 1742 is now called 
the John Lennon and Yoko Ono Suite and features framed gold records,

Sheraton Gunter Hotel, San Antonio, Texas

It was in this Texan hotel that blues guitarist Robert Johnson demonstrated 
his exemplary playing on a number of recordings. Johnson had been invited to 
record his lonesome blues by producer Don Law in rooms 413 and 414, where a 
temporary studio had been set up. Hunched over his guitar, Johnson sang into a 
corner of the room, unleashing his spectral voice. However, after the first day 
of recording, Law received a phone call – Johnson had wound up in jail. Upon 
returning to the hotel to resume recording, Johnson cut only one more track: 
the famous Cross Road Blues. It was to be the track that perfectly captured the 
Delta blues spirit.

Comfort Inn Downtown, Cleveland, Ohio

If there were an award for the Hotel That Had Been Privy to the Most 
Debauchery, this Comfort Inn – formerly Swingos Celebrity Inn – would be a 
contender for the gong. Swingos' notorious reputation began in earnest when 
Elvis sashayed into the unprepossessing hotel having booked more than 100 rooms 
over three floors. By the time the King checked out, with a $20,000 bill, the 
hotel's fate had been decided. With bated breath, the hotel later welcomed the 
Who's Keith Moon, who checked in dressed as a cop before handcuffing two 
strangers together. Of its reputation, Mott the Hoople's Ian Hunter said: 
"Swingos was a place you remember checking in and out of, but you can't 
remember anything in between."

Stonover Farm, Lenox, Massachusetts
 Stonover Farm, Massachusetts 
Stonover doesn't have a lurid history peppered with casualties. In fact, 
Stonover isn't even a hotel; it's a B&B. And yes, as with most B&Bs, once 
you've sleepily wended your way down to breakfast, you'll find the buoyant 
owner masquerading as chef and cooking your morning omelette. Only the buoyant 
owner in question happens to be Tom Werman – esteemed record producer for the 
likes of Mötley Crüe, Poison, Blue Öyster Cult, Ted Nugent and Twisted Sister, 
among others. So, as you seat yourself for breakfast muffins, take the time to 
broach the subjects of jamming with Jimi Hendrix, working at Epic Records, 
overseeing the soundtrack for the film Rock Star and having 25 gold and 
platinum records.

Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok

Checking into a sumptuous suite at the Mandarin Oriental – an imposing, regal 
hotel perched on the banks of the Chao Phraya River – peroxide rocker Billy 
Idol set about cooking up a maelstrom of debauchery with an assembly of 
prostitutes. Stuffed to the gills with drugs, Idol demolished furniture, 
reduced his TV to rubble and spilt all manner of liquids on the carpets. Unable 
to restrain the spiky haired libertine, the hotel was forced to call in the 
Thai army who resorted to shooting the unhinged Billy with tranquilliser darts 
after he refused to leave his suite. He was checked out of the hotel on a 
stretcher.

Sofitel, Brisbane

A sense of buoyant calm pervades throughout this five-star luxury hotel. It is 
probably this aura of laid-back confidence that enabled an energetic Robbie 
Williams to treat guests to an impromptu performance in the piano lounge 
without causing too much hysteria. The same sense of benevolence and relaxed 
blitheness also touched Californian pop-rockers Maroon 5, as they once dished 
out free concert tickets to guests. Everyone's favourite Brummie, Ozzy 
Osbourne, has also shuffled into the Sofitel. The only animal Ozzy put inside 
his mouth during his stay was chicken, and he had it served up just like 
everybody else in the hotel: plucked and cooked.

ME Barcelona, Barcelona
 ME Barcelona001 
ME Barcelona is quickly becoming the hotspot for those who want to drink, 
dance and stay somewhere that has glamour and the cinematic allure of LA's 
sun-kissed magnetism. Yet, it's not an A-lister's hideout. Instead, being an 
achingly hip hotel means it's the musicians at rock'n'roll's acute cutting edge 
that it lures. For example, Nick Cave and fellow Bad Seed Warren Ellis have 
been spotted eating lunch here, while noise-rocker Bradford Cox (vocalist for 
Deerhunter) and instrumental experimentalists Explosions in the Sky have also 
been seen loitering in fashionably cool repose. In other words, this is a place 
where it's OK to wear your shades indoors.
