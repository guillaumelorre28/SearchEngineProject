Ana Ivanovic has fuelled rumours of retirement by announcing she will reveal 
“important” news on Wednesday. The former world No1 posted a cryptic message on 
Twitter, saying: “My dear fans & supporters. Pls tune in to my Facebook page 
tomorrow at 6pm UK time, where I’ll be sharing something important with you 
live.”

There has been speculation in recent years about Ivanovic’s future in the 
sport, with the Serb struggling to replicate the form that secured her only 
grand slam title at the French Open in 2008.

The 29-year-old had a particularly tough 2016 season, winning 15 matches all 
year, the most recent in June, and slipping to 63rd in the rankings.

After enduring a fifth successive defeat in the opening round of the US Open 
in August 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/02/us-open-amelie-mauresmo-ana-ivanovic-out>
, Ivanovic insisted she was not thinking of retiring, saying: “I just need to 
really see why is this happening. I had struggles throughout my career. I had 
some tough times. This is not the first time I’m going through this. It just 
hurts because I know what I invested.”

A few days later Ivanovic, who married the Manchester United midfielder 
Bastian Schweinsteiger in the summer, announced she was ending her season early 
to allow wrist and toe injuries to fully heal.

But she vowed to return, saying: “I had to make this difficult decision so 
that I can fully recover and play injury-free next year. I can’t wait to play 
again and be back on court fully fit in 2017.”

Ivanovic posted pictures of herself back in training in November and was one 
of the highest-profile players to compete in this year’s International Premier
Tennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> League in Asia. She is due to 
begin the new season at the ASB Classic in Auckland, starting on 2 January, and 
is also on the entry list for the Australian Open.
