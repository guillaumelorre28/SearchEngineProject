Zombie Apocalypse Store

This store's mission is grave but simple: zombies are on the brink of a 
massive world attack and we must prepare by purchasing 500lbs of freeze-dried 
food, stun guns, tasers and maybe a sword. OK, the guys who run this wacky 
store on an unwacky stretch of Spring Mountain Road don't believe in zombies 
per se, but they do believe in zombies as metaphor. "To some people zombies are 
the government, to some people they're terrorists or outsiders. We just want 
people to be prepared," says owner Mike Monko. His new venture is tucked into 
the corner of his old venture, which sells artificial lawn supplies. When we 
visited, Monko displayed a video of himself stun-gunning his business partner's 
adult son.

Toy Shack

Many religions – Hot Wheels <http://uk.hotwheels.com/>, Simpsons' figurines, 
original porcelain Madame Alexandra dolls – but just one Mecca: the Las Vegas 
Toy Shack not only has thousands of toys packed into its brand new space in a 
Fremont Street mini-mall, it also has acres of warehouse space, full of more 
toys. "We can't keep the stuff on the shelves," says manager Boyd Fiedler, who 
is at least 40 years past adolescence and estimates his own Hot Wheels 
collection is worth about $5,000. "During a recession, people like to escape to 
a simpler time." If you don't see it, the Toy Shack will find it for you. And 
if they don't, you can throw a tantrum.

Pits 'n' Wieners
 Pits and Wieners, Las Vegas. 
You're leaving Vegas tomorrow and all you managed to get for a picky friend is 
a CSI: Las Vegas travel mug. Fail. You need something that says Vegas without 
literally saying Vegas. You need to go to Pits and Wieners in downtown's
Emergency Arts <http://www.emergencyartslv.com/>, where several mini-galleries 
and shops occupy the examining rooms of a former medical clinic (theBeat Cafe 
<http://www.thebeatlv.com/> takes up what was the larger waiting room area). 
Pits and Wieners sells rosaries, T-shirts, digital block prints, featuring one 
of two creatures: pits (pit bulls) and wieners (dachshunds). Artist Sophie 
Duncan opened this place earlier this year as a way to "say thanks to the two 
dogs that have so positively impacted my life". Awwww!

Bonanza

Make no mistake – this is perhaps the world's largest gift shop but it is 
definitely not the world's most high-quality or classy gift shop. That said, if 
you find yourself excited or amused by the idea of either owning or passing 
onto a fellow human a Vegas backscratcher, a Vegas Christmas ornament, a Vegas 
piggybank, cheap Native American jewellery, or a white tiger made out of 
felt-covered porcelain sitting on a driftwood base, then Bonanza's for you. I 
imagine this is the type of place where some people browse for hours while 
their friends or spouses sob quietly in the car.

Who needs museums when you've got the White Cross Drugstore? In the shadow of 
the Stratosphere Hotel, this 74-year old drugstore (which likely survives by 
supplying morning-after pills and Bactrim to tourists) is a wonderful step back 
in time – to a day when drugstores had lunch counters, an entire display of 
no-nonsense pantyhose (they even have knee highs) and not one "natural" or 
"organic" bottle of shampoo. An awesome and cheap place to get gifts for all 
your ironic friends who think there's nothing in the world more wonderful than 
a shot glass with their name on it, a wet 'n' wild brand lip gloss or a box of 
Russell Stover candies.

So, Vegas has not merely whetted your appetite for gambling, it has made you 
ravenous, and you've decided, alas, this particular sin will not stay in Vegas. 
Just a short drive from the Strip there's everything you need to service an 
at-home gambling addiction: cards, chips, roulette wheels, slot machines – hey, 
if it can't separate your friends and neighbours from a significant portion of 
their paychecks, the Gambler's General Store doesn't sell it. It costs a mere 
£300 to ship a vintage slot machine to London – you could make that back in a 
weekend.

Hahn's Army Surplus
 Hahn's Army Surplus. 
On its website, right under a very large American flag Hahn's proclaims: "For 
more than 35 years, Hahn's World of Surplus has been the one-stop shop for all 
your military and surplus needs." If you now say to yourself: "I don't have any 
military or surplus needs," well, think again. OK, maybe you don't need a gas 
mask, or a T-shirt that says, "To Err is Human To Forgive Divine – Neither of 
which is US Marine Corps Policy"! Maybe you don't even need the pamphlet Hand 
to Hand Fighting or the bookConquer Terror: How to Survive the Attack 
<http://www.amazon.com/Conquer-Terror-How-Survive-Attack/dp/0938263277>. But 
your bathroom does.

Rainbow Feather Dyeing Company

Such a humble place, on a lonely street in the arts district, yet what beauty 
comes from it. Rainbow Feather Dyeing Company started in Burbank in 1964, but 
the need for the weightless downy medium of coloured feathers grew with 
Strip-show culture, so in 1993, they moved here. The Cirque de Soleil gets all 
its feathers here. Hawaiians have bought millions of them to make their 
traditional leis. Tourists buy mostly boas, says Jim Favazzo, whose wife Jodi 
is the owner. Canadians, he reports, really love feathers. Favazzo seems 
unfazed that he is a straight man who has spent his life selling multicoloured 
feathers. "Everything has its time," Favazzo confides.

There's a lot of pressure in Vegas to be super cool. It's unfortunate, but 
it's nothing that a comic book won't fix. Ralph Mathieu has operated this store 
for 17 years, 16 years nearby and one at this new space, in the same Eastside 
neighbourhood . His philosophy remains: superheroes are fine, but comics can 
tell any kind of story. Two recent genre busters are:Scott Chantler's Two 
Generals <http://www.amazon.co.uk/Two-Generals-Scott-Chantler/dp/0771019580>, 
about the Highland Light Infantry of Canada during the second world war and
Alissa Torres's American Widow 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Widow-Alissa-Torres/dp/0345500695>, about her 
husband, who died at the World Trade Centre on 9/11.

You'd really love to own a piece of original art but you don't have any money. 
Well, do you have five bucks? Sure, you have five bucks. Take the escalator to 
the 2nd or 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, put $5 into the refurbished 
cigarette machines, and get yourself some art. Perhaps it will be a leather 
wristband with a whimsical drawing or a photograph, or a tiny painting on a 
block of wood. The important thing is that this project to put real art from up 
and coming artists into the hands of the masses has worked, and you're an art 
owner now.
