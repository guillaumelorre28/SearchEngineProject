Mauricio Pochettino has Tottenham flying. They have six straight wins in all 
competitions and are playing the sort of football that took them close to the 
title last season. But West Brom are something of a bogey team and it was 
Tottenham’s failure to beat them at the end of last season that effectively 
derailed their title challenge. Pochettino knows that Albion will make life 
extremely difficult.David Hytner
