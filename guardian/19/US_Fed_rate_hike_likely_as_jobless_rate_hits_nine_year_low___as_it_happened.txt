2.22pm GMT 14:22  <> 

And over in Greece, scores of disabled protestors have been taking to the 
streets as the governing coalition rushes to complete reforms ahead of Monday’s 
crucial meeting of euro zone finance ministers. 

Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens:

Once again the eurozone’s weakest link is in a race-against-the clock to 
complete reforms demanded by creditors keeping the debt-stricken country 
afloat. Hopes had been high that passage of the ‘prior actions” – contingent 
for the conclusion of a second review of the bailed out Greek economy – would 
have been concluded in time for Monday’s meeting, the last gathering of euro 
zone finance ministers this year. For prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ 
government, December 5th has been marked as the date debt relief talks could 
finally start.

Instead, the leftist-led coalition has been faced with the daunting task of 
endorsing yet more austerity, the price of participation of the International 
Monetary Fund in Greece’s third, 86 bn euro rescue programme. Today’s 
protestors, rallying outside the prime ministers offices, are among the 
thousands who will be hit by cuts expected to apply as of the New Year.

But in a move interpreted as an olive branch, the German finance ministry 
announced today that the euro group would also discuss possible short-term debt 
measures for Greece at Monday’s meeting. The IMF has long said that euro zone 
countries must give Greece “upfront, unconditional” debt relief to make it debt 
burden sustainable and allow the Washington-based organisation to take part in 
its bailout programme. At over 300 bn euro or 180 percent of GDP, Athens has by 
far the highest debt load in the EU. The IMF would consider 120 percent to be 
manageable.

And Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said:

With a December hike in the Fed Funds rate fully priced into markets, the 
latest set of payrolls would have to have been extremely weak to impact 
expectations.

We expect the Fed to hike rates on December 14th and the market will move on 
to speculating on the timing and direction of the next move. With rising 
treasury yields impacting mortgage rates, other central banks still easing 
policy, and uncertainty over the scale and timing of any Trumpflation stimulus, 
we expect the Fed to remain cautious with the pace of rate hikes next year.”

2.20pm GMT 14:20  <> 

Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said:

The decline in the unemployment rate to a new cyclical low of 4.6% last month, 
from 4.9% was due to a combination of a 160,000 increase in the household 
survey measure of employment together with a 226,000 decline in the labour 
force. The number of involuntary part-time workers fell by 220,000. As a 
result, the U6 unemployment dropped to an eight-year low of 9.3%, from 9.5%. 
The upshot is that the labour market appears to be approaching full employment.

That said, the 0.1% m/m decline in average hourly earnings, which pushed the 
annual growth rate back down to 2.5%, from 2.8%, suggests that there is still a 
little slack left for the Fed to play with.

A December rate hike is coming and, assuming that we see a major fiscal 
stimulus passed in the first half of next year, we expect an additional 100 
basis points of tightening from the Fed next year, taking the fed funds target 
range to between 1.50% and 1.75% by end-2017.”

Returning to the US economy, Alex Lydall, head of dealing at Foenix Partners, 
has a slightly different take on the labour market data.

A rate hike in December is unlikely to be derailed from the afternoon’s jobs 
report, but a poor wages number does give Janet Yellen food for thought. The 
headline figure of 178k was solid - along with a significant decrease in the 
Unemployment rate to 4.6% - but the premise of extra fiscal stimulus in a Trump 
era and letting wages naturally increase as the Fed have reiterated, could 
leave Yellen pondering future hikes if wages stutter.

We are still likely to see a 0.25 hike this month, but the speed of next 
year’s recovery could be impacted if wages and participation rates continue to 
cause a headache. With risk appetite bullish from the OPEC agreement this week, 
the greenback could likely see some short-term weakness against the majors, 
with the notable exception of the risk associated this weekend with the Italian 
Referendum.”

Meanwhile, my colleague Katie Allen writes:

The Bank of England 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/bankofenglandgovernor> should be wary of 
rushing into interest rate rises to curb inflation, according to its chief 
economist, in a warning that the UK economy is vulnerable to a sharper slowdown 
next year than current forecasts would suggest.

Andy Haldane said he was comfortable with the Bank’s current wait-and-see 
stance on borrowing costs as it weighs up the conflicting forces of a lower 
pound stoking inflation and the Brexit vote denting business confidence.

Here is some instant reaction to the US jobs data. Nancy Curtin, chief 
investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said:


Today’s positive US job figures, coming on the back of good economic numbers 
across the board, will further increase the odds of a rate rise at the next Fed 
meeting in mid-December. The healthy labour market mirrors the momentum we’ve 
seen in the economy since the summer, which has enjoyed strong PMI figures in 
both services and manufacturing. However, crucially, the participation rate has 
not risen, which may take some of the shine off these figures for the Fed.

With the US presidential election suspense now behind us, it is Yellen’s 
rhetoric which will be of most interest to investors as they look ahead at what 
to expect in the new Trump era next year. If as expected, we see a swing 
towards fiscal stimulus, this may give the Fed greater scope to hike rates 
further in 2017. Fed decision making will no longer be solely data dependent, 
but policy dependent also.”

The 178,000 increase in new jobs was slightly better than expected. Economists 
had pencilled in 175,000 jobs and an unchanged jobless rate of 4.9%.

However, wage growth has slowed. Average hourly earnings fell 3 cents, or 
0.1%, after rising 0.4% in October. This lowered the year-on-year growth rate 
to 2.5% in November from 2.8% in October, which was the biggest increase in 
nearly 7 1/2 years.

2.5%y/y growth in earnings, down from 2.8%. Wage growth just isn't properly 
igniting despite apparent labour market tightening.

My colleague Sean Farrell has found out more. The owners have sold the 
property in Whitechapel to an undisclosed buyer, will leave in May 2017 and are 
in talks about what will happen to the business. It looks like it could be sold 
– so it is likely to continue as a business.

Britain's oldest bell foundry to close

Britain’s oldest bell foundry which made Big Ben and the Liberty Bell in 
Philadelphia, is closing. Whitechapel Bell Foundry, which traces itself back to 
Elizabethan times and says it is the UK’s oldest manufacturing company, said 
the decision was “in response to the changing realities of running a business 
of this kind”.

The firm was set up in 1570 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and is one 
of two remaining bell foundries in the UK. It has changed ownership several 
times and moved sites. The foundry says it is listed in the Guinness Book of 
Records as the UK’s oldest manufacturing company in continuous operation.

Owners Alan and Kathryn Hughes said, according to the Daily Telegraph

We have made this decision with a heavy heart, but in response to the changing 
realities of running a business of this kind. The Bell Foundry in Whitechapel 
has changed hands many times, but it has always been a family business.

My own family has owned the foundry since 1904, but other families have run

Brent crude oil has reversed earlier declines and risen above $54. It is now

And over in Greece, scores of disabled protestors have been taking to the 
streets as the governing coalition rushes to complete reforms ahead of Monday’s 
crucial meeting of euro zone finance ministers. 

Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens:

Once again the eurozone’s weakest link is in a race-against-the clock to 
complete reforms demanded by creditors keeping the debt-stricken country 
afloat. Hopes had been high that passage of the ‘prior actions” – contingent 
for the conclusion of a second review of the bailed out Greek economy – would 
have been concluded in time for Monday’s meeting, the last gathering of euro 
zone finance ministers this year. For prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ 
government, December 5th has been marked as the date debt relief talks could 
finally start.

Instead, the leftist-led coalition has been faced with the daunting task of 
endorsing yet more austerity, the price of participation of the International 
Monetary Fund in Greece’s third, 86 bn euro rescue programme. Today’s 
protestors, rallying outside the prime ministers offices, are among the 
thousands who will be hit by cuts expected to apply as of the New Year.

But in a move interpreted as an olive branch, the German finance ministry 
announced today that the euro group would also discuss possible short-term debt 
measures for Greece at Monday’s meeting. The IMF has long said that euro zone 
countries must give Greece “upfront, unconditional” debt relief to make it debt 
burden sustainable and allow the Washington-based organisation to take part in 
its bailout programme. At over 300 bn euro or 180 percent of GDP, Athens has by 
far the highest debt load in the EU. The IMF would consider 120 percent to be 
manageable.
 
And Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said:

With a December hike in the Fed Funds rate fully priced into markets, the 
latest set of payrolls would have to have been extremely weak to impact 
expectations.

We expect the Fed to hike rates on December 14th and the market will move on 
to speculating on the timing and direction of the next move. With rising 
treasury yields impacting mortgage rates, other central banks still easing 
policy, and uncertainty over the scale and timing of any Trumpflation stimulus, 
we expect the Fed to remain cautious with the pace of rate hikes next year.”
 
Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said:

The decline in the unemployment rate to a new cyclical low of 4.6% last month, 
from 4.9% was due to a combination of a 160,000 increase in the household 
survey measure of employment together with a 226,000 decline in the labour 
force. The number of involuntary part-time workers fell by 220,000. As a 
result, the U6 unemployment dropped to an eight-year low of 9.3%, from 9.5%. 
The upshot is that the labour market appears to be approaching full employment.

That said, the 0.1% m/m decline in average hourly earnings, which pushed the 
annual growth rate back down to 2.5%, from 2.8%, suggests that there is still a 
little slack left for the Fed to play with.

A December rate hike is coming and, assuming that we see a major fiscal 
stimulus passed in the first half of next year, we expect an additional 100 
basis points of tightening from the Fed next year, taking the fed funds target 
range to between 1.50% and 1.75% by end-2017.”
 
Returning to the US economy, Alex Lydall, head of dealing at Foenix Partners, 
has a slightly different take on the labour market data.

A rate hike in December is unlikely to be derailed from the afternoon’s jobs 
report, but a poor wages number does give Janet Yellen food for thought. The 
headline figure of 178k was solid - along with a significant decrease in the 
Unemployment rate to 4.6% - but the premise of extra fiscal stimulus in a Trump 
era and letting wages naturally increase as the Fed have reiterated, could 
leave Yellen pondering future hikes if wages stutter.

We are still likely to see a 0.25 hike this month, but the speed of next 
year’s recovery could be impacted if wages and participation rates continue to 
cause a headache. With risk appetite bullish from the OPEC agreement this week, 
the greenback could likely see some short-term weakness against the majors, 
with the notable exception of the risk associated this weekend with the Italian 
Referendum.”
 
Meanwhile, my colleague Katie Allen writes:

The Bank of England 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/bankofenglandgovernor> should be wary of 
rushing into interest rate rises to curb inflation, according to its chief 
economist, in a warning that the UK economy is vulnerable to a sharper slowdown 
next year than current forecasts would suggest.

Andy Haldane said he was comfortable with the Bank’s current wait-and-see 
stance on borrowing costs as it weighs up the conflicting forces of a lower 
pound stoking inflation and the Brexit vote denting business confidence.

Here is some instant reaction to the US jobs data. Nancy Curtin, chief 
investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said:


Today’s positive US job figures, coming on the back of good economic numbers 
across the board, will further increase the odds of a rate rise at the next Fed 
meeting in mid-December. The healthy labour market mirrors the momentum we’ve 
seen in the economy since the summer, which has enjoyed strong PMI figures in 
both services and manufacturing. However, crucially, the participation rate has 
not risen, which may take some of the shine off these figures for the Fed.

With the US presidential election suspense now behind us, it is Yellen’s 
rhetoric which will be of most interest to investors as they look ahead at what 
to expect in the new Trump era next year. If as expected, we see a swing 
towards fiscal stimulus, this may give the Fed greater scope to hike rates 
further in 2017. Fed decision making will no longer be solely data dependent, 
but policy dependent also.”
 
Looking at a breakdown by sector, manufacturing jobs fell by 4,000 last month, 
the fourth monthly decline. Construction rose by 19,000 jobs following a 14,000 
gain in October, and retail jobs fell for the second month in a row, by 8,300.
 
As the US economy approaches full employment, monthly job gains have slowed 
from an average of 229,000 in 2015 to an average of 180,000 this year.
 
The 178,000 increase in new jobs was slightly better than expected. Economists 
had pencilled in 175,000 jobs and an unchanged jobless rate of 4.9%.

However, wage growth has slowed. Average hourly earnings fell 3 cents, or 
0.1%, after rising 0.4% in October. This lowered the year-on-year growth rate 
to 2.5% in November from 2.8% in October, which was the biggest increase in 
nearly 7 1/2 years.

2.5%y/y growth in earnings, down from 2.8%. Wage growth just isn't properly 
igniting despite apparent labour market tightening.

The jobless rate hit 4.6%, the lowest in more than nine years, making it a 
near certainty that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its 
meeting on 14 December. The jobs report comes after a run of strong economic 
data.
 
Breaking news: nonfarm payrolls show 178,000 new jobs were created in the US 
economy last month, compared with 142,000 in October (revised lower from 
161,000).
 
My colleague Sean Farrell has found out more. The owners have sold the 
property in Whitechapel to an undisclosed buyer, will leave in May 2017 and are 
in talks about what will happen to the business. It looks like it could be sold 
– so it is likely to continue as a business.
 
Britain’s oldest bell foundry which made Big Ben and the Liberty Bell in 
Philadelphia, is closing. Whitechapel Bell Foundry, which traces itself back to 
Elizabethan times and says it is the UK’s oldest manufacturing company, said 
the decision was “in response to the changing realities of running a business 
of this kind”.

The firm was set up in 1570 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and is one 
of two remaining bell foundries in the UK. It has changed ownership several 
times and moved sites. The foundry says it is listed in the Guinness Book of 
Records as the UK’s oldest manufacturing company in continuous operation.

Owners Alan and Kathryn Hughes said, according to the Daily Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/02/britains-oldest-bell-foundry-cast-big-ben-close/>
:

We have made this decision with a heavy heart, but in response to the changing 
realities of running a business of this kind. The Bell Foundry in Whitechapel 
has changed hands many times, but it has always been a family business.

My own family has owned the foundry since 1904, but other families have run 
the firm through its history, which stretches back to 1570.”

A statement posted on the firm’s website suggests that perhaps the company 
will reopen somewhere else.

Whitechapel Bell Foundry Ltd announces, with regret, that by May 2017 it will 
cease its activities at the Whitechapel Road site that it has occupied since 
its move there in 1738.

The company intends to complete work on all projects presently in hand during 
the coming months. It will not be entering into new contracts for the time 
being whilst discussions with the company’s staff and other interested parties 
regarding the future direction, ownership, and location of the company are 
ongoing.”
