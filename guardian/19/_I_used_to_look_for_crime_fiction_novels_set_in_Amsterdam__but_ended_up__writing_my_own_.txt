The Netherlands is a famously flat country, more than a quarter of which is 
below sea level, and it’s not rich in natural resources, which meant the Dutch 
learned to trade early on. The resulting canal belt of Amsterdam is 
extraordinary. Make sure you look up when strolling the streets; the former 
merchants’ houses are very beautiful. You’ll see many ahijshaak (lifting 
hook/beam projecting from roof lines) used to winch goods to higher floors of 
narrow properties – they were originally taxed on the width of street frontage. 
True to Calvinist traditional, ground floor curtains are typically left open – 
a declaration of their owners having nothing to hide.

 Daniel Pembrey 
When I started visiting Amsterdam regularly a decade ago, I used to look for 
crime fiction novels set here and translated into English – but ended up 
writing my own! It involved doing research with the Dutch police force; I even 
went on an undercover operation with them in the Red Light District. Generally, 
it’s a safe city, but any port as big as Amsterdam’s attracts a good slice of 
criminality.

My fictional detective, Henk van der Pol, has his own houseboat in the 
docklands area of the city, which is his beat. Book one starts in the 
backstreets of the adjacent Red Light District.

The best way to get about is by bike, but wearing a cycle helmet here is 
considered uncool. Fortunately, given the number of cycle lanes and the status 
accorded bike riders, you should be safe enough. But remember that wobbling 
foreign cyclists can be as frustrating to locals going about their daily 
business as people standing on the left side of escalators in London tube 
stations. There’s a growing debate about the costs and benefits of tourism: a 
city of 835,000 received more than 17 million visitors last year.


For really good-value, authentic eating go to a haring stall such as Kras 
Haring, beside Oosterkerk on Wittenburgergracht. The fresh herring there is 
prepared and served like sushi, packed with proteins and vitamins, and costs 
just a couple of euros.

A fun and unusual food location is De Hallen <http://dehallen-amsterdam.nl/en/>
, a former tram depot. Twenty or so stalls offer everything from Dutch 
bitterballen (deep-fried meaty snacks) to Vietnamese street food. It’s in 
Bellamyplein, to the west of the city centre. On the same site is theFilmhallen 
<https://www.filmhallen.nl/> arthouse cinema, which includes the beautiful art 
deco Parisien Room, formerly belonging to one of the oldest film theatres in 
Amsterdam. You can even stay on site, at the boutiqueHotel de Hallen 
<https://www.hoteldehallen.com/en>.

Try genever gin as a beer chaser, as my detective does. This is sometimes 
referred to as a kopstoot (headbutt)

Genever gin is very old, predating the British variant and giving rise to the 
expression Dutch courage. It is an acquired taste, but you can savour it in one 
of the scenic harbourside bars such as De Druif (Rapenburg 83), my favourite. 
You can also try it as a beer chaser, as my detective occasionally does. This 
is sometimes referred to as akopstoot (headbutt).

To appreciate how refined genever can be, visit Van Wees distillery 
<http://www.de-ooievaar.nl/> in the nearby Jordaan district, where they have 
been making it for centuries. Owner Fenny van Wees recently perfected a single, 
old grain version – Mirakel van Amsterdam (‘miracle from Amsterdam’), well 
worth experiencing.

One of my favourite museums is the Ons’ Lieve Heer op Solder 
<https://www.opsolder.nl/en> (Our Lord in the Attic), a 17th-century house 
which hid an ornate Catholic church in its upper level in the time it was 
prohibited to celebrate mass. Another is theNational Maritime Museum 
<https://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl/>, which showcases Holland’s seafaring 
heritage – plus a glass ceiling to rival the British Museum’s. Like Britain, 
this is a country mulling its extraordinary past, current place in the world, 
and what the future may bring.
