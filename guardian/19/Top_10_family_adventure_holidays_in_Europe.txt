Cycling, Austrian Tyrol


With dramatic mountains all around, this self-guided cycling holiday with 
Saddle Skedaddle starting in Fügen (closest airport Innsbruck, 40 minutes’ 
drive) is along quiet cycle paths in the Tyrolean valleys. It can either be a 
relaxed introduction to family cycling or faster-paced, depending on the routes 
chosen each day – though all cyclists will want to ride to the dramatic gorge at
Wolfsklamm 
<http://www.tyrol.com/things-to-do/attractions/all-attractions/a-wolfsklamm-gorge>
 and swim in the lakes of Krummsee and Reintalersee. Kids will love the Black 
Hole water slide at theZillertal Thermal Baths 
<http://www.tyrol.tl/en/highlights/thermal-baths-water-worlds/erlebnistherme-zillertal/>
, plus a trip to theKufstein fortress

In the shadow of sequoias, deep in Scotland’s Big Tree Country, is the 
18th-century mansion of Dalguise (30 minutes’ drive north of Perth, two hours 
from Glasgow), once the summer home of Beatrix Potter. Peter Rabbit-loving kids 
will recognise the manager’s centre as the home of Mrs Tiggy-Winkle. Now its 50 
acres of formal gardens and mature woodland, by the river Tay, are the setting 
for family adventures ranging from zipwiring and tree climbing, to abseiling, 
canoeing, rock climbing, and mountain biking. There’s also an indoor sports 
dome for rainy days, and family and kids’ entertainment in the evenings.
• Seven nights from £409 adult, £349 child, full-board, including activities,

Galloping, or just trotting, on horseback along a beach while Atlantic waves 
crash in is an exhilarating experience. This farm in County Sligo, right by the 
sea, runs family holidays for intermediate riders and above, aged 12-plus, with 
riding every day. Trek along the lanes, past lakes, waterfalls, historic houses 
and mountain backdrops, too.

If your kids love the climbing wall back home, try them on the real thing on 
the sunny Costa Blanca, where the limestone sea cliffs and mountain crags 
provide a perfect and varied learning setting. Rock and Sun tailors holidays to 
level and age – for younger children one morning session a day is often enough. 
The beaches at Calp are great to relax on when not climbing. Nearest airport is 
Alicante, 40 miles away.
• From £699pp a week self-catering, including transfers and guidance for 
adults and children aged 7+. Discounts for non-climbing family members and 
children under 7,rockandsun.com

For the ultimate family slow travel experience, paddle down the Klarälven 
river in Sweden, averaging just 2km per hour. The serpentine meanderings, and 
Värmland landscape of forests, small villages and farmland are a delight. The 
river is wide and mellow, so this trip is suitable for children of all ages, as 
long as they’re keen to wild camp on the river’s banks. You can stop whenever 
you want to hike in the forest and be sure to look out for beavers around the 
banks and shallows. An adventure yes, but a peaceful one. The starting point is

about four hours from Oslo or Stockholm by train to Karlstad then bus.

Many of us yearn to get back to nature but lack practical experience. Family 
Bushcraft Camp is a great place to start. Based in the Parc-le-Breos on the 
Gower peninsula, the camp is surrounded by woodland and is just 20 minutes’ 
walk from beautiful Oxwich beach. Activities include nature walks, shelter 
building, fire lighting, willow craft and tracking. And there’s a special focus 
on coastal foraging and wild cooking, so visitors can whip up a gourmet storm 
on a campfire.
• Adult £90, child £30, including sleeping on hammocks and shelters or bring 
your own tent, local accommodation can be arranged at extra cost, weekend 27-28 
August (bespoke group bookings taken for other weekends),dryadbushcraft.co.uk

Having kids doesn’t mean giving up doing the things you love, just bring them 
along so they can get excited about them too. Surf camps and hostels are 
getting more family-friendly as are yoga retreats, and places such as Karma 
Surf Retreat (near Cascais, just outside Lisbon) combine the two for parents 
and kids over six, and childcare is also available.
• From €665pp a week self-catering, including twice-daily surf and yoga
