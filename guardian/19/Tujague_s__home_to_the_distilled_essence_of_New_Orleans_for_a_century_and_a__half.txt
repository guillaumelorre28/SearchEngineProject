Music and singing are tangible entities in New Orleans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans>. In Tujague’s, the atoms that 
go in and out of human lungs haven’t changed that much since 1856.


 In the restaurant, 21st century guests inhale and then exhale the same air as 
the first crabbers, shrimpers and oystermen who stood at the wide cypress plank 
bar a century and a half ago. In the room-sized mirror behind the bar that was 
already 90 years old when it was shipped over from Paris, there remain the 
smiling faces of those good working men.

 You can walk out the door, but you can’t walk out of the past here, so you 
might as well resign yourself to living in it. Even the gutters in the street 
outside are significant to the world’s history, bars of dense stone that came 
over as ballast in the holds of 19th century British ships arriving to be 
emptied of granite, then refilled with the Louisiana cotton that sustained UK 
factories.

 I first placed my foot on Tujague’s brass rail almost half a century ago. On 
the day after high school graduation, dressed in torn black jeans and a very, 
very early silkscreened Grateful Dead T-shirt, I would have never believed I 
would one day find myself 67 years old, standing in the same place. But sure 
enough, here I am, looking in the wall of mirror at the fellow with the wide 
grey streaks in his hair and conservative adult clothes on his bones.

 Everything in this neighborhood is old. Vieux Carré does not romantically 
mean “French Quarter”, as so many visitors believe. It means “Old Square”. And 
here I wander, appropriately enough, now as old and square as they come.

 This building lived an entire life as a Spanish armory before Guillame 
Tujague arrived from Mazzeroles, France, to open a restaurant within the 
two-foot-thick brick and stucco walls. Ceiling fans that once ran off DC 
electricity are now converted to more modern power, but move just as crankily 
as they did during Prohibition.

 Even the black-and-white tile floor’s surface rolls in noticeable grooves 
like the rising swell of a morning sea, the result of a decade of decades of 
dockworkers, sailors, and butchers making their way to the bar to stand and 
raise glasses in camaraderie. This is indeed the sovereign “standing” bar of 
the city.

 I enter. Dollene the bartender and Steve the owner are waiting, ears and 
minds still alert for the closing dialogue of the latest episode of their own 
inventedtelenovela, Local Boy Tells All. They suspect I have Woman Trouble. The 
last lines of any imaginary drama have, however, already passed from my mind. 
Credits are rolling, and I really would just like to request a bourbon.

 The radio soundtrack continues underneath, the local community radio station 
broadcast over tinny, ceiling-mounted speakers:“… you treat me wrong now, my 
love is strong now …”

 Inside Tujague’s. Photograph: Jim Gabour 
 A fresh drink is placed on a napkin in front of me before I am halfway to my 
leaning spot at the long cypress plank. Steve is staring at the closed barroom 
door and the street beyond. But now he sets his mouth and shakes his head, he 
lowers his eyes and walks toward the kitchen, mumbling during that passage. The 
word “woman” is heard amid the consonant sounds of his voice.

 It is just another fine Monday afternoon in New Orleans. A time to stand and 
have a toddy with friends at Tujague’s. And forget the rest of life.

 Weekday regular Mad Dog Salvatano re-enters the room and walks right up to 
me: “I myself wouldn’ta normally be tellin’ ya this, Jimbo, but you know, I 
just this mornin’ found out somethin’…” the Dog pausing for an oratorical drum 
roll, then, “… that this non-violence shitreally pays off.”

 This from the mouth of the infamous “Mad Dog”, semi-retired bookie and 
gambler extraordinaire.

 I make note of the occasion immediately on to a cocktail napkin. I figure to 
research this occurrence later to see if some heavy-metal, planet-oozing 
radiation has slipped from orbit, my reasoning being that there must be some 
cause for what I had just heard. Contradiction on such a cosmic scale does not 
often occur without a substantial prompt.

 And the Dog was not known as a master of self-restraint in any portion of his 
life. Thus, his name. This man is embracing non-violence?

 He has more to say.

 “Yeah, me and my lady we was watching Gandhi last night …” 

 Another slip in the universe.

 “… and there he was in prison …”

 This I know the Dog can relate to. 

 “… wearing a uniform with the numbers 189 on the pocket.”

 OK …

 “So I got up right then and there and drove to the Cracker Barrel mini-mart 
and put a buck on the Lotto Quick Pick 3, betting the numbers 1, 8 & 9 …”

 Oh, no.

 “I tell the cashier where I got my numbers, and she’s cute and laughs. Seems 
to like me, I mean, but who doesn’t? Who can resist the Dog in his prime? 
Though she has these dimples, which are making me crazy. Nobody else in the 
joint. So I buy us each a beer out the cooler, and we have a little talk about 
this philosophy stuff. We drink a second beer. Almost no customers comin’ in, 
you know, on a Sunday night. Even let me sit behind the counter with her while 
we was sipping our brews. Very classy dame. I got her number.

 “Then I figured I’d go finish the movie and get some more of the scoop, but 
by the time I get home, this Gandhi guy is dead, and Linda smells somebody 
else’s perfume on me and asks me where I been and isn’t any too hot about 
giving me a recap of the plot.

 “I figure it can wait and go to bed. Alone.

 “So I get up this morning, look at the paper, and sure enough, there it is: 
the Quick Pick 3 winning numbers are 189. Natch. I won me $500 because a dead 
Indian went to jail in South Africa. I’m gonna watch that movie all the way 
through tonight. Maybe he sent me some more messages, hunh?” He drains his 
glass with a loud emphatic slurp. His extended idea of ending communication.

 I add that last likelihood to my notes. “The Dog looks to Gandhi for 
messages,” I write, albeit in handwriting that bears no small resemblance to 
Sanskrit.

 Looking at the wadded, marker-stained cocktail napkin, I decide to add the 
flimsy piece of paper to my new home’s mojo altar. My thinking: “It’s best to 
pay attention when these things happen, and I am.”

 Gandhi probably did, too.

 The momentary gap in reality closes as the Dog pats me on the back, orders 
another Crown & Seven, and ambles over to his regular sunlit seat.

 The radio: “… my love is strong now …”
