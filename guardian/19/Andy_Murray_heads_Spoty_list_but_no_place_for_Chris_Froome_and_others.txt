Andy Murray heads an expanded 16-strong shortlist for the BBC Sports 
Personality of the Year Award, which is predictably dominated by Britain’s 
Olympic and Paralympic stars. But there is no place for thetriple Tour de 
France winner Chris Froome

 or Sir Bradley Wiggins, whose exploits in Rio made him the most decorated 
British athlete in Olympic history.

, the favourite to win a third award, will again miss the awards ceremony in 
Birmingham on 18 December because he will be in Miami preparing for the 
Australian Open. The BBC’s decision to increase the shortlist from 12 names to 
16 means a record number of gold medal-winning Olympians will be in attendance, 
including the triathlete Alistair Brownlee, the husband and wife cyclists Jason 
and Laura Kenny, the boxer Nicola Adams and the athlete Mo Farah. The gymnast 
Max Whitlock, the GB hockey captain Kate Richardson-Walsh, the swimmer Adam 
Peaty and the showjumper Nick Skelton – who all also won gold medals in Rio – 
also make the list.

Paralympians are also well represented with Kadeena Cox, who won gold in 
cycling and athletics, the cyclist Dame Sarah Storey and the equestrian rider 
Sophie Christiansen all on the shortlist.

Only three names on the shortlist – the footballers Jamie Vardy and Gareth Bale

 and the Masters winner Danny Willett – are not Olympic or Paralympic gold 
medallists.

That means several big names miss out, including Froome, who won his third 
Tour de France title in July and Wiggins, whose successes in Rio have been 
overshadowed by questions about his use of therapeutic use exemptions before 
the 2011 and 2012 Tours de France and the 2013 Giro D’Italia.

They aren’t the only surprises, however. Alastair Cook, who became the first 
England batsman to pass 10,000 runs

 this summer, is also excluded along with Anthony Joshua, the charismatic 
Londoner who won a version of the world heavyweight title in January. None of 
England’s rugby union squad, who clinched their first Six Nations grand slam in 
13 years and are now unbeaten in 13 matches, made the cut.
