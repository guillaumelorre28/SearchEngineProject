Britain’s growing army of self-employed workers are earning less than they 
were 15 years ago and are vulnerable to changes that will make the welfare 
system less generous, two new thinktank reports have revealed.

The Resolution Foundation said the 45% increase in people deemed to be working 
for themselves since 2001-02 had been accompanied by a £60-a-week cut in the 
average pay packet.

Meanwhile, the Social Market Foundation said many of those working for below 
the minimum wage in a sector that includes construction site workers and 
drivers forDeliveroo

The two reports come as the government launches an investigation led by

, the former head of Tony Blair’s No 10 policy unit, into the pay and 
conditions of the one-in-seven workers who are self-employed.

Adam Corlett, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Almost 
five million workers across Britain are now self-employed. But while the 
self-employed workforce is getting bigger, typical earnings are actually lower 
than they were 20 years ago.

“Prior to the financial crisis, this stagnation was as much about the changing 
nature of self-employed work, rather than individual rewards. But since the 
crisis the returns to self-employment have fallen sharply, even when measured 
on a like-for-like basis.”

The Resolution Foundation said typical weekly earnings for self-employed 
workers grew steadily in the late 1990s and early 2000s, stagnated in the 
run-up to the crash and then fell by a quarter in the wake of the financial 
crisis.

A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial 
Strategy, said: “The government is committed to building an economy that works 
for everyone and while the‘national living wage’ 
<http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1902> has given one million 
workers a pay rise, the prime minister has made clear the labour market must 
support and protect all workers.”

The Social Market Foundation said the pay squeeze meant 45% of the 
self-employed were being paid below the “national living wage” of £7.20 an hour.

It added that 20% of families with self-employed workers were claiming in-work 
benefits such as tax credits and housing benefits and that when these were 
replaced by universal credit – which is being phased in by 2022 – many were set 
to be worse off since the amount they could claim would be based on an 
assumption that they were earning the equivalent of an employee on the national 
living wage.

Nida Broughton, Social Market Foundation chief economist, said: “We have made 
great strides in tackling low pay among employees, however the self-employed 
have traditionally been overlooked. We welcome the government’s announcement 
that Matthew Taylor will lead a review into modern employment.

 “Our report shows the scale of the low pay problem among the self-employed. 
If the government really wants to build ‘an economy which works for everyone’ – 
and deal with the problem of low pay among the self-employed – it must address 
the tax and regulation gap between employees and the self-employed, give the 
self-employed a stronger voice, and look at how training, better advice on 
business growth and wider opportunities can help people decide whether 
self-employment is the correct career path for them.”

Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “Britain’s new generation of 
self-employed workers are not all the budding entrepreneurs ministers like to 
talk about. While some choose self-employment, many are forced into it because 
there is no alternative work.

“Self-employment today too often means low pay and fewer rights at work. We 
need more decent jobs that people can live on. Not a return to the sort of 
working practices we saw in Victorian times.”
