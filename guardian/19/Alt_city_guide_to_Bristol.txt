In Bristol, there is a shop, Stokes Croft China <http://www.prscshop.co.uk/>, 
that sells fine bone china emblazoned with quotes from Tony Benn, images of the 
late, local music legend DJ Derek and a photograph of the Queen surrounded by 
the words: “I eat swans.” Affiliated to radical community group thePeople’s 
Republic of Stokes Croft <http://www.prsc.org.uk/>, this ceramics enterprise – 
in its improbable mix of craft, creativity and protest – sums up Bristol.

Uniquely among large British cities, Bristol marches to the beat of its own 
drum (and bass). Liverpool and Glasgow may have a similar streak of 
independence, but Bristol’s refusal to kowtow to the homogenising forces of 
modern capitalism is a visible, city-wide phenomenon manifested in endless 
community groups and co-ops. There is a widespread solidarity in the arts, food 
and music that promotes quality and individual expression, not profit. From 
Gloucester Road (the UK’s longest strip of independently owned shops) to the 
city’s distinctive musical association with heavy bass music – fromMassive 
Attack <https://www.theguardian.com/music/massive-attack> via dubstep pioneers 
such asPinch <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/25/pinch-q-and-a>, to 
modern cult heroes as different as Hodge,Vessel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/16/new-band-vessel> and the label 
Crazylegs <http://wearecrazylegs.com/> – Bristol is a genuine one-off.

Of course, being such an attractive place is both a blessing and a curse. 
Bristol is one of those places (along with, say, Berlin and Brighton) that many 
Londoners dream of moving to for a better life. The consequent gentrification 
is a double-edged sword – you get more nice beer but also more noise complaints 
– but it can also be devastating where soaring property prices drive out those 
who give Bristol its energy. Unlike in other cities though (remember 2011’s
Tesco riots 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/22/bristol-riot-police-injured>?), be 
assured that Bristol will fight any attempt to commodify its bohemian cool. 
Independence is hardwired into its DNA.

 Party hard … revellers at an event hosted by Alfresco Disco 
What Bristol lacks, locals insist, is a high-quality 400-capacity venue that, 
at the level belowMotion <http://www.motionbristol.com/>, would provide a focal 
point for the city’s underground. However, that absence is fuelling a 
subculture of ad hoc parties thrown in weird locations by outfits such asDirty 
Talk <https://www.facebook.com/dirtytalkDJ> (“Bristol’s bastion of interesting 
house and techno bookings,” says Chris Farrell, who runs the record shop and 
labelIdle Hands <http://www.idlehandsbristol.com/>); People Like Us 
<http://peoplelikeusdj.tumblr.com/>; and Rough Draft 
<https://www.facebook.com/roughdraftbristol>. “There’s a really good DIY party 
scene,” agrees Luke Sutton, fromCrack magazine <http://crackmagazine.net/>, who 
also ratesAlfresco Disco <https://www.facebook.com/alfrescodiscouk/>: 
“Recently, they hired an old navy ship and on a beautiful sunny day sailed 500 
people down the river under the suspension bridge to sea, and dropped us off at 
Clevedon Pier. That was special.”

This former police station is home to music and art studios, a circus school, 
gallery and a subterranean complex of old prison cells where gigs/club nights 
happen. “There’s a long, 200-capacity corridor room down there that’s used 
sporadically, and it’s got a very special vibe,” says Sutton, whose October 
festivalSimple Things <http://simplethingsfestival.co.uk/> uses the Island as a 
venue. “We had [techno DJ]Helena Hauff  <http://helena-hauff.com/>down there. 
It’s the kind of place you want to be when listening to harsh sounds.”

This cellar bar has been one of Bristol’s key underground spots for decades. 
Midweek, it hosts some excellent leftfield electronica/bass nights, such as
Death Disko <https://www.facebook.com/events/1734387123505969/> from the Young 
Echo collective duo Kahn & Neek. “Cosies holds a special place in lots of 
people’s hearts,” says Farrell. “Back in the day, you’d have toothless old 
dreads in there dancing next to students and everyone getting on, and a lot of 
interesting music still happens there.”

With its hand-thrown crockery and homemade foraged liqueurs, Bulrush 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/03/bulrush-bristol-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin>
 is one of those post-Noma restaurants that celebrates artisan skills and 
seasonality. In dishes such as hake with chicken of the woods mushrooms, white 
asparagus and ox-eye daisy, George Livesey’s food is as fastidious as Bulrush 
itself is warm and relaxed. Peter Sanchez-Iglesias, chef-owner at 
Michelin-starredCasamia <http://www.casamiarestaurant.co.uk/> in Bristol, loves 
it: “The food offers interesting flavours and techniques, especially in 
George’s fermenting and use of Japanese ingredients. It feels exciting.”

This speakeasy-style bar, hidden by the Triangle (look out for bowler hat sign 
by the door), is Bristol’s best cocktail bar, where even its bitters and 
tinctures are homemade. “The menu is designed around Prohibition-era classics, 
but they can make anything,” says Rowe. “I once ordered a salt ‘n’ vinegar 
martini, as I’d read about them somewhere trendy… which I regretted the next 
day.”

Up top, Beer Emporium is a modest bottle shop, but down below its vaulted 
cellars stock a pleasantly bewildering array of craft beer. Across 38 taps and 
endless bottles, the choice starts local (ales from Arbor, Moor, Good 
Chemistry, Crane, Left Handed Giant), before going global: Italian Hibu, for 
instance, is new even to hardcore beer geeks.

Bar Buvette

This spin-off from Auberge de Chassignolles – a boutique hotel and 
smallholding in the Auvergne – is a modish, rustic bar, specialising in natural 
wines, cheese and charcuterie. “The nearest thing to a Parisian natural wine 
bar this side of the Channel,” enthuses the Guardian’s Bristol-based wine 
writer, Fiona Beckett.

Perched on a hill overlooking Stokes Croft, this pub has been pushing good 
beer since time immemorial, but it has not stood still. Its 14 real ales are 
now partnered by six keg lines (not to mention DJs, kitchen takeovers, food 
pop-ups in the yard…). “It just feels right,” says Michael Wiper, owner of 
Bristol craft breweryWiper & True <http://wiperandtrue.com/>. “Adorned in hop 
vines and pump-clips, the whole place speaks of a love of beer, and the staff 
will happily take you through their favourites. It’s difficult not to have a 
good time.”

A small, artist-led theatre that fosters new local talent and often leftfield 
performance, including a monthly Speak Easy Story Slam, in which the audience 
shares stories. The Slam is a pay-what-you-want gig, and Wardrobe emphasises 
that the suggested £4 donation is not mandatory: “We’d rather have you here 
sharing stories than at home crying about capitalism.”

This 1960s office block is now a base for creatives and community groups. It 
houses exhibition and event spaces (where you can get involved in everything 
from dance classes to screen-printing workshops), and the Canteen bar, which 
hosts live bands every night – everything from New Orleans jazz to hip-hop. 
“It’s a fantastic creative hub,” says Sarah Thorp, owner of Gloucester Road 
gallery,Room 212 <http://room212.co.uk/>. “There’s a Banksy on the wall outside 
and the famous Trump-Boris kiss is just round the corner.”

Art Trails

This most creative of cities loves art trails 
<https://www.bristol.gov.uk/museums-parks-sports-culture/bristols-art-trails-and-open-studios>
, where visitors can buy direct from artists in their studios, galleries and 
homes. The trails are, essentially, community festivals and every district (BS9 
<http://www.bs9arts.co.uk/>, Victoria Park 
<https://www.facebook.com/artonthehillbristol/>, Totterdown 
<http://frontroom.org.uk/>, etc) has its own. “They’re generally monthly and 
every area has its own flavour,” says Sarah Thorp, who helps organise theNorth 
Bristol Arts Trail <http://www.northbristolartists.org.uk/>.
