police closed a section of the M1 while they investigated the circumstances 
behind the discovery of a body on the motorway.

closed from junctions 16 to 17, close to Watford Gap services, after the body 
was found just before 3am. They were treating the incident as a road traffic 
accident.

“Motorists are advised to seek alternative routes and diversions will be in 
place,” police said in a statement. A spokeswoman said an update would be made 
once officers had been able to assess the situation in daylight.

Officers attended the scene after a call from a motorist just before 3am, the 
spokeswoman said. The road was likely to be closed for some time, she added.

Sergeant Tony Hopkins told BBC Northampton

male. He told the station it had been “travelled over by several vehicles” and 
investigations were continuing.

closure is expected to remain in place for most of today.”
