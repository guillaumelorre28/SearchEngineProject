A worker has fallen to her death in Yellowstone national park, according to 
officials.


The 21-year-old died early on Friday during a social gathering with 
colleagues, park officials said.

 Estefania Liset Mosquera Alcivar, 21, a concession employee, was with a small 
group of co-workers at the rim of the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone shortly after 
3.15am when she fell, according to accounts by her companions, the park’s 
public affairs office said in a statement.

 Her body was recovered about four hours later and the incident remained under 
investigation, the officials said. Alvicar was from Quito, Ecuador.

 The incident, along with three major wildfires burning in Yellowstone, comes 
at the height of the summer tourist season and as officials in both parks 
prepare for celebrations set for Thursday marking the 100th anniversary of the 
creation of the National Park Service.

 The fires have prompted authorities to close the south entrance to the park, 
which last month saw an average of more than 2,400 vehicles per day.
