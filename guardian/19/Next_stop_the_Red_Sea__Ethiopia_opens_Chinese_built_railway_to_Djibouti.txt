With Chinese conductors at the helm, a fleet of shiny new trains has begun 
plying a new route from the Ethiopian capital toDjibouti 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/djibouti>, in a major boost to both 
economies.


The 750km (460-mile) railway, built by two Chinese companies, which will link 
Addis Ababa to the Red Sea port city of Djibouti, was inaugurated at a new 
station just outside the Ethiopian capital.

The Ethiopian prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, and his counterpart from 
Djibouti, Ismael Omar Guelleh, were welcomed by the uniformed Chinese personnel 
who will be operating the trains until their local counterparts have been 
trained.

“This train will speed up the development of our country’s manufacturing 
industry and it will provide huge benefits to the industrial parks and modern 
farms that will be built in the future. It will give employment opportunities 
for our citizens,” Desalegn said at the ceremony.

industry.

The new railway will take products between Ethiopia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ethiopia> and Djibouti in about 10 hours, a 
far cry from the current excruciating multi-day trip along a congested, 
pot-holed road.

“We’re so excited! It takes two or three days for a truck to come from 
Djibouti,” said Ethiopian importer Tingrit Worku. “The train could make a huge 
difference.”

Some 1,500 trucks a day currently lumber along the road, which carries 90% of 
imports and exports from landlocked Ethiopia to the port – a key trade hub to 
Asia, Europe and the rest of Africa.

“This train is a game-changer. Ethiopia is one of the fastest growing 
economies in Africa. The connection to the ports of Djibouti will give a bounce 
and our economy will grow faster,” said Mekonnen Getachew, project manager of 
the Ethiopian Railways Corporation.

Ethiopia country was the world’s fastest growing economy last year at 10.2%, 
but the International Monetary Fund estimates thatthe worst drought in 30 years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/16/drought-high-temperatures-el-nino-36m-people-africa-hunger>
 is likely to see this plummet to 4.5% in 2016.

Both countries benefit from economic integration, with Ethiopia gaining access 
to the sea and Djibouti gaining access to Ethiopia’s emerging market of 95 
million people.

The new railway means the end of the French-built diesel line constructed in 
1917, which fell into disrepair in later decades, with frequent derailments.

The inauguration will be followed by a three-month test period, with no paying 
passengers and carrying only cargo on the line, which includes stops at Mieso, 
Dire Dawa and Dewele on the border.

However when the line is fully functional, uniformed Chinese controllers will 
welcome passengers to the spotless platforms of newly built stations all along 
the route, while Chinese technicians and stationmasters will keep things 
running behind the scenes.

“We don’t yet have the management experience yet. We have a management 
contract with Chinese staff for five years, with an Ethiopian counterpart in 
training,” said Getachew.

China has invested heavily in infrastructure in Ethiopia, funding sub-Saharan 
Africa’s first modern tramway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/25/addis-ababa-first-sub-saharan-light-rail-network>
 – which opened in Addis Ababa last year – as well as motorways and dams.


The new $3.4bn railway, with its red, yellow and green trains evoking the 
Ethiopian flag, was 70% financed by China’s Exim Bank and built by China 
Railway Group andChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> Civil

A high-level Chinese delegation, in Addis Ababa for the inauguration of the 
railway, on Tuesday signed further agreements worth $100m for the construction 
of roads, the state-controlled Fana Broadcasting Corporation reported.

Natural resources from Africa have helped fuel China’s economic boom, and it 
became the continent’s largest trade partner in 2009.

However, direct investment in Africa slumped more than 40% last year, as 
growth slowed in the Asian giant.

The railway is the first step in a 5,000km-long network of rail which Ethiopia 
hopes to build by 2020, connecting it to Kenya, Sudan and South Sudan.

Djibouti, the smallest state in the Horn of Africa, sees the project as the 
start of a trans-African railway crossing the continent from the Red Sea to the 
Atlantic Ocean, a journey which takes three weeks by boat.

However this dream appears far off, as the railway would have to pass through 
war-torn countries such as South Sudan or the Central African Republic.

• This article was amended on 6 October 2016. An earlier version said 
incorrectly that the new route was “the first electrified railway in Africa”.
