ANR – It's Around You 

ANR <http://www.anrmiami.com/> are a quintessentially Floridian act: hard to 
categorise but captivating. Primarily a duo with a rotating cast of guest 
musicians, their music evokes everyone from Prince to the Beach Boys to 
Talking Heads. ANR are signed to the indie labelSomething In Construction 
<http://somethinginconstruction.com/current-roster/anr/> (Memory Tapes, Air 
France) in the UK.

Levek – Black Mold Grow

You can hear how the whimsical Disney influence has seeped into Orlando native 
David Levesque's music <http://levek.bandcamp.com/>. Recommended for fans of 
Beirut, Grizzly Bear and other dreamy, folky pop.

Jacuzzi Boys – Island Ave

The Jacuzzi Boys <http://jacuzziboys.com/> are south Florida's little band 
that could. Now a far cry from their sloppy early shows, they've grown into a 
tight garage-pop trio that perfectly captures the beachy but sometimes sleazy 
Miami vibe. Iggy Pop recently picked this track for a top five list he played 
on an Australian radio station.

Afrobeta – Do You Party?

Avant-dance-pop duo Afrobeta <http://afrobeta.com/> are one of the most 
popular groups in south Florida. Lead singer Cuci Amador is a dynamic 
frontwoman with an incredible wardrobe, while producer Smurphio provides the 
beats (and the afro). Afrobeta have played Burning Man, several Ultra Music 
Festivals, a Glastonbury, Space Ibiza and more. Cuci also lent vocals to Calle 
13's massive hit Electro Movimiento, and there is an awesome video to this 
Afrobeta song by genius editor Lindsay Scoggins, featuring kids' TV show puppet 
Lamb Chop.

Hundred Waters – Thistle

Hundred Waters <http://www.hundred-waters.com/> are one of those bands that 
work magic in melding the electronic with the organic. Think Battles or Ambien 
or a girlier Four Tet. Their home town of Gainesville, Florida, was hailed the 
"best place to start a band in the United States" by Blender Magazine, so it 
makes sense that this quintet has just signed to Skrillex'sOWSLA label 
<http://www.owsla.com/>.

Krisp – Captain Hook

Dance-rock quartet Krisp <http://krispband.com/> are full of surprises – at 
one show they might be wearing matching beards, at another they're breaking 
into obscure but perfect covers such as the Whitest Boy Alive's Burning. Either 
way, Krisp make tight, dynamic, fun tunes that complement any night out.

Spam Allstars – Electrodomésticos

The Spam Allstars <http://spamallstars.com/> are one of the most reliabe live 
acts in south Florida; with vinyl collector/music historian DJ Le Spam leading 
the nine-piece band, the Allstars gig constantly, playing all over America and 
the world. Their fusion of funk and a variety of latin and electronic music 
styles guarantees that no two shows are the same.

Otto Von Schirach – When Dinosaurs Rule the Earth

Otto Von Schirach <http://www.ottovonschirach.com/> is the reigning king of 
glitch bass. He's released music on Miami's renownedSchematic 
<http://www.schematic.net/news.htm> label, as well as Mike Patton and 
Modeselektor's imprints, and has a worldwide cult following. His music is about 
elements of classic Miami bass and experimental sounds and can get a (weird) 
party started. He's multitalented too, appearing in the short film Otto and the 
Electric Eel that made the film festival circuit last year.

One of the premier hip-hop groups out of Florida (and one that uses actual 
instruments at that),¡Mayday! <http://maydayonline.com/> have collaborated with 
CeeLo, backed up Lil Wayne, and the legendary MC, Del the Funky Homosapien, 
features on this track. Formed in '06, they show no signs of slowing down and 
recently signed to Tech N9ne'sStrange Music label 
<http://www.strangemusicinc.net/>.

Torche – Kicking

Sometimes labelled "doom pop" or "stoner metal", Torche 
<http://www.torchemusic.com/> are a bridge for fans of heavy music to get into 
something catchy and vice-versa. Recommended for fans of Queens of the Stone 
Age, Foo Fighters, Baroness, etc.

Florida native Lauren Reskin is the owner of Sweat Records

Miami

We need your tunes to keep our wheels turning. Starting with Florida, we're 
looking for songs that you associate with the state – maybe that's the twang of 
the Allman Brothers Band or Tom Petty, or the latin rhythms of Gloria Estefan.
