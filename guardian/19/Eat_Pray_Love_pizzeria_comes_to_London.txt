Naples’ most famous pizza joint, L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele 
<http://damichele.net/> – featured in the bestselling travel memoir Eat Pray 
Love – is set to open a branch in London.

“I love my pizza so much,” author Elizabeth Gilbert wrote on her visit to the 
restaurant, where she ordered a margherita with double mozzarella, “that I have 
come to believe in my delirium that my pizza might actually love me, in return. 
I am having a relationship with this pizza, almost an affair.”

The pizzeria also featured in the film of the book, in which Elizabeth 
Gilbert, played byJulia Roberts <https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliaroberts>
, can be seen mumbling the same lines in between in between bites of the 
classic Neapolitan dish.

 Julia Roberts, as Elizabeth Gilbert, eats pizza at L’Antica Pizzeria da 
Michele. 
The restaurant, which has been in the same location since 1930 and is run by a 
family whose pizza heritage goes back to 1870, is known for making the best 
pizzas in Naples and is a point of pilgrimage for pizza lovers around the world.

Pilgrims from the UK won’t need to travel quite so far now, thanks to the 
soon-to-open London branch, which will be on Stoke Newington’s Church Street.

The London restaurant will follow the same formula that has won it acclaim in 
Naples. This means only serving margherita and marinara pizzas (although, in 
the London branch, there will be two specials on rotation), as well as offering 
the same wine and beers that are served in the original pizzeria.
