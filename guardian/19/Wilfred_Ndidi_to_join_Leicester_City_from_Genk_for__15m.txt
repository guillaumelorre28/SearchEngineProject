Ndidi is set to sign for Claudio Ranieri’s team for around £15m when the 
transfer window reopens next month, subject to being granted a work permit.

The Nigeria international has agreed a five-year contract and has been 
earmarked as a long-term replacement forN’Golo Kanté, who Leicester sold to 
Chelsea in the summer

.

Ndidi moved to Genk from Nathaniel Boys of Lagos after impressing during a 
trial and made his debut in January 2015 as a centre-half. He can also play at 
right-back and has been capped twice by Nigeria.

He will join his international team‑mate Ahmed Musa at Leicester and both will 
be available during the Africa Cup of Nations in January because Nigeria failed 
to qualify.
