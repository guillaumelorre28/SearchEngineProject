Susanna Rustin (Killer Drivers are the biggest stranger danger of all, 7 
December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/06/killer-drivers-biggest-stranger-danger-life-sentences>
) tells us that in 1925 F Scott Fitzgerald “perceived the sociopathic potential 
of driving”. But careless driving was not born with the motor car. In A Tale of 
Two Cities in 1859 Charles Dickens had written of the dangers of “hard driving” 
and describes an aristocrat in his horse-drawn coach being driven at a reckless 
speed, “with an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to understand in 
these days”. So when his coach kills a child, he obviously feels no remorse or 
fear of the law, telling the distraught father: “It is extraordinary to me that 
you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children.” He then speeds 
carelessly away, presumably to endanger and ruin more lives. So what’s new?
