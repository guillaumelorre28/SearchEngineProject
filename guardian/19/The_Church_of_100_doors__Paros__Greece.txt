There’s a silver mother and child icon in every house on the Greek island of 
Paros, so what’s the story? Friend and local Paraskevi tells me: “You’ll find 
the original in Ekatontapiliani, the Church of 100 Doors.”

Two minutes from the sea, hidden from the bustle of Parikia’s port, the 
fourth-century church is all arches, dome and windows (although there aren’t 
100 doors). I light a candle and walk to the glittering Madonna, a Byzantine 
icon covered with silver in 1788. I queue, kiss the child, then sit.

There are pots of basil outside, lovingly tended in memory of ninth-century 
nun Osia Theokisti, who lived alone on the island for 35 years after escaping 
from pirates, surviving on wild basil and holy water. On either side of the 
shrine, deep in the foundations and visible through a glass floor, are marble 
pillars from a Grecian temple to Aphrodite, which stood here before. Every 
August, villagers carry icons of Mary down to the sea, with fireworks and 
partying. Surely such festivities date back to the rites of ocean-born 
Aphrodite, when clay effigies were thrown into the ocean?
