The fourth single from last year's blockbuster My Beautiful Dark Twisted 
Fantasy <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TSDc0vZMkc> might not have an explicit 
Las Vegas theme, but when you catch your first glimpse of the lit-up Strip at 
night, try not singing its glittering chorus.

The biggest band ever to come out of Las Vegas also makes for an excellent 
pre-gaming soundtrack. And who knows, you just might luck into a shared 
elevator ride with Brandon, Dave, Mark or Ronnie.

Electronic dance music has become as much a part of the Vegas party scene as 
dice and limos, and Oakie helped jumpstart the movement on the Strip. So dance 
all night to this DJ ... or another one.

Sure, Tumbling Dice <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ1CRKiwdho> is the 
obvious pick off Exile on Main Street, what with its "I'm all sixes and sevens 
and nines" lyrics. But this one's got that groove, the one you need to hear 
just before you hit the casino floor.

Silly enough to make you smile, serious enough to make you play it 10 more 
times as you roll into town, with your mind on your money and your money on 
your mind.

"Lambourginis, caviar, dry martinis, Shangri-La." Bon Scott knew a good party 
when he saw one. Let his raspy voice psych you up for yours.

A smoky duet from the Francis Ford Coppola film One From the Heart 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6aYLIn9zXs&feature=related>) set on the Strip. 
"Maybe I'll go down to the corner and get a racing form/I should probably wait 
here by the phone." Leave it to Tom to get to the heart of this one-of-a-kind 
American crossroads.

For all its shimmering neon, Las Vegas will always be, at its heart, a cowboy 
town deep in the Mojave desert. Let Gram remind you.

You'll hear Viva Las Vegas <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFw5a5Bp_Pw> enough 
while you're here. Play this one to remind yourself of the consequences of 
having too much fun while in Sin City. It's not very hard to do.

We've avoided most of the overplayed Vegas classics, but this one's simply too 
good to pass up. A trip to the Strip without a little Rat Pack homage is like a 
weekend in Seattle without rain.
