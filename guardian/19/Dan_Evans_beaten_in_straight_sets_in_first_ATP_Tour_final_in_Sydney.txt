Britain’s Dan Evans was denied the first ATP World Tour title of his career 
after a straight-sets defeat at the hands of Gilles Müller in the Sydney 
International. The left-hander from Luxembourg had lost all of his previous 
five finals but will climb into the top 30 of the world rankings for the first 
time after the 7-6, 6-2 triumph over Evans, who wascompeting in his first ATP 
Tour final

Evans, ranked in the high 700s in the world only a couple of years ago but 
destined to hit a career-high 51 on Monday, failed to come to terms with the 
variety of Müller’s serve. The 26-year-old held his own in a tight first set 
without putting enough pressure on his opponent to conjure up a single break 
point.

Müller always looked like having the edge with his serve-volley game and made 
it count with a forehand smash at the net to seal the first-set tiebreak. The 
second set was a more one-sided affair and Evans sank to his haunches and 
banged his racket on the court in frustration after being broken for the second 
time.

Müller raced to 40-0 lead while serving for the match but the nerves caught up 
with him and he double-faulted on his first championship point and went long on 
his second. Again on the third, his first serve let him down as he looked for a 
13th ace to seal victory but his angled second effort had enough on it to force 
the error out of Evans and the title was his.

“Well done to Gilles, I was hoping it was going to be six losses in finals but 
it wasn’t to be,” Evans said with a grin.

Evans takes on the Argentinian Facundo Bagnis in the first round of the 
Australian Open on Monday.
