What a finish to the game. A quite magnificent finish from Lyle Taylor was a 
rare piece of quality in an otherwise poor game, and it was that striker that 
set Wimbledon on their way. Plymouth had a late claim for a penalty turned down 
in injury time, before Akinfenwa’s penalty, but in truth, they probably didn’t 
do enough on the day: Carey was marked out of the game, Matt never got enough 
support, and Reid wasn’t given enough time off the bench to make an impact.

Wimbledon will play in League One next season, the same division as MK Dons. 
It’s a quite remarkable story.

Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. See you next season. Bye!

Akinfenwa, twice a play-off final loser and whose contract is up at the end of 
this season, has been talking to the cameras. He is hilarious.

“It’s what dreams are made up. It’s a beautiful thing. Oh, yeah, but sidebar, 
I think I’m technically unemployed. So any managers out there, hit me up on the 
Whatsapp. All those people who said I was too big to play football. Haaaaaaa, 
come on now. From playing in the dark in Hackney to winning at Wembley. It’s a 
beautiful thing.”

LOL.
Mark Farrelly (@MarkFarrelly131) 
Akinfenwa just gave his post match interview straight to camera!

GOAL! AFC Wimbledon 2-0 Plymouth Argyle (Akinfenwa 99)

The big man sends McCormick the wrong way, and AFC Wimbledon

Akinfenwa rips his shirt off and celebrates in front of the fans. One man is in 
tears.

the first time since September. Beast.

Penalty to Wimbledon!

Azeez, just on, goes down in the area after another Wimbledon counter-attack. 
Forster brings him down, it’s clumsy but never a penalty, Azeez ran into 
Forster! Azeez, Kennedy and Akinfenwa are all arguing over the ball. They all 
want to take it. Akinfenwa wins the argument, obviously.

96 min: Akinfenwa wins the flick on, and Taylor is through on goal. He’s clean 
through … no! A terrible shot, he tried to chip McCormick but completely 
scuffed it and the keeper just caught it. He’s injured himself in the process, 
too, and has to come off: Azeez on.

94 min: Penalty shout for Plymouth! Oh, that could have so easily been given. 
Carey makes an incisive run down the left, feeds Tanner, who is bundles to the 
ground by Bulman. There’s not to much contact, but Bulman got none of the ball. 
Not given!

92 min: It’s taken a while for them to react, but here Plymouth come, 
attacking in waves. Reid, with his trademark low socks, controls the ball on 
the right and crosses towards Matt but Robinson heads clear. He’s had an 
excellent day.

88 min: Attack it is! Bulman strives forward on the counter attack, feeds 
Taylor on the left, and the goalscorer stands up a cross to Akinfenwa at the 
back post. The big man powers a header towards the top corner from close range, 
but a quite magnificent save from McCormick turns the ball over the bar. That 
is some save. Keeping Plymouth in it!

86 min: Interesting to see what kind of ambition Wimbledon show now. Will they 
continue to attack as they have done for most of this half, or will they get 
bodies behind the ball?

84 min: Lord have mercy: Hartley comes together with Akinfenwa under a high 
ball. Who do you think comes off the worst? Hartley comes down from a great 
height, lands flat on his back, and writhes around in agony on the ground. 
Ouch. He’s not getting up, and is going to have to come off. Forster comes on 
in his play. That was a lengthy delay for the stretcher.

82 min: Plymouth throw on Reuben Reid, for Wylde. They need a bit of his magic

80 min: Wimbledon should be 2-0 up! Fuller makes a surging run from right 
back, plays a lovely one-two with Taylor and is clean through, but McCormick 
comes out and makes a wonderful save with his right hand, closing the angle 
superbly. Fuller holds his head in his hands, he knows his shot could have been 
stronger.

GOAL! AFC Wimbledon 1-0 Plymouth Argyle (Taylor 79)

And they have scored! Ooooohhhhh! Could that be the goal that takes AFC 
Wimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/afc-wimbledon> to League One? 
And it’s Taylor, who has got it with his 23rd goal of the season, latching into 
a teasing low cross from Kennedy. The ball dipped at the last minute, and 
Taylor read it, before a deft touch glances the ball off his right boot, past 
McCormick and into the corner. Taylor goes wild, ripping his shirt from his 
back, and sprints towards Ardley, who sprints down the touchline to greet him. 
Dons fans going crazy here!

70 min: Great chance for Wimbledon. A clever run from Elliot is well found 
with a pass down the line from Kennedy. Bulman, 37-year-old Bulman, is the 
first of Wimbledon’s midfield to join Elliot and he breaks beyond the striker 
into the box but it’s a poor cutback and McHugh is able to clear. No clear-cut 
chances as yet, but Wimbledon are getting into some excellent positions.

64 min: Carey may have been a ghost in this hour, but he’s making himself a 
nuisance from set pieces. First Jervis wins a free-kick right on the edge of 
Wimbledon’s box – Carey gets it up and over the wall but Roos is there to palm 
it wide. Next he swings a deep cross to Hartley who is completely unmarked at 
the back post for Plymouth. Oh no! He can’t connect properly with the header 
and instead nods it into the turf, the ball bouncing kindly into the arms of 
Roos. Hartley should have scored!

59 min: The quality is still poor, but the atmosphere is definitely hotting 
up, particularly as both teams are now kicking towards their own supporters.

Alex Ross on the email: “I asked my friend, Big Tim, who I am accompanying 
today, what the best Plymouth chant was when I met him earlier. “Argyle, 
Argyle,” I was told. Witty it may not be but at least they’re singing it 
loudly. The last time I was at Wembley I watched England play Macedonia. I can 
confirm that today’s atmosphere is better.”

Well at least that’s something.

54 min: Great block from Nelson! The ball fell to Barcham on the edge of the 
box and the winger smashed it goalwards on the volley but Plymouth’s captain 
threw his body in front of the ball. Fearless defending.

53 min: Mellor is increasingly looking like a weak link for Plymouth at 
right-back. Twice in two minutes the defender has given the ball away in 
dangerous areas, with Barcham pouncing. Elliot gets to the byline and swings a 
cross in towards his mate Taylor, but Nelson is there to head it behind his own 
goal. Corner to Wimbledon, but it’s cleared by Boateng.

51 min: Oooooo, so nearly an own goal from Carl McHugh. This was very nearly a 
spectacular one from the Plymouth defender, who tried to lob the ball back to 
his goalkeeper, but sent the ball just a yard wide of his own goal. McCormick 
was stranded. McHugh is a lucky boy.

47 min: Plymouth are immediately on the front foot, with Wylde whipping in a 
dangerous cross to the back post. Jervis beats the keeper Roos to the ball but 
can’t direct his header at goal. Roos actually clattered into Jervis there and 
got none of the ball, but none of the Plymouth fans appealed for a penalty.

What a finish to the game. A quite magnificent finish from Lyle Taylor was a 
rare piece of quality in an otherwise poor game, and it was that striker that 
set Wimbledon on their way. Plymouth had a late claim for a penalty turned down 
in injury time, before Akinfenwa’s penalty, but in truth, they probably didn’t 
do enough on the day: Carey was marked out of the game, Matt never got enough 
support, and Reid wasn’t given enough time off the bench to make an impact.

Wimbledon will play in League One next season, the same division as MK Dons. 
It’s a quite remarkable story.

Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. See you next season. Bye!

Akinfenwa, twice a play-off final loser and whose contract is up at the end of 
this season, has been talking to the cameras. He is hilarious.

“It’s what dreams are made up. It’s a beautiful thing. Oh, yeah, but sidebar, 
I think I’m technically unemployed. So any managers out there, hit me up on the 
Whatsapp. All those people who said I was too big to play football. Haaaaaaa, 
come on now. From playing in the dark in Hackney to winning at Wembley. It’s a 
beautiful thing.”

LOL.

Full-time: AFC Wimbledon 2-0 Plymouth Argyle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/plymouthargyle>. Cue bedlam.
 
The big man sends McCormick the wrong way, and AFC Wimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/afc-wimbledon> fans are in dreamland. 
Akinfenwa rips his shirt off and celebrates in front of the fans. One man is in 
tears.

Azeez, just on, goes down in the area after another Wimbledon counter-attack. 
Forster brings him down, it’s clumsy but never a penalty, Azeez ran into 
Forster! Azeez, Kennedy and Akinfenwa are all arguing over the ball. They all 
want to take it. Akinfenwa wins the argument, obviously.
 
96 min: Akinfenwa wins the flick on, and Taylor is through on goal. He’s clean 
through … no! A terrible shot, he tried to chip McCormick but completely 
scuffed it and the keeper just caught it. He’s injured himself in the process, 
too, and has to come off: Azeez on.
 
94 min: Penalty shout for Plymouth! Oh, that could have so easily been given. 
Carey makes an incisive run down the left, feeds Tanner, who is bundles to the 
ground by Bulman. There’s not to much contact, but Bulman got none of the ball. 
Not given!
 
92 min: It’s taken a while for them to react, but here Plymouth come, 
attacking in waves. Reid, with his trademark low socks, controls the ball on 
the right and crosses towards Matt but Robinson heads clear. He’s had an 
excellent day.
 
90 min: Seven minutes added on here for injury time. Mainly due to the injury 
to Hartley. A huge roar from the Green Army. Here we go!
 
88 min: Attack it is! Bulman strives forward on the counter attack, feeds 
Taylor on the left, and the goalscorer stands up a cross to Akinfenwa at the 
back post. The big man powers a header towards the top corner from close range, 
but a quite magnificent save from McCormick turns the ball over the bar. That 
is some save. Keeping Plymouth in it!
 
86 min: Interesting to see what kind of ambition Wimbledon show now. Will they 
continue to attack as they have done for most of this half, or will they get 
bodies behind the ball?

84 min: Lord have mercy: Hartley comes together with Akinfenwa under a high 
ball. Who do you think comes off the worst? Hartley comes down from a great 
height, lands flat on his back, and writhes around in agony on the ground. 
Ouch. He’s not getting up, and is going to have to come off. Forster comes on 
in his play. That was a lengthy delay for the stretcher.
 
82 min: Plymouth throw on Reuben Reid, for Wylde. They need a bit of his magic 
now. How quiet has Matt been?
 
80 min: Wimbledon should be 2-0 up! Fuller makes a surging run from right 
back, plays a lovely one-two with Taylor and is clean through, but McCormick 
comes out and makes a wonderful save with his right hand, closing the angle 
superbly. Fuller holds his head in his hands, he knows his shot could have been 
stronger.
 
And they have scored! Ooooohhhhh! Could that be the goal that takes AFC 
Wimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/afc-wimbledon> to League One? 
And it’s Taylor, who has got it with his 23rd goal of the season, latching into 
a teasing low cross from Kennedy. The ball dipped at the last minute, and 
Taylor read it, before a deft touch glances the ball off his right boot, past 
McCormick and into the corner. Taylor goes wild, ripping his shirt from his 
back, and sprints towards Ardley, who sprints down the touchline to greet him. 
Dons fans going crazy here!

78 min: Akinfenwa immediately wins a header, and Wimbledon fans erupt as 
though they just scored a goal.
 
76 min: Here he comes …

72 min: Barcham is down. He’s been Wimbledon’s best player this second half. 
Ardley will want him fit. Yep, he’s OK.

That nearly 6,000 more than the League ONE play-off final yesterday. 
 
70 min: Great chance for Wimbledon. A clever run from Elliot is well found 
with a pass down the line from Kennedy. Bulman, 37-year-old Bulman, is the 
first of Wimbledon’s midfield to join Elliot and he breaks beyond the striker 
into the box but it’s a poor cutback and McHugh is able to clear. No clear-cut 
chances as yet, but Wimbledon are getting into some excellent positions.
 
66 min: First substitutions of the afternoon: Tanner comes on for Jervis in a 
straight swap for Tanner. A minute later, Wimbledon respond: Meades on for 
Smith.
 
64 min: Carey may have been a ghost in this hour, but he’s making himself a 
nuisance from set pieces. First Jervis wins a free-kick right on the edge of 
Wimbledon’s box – Carey gets it up and over the wall but Roos is there to palm 
it wide. Next he swings a deep cross to Hartley who is completely unmarked at 
the back post for Plymouth. Oh no! He can’t connect properly with the header 
and instead nods it into the turf, the ball bouncing kindly into the arms of 
Roos. Hartley should have scored!
 
62 min: Wylde slides in on Fuller, and catches the Wimbledon captain badly. 
Yellow card for the Plymouth man. Deserved.
 
59 min: The quality is still poor, but the atmosphere is definitely hotting 
up, particularly as both teams are now kicking towards their own supporters.

Alex Ross on the email: “I asked my friend, Big Tim, who I am accompanying 
today, what the best Plymouth chant was when I met him earlier. “Argyle, 
Argyle,” I was told. Witty it may not be but at least they’re singing it 
loudly. The last time I was at Wembley I watched England play Macedonia. I can 
confirm that today’s atmosphere is better.”

Well at least that’s something.
 
56 min: Ouch! Smith is about half an hour late on Carey on the left touchline. 
Carey has taken some stick so far this game.

54 min: Great block from Nelson! The ball fell to Barcham on the edge of the 
box and the winger smashed it goalwards on the volley but Plymouth’s captain 
threw his body in front of the ball. Fearless defending.
 
53 min: Mellor is increasingly looking like a weak link for Plymouth at 
right-back. Twice in two minutes the defender has given the ball away in 
dangerous areas, with Barcham pouncing. Elliot gets to the byline and swings a 
cross in towards his mate Taylor, but Nelson is there to head it behind his own 
goal. Corner to Wimbledon, but it’s cleared by Boateng.
 
51 min: Oooooo, so nearly an own goal from Carl McHugh. This was very nearly a 
spectacular one from the Plymouth defender, who tried to lob the ball back to 
his goalkeeper, but sent the ball just a yard wide of his own goal. McCormick 
was stranded. McHugh is a lucky boy.
 
49 min: “Wylde is opening them up at the back, but his final ball is still 
erratic,” writes Reg Gorczynski. “Sort that out and we might snatch a couple of 
goals. Green Army forever!!!”
 
47 min: Plymouth are immediately on the front foot, with Wylde whipping in a 
dangerous cross to the back post. Jervis beats the keeper Roos to the ball but 
can’t direct his header at goal. Roos actually clattered into Jervis there and 
got none of the ball, but none of the Plymouth fans appealed for a penalty.
 
Peeeeep! And we’re off again.
