Well, well, well. Tunisia were rather brilliant at times, but truly awful in 
front of goal. Senegal sat back and basked in their two-goal lead and on 
another day would’ve been punished for a pretty ordinary display. But it’s 
Senegal that prosper and regardless of this performance, they’ll go into 
Thursday’s match against Zimbabwe with confidence. Next up forTunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> are north African neighbours 
Algeria, also on Thursday.

That’s all from myself. Thanks for your company, emails and tweets. Bye!

Full-time: Tunisia 0-2 Senegal

It’s all over in Franceville. Two first-half goals win for Senegal, with Sadio 
Mané’s penalty and Kara Mbodji’s header sending Aliou Cissé’s side top of Group 
B at this early stage. It could have been very different hadTunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> taken just one of their – what 
felt like – hundreds of chances in front of goal.

90+3: Naguez puts in a decent cross from the byline on the right flank but 
Khenessi, the Tunisia substitute, sees it awkwardly cannon off a combination of 
his head, neck and shoulder and it’s wide. That just about sums upTunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> tonight – they’ve played some 
sterling stuff at times.

86 min: Msakni flicks the ball beautifully back to Khenessi but he, like every 
otherTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> player this 
evening, fluffs his lines. Meanwhile, Mané is fouled and Senegal will just be 
hoping to see this game out now after a relatively poor second-half display.

Cheikh Kouyaté, Senegal’s captain, is substituted and replaced by Diop. Not 
Papa Bouba Diop but rather Papakouli Diop.

84 min: Msakni again comes alive after a neat through ball by Naguez but 
Koulibaly clears. Both teams have one substitution left in the can. Can either 
manager make an impact with a final roll of the dice?

more than played his part at keepingTunisia

Kara’s sliced clearance from rippling the net.

chances. Up the other end, Mané sprints with the ball and it’s 3 v 1 but his 
pass sees Sarr given offside. Into the final 10 minutes we go.

77 min: Msakni sees another of his efforts kept out by Diallo. Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> get the ball wide and the 
striker shoots low but it’s directly at the Senegal goalkeeper, who clears. 
Abdennour, guilty of giving away the first-half penalty, then does brilliantly 
to snuff out the ball from Sarr on the counterattack.

70 min: Msakni this time squanders a huge chance! A free header goes begging 
from a Tunisia corner. He’s got his head on his hands. Quite how Tunisia are 
yet to register a goal this evening is amazing. But goodness gracious me, 
they’ve been wasteful in front of goal. Regardless,Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> should not be two goals down 
here.

Meanwhile, Senegal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> make another 
change with Newcastle striker Saivet replacing Ndiaye, who high-fives his 
team-mates on the bench. In the other dugout, the 70-year-old Kasperczak, 
Tunisia’s coach, is pulling his hair out.

68 min: Kara very, very nearly scores an own goal! And what a goal that would 
have been too. Sliti surges towards goal and his blocked effort lands at the 
feet of Kara, who scored Senegal’s second, and he duly slices the ball towards 
his own goalnet. It crashed off the inside of the post and somehow away from 
goal. Poor old Henryk Kasperczak, Tunisia’s Polish coach, cannot quite believe 
it.

67 min: Senegal try to put their foot on the ball, in a bid to take the sting 
out of the game. Just as I say that, Senegal gift the ball back to the 
opposition.Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> have been 
pretty relentless for much of this second half.

63 min: Lahmar’s free-kick is powered straight into the wall. And Senegal go 
straight up the other end, with Sarr on the counterattack and he ends up 
hitting the bar with a cross-cum-shot. What an introduction that would’ve been.
Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> have made a change 
amongst all that too, with Akaichi subbed. Taha Khenessi replaces him.

59 min: Maaloul creates danger, looping a ball into the box after some neat 
buildup play on the edge of the box.Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> garner a corner of it, and their 
players, notably Khazri, end up appealing for a goal. Where’s goal-line 
technology when you need it?

The ball is whipped in from the corner, and the ball cannons off Diallo’s knee 
and away from goal. It may very well of gone over the line, though.

Tunisia then follow that up with more fine attacking play, only for Akaichi to 
totally forget to allow his head to make contact with the ball.

56 min: Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> cannot be 
faulted for their efforts: Msakni, who plays his club football in Qatar, 
charges onto a lost cause at the back stick, after a deep ball by Sassi. He 
very nearly hooks it back goalwards but the ball runs out of touch. Cheikh 
M’Bengue had totally given up on it.

52 min: Plenty of action in the opening seven minutes or so of this second 
half. Senegal get a corner, and once more there’s plenty of aggro and bizarre 
goings-on between theTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> 
defenders and the Senegalese forwards. The corner is whipped in and Mame Biram 
Diouf, unmarked, heads wide. That was a golden opportunity.

49 min: The corner is taken short, to the disappointment of Abdennour and Ben 
Youssef, who trudge back to their own half. Senegal need to get a grasp on this 
second half, andTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia>, again, 
much like the opening half hour or so, look the better of the two teams.

48 min: Lahmar again takes the free-kick and it gets up and down over the wall 
but it fires just over Diallo’s goal. The Senegal keeper watches it go over. But
Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> come again and Sassi 
combines with Sliti once more, who eventually feeds Akaichi. Corner-kick.

And Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> have made a change, 
with Sunderland forward Khazri replacing Azouni. Will he inspire the Carthage

A half-time stat that counts for nothing: Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> had 60% of the possession in 
those opening 45 minutes.

Half-time: Tunisia 0-2 Senegal

Lahmar’s free-kick sails wide and at the break it’s very much Senegal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> who head down the tunnel the 
happier of the two sides. Mané got the ball rolling from the spot after a 
clumsy foul from Abdennour, the Valencia defender, before Kara’s crashing 
header doubled their lead.

45 min: Mané had a chance for his second and Senegal’s third but he cannot 
control Gassama’s cross. Anyway, as it stands, Senegal will top Group B at this 
painfully early stage, following Algeria’s earlier 2-2 draw with Zimbabwe. Just 
before the break,Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> have a 
free-kick 25 yards out after another dodgy Koulibaly challenge.

43 min: Senegal are going through the motions a little, and Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> look a little one-dimensional. 
There’s no Plan B available for them it seems. “Looks like Senegal are in the 
driving seat,” emails Steve. Indeed, Aliou Cissé will be satisfied with this 
first-half display so far.

the referee’s book. The Napoli defender appeared to lose his balance before 
essentially rugby tackling the forward, who has impressed so far here. The 
free-kick is put in swiftly butSenegal

36 min: Cheikh M’bengue is booked for a meaty challenge on Naguez. The 
free-kick is wasted, and it’s Mané this time looking for a free-kick, but in 
vein. Senegal look rather comfortable now, although every time Akaichi’s got on 
the ball,Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> look dangerous.

Well, well, well. Tunisia were rather brilliant at times, but truly awful in 
front of goal. Senegal sat back and basked in their two-goal lead and on 
another day would’ve been punished for a pretty ordinary display. But it’s 
Senegal that prosper and regardless of this performance, they’ll go into 
Thursday’s match against Zimbabwe with confidence. Next up forTunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> are north African neighbours 
Algeria, also on Thursday.

That’s all from myself. Thanks for your company, emails and tweets. Bye!

Afcon 2017: Sadio Mané on target as Senegal defeat wasteful Tunisia
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/15/sadio-mane-senegal-africa-cup-of-nations-tunisia> 
It’s all over in Franceville. Two first-half goals win for Senegal, with Sadio 
Mané’s penalty and Kara Mbodji’s header sending Aliou Cissé’s side top of Group 
B at this early stage. It could have been very different hadTunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> taken just one of their – what 
felt like – hundreds of chances in front of goal.

90+3: Naguez puts in a decent cross from the byline on the right flank but 
Khenessi, the Tunisia substitute, sees it awkwardly cannon off a combination of 
his head, neck and shoulder and it’s wide. That just about sums upTunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> tonight – they’ve played some 
sterling stuff at times.
 
90+1 min: It’s a bit of neat keep-ball now for Senegal, after Sassi fouls 
Saivet, theSenegal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> substitute, 
in frustration.
 
90 min: There will be four added minutes in Franceville.
 
89 min: Senegal gift Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> 
back possession on the half-way line but when Sliti plays in Msakni, he’s 
flagged offside. That’s an agonisingly close call. Double drat. That was some 
lovely football.
 
86 min: Msakni flicks the ball beautifully back to Khenessi but he, like every 
otherTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> player this 
evening, fluffs his lines. Meanwhile, Mané is fouled and Senegal will just be 
hoping to see this game out now after a relatively poor second-half display.

Cheikh Kouyaté, Senegal’s captain, is substituted and replaced by Diop. Not 
Papa Bouba Diop but rather Papakouli Diop.
 
84 min: Msakni again comes alive after a neat through ball by Naguez but 
Koulibaly clears. Both teams have one substitution left in the can. Can either 
manager make an impact with a final roll of the dice?
 
82 min: Diallo smothers another low shot from Msakni. The Senegal keeper has 
more than played his part at keepingTunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> out here. And his post saved 
Kara’s sliced clearance from rippling the net.
 
79 min: Henryk Kasperczak must be dusting down his age-old shooting drills for 
tomorrow’s training session after this.Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia>, simply, have missed so many 
chances. Up the other end, Mané sprints with the ball and it’s 3 v 1 but his 
pass sees Sarr given offside. Into the final 10 minutes we go.
 
77 min: Msakni sees another of his efforts kept out by Diallo. Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> get the ball wide and the 
striker shoots low but it’s directly at the Senegal goalkeeper, who clears. 
Abdennour, guilty of giving away the first-half penalty, then does brilliantly 
to snuff out the ball from Sarr on the counterattack.
 
76 min: Aliou Cissé is barking out instructions on the touchline and he looks 
truly baffled at his side’s second-half display. Or perhaps arrogance. It must 
be said, barring his penalty and almost giftingTunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> a shot at goal, Mané has been 
incredibly quiet.
 
75 min: Khazri then has a free-kick from the left but it’s pretty poor and 
straight down Diallo’s throat. Senegal look tired and flat, whileTunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> are still trying, so very hard 
too.
 
73 min: Diallo does not communicate properly with Gassama, and confusion at 
the back allowsTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> a glimpse 
at goal. Khazri shoots wide before Lahmar shoots, er, even wider wide.
 
70 min: Msakni this time squanders a huge chance! A free header goes begging 
from a Tunisia corner. He’s got his head on his hands. Quite how Tunisia are 
yet to register a goal this evening is amazing. But goodness gracious me, 
they’ve been wasteful in front of goal. Regardless,Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> should not be two goals down 
here.

Meanwhile, Senegal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> make another 
change with Newcastle striker Saivet replacing Ndiaye, who high-fives his 
team-mates on the bench. In the other dugout, the 70-year-old Kasperczak, 
Tunisia’s coach, is pulling his hair out.
 
68 min: Kara very, very nearly scores an own goal! And what a goal that would 
have been too. Sliti surges towards goal and his blocked effort lands at the 
feet of Kara, who scored Senegal’s second, and he duly slices the ball towards 
his own goalnet. It crashed off the inside of the post and somehow away from 
goal. Poor old Henryk Kasperczak, Tunisia’s Polish coach, cannot quite believe 
it.
 
67 min: Senegal try to put their foot on the ball, in a bid to take the sting 
out of the game. Just as I say that, Senegal gift the ball back to the 
opposition.Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> have been 
pretty relentless for much of this second half.
 
65 min: Khazri fires low and, only just, wide from outside the box after 
clever play by Sassi. The Sunderland forward puts his thumbs up and there’s a 
big grin to match, butTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> 
still trail by two goals.
 
63 min: Lahmar’s free-kick is powered straight into the wall. And Senegal go 
straight up the other end, with Sarr on the counterattack and he ends up 
hitting the bar with a cross-cum-shot. What an introduction that would’ve been.
Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> have made a change 
amongst all that too, with Akaichi subbed. Taha Khenessi replaces him.
 
61 min: A bonkers couple of minutes in Franceville, and how the ruddy nora are 
Tunisia yet to score themselves? Meanwhile, Sarr, of Metz, replaces Balde for 
Senegal. They need to do something to seize back control of this contest.Tunisia
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia>, meanwhile, win another 
free-kick right on the edge of the box through Msakni ...
 
59 min: Maaloul creates danger, looping a ball into the box after some neat 
buildup play on the edge of the box.Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> garner a corner of it, and their 
players, notably Khazri, end up appealing for a goal. Where’s goal-line 
technology when you need it?

The ball is whipped in from the corner, and the ball cannons off Diallo’s knee 
and away from goal. It may very well of gone over the line, though.

Tunisia then follow that up with more fine attacking play, only for Akaichi to 
totally forget to allow his head to make contact with the ball.
 
57 min: Msakni has a sight of goal but it’s a terribly tame finish. Diallo 
averts the danger before Tunisia break again through Akaichi, who can only 
drive at the legs of the Senegal keeper. Two half-chances squandered forTunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia>.
 
56 min: Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> cannot be 
faulted for their efforts: Msakni, who plays his club football in Qatar, 
charges onto a lost cause at the back stick, after a deep ball by Sassi. He 
very nearly hooks it back goalwards but the ball runs out of touch. Cheikh 
M’Bengue had totally given up on it.
 
55 min: Gassama does brilliantly to somehow the get ball out of his feet, and 
puts in a deep cross from the right. It falls just beyond Diouf, though, but 
this is a healthy, encouraging spell fromSenegal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> after a poor start to this 
second period.
 
52 min: Plenty of action in the opening seven minutes or so of this second 
half. Senegal get a corner, and once more there’s plenty of aggro and bizarre 
goings-on between theTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> 
defenders and the Senegalese forwards. The corner is whipped in and Mame Biram 
Diouf, unmarked, heads wide. That was a golden opportunity.
 
51 min: Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> go up the other 
end and Sassi, unselfishly, picks out Khazri who’s lingering on the edge of the 
box and his shot bends away from goal. He looks pained as he reacts to it 
firing wide.
 
50 min: Senegal then grease the wheels and it’s Keita down the right who 
surges into the box. He strikes at goal but goes for power, too much of it, and 
it goes over.Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> will not 
mind too many of those in this half.
 
49 min: The corner is taken short, to the disappointment of Abdennour and Ben 
Youssef, who trudge back to their own half. Senegal need to get a grasp on this 
second half, andTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia>, again, 
much like the opening half hour or so, look the better of the two teams.
 
48 min: Lahmar again takes the free-kick and it gets up and down over the wall 
but it fires just over Diallo’s goal. The Senegal keeper watches it go over. But
Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> come again and Sassi 
combines with Sliti once more, who eventually feeds Akaichi. Corner-kick.
 
46 min: Sassi surges towards goal, his effort his blocked and Sliti is sent 
tumbling by Senegal’s Ndiaye.Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> seemingly have started this 
second half as they mean to go on.
 
And Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> have made a change, 
with Sunderland forward Khazri replacing Azouni. Will he inspire the Carthage 
Eagles here?
 
Just before the second half gets underway, a note to say that the top three 
nominees for the African Player of the Year award have all already notched at 
this tournament. Aubameyang, Mahrez, and now Mané.
 
The second half is imminent, with both teams slowly making their way back onto 
the pitch in Franceville.
 
A half-time stat that counts for nothing: Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> had 60% of the possession in 
those opening 45 minutes.
 
Lahmar’s free-kick sails wide and at the break it’s very much Senegal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> who head down the tunnel the 
happier of the two sides. Mané got the ball rolling from the spot after a 
clumsy foul from Abdennour, the Valencia defender, before Kara’s crashing 
header doubled their lead.

scoring his team’s second goal against Tunisia. Photograph: Khaled 
Desouki/AFP/Getty Images  
45 min: Mané had a chance for his second and Senegal’s third but he cannot 
control Gassama’s cross. Anyway, as it stands, Senegal will top Group B at this 
painfully early stage, following Algeria’s earlier 2-2 draw with Zimbabwe. Just 
before the break,Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> have a 
free-kick 25 yards out after another dodgy Koulibaly challenge.
 
43 min: Senegal are going through the motions a little, and Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> look a little one-dimensional. 
There’s no Plan B available for them it seems. “Looks like Senegal are in the 
driving seat,” emails Steve. Indeed, Aliou Cissé will be satisfied with this 
first-half display so far.
 
41 min: Akaichi draws the foul from Koulibaly, and he joins Cheikh M’Bengue in 
the referee’s book. The Napoli defender appeared to lose his balance before 
essentially rugby tackling the forward, who has impressed so far here. The 
free-kick is put in swiftly butSenegal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/senegal> hook the ball clear.
 
38 min: Mané loses the ball and Msakni seizes possession inside the box, 
cutting inside after chesting the ball down. Before attempting to shoot, Mané 
gets back to distract theTunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> 
forward and the legs of Koulibaly ensure danger is averted.
 
36 min: Cheikh M’bengue is booked for a meaty challenge on Naguez. The 
free-kick is wasted, and it’s Mané this time looking for a free-kick, but in 
vein. Senegal look rather comfortable now, although every time Akaichi’s got on 
the ball,Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> look dangerous.
 
35 min: Gueye runs into trouble in the shape of Sassi, but he’s forced wide by 
Kara.Tunisia <https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> retain possession, 
just inside the opposition half, before Sliti’s shot from the edge of the area 
signals the end of some promising play.
 
33 min: From the same phase of play, Tunisia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tunisia> get a free-kick for a soft foul. 
Maaloul stands over the free-kick but that’s nice and easy for Diallo in the 
Senegal goal. Idrissa Gueye gets things going again, putting his foot on the 
ball to slow things down before spreading it wide to Mané.
