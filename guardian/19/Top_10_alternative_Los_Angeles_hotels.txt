Big-hitter LA hotels such as the Beverly Wilshire 
<http://www.fourseasons.com/beverlywilshire/> or the Hollywood Roosevelt 
<http://www.thompsonhotels.com/hotels/la/hollywood-roosevelt> are so 
well-publicised and celebrity-haunted that they often blind tourists to more 
distinctive, reasonably priced accommodation in the city. Hidden in nooks, 
crannies and side-roads of the City of Angels, there are, contrary to popular 
perception, numerous family-run guesthouses, intimate boutique hotels and even 
quirky little B&BS. You just have know where to look.

The Cadillac

Built in 1914, the looming pink and turquoise art deco Cadillac Hotel is on 
the border of Venice and Santa Monica, with rooms looking out on Santa Monica 
bay and along the coastline to Malibu. It was once the summer residence of 
Charlie Chaplin and you'll find a host of eccentrics on your doorstep. From 
bodybuilders to fire-eaters, you'll never see anything boring from your window 
at The Cadillac.

The rooms are functional, although sometimes smell like they've been hot-boxed 
by over-excited backpackers who've discovered the numerous "medical marijuana" 
dispensaries on the beach. Despite recent renovations, it's still a backpacker 
hotel at heart, and everyone's up for a good time. The view from the roof is 
the best place to watch the sunset, and you're bound to find people to share a 
beer with.

The Hollywood Pensione
 Zen room 
This family-run, three-room guest house in East Hollywood is achingly chic, 
while retaining a homely vibe. Hidden in a 1915 Craftsman house on the edge of 
Franklin Village, it has sleek and unpretentious rooms, each with a private 
bath. There's also a common lounge with a balcony, and access to a 
fully-equipped guest kitchen.

Franklin Village is the haunt of local artists and writers by day, and 
hipsters by night. You'll find one of the best second-hand bookstores in LA, 
calledCounterpoint <http://www.counterpointrecordsandbooks.com/>, within 
skipping distance of your bedroom, as well as the best comedy-theatre,the 
Upright Citizens Brigade <http://losangeles.ucbtheatre.com/>. Eat in the 
numerous restaurants in the village or buy groceries at the Mayfair Market and 
cook in the Hollywood Pensione's superbly kitted out and colorful kitchen. Then 
eat on the balcony, under the stars.

Farmer's Daughter
 Farmer’s Daughter Hotel, LA 
This has recently been renovated from a very basic roadside motel into a 
surreal tongue-in-cheek hotel that boasts all the cinematic charm of a seedy 
motel, with all the comfort of a beautifully designed boutique hotel.

"You have to keep to your roots," the manager winked at me one morning as he 
explained that the original Farmer's Daughter motel was a notorious haunt for 
desperate starlets new to the city, hoping to bump into producers from CBS 
Studios, just opposite. The hotel still harks back to kinkier days, while also 
offering free Wi-Fi and 24-hour secured valet parking. There are brightly 
coloured rocking chairs in the rooms, gingham curtains, denim bedspreads and if 
you're in the mood for love there's a "No-Tell Room" where you'll find mirrors 
on the ceiling and a fully stocked bar, as well as a mural of a wheat field to 
inspire a roll around in the hay.

Being just across the road from the Farmer's Market, the Farmer's Daughter is 
walking distance from the shops on Melrose, or a cultural wander down Museum 
Row. If jet lag has you awake before the market is open for breakfast, you can 
potter up Fairfax toCanter's, a 24-hour deli <http://www.cantersdeli.com/> 
that's been a Los Angeles Landmark since 1931.

Hotel Figueroa
 Hotel Figueroa, LA 
Located opposite the Staples Center in the urban heart of Downtown Los 
Angeles, stepping into the lobby of Hotel Figueroa is like stumbling on a 
Moroccan Riad. With high, mural-covered ceilings hung with amber lamps, and 
giant palm trees lolling next to faux-marble pillars, it's an unexpected oasis 
in the bustling concrete jungle of downtown.

It used to be a YMCA and it still has something of that vibe, but with more 
soul. It's bohemian rather than slick, but it's by far my favorite hotel down 
town. In the veranda bar, stained-glass windows spin LA's white light into 
colored patterns as you sip a mid-afternoon beer, then later in the evening you 
can take a mojito up to the Jacuzzi terrace, surrounded by cactus plants and 
skyscrapers.

The Magic Castle Hotel
 Magic Castle Hotel 
One sure-fire way to gain entrance into the iconic and secretive Magic Castle, 
the world's most famous private members' club for magicians and magic 
enthusiasts, is to stay in the nearby Magic Castle Hotel. Don't expect this 
friendly, motel-style hotel to have any of the opulence and mystery of the 
hotel's nocturnal cousin, though. There are no magicians' assistants lounging 
by the pool, or rabbits scrambling out of hats in the lobby, so if you're after 
high-drama look elsewhere. It is, however, clean and reasonably priced 
considering it's minutes from The Walk of Fame and Grauman's Chinese Theatre. 
Better still, after a hard day of sight-seeing on Hollywood Boulevard, the 
Magic Castle hotel will provide frozen popsicles while you sunbathe in their 
courtyard pool.

Highland Gardens Hotel
 Highland Gardens Hotel, LA 
The monochrome lobby, flooded with natural light and decorated with pristine 
white sofas, might as well be a different hotel from the old-fashioned guest 
rooms with their somewhat shiny bedspreads and patterned curtains, but it's 
still a reasonably priced and convenient place to stay in Los Angeles. Located 
near all the tourist sites of Hollywood Boulevard, this is slightly more grown 
up and slicker than the Magic Castle Hotel. There's a pool surrounded by a palm 
trees, and some of the rooms have private kitchen facilities. Try to get a 
courtyard-facing room.

It's worth knowing that the Highland Gardens Hotel was formerly the Landmark 
Hotel, where Janis Joplin died, so if you're feeling morbid, book room 105.

Garden Cottage B&B
 The Garden Cottage, LA 
At the base of the Hollywood Hills, on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, is the quaint 
Garden Cottage B&B, where the proprietors, Ahuva and Bob, are known for 
providing superb organic breakfasts in their garden and great local knowledge.

Of the four rooms, the Terrace Room is probably the prettiest, with a mahogany 
double bed and a large balcony overlooking the garden. Alternatively you can 
rent your own little cottage, called The Garden Cottage, with its own private 
living room and kitchen. This serene little B&B is located just on the edge of 
glamorous Beverly Hills, near the Beverly Center, so if the wholesome organic 
vibe gets too much, you can use the money you've saved on accommodation to 
binge on Louboutin shoes.

Topanga Canyon Inn
 Topanga Canyon Inn, LA 
This isn't the place to stay if you want to spend your evenings dancing in 
West Hollywood with Paris Hilton or getting drunk with the girls from America's 
Next Top Model, but it is if you want to experience the grandeur of the 
Californian countryside. Tucked among the caves, cliffs and canyons of the 
Santa Monica Mountains, Topanga Canyon boasts nearly 40 miles of trails and 
views of the Pacific Ocean, Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley.

It's a perfect jumping off point for mountain biking, horse riding or hiking, 
and it's also near a secret, romantic little bay called Topanga State Beach, 
which is quieter than other Malibu beaches because it has a rocky surface under 
the waves. The Topanga Canyon Inn is also convenient for the Getty, if you're 
looking for a splash of culture between hikes and early morning horse rides.

Cinema Suites Bed and Breakfast
 Cinema Suites Bed and Breakfast, LA 
This hotel was opened by Dianne Bennet because her show-biz friends were 
always asking for recommendations for reasonably priced, central Los Angeles 
hotels, of which she decided there were none. And so Cinema Suites was born 
with three simple, homely rooms right nearLACMA 
<http://www.lacma.org/cafam-library>, the Craft and Folk Art Museum, and the 
George C Page Park. It's slightly cluttered, a bit like the house of an 
eccentric family member, but well worth it just to meet the proprietor.

In addition to running the Cinema Suites, Dianne has been described as "LA's 
best matchmaker" and has apparently been operating nationwide since 1990. She 
claims to have a little black book full of industry contacts and her speciality 
is arranging matches between glamorous women and wealthy men. So if you're a 
single woman looking for a sugar-daddy, the Cinema Suites Bed and Breakfast 
might well be the place to head.

Loz Feliz Lodge

The Los Feliz Lodge encompasses four separate Spanish-style 1920s bungalows, 
each with colorful living rooms and kitchens. It's almost like having your own 
little flat in the heart of Los Angeles, but with less hassle, and with people 
to clean up after you.

The Lodge is walking distance to Los Feliz Village, where you can sip a 
milkshake inFred 62 <http://www.fred62.com/>, an iconic 1950s diner, or scour 
LA's favourite independent bookstore,Skylight Books 
<http://www.skylightbooks.com/>. You can also have one too many martinis in a 
Los Angeles drinking institution calledThe Dresdon <http://www.thedresden.com/> 
while listening to Marty and Elayne – a lounge act duo who have been performing 
there since 1982 – and know that you can stumble home to your own little 
bungalow without getting in a car. Bliss.
