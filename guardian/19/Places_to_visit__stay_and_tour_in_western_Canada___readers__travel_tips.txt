Winning tip: Falling buffaloes, Alberta


Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump in south-west Alberta is a Unesco world heritage 
site with a fascinating history. Herds of buffalo were deliberately stampeded 
over the cliff’s edge here by the indigenous plains people for nearly 6,000 
years. Exploring the visitor’s centre, which is built into the face of the 
cliff, we learned how the Blackfoot nation relied on the buffalo drive to 
provide food, shelter and clothing, especially over winter. The hypnotic beat 
of Blackfoot singing and drumming carried us back to the past. We hiked 
off-trail with a guide, listening to stories about the days when millions of 
buffalo roamed the windswept prairies.

Butchart Gardens, Victoria, are a glorious riot of colour, scents, birds, 
butterflies, music and choreographed fountain and firework displays. They 
started life as a quarry, owned by cement businessman Robert Pim Butchart, but 
when the limestone deposits were exhausted, his wife and company chemist, 
Jennie Butchart, decided to turn a scar on the landscape to a place of beauty. 
She began by making the quarry into a sunken garden, adding an Italian and 
Japanese garden soon afterwards. The gardens (one ofNational Geographic’s world 
top 10 
<http://www.butchartgardens.com/media/news-releases/top-10-magnificent-gardens-national-geographic>
) have remained in the family ever since 1904, the plant collection gradually 
expanding. Spectacular in every season, today they are a designatedNational 
Historic Site of Canada <http://www.pc.gc.ca/progs/lhn-nhs/intro_e.asp>.

In the sleepy mountain town of Revelstoke, the new thrill is a steep, hairy 
monorail ride down the mountain from the top of the chair lift - you will 
scream all the way as it swoops and lurches 1.4km down 279 metres of vertical 
drops and dizzy turns over the peaceful hillside. And while you’re on it, look 
out for bears!

Visit Barkerville Historic Town and park to explore a gold rush town as it was 
in 1862 (over 107 original buildings, as well as 60 replicas). The cemetery is 
particularly moving for its sparseness and remoteness; a resting place to many 
people from lands far across the globe, memorialised by name, country and claim 
number. How many found their fortune in this land of plenty? It seems that at 
least as many lost it as found it. We camped in a nearby site and cycled into 
the town for a day immersed in the life of a 19th-century frontier town – the 
courtroom, stables, homes, Chinatown, places of worship, doctors, hotels and 
newspaper offices. Far off the beaten track (there is abus from Quesnal 
<http://www.wells.ca/site-page/public-transit>), but well worth a visit.

For a sense of what the wild, free-flowing Columbia used to be like, before 
damming, visit theColumbia Wetlands, south of Golden, BC, and between Glacier 
and Yoho national parks. A good starting place is Columbia Wetlands Adventures, 
where you can rent a canoe or arrange a guided tour on a small boat. Great 
scenery and birding, and if you go in the evening, a good chance to see busy 
beavers along the shoreline.

Saltery Bay is among the loveliest of BC provincial parks. Its campground is 
covered in a carpet of moss, making for a comfortable night’s sleep. Near the 
site you can see fantastic marine life in the clear tidal pools. The campground 
is 1km north of Saltery Bay ferry terminal and 27km south of Powell River, 
which is home to theTownsite Brewery <http://townsitebrewing.com/>, the creator 
of the amber Suncoast ale. Saltery Bay and Powell River are great stops on a 
road trip up the Sunshine Coast and onwards to Vancouver Island and also great 
jumping-off points for an adventure into Desolation Sound or the 57kmPowell 
Forest Canoe Route

At the Mount Assiniboine provincial park there are relatively cheap mountain 
huts, with well-appointed kitchens, or visitors can splash out for a stay in 
Assiniboine Lodge (built in 1928, the first backcountry ski lodge in the 
Canadian Rockies). Enjoy wondrous lakes, passes, and some of the highest peaks 
in the Rockies, with the added spice of grizzly bears (some of the trails are 
closed off in late summer to “reduce human-grizzly conflicts”). Access is by 
helicopter (£90pp) from Canmore or dirt track and a 27km hike via Bryant Creek.

God’s Mountain in BC’s Okanagan valley is an unusual, small B&B, run by an 
English woman and (when we were there) staffed by interesting people from all 
over the world. It’s in a vineyard above a lake, with deer roaming the slopes 
below at sunset. It has a roofless room with a four-poster bed and curtains, 
but the rest of the room, including the bathroom, is open to the sky. It’s an 
amazing and peaceful place to stay. The valley itself has great cycle paths 
through the many tourist-friendly wineries and it’s only a day (or two if you 
stop somewhere on the way) from Vancouver.

Dinosaur provincial park in Alberta is a Unesco world heritage site three 
hours’ drive south-east of Calgary. It is absolutely otherworldy with the most 
fascinating topography. The two-hour bus tour we took around the site, guided 
by a paleontologist, was essential to our understanding of the area and we 
learned how to find fossils (which of course must not be disturbed) on our own. 
We “comfort camped” in fabulously luxurious andwell-equipped tents

right on the Red Deer river. A fabulous experience and off the beaten tourist 
track.
