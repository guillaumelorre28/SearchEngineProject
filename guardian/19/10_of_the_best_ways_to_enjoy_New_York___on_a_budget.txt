Take to the water

Despite recent stories of hapless tourists being charged $200 a ride 
<http://nypost.com/2015/05/30/tourists-tricked-into-paying-200-for-free-staten-island-ferry-ride/>
 by alleged scammers, theStaten Island ferry <http://www.siferry.com/> is still 
as free as it has been since 1997 and offers a dazzling view of the southern 
tip of Manhattan, Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty as it chugs out across 
New York Bay to the fifth borough and back again. Also free at weekends 
(although it’s $5 on weekdays) is theIkea ferry 
<http://www.nywatertaxi.com/tours/ikea> that runs from Wall Street to the 
Swedish furniture store in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and theEast River ferry 
<http://www.eastriverferry.com/> from Manhattan to Brooklyn ($4 weekdays, $6 
weekends) is another scenic option. If you do decide you want to splash out, the
Circle line ferry <https://www.circleline42.com/>, which circumnavigates 
Manhattan island in two-and-a-half hours for $41, really gives you a 
comprehensive perspective on the city.

Buffalo stance: New York state’s forgotten city is coming in from the cold

Accommodation costs in New York can be as high as the city’s famous 
skyscrapers, but there are usually some bargains to be had among the array of 
properties available for holiday let onAirbnb 
<https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/New-York--NY>, particularly if you avoid Manhattan. 
A bargain probably still means $100 a night for an apartment but, if you are 
willing to stay in a room in someone’s place, rather than having an apartment 
to yourself, you can cut the price to under $60. A flat-swap website such as
HomeExchange 
<https://www.homeexchange.com/en/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=homeexchange&utm_campaign=English%20-%20UK&mkwid=sp3Fd54TI%7Cdc&pcrid=53448673074&gclid=CjwKEAjwxMetBRDJx6Sz2p7DsQ0SJADJHAqNL6_NDCwYtm5DixDlTu05xL72pL2rIO82NgOgeVowVRoC0Kjw_wcB>
 is another option, although it’s obviously not for everyone. If you don’t 
fancy staying in an apartment, rooms at theBowery House hotel-hostel 
<http://www.theboweryhouse.com/> in Nolita start at $109 a night for a double, 
while the summer rates at theChelsea International Hostel 
<http://www.chelseahostel.com/> on West 20th Street start at $75 for a single 
room with a shared bathroom, $140 for a private en suite double and $62 a 
person to stay in a dorm.

For the classic American diner experience, sit yourself down in one of the 
red-leather booths of theWaverly restaurant <http://www.waverlyrestaurant.net/> 
(cheeseburger $8.05) in Greenwich Village. Or if you want a wider selectionhead 
to Williamsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/feb/01/tour-brooklyn-footsteps-lena-dunhams-girls>
 on a Saturday orBrooklyn Bridge Park <http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/> on a 
Sunday to visitSmorgasburg <http://www.smorgasburg.com/>, an increasingly 
popular collection of open-air food stalls. Restaurants can be pricey in New 
York – especially once you factor in the mandatory 15%-20% tip – butGruppo 
<http://www.gruppothincrust.com/index.html> in Alphabet City is a good option 
for inexpensive and very tasty thin-crust pizza, and Cafe Argentino (499 Grand 
Street, +1 718 782 9477) in Williamsburg offers a $10 brunch. And if the well 
really has run dry, most delis offer a selection of cooked meals, usually 
charged by weight. For a cheap drink, try thePeter McManus Cafe 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Peter-McManus-Cafe/319879212077> in Chelsea, a 
friendly Irish pub where the bar staff will often give you a round on the 
house, orJimmy’s Corner <https://www.facebook.com/jimmyscornernyc> near Times 
Square, the best bar in that area.

New York was made to be seen from up high but, unfortunately, the observation 
decks of theEmpire State Building <http://www.esbnyc.com/> ($32), the 
Rockefeller Center <https://www.rockefellercenter.com/> ($30), and the new 1 
World Trade Center 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/20/one-world-trade-center-elevators-500->
 ($32) will all set you back a pretty penny. Another option is to go to a 
rooftop bar and make a drink or two last while you enjoy the view. The best in 
town is theStandard hotel <http://www.standardhotels.com/high-line> in the 
Meatpacking District, which has a beautiful copper-coloured bar on the top 
floor and a busy roof garden overlooking the Hudson River. The staff can be a 
bit sniffy about who gets in – in the evening – but they’re friendlier in the 
afternoon. Also worth trying is230 Fifth <http://www.230-fifth.com/> in 
Midtown, while in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, theWythe hotel 
<http://wythehotel.com/> has a sweeping view across the East river of the 
Manhattan skyline. It’s unbeatable in the early evening as the sun goes down.

The decade-long effort by two Chelsea residents 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/22/final-stretch-new-york-high-line-complete>
, Joshua David and Robert Hammond, to transform the abandoned and overgrown 
tracks of the old elevated freight train line along the city’s west side into a 
“park in the sky” -the High Line <http://www.thehighline.org/visit> - has 
blossomed into one of New York’s most popular attractions. Strolling above the 
traffic among the semi-wild meadow plants – meant to evoke the decades when the 
tracks had reverted back to nature – provides a peaceful respite from the 
hustle and bustle of the city below, and there’s something rather European 
about promenading from one end to the other, not in order to arrive at any 
particular destination, but simply for the joy of it.Central Park 
<http://www.centralparknyc.org/?referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/> gives you 
even more of feeling of having been suddenly removed from the city; its 840 
acres include a reservoir, a boating lake, sports fields, a zoo and more, and 
the line of Midtown towers framing its woods, meadows and gardens to the south 
is a quintessential New York view.Prospect Park <https://www.prospectpark.org/> 
in Brooklyn is not much smaller and includes the beautiful cherry trees of the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden <http://www.bbg.org/>.

They don’t like to shout about it but the $25 fee to enter the prestigious 
Metropolitan Museum of Art <http://www.metmuseum.org/> in Central Park is 
actually a “recommended” amount: you can pay what you wish. John Singer 
Sargent’s portraits of the members of his artistic circle – including Monet, 
Rodin and Henry James – are on display at the moment, while the permanent 
collection covering Greece, Rome, Egypt and European and American art is 
unmissable. TheWhitney Museum of American Art <http://whitney.org/>, which has 
justreopened in a brand-new building 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/30/michelle-obama-whitney-museum-new-york>
 at the southern end of the High Line, also allows you to pay what you wish on 
Fridays between 7pm and 10pm. Its opening exhibition is a stunning survey of 
the US art scene from the beginning of the 20th century to today, while New 
York and New Jersey are themselves framed and presented as works of art through 
the huge glass windows at the east and west sides of the building. TheMuseum of 
Modern Art <http://www.moma.org/> on 53rd Street is also free on Fridays from 
4pm. Don’t miss Jacob Lawrence’s striking Migration Series: the story of 
African-Americans’ journey north in the wake of the first and second world 
wars, told through 60 tempera panels painted in vivid blocks of colour.

During the sweltering summer, the city opens dozens of free outdoor swimming 
pools 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-swimming-blog/2014/jan/28/swimming-in-new-york-community-pools>
 across the five boroughs, many of them enormous.Asser Levy pool 
<http://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/recreationcenters/M164> on East 23rd 
Street might be a good place to start. If you prefer a cycle ride, you could 
try picking up aCiti Bike <https://www.citibikenyc.com/> from the city’s 
on-street cycle-hire scheme. There are stations spread across Manhattan below 
60th Street, and in several areas of Brooklyn including Williamsburg, Brooklyn 
Heights and Fort Greene. Twenty-four hour access costs $9.95 although, if a 
single journey lasts longer than 30 minutes, you begin to rack up extra fees. 
For a longer ride, you would be better off hiring a bike from one of the 
numerous cycle shops in the city. AtNYC Velo <http://www.nycvelo.com/> on 
Second Avenue in the East Village, or 11th Avenue in Hell’s Kitchen, prices 
start at $30 for 24 hours. The most enjoyable and safest trip is along thecycle 
path that runs up the whole west side of Manhattan 
<http://www.nycbikemaps.com/maps/manhattan-bike-map/>, along the Hudson River – 
it’s a scenic journey that ends at the George Washington bridge, underneath 
which you will find the Little Red Lighthouse immortalised in Hildegarde 
Swift’s 1942 children’s book.

and tours of Harlem, Little Italy and Chinatown. I’d recommend the tour of 
Greenwich Village, which tells the story of the founding of this patchwork of 
dappled downtown streets by the Dutch as Groenwijck (Green District) in the 
17th century up to its heyday as the home of the 1960s folk scene, taking in 
Cafe Wha? and the apartment where Bob Dylan wrote Blowin’ in the Wind. The tour 
also looks at the Village’s key part in the struggle for gay rights following 
the Stonewall riots in 1969, and you’ll also see an open-air swimming pool that 
the young Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro used to break into at night, right 
across the street from a house where Marlon Brando once kept a raccoon in the 
bathtub. As with many supposedly free walking tours, you’re encouraged to tip 
the guide at the end: $10 or $20 seems to be the going rate.

One of New York’s most recognisable landmarks, the Brooklyn bridge was built 
in 1883, and its limestone and granite neo-gothic towers make it far more 
imposing than the steel bridges that followed it further up the East river. The 
bridge’s pedestrian and cycle pathway is elevated, so it offers fantastic views 
of the Manhattan skyline and downtown Brooklyn. It can be a bit of a scrum on 
there sometimes as tourists stop for photos and to attach love locks to its 
metal latticework fencing – so walking across may take longer than you think. 
If you cross from Manhattan to Brooklyn, walk down through the Dumbo district 
afterwards and have a coffee or an ice-cream in Brooklyn Bridge Park, which 
runs along the shoreline and currently features an enjoyable sculpture 
exhibition byJeppe Hein called Please Touch the Art

While the September 11 attack has already passed into history as the 
geopolitical turning point of the early 21st century, the9/11 memorial 
<http://www.911memorial.org/> (tickets for the museum cost $24 for adults, free 
on Tuesdays from 5pm) by architect Michael Arad and landscape architect Peter 
Walker successfully turns the focus back on to the nearly 3,000 people who died 
in the atrocity. The memorial consists of two enormous waterfalls pouring into 
the foundations where the Twin Towers once stood, with the names of the victims 
cut into a metal rim around them. It communicates a powerful sense of loss and 
absence.
