by number of performing arts companies and film industry facilities per 100,000 
citizens. And it was in the top 25 for the number of art schools, art galleries

.

“Bristol has a strong sense of freedom and open-mindedness, but also of mutual 
support,” says Kimberly Rogers, operation manager at Hamilton House, a creative 
community in Stokes Croft that features studios, workshops and event spaces.

“It’s this energy that has developed a deeply embedded and respected culture 
of creativity and expression. Organisations such as our own foster this 
culture, with community-led and inspired social and cultural projects 
intertwining and working together. It’s this city-felt sense of collaboration 
that creates such a big impact.”
