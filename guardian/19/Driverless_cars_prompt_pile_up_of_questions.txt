As a London taxi driver on the front line of the impact of driverless cars, I 
found Jackie Ashley’s article (Driverless cars should be a major political issue
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/driverless-cars-boon-bane-coming-down-fast-lane>
, 2 January) long overdue. Many of the questions she raises are worrying.

The idea that faceless corporations such as Uber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber> are developing this technology to 
give it away for the greater good of mankind and the environment is 
questionable. Once these non-national monopolies take control, they will have 
the power to set the price for the job, and my bet is it will not be as cheap 
as Jackie predicts. Just check out the companies and individuals who have 
bought shares in these tech platforms, there’s hardly an idealist among them.

Volkswagen and Ford <https://www.theguardian.com/business/ford> are not 
investing in joint ventures with Uber etc to sell fewer cars. They are in the 
game to increase production.

As for driverless cars increasing the safety of vulnerable members of the 
travelling public, this is unproven – a car’s computer could be hacked, causing 
safety issues. If there is an accident, who will be legally to blame? If Uber 
doesn’t pay its taxes in the UK, would it be bound by UK law in a road traffic 
accident caused by an algorithm emanating anywhere on the planet?

I am sure most London cab drivers would be willing to discuss this further 
with Jackie for the cost of a metered and regulated cab fare from York Way.

, 3 January) and Jackie Ashley are right about the benevolent effects of 
driverless cars. We will have to ensure that ownership, distribution and use 
are organised socially rather than by corporate monopolies, which will have no 
interest in passing on reduced costs; so Wikipedia, not Google. We may also 
need to take over the manufacturers since they are unlikely to go along with an 
80% reduction in production. And we will have to engineer a major shift in 
social attitudes to ownership if collective benefits are not to be trumped by 
the premium attached to private convenience and status.
