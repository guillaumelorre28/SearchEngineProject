Sweetwater Music Hall

The second iteration of this beloved Mill Valley club in Marin County opened 
only in 2011 and features fine dining, patio eating and a 300-seat nightclub in 
an old Mason's lodge. The original Sweetwater was a friendly, 80-seat closet 
that served as the Marin music community's living room for 30 years, where 
Jerry Garcia and Elvis Costello jammed once with James Burton, the fabled 
guitarist for Elvis Presley. The new, improved edition regularly attracts 
impromptu performances by neighbours such as Bob Weir, Sammy Hagar or Bonnie 
Raitt, effectively retaining the informal, homey atmosphere of the predecessor, 
booking a mixture of local musicians and touring acts.

Fillmore Auditorium

The hallowed days of the 60s, when giants walked the tiny stage – Grateful Dead
 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/grateful-dead>, Jefferson Airplane, The 
Doors <https://www.theguardian.com/music/doors>, Led Zeppelin, Cream, Jimi 
Hendrix – were long gone when the upstairs dance hall (where promoter Bill 
Graham established the San Francisco rock scene) reopened in 1985 with velvet 
curtains and crystal chandeliers, but the ghosts still haunt the room. The 
walls of an upstairs bar are covered with framed posters from those historic 
shows and the hall has flourished many nights a week, presenting top acts – Tom 
Petty and the Heartbreakers did a memorable run of more than 20 shows in 1999 
and big stars regularly underplay the market so they can work the Fillmore.

Bimbo's 365 Club

A grand relic from the golden age of nightclubs, Bimbo's 365 Club was opened 
on its present site in 1951 by the former operator of the city's top speakeasy 
during prohibition, Bimbo Giuntoli, and his family have maintained the venue in 
gleaming, pristine condition ever since. All the supper-club acts of the 50s 
and 60s worked the room – from Louis Prima to Glen Campbell. Bimbo's grandson 
Michael Cerchiai now books a steady stream of bands at the gilded 750-seat club 
with its parquet dancefloor and men's room attendant, once home to The Girl in 
the Fishbowl, which was re-created for The Chris Isaak Show.

Slim's

Owned by a partnership formed by rock star Boz Scaggs, who kept a studio for 
many years in the alley behind the club, Slim's started out life as a 
rhythm-and-blues roadhouse, but quickly adopted a broader musical palette that 
ranges from punk rock to indie rock, from blues to hip-hop, booked by savvy 
veteran Dawn Holliday, who also produces the massive annual free music festival 
Hardly Strictly Bluegrass in Golden Gate park every October. The 600-seat club 
features a broad array of touring musical acts five or six nights a week – 
including The Damned and The Afghan Whigs – and is the keystone club on a 
nightlife strip on Eleventh Street, where club-goers throng the sidewalk on 
weekend nights and dine at a street-food park on the corner.

Great American Music Hall

Built the year after the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 demolished the 
neighbourhood, this baroque gilded hall was once a fancy restaurant and a 
bordello, as well as home to famed fan dancer Sally Rand in the 1930s. 
Converted to the Great American Music Hall in 1972, the club concentrated on 
jazz for the first decade – Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Carmen MacRae, Dizzy 
Gillespie, Betty Carter – before expanding into wider genres. Van Morrison 
frequently played the elegant 450-seat room with the marble pillars and 
wrap-around balcony when he lived in the area during the 70s and 80s. Taken 
over in 2002 by the partnership that also manages Slim's, the Music Hall offers 
a steady diet of high-calibre names in rock, folk and pop music in an elegant 
setting – David Crosby, Richard Thompson and Suzanne Vega to name but a few.

Yoshi's

Once only a small room off to the side of an Oakland sushi restaurant, Yoshi's 
now operates two primetime nightclubs in major urban redevelopments – Oakland's 
Jack London Square and San Francisco's Fillmore Street, once a jazz corridor, 
recently brought back to life with a second Yoshi's as the anchor tenant. The 
350-seat Jack London Square venue opened in 1997. Both locations continue to 
serve fine Japanese food in dining rooms adjacent to the club, but the 
showrooms are magnificent and, since the 2007 opening of the larger San 
Francisco club, the programming has opened up to include all kinds of soul, 
rock, R&B and hip-hop, in addition to top-flight jazz and Latin performers. 
Dave Masom, TV's Wonder Woman, Lynda Carter, who has a supper club act, and 80s 
pop star Taylor Dayne are some of the eclectic performers. Oakland has featured 
Stanley Clarke, Jack Jones, Cassandra Wilson and Allen Toussaint.

SF Jazz

SF Jazz impresario Randall Kline opened this $64m centre for jazz performance 
in January 2013, after more than 30 years of presenting his gypsy jazz festival 
at various locales around the city. Designed by architect Mark Cavagnero, the 
three-storey building with the syncopated exterior and glass-sided ground floor 
was an instant landmark. The main showroom with the supersonic Meyer Sound 
system is a modern, high-tech marvel and the building also includes a cafe and 
smaller lounge for more intimate performances. The musical menu is not strictly 
jazz, featuring forays into acoustic pop and experimental music, poetry and 
soul singers. Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks recently performed a tribute to 
jazzman Fats Waller here, probably one of the greatest jazz concert halls in 
the world.

Freight & Salvage

A couple of acoustic music-minded billionaires helped fund the $13m remodel 
that turned this old auto shop on Berkeley's culture gulch off Shattuck Avenue 
(across the street from theBerkeley Repertory Theatre 
<https://www.berkeleyrep.org/>) into one of the finest folk-music emporiums in 
the country. In a spacious room that seats 400 and is panelled with distressed 
wood pulled from the original building, the biggest names in acoustic music 
work the room – including Greg Brown, Kathy Mattea and Jim Kweskin – having 
risen through the ranks playing one or two of the club's previous, more humble, 
locations, which have been running since 1968. The new building includes 
upstairs rooms for music lessons and conferences, making The Freight an 
authentic culture centre.

This hive buzzes in the centre of the Mission District's throbbing nightlife 
scene, an immediate focal point of hipster happenings since its 2012 opening. 
The showroom is a former chapel with a peak-roof and large balcony in the rear, 
in a sprawling complex that once housed a funeral home. Techies throng the 
Chapel Bar, show or no – large, sliding wooden doors reveal the showroom from 
the bar when the show is on. The Vestry Restaurant feeds the audiences. Indie 
rock bands from San Francisco and across the country crowd the schedule.

Archbishop Franzo King and Reverend Mother Marina King started the Saint John 
Coltrane Church 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/aug/19/culture.sanfrancisco.unitedstates>
, a San Francisco idiosyncrasy since 1970, following a spiritual vision that 
came to the couple while attending a performance by the great jazz saxophonist 
in 1965. The church has moved to a small, intimate storefront on Fillmore 
Street. The inside is crowded with devotional art and space is limited to about 
30 worshippers. The Archbishop leads the congregation on sax, eeking and 
squeaking, while people bang on tambourines, tinkle pianos and raise cacophony 
to the greater glory.
