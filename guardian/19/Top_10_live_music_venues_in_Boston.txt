House of Blues

Although the House of Blues is now a successful chain of 13 music venues 
across the country, the franchise started in 1992 in a converted art house in 
Cambridge's Harvard Square. That room closed 10 years ago, but the House of 
Blues theme returned to Boston in February 2009, creating a premier 
2,500-capacity room with a seated balcony. Situated next to Fenway Park, the 
biggest "club" in Boston has hosted everyone from Bob Dylan toDeadmau5

Brighton Music Hall

Located in the heart of Allston Rock City's populous student village, the club 
known for 40 years as Harpers Ferry received a much-needed reboot in January 
2011 – and with it came a revitalised live slate of young, touring buzz bands 
and top-shelf locals. When bigger acts want to play an intimate club show (the 
capacity is 400), they come here – whether it'sTegan and Sara 
<http://www.teganandsara.com/> or the Dropkick Murphys 
<http://www.dropkickmurphys.com/>, who play annually during St Patrick's Day 
week.

Great Scott

A former frat bar equidistant from Boston University and Boston College, Great 
Scott had a dramatic makeover 10 years ago into an indie rock mecca, placing it 
among the best small-sized rock clubs in the country. It has a 240-person 
capacity and a mix of dance nights – including long-running Britpop party The 
Pill – and live shows. The band playing tonight could be huge in two years.

The Plough & Stars

 Photograph: Alamy 
Cambridge has its share of live music venues, but the tiny Plough & Stars is 
the sort of neighbourhood bar where you can have a pint and watch your friend's 
band. Opened in 1969, the Plough is a respected beer bar on a corner between 
Harvard and Central squares. Its cosy decor and lived-in heritage allows for a 
welcoming, friendly atmosphere – perfect for the city's up-and-coming 
singer-songwriters and familiar neighbourhood faces. Pay no mind to Cheers 
across the river; it's at the Plough where everybody knows your name.

The Sinclair
 Sinclair, Boston 
The newest kid on the block, the Sinclair opened in Harvard Square earlier 
this year, to immediate acclaim. It's a live-music venue and restaurant, run by 
The Bowery and noted chef Michael Schlow, and has an ambitious roster of acts. 
The "landing spot" perch above the front of house is perhaps the best place in 
town to watch a gig, and the side balconies put you comfortably above the sonic 
fray. Anchoring the main bar is an antique wooden bureau that allegedly has 
mysterious inscriptions from Harvard University fraternities of decades past.

TT The Bear's Place
 TT the bear's place 
Made famous in the 1990s by hosting Sebadoh's Ocean music video 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6vvlag30Zs> (hey, there's Lou Barlow crying 
out back!), TT The Bear's Place is celebrating its 40th anniversary in 2013. 
Everyone from the Pixies to the Strokes to Franz Ferdinand played early shows 
here, and the 330-person room now houses a popular weekly new-wave night spun 
by DJ Chris Ewen (Future Bible Heroes 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9sAWargacM>). In case you were wondering, the 
"TT" stands for "Tough Teddy" – the former pet hamster of its longtime owner, 
Bonnie Bouley.

The Lizard Lounge
 lizard lounge 
Known as much for poetry slams and open mic nights, the Lizard Lounge is a 
warm and intimate subterranean space, and a seasoned destination for jazz, folk 
and roots rock. A musicians' venue, it's home to local luminaries such as Bill 
Janovitz,Dennis Brennan <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD7AI0j6a94> and Duke 
Levine <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPValLR5DIA>. Many artists return after 
cutting their teeth on its open mic night.

The Middle East
 Middle East, Boston 
The Middle East is more than just a rock club: it's a complex that also boasts 
restaurants and a smaller companion venue in ZuZu, home to several of the 
area's best dance parties. But it's the Middle East's two live music spaces, 
the "Upstairs" and the larger "Downstairs", that make this the live music 
centrepiece of Cambridge. Located in Mark Sandman Square, named after the late
Morphine <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKtDxX_Gzts> singer/slide bassist, the 
Middle East is a musical institution for all genres, and a cultural centre.

Middlesex Lounge
 Middlesex Boston 
Stodgy rock town Boston was one of the last places to embrace electronic dance 
music, but the Middlesex Lounge has been providing a steady beat since 2004. 
Live shows have a DIY feel, as indie bands perform on the floor (there's no 
stage), but the real draw is the wealth of DJ nights, including techno mainstay 
Make It New. The room's minimalist decor is sleek and cool, and the cocktail 
menu keeps the hip crowd – fashionable twentysomethings and brainy students 
from nearby MIT – dancing until last call.

The Paradise Rock Club
 Paradise Rock Club, Boston 
Ever since U2 played here in 1980, the Paradise has been the best live music 
venue in Boston. Its rectangular shape and wide stage running along one side 
means concertgoers are close to the action. A first stop for British bands over 
the years (Suede's gear was stolen outside the club in 1997), the 'Dise offers 
a wide range of shows – the September calendar boasts Haim, Arctic Monkeys and
Jake Bugg <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY0oPg1h8fQ>.
