Full-time: Gabon 1-1 Burkina Faso

Another 1-1 draw in this group leaves the hosts in a dicey position: they’ll 
probably need to beat Cameroon in their last match, while Burkina face Guinea 
Bissau. While it’s true thatGabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> 
might have won here if not for the excellence of the opposing goalkeeper, 
20-year-old Hervé Koffi, they generally lacked attacking fluency and Burkina 
were the better side for some chunks of the game. Still, the first of the 
second round of matches suggests this tournament is gathering momentum. And on 
that note, bye.

90+3 min: One last chance for Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>? A freekick midway inside the 
Burkina half gives Bouanga an opportunity to send one into what is known in 
these parts as ‘the mixer’. But it’s a bad delivery.

90 min: There will be at least four more minutes. That announcement is greeted 
by boos from the locals, who are wondering how there is not more time to be 
added on after so many injuries and substitutions.

88 min: Bounaga does superbly on the right to create space for a cross despite 
being pestered by the excellent Coulibaly. The delivery from right beside the 
corner flag is superb. Kevyn gets a firm header to it eight yards from goal ... 
but sends it inches past the far post! So close to a winner for the hosts!

85 min: Ndong gives away possession cheaply in midfield. Nakooulma sweeps a 
fine pass wide to Traoré, who clips a pass towards Diawara near the penalty 
spot. Appindagoyé shoulders him to the ground. The forward shouts for a penalty 
but the referee wisely ignores him.

81 min: Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> hoiks a cross 
towards the far post. Aubameyang heads back across goal and Bouanga opens fire 
from seven yards. But Koffi makes a brilliant save with his left foot, showing 
superb reflexes and agility to kick out and send the ball over the bar! The 
20-year-old gave away the penalty after underestimating the pace of Aubameyang 
(and he’s not the first to do that) but other than that he has been excellent.

78 min: Bertrand Traoré gives the ball away 30 yards from his own goal - and

Gabon substitution: Ngoulai on, Tandjigora off. The latter was injured - this 
pitch is taking a toll.

64 min: Palun ventures forward in an effort to get Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> back on the front foot. But his 
bad pass gives Burkina an opportunity to put the pressure back on, and Alain 
Traoré duly sweeps the ball into the place where Palun would normally have 
been. Nakoulma collects it and bounds towards the box, but Ecuélé Manga gets 
back and does well to stick the ball out for a corner.

58 min: Lovely dart and dribble by Bertrand Traoré! It took him between two 
defenders at the edge of the area and then he tried to curl a low shot towards 
the far corner. It took a deflection off the trailing leg of a defender before 
Ovono palmed it away.

57 min: There were suggestions at half-time that Burkina might downgrade their 
ambition and settle for a draw here in the expectation of beating Guinea Bissau 
in their last group match. But they have sensibly eschewed that option and are 
going for the win here: and they’re been on top for most of the second half.

52 min: Bouanga is shunted to the ground by Jonathan Zongo as Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> try to complete another 
counter-attack. It’s a freekick to the hosts but it won’t be taken until 
Burkina make another substitution, Zongo having injured himself in that 
challenge. It’s Bertrand Traoré time.

50 min: The crowd squeal with excitement as a Burkina attack breaks down and 
the ball squirts out to Aubameyang, who sets off on a gallop towards the other 
end. But the Dortmund striker disappoints his adoring fans by mislaying an 
attempted pass to Evouna.

Half-time: Gabon 1-1 Burkina Faso

That was highly enjoyable and the second half should be likewise: both these 
teams are intent on victory and playing at a cracking tempo and total 
commitment. A bit of pushing and shoving as they go off the pitch for a break 
augurs well for the next period. In the mean time, why not have a gander atsome 
of the best goals scored in the last few days

42 min: Corner to Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>, whose 
confidence has been restored by the goal. Poko clips one over to the penalty 
spot, where Ecuélé Manga meets it with his full forehead but fails to guide his 
shot on target.

40 min: Are we going to have a third substitution in the first half? Poko is 
down clutching his shoulder after landing heavily following a tackle. This 
pitch must is evidently very hard, a fact also shown by the height to which the 
ball bounces.

PENALTY TO GABON!

Koffi hared off his line to intercept a long through-ball - but Aubameyang was 
too fast for him and nicked the ball past him before being felled. The keeper 
is booked. Can he redeem himself by saving the spotkick?

34 min: Malo tries his luck from long range. No bobble will help him, however, 
because his shot is nowhere near the ground, nor the goal.

29 min: Koffi spills a long-range shot by Bouanga. That’s almost inevitable on 
this bobbly pitch so regular shooting - and following up - are well in order.

27 min: Burkina are doing a job on Gabon now alright. They’re showing their 
power and their experience to tighten their grip on this game.Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> are looking frazzled and cannot 
get the ball to Aubemeyang, who has pulled wide to the right in the hope of 
making himself more available.

25 min: The hosts are under enormous pressure now and it looks like they’ll 
need time to come to terms with it - but Burkina don’t intend to give them 
that: they’re swarming all over them with renewed vigour now, forcing mistakes 
and fraying nerves even further.

GOAL! Gabon 0-1 Burkina Faso (Nakoulma 22)

The substitute scores with a straightforward counter-attack! A punt clear from 
the Burkina box was intended solely to relieve pressure but it turned into a 
perfect through-ball when Obiang got flustered under pressure from Nakoulma and 
made a mess of a header. Nakoulma raced through on goal and, as two defenders 
converged on him, shunted it past Ovono and into the net!

20 min: Aubameyang sets off in pursuit of a clever pass into the right 
channel. But the ball travels fast and untrue on this pitch and runs out of 
play before even Aubameyang can retrieve it.

17 min: First-class look of disgust on the face of Evouna after Palun fails to 
collect his pass near half-way. Palun’s look, meanwhile, seems intended to 
convey the point that he might have collected the pass if it had not been so 
far away from him.

14 min: Diawara literally has a pain in his ass. After leaping high to 
challenge for a header he fell derrière-first on the hard ground and winced 
accordingly. Fortunately being doused with water and rubbed by a physio seems 
to have sorted him out, so Burkina do not need to make a second substitution 
just yet.

12 min: It’s been all Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> so 
far. They’re playing with admirable speed and purpose, and regularly stretching 
the Burkinabe defence. Having said that, Abdou Traoré has just given them a 
reminder about the dangers of easing off, as he pounced on a loose ball and 
fired off a shot that nearly befuddled the keeper, Ovono needing two attempts 
to hold it. Sending in shots that bounce in front of the keeper are a smart 
ploy in this pitch, like the way cricket spinners thrive on scruffy wickets.

7 min: Dayo fails to clear a cross from the left properly and it falls to 
Bouanga, who smashes it first-time on the half-volley from 12 yards. Koffi 
reacts brilliantly to tip it on to the crossbar! Aubameyang tries to nod the 
rebound into the net but can’t get enough power on his header, so Koffi gets up 
to gather with ease. So close forGabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>, who’ve made a roaring start!

2 min: Evouna gives an early sample of his dribbling prowess, skittering down 
the right and into the Burkinabe box. He then pokes a pass though to Poko, 
who’s closed down before he can get off a clean shot from eight yards. But that 
was encouraging forGabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> 
nonetheless.

The Burkinabe players belt out their national anthem and well they might: it 
was written by Thomas Sankara, no less. The Gabonese one is recited more 
nervously, by the players at least; the crowd in the stadium in Libreville, 
which looks about half-full, give it more gusto.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/burkinafaso> are resplendent in white, 
while Gabon are wearing yellows jerseys, blue shorts and green socks, which is 
essentially their national flag in football kit format.

Preamble

Hello. Let’s not perfume a dungheap: most of the matches in the first round of 
this tournament were total stinkers. Of the most fancied countries only Senegal 
and, at a push, DR Congo have vindicated their status so far, while the other 
most notable performers have been less highly billed sides, with Zimbabwe, 
Guinea Bissau and Togo doing well to justify their presence. Everyone else has 
been varying degrees of plod.

The good thing is that means that the second round of matches should be 
contested by teams doing their utmost to improve, starting with Gabon and
Burkina Faso <https://www.theguardian.com/football/burkinafaso>. There is, of 
course, the danger that the tightness of Group A (both of the opening matches 
ended 1-1) could lead to caution but let’s hope that both sides choose audacity 
and, more to the point, show that they have the talent to match their 
ambitions. Go Panthers! Go Stallions! Pretty please!

The onus is on Gabon, in particular. The hosts first performance was 
error-strewn. Perhaps nerves were a factor, though the first mistake was 
committed by the manager, Jose Antonio Camacho, who deployed an unbalanced 
side, as Merlin Tandjigora turned out to be not quite magical enough to secure 
midfield on his lonesome. Gabon also suffered from a grievous lack of 
creativity, with no sign of Malick Evouna’s dribbling skills or Mario Lemina’s 
passing ability. Poor old Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang was more akin to a blowfly 
than a Panther, left to feed off rotten remains.Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> need to provide their brilliant 
striker with far better service if they are to progress.

 The players from the Country of Honourable People, meanwhile, looked 
defensively vulnerable and on course for a walloping in their opening match but 
fought back well in the second half to draw with Cameroon. Banou Diawara, the 
super sub who triggered those super scenes in the final game of the qualifying 
campaign by hitting a stoppage time winner against Botswana, made another big 
impact from the bench in the match against Cameroon, though the equaliser was 
scored by Issoufou Dayo. Paulo Durate, Burkina’s Portuguese manager, admitted 
that he got his initial tactics wrong against Cameroon – actually, he said that 
his players, though very experienced, seemed confused by his plan, which is the 
same thing as admitting he messed up – so it’ll be interesting to see whether 
they make a better start today. Duarte should know enough about Gabon and his 
own players to at least devise a clear plot, as he managed the Panthers, 
unsuccessfully, before returning for a second spell in charge of Burkina.

In short, the stakes are high for this one and there’s no telling which way 
it’ll go. But 2-1 to Gabon in a drama-filled contest seems the most likely 
denouement. Will you stay tuned now?

Another 1-1 draw in this group leaves the hosts in a dicey position: they’ll 
probably need to beat Cameroon in their last match, while Burkina face Guinea 
Bissau. While it’s true thatGabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> 
might have won here if not for the excellence of the opposing goalkeeper, 
20-year-old Hervé Koffi, they generally lacked attacking fluency and Burkina 
were the better side for some chunks of the game. Still, the first of the 
second round of matches suggests this tournament is gathering momentum. And on 
that note, bye.
 
90+3 min: One last chance for Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>? A freekick midway inside the 
Burkina half gives Bouanga an opportunity to send one into what is known in 
these parts as ‘the mixer’. But it’s a bad delivery.
 
90 min: There will be at least four more minutes. That announcement is greeted 
by boos from the locals, who are wondering how there is not more time to be 
added on after so many injuries and substitutions.
 
88 min: Bounaga does superbly on the right to create space for a cross despite 
being pestered by the excellent Coulibaly. The delivery from right beside the 
corner flag is superb. Kevyn gets a firm header to it eight yards from goal ... 
but sends it inches past the far post! So close to a winner for the hosts!
 
85 min: Ndong gives away possession cheaply in midfield. Nakooulma sweeps a 
fine pass wide to Traoré, who clips a pass towards Diawara near the penalty 
spot. Appindagoyé shoulders him to the ground. The forward shouts for a penalty 
but the referee wisely ignores him.
 
83 min: Palun gets away with a blatant tug of Nakoulma’s shirt as Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> repel the first Burkina attack for 
a while.
 
81 min: Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> hoiks a cross 
towards the far post. Aubameyang heads back across goal and Bouanga opens fire 
from seven yards. But Koffi makes a brilliant save with his left foot, showing 
superb reflexes and agility to kick out and send the ball over the bar! The 
20-year-old gave away the penalty after underestimating the pace of Aubameyang 
(and he’s not the first to do that) but other than that he has been excellent.
 
80 min: Coulibaly becomes the latest player to be carried off on a stretcher, 
though the pitch can’t be blamed this time: his problem came from a clash of 
heads as he jumped to nod the ball clear. Burkina have made all their 
substitutes so they’ll be hoping their man can rejoin the action quickly...
 
78 min: Bertrand Traoré gives the ball away 30 yards from his own goal - and 
to Aubameyang, of all people. The striker attempts to mete out maximum 
punishment but his shot flies way over.
 
Burkina Faso substitution: Saré on, Alain Traoré off. 
 
76 min: Kevyn’s first touch is an optimistic blast from 25 yards. It cannons 
straight into the first defender.
 
Gabon substitution: Kevyn on, Poko off
 
71 min: Poko shows his speed and strength to shoulder Coulibaly off the ball 
after outrunning Traoré. Sadly his subsequent cross is not as good.
 
68 min: Freekick to Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> in 
prime crossing territory on the right. Bouanga’s delivery sails straight into 
the hands of Koffi.
 
Gabon substitution: Ngoulai on, Tandjigora off. The latter was injured - this 
pitch is taking a toll.
 
64 min: Palun ventures forward in an effort to get Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> back on the front foot. But his 
bad pass gives Burkina an opportunity to put the pressure back on, and Alain 
Traoré duly sweeps the ball into the place where Palun would normally have 
been. Nakoulma collects it and bounds towards the box, but Ecuélé Manga gets 
back and does well to stick the ball out for a corner.
 
62 min: Freekick to Burkina just outside the D, perfectly central. Alain 
Traoré bangs it into the wall.
 
61 min: Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> are reeling in the 
face of zippy interplay by Burkina, with Bertrand Traoré heavily involved ...
 
60 min: A freekick by Diawara deflects off the wall. Dayo tries to flick a 
header into the net from six yards but fails to connect, allowing Ovono to push 
the delivery away awkwardly.
 
58 min: Lovely dart and dribble by Bertrand Traoré! It took him between two 
defenders at the edge of the area and then he tried to curl a low shot towards 
the far corner. It took a deflection off the trailing leg of a defender before 
Ovono palmed it away.
 
57 min: There were suggestions at half-time that Burkina might downgrade their 
ambition and settle for a draw here in the expectation of beating Guinea Bissau 
in their last group match. But they have sensibly eschewed that option and are 
going for the win here: and they’re been on top for most of the second half.
 
55 min: Solid defending by Palun, who held off Nakoulma at the edge of his own 
area and then played his way out of defence.
 
Burkina Faso substitution: B Traoré on, Jonathan Zongo off. 
 
52 min: Bouanga is shunted to the ground by Jonathan Zongo as Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> try to complete another 
counter-attack. It’s a freekick to the hosts but it won’t be taken until 
Burkina make another substitution, Zongo having injured himself in that 
challenge. It’s Bertrand Traoré time.
 
50 min: The crowd squeal with excitement as a Burkina attack breaks down and 
the ball squirts out to Aubameyang, who sets off on a gallop towards the other 
end. But the Dortmund striker disappoints his adoring fans by mislaying an 
attempted pass to Evouna.
 
48 min: Alain Traoré rolls the freekick back to Kaboré at the edge of the area 
... and Kaboré launches his shot towards Sao Tomé e Principe.
 
47 min: Diawara hassles Ze Ondo into an error. The defender compounds it by 
pulling the attacker back, giving Burkina a freekick in a dangerous crossing 
position.
 
46 min: Off we go again. 
 
That was highly enjoyable and the second half should be likewise: both these 
teams are intent on victory and playing at a cracking tempo and total 
commitment. A bit of pushing and shoving as they go off the pitch for a break 
augurs well for the next period. In the mean time, why not have a gander atsome 
of the best goals scored in the last few days 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/18/best-goals-week-andy-carroll-riyad-mahrez-fa-cup>
.
 
44 min: Poko bounds down the right and cracks in a powerful low cross. Dayo 
sticks out a foot to clear it at the near post.
 
42 min: Corner to Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>, whose 
confidence has been restored by the goal. Poko clips one over to the penalty 
spot, where Ecuélé Manga meets it with his full forehead but fails to guide his 
shot on target.
 
40 min: Are we going to have a third substitution in the first half? Poko is 
down clutching his shoulder after landing heavily following a tackle. This 
pitch must is evidently very hard, a fact also shown by the height to which the 
ball bounces.
 
Aubameyang sends the keeper the wrong way - and the crowd into raptures! 
 
Koffi hared off his line to intercept a long through-ball - but Aubameyang was 
too fast for him and nicked the ball past him before being felled. The keeper 
is booked. Can he redeem himself by saving the spotkick?
 
Gabon substitution: Ze Ondo on Obiang off. 
 
34 min: Malo tries his luck from long range. No bobble will help him, however, 
because his shot is nowhere near the ground, nor the goal.
 
32 min: A break in play as Obiang receives treatment for a knock. Happily, 
today’s Fiver has just landed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/18/the-fiver-fa-cup-still-got-it-baby>
 - and it was written by Rob Smyth so has to be good.
 
29 min: Koffi spills a long-range shot by Bouanga. That’s almost inevitable on 
this bobbly pitch so regular shooting - and following up - are well in order.
 
27 min: Burkina are doing a job on Gabon now alright. They’re showing their 
power and their experience to tighten their grip on this game.Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> are looking frazzled and cannot 
get the ball to Aubemeyang, who has pulled wide to the right in the hope of 
making himself more available.
 
25 min: The hosts are under enormous pressure now and it looks like they’ll 
need time to come to terms with it - but Burkina don’t intend to give them 
that: they’re swarming all over them with renewed vigour now, forcing mistakes 
and fraying nerves even further.
 
The substitute scores with a straightforward counter-attack! A punt clear from 
the Burkina box was intended solely to relieve pressure but it turned into a 
perfect through-ball when Obiang got flustered under pressure from Nakoulma and 
made a mess of a header. Nakoulma raced through on goal and, as two defenders 
converged on him, shunted it past Ovono and into the net!
 
20 min: Aubameyang sets off in pursuit of a clever pass into the right 
channel. But the ball travels fast and untrue on this pitch and runs out of 
play before even Aubameyang can retrieve it.
 
17 min: First-class look of disgust on the face of Evouna after Palun fails to 
collect his pass near half-way. Palun’s look, meanwhile, seems intended to 
convey the point that he might have collected the pass if it had not been so 
far away from him.
 
14 min: Diawara literally has a pain in his ass. After leaping high to 
challenge for a header he fell derrière-first on the hard ground and winced 
accordingly. Fortunately being doused with water and rubbed by a physio seems 
to have sorted him out, so Burkina do not need to make a second substitution 
just yet.
 
12 min: It’s been all Gabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> so 
far. They’re playing with admirable speed and purpose, and regularly stretching 
the Burkinabe defence. Having said that, Abdou Traoré has just given them a 
reminder about the dangers of easing off, as he pounced on a loose ball and 
fired off a shot that nearly befuddled the keeper, Ovono needing two attempts 
to hold it. Sending in shots that bounce in front of the keeper are a smart 
ploy in this pitch, like the way cricket spinners thrive on scruffy wickets.
 
Burkina Faso substitution: Nakoulma on, Pitroipa off. 
 
8 min: Bad news for Burkina and fans of tricky footballers: Pitroipa has 
twisted an ankle and is carried off on a stretcher.
 
7 min: Dayo fails to clear a cross from the left properly and it falls to 
Bouanga, who smashes it first-time on the half-volley from 12 yards. Koffi 
reacts brilliantly to tip it on to the crossbar! Aubameyang tries to nod the 
rebound into the net but can’t get enough power on his header, so Koffi gets up 
to gather with ease. So close forGabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>, who’ve made a roaring start!
 
6 min: Fine goalkeeping by Koffi, the 20-year-old in nets for Burkina! Hu 
hurtled off his line to make a perfectly timed dive at the feet of Bouanga 
after a sharp move byGabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon>.
 
5 min: The bobbly pitch betrays Obiang as Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> tried to launch a counter-attack. 
As the left-back tried to collect a pass on the run, the ball skipped over his 
foot and into touch.
 
3 min: Aubameyang essays on those knuckleball freekick from 30 yards. The ball 
wobbles about four yards over the bar, but thetribute to Juninho is well noted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/oct/31/golden-goal-juninho-pernambucano-lyon-bayern-munich>
.
 
2 min: Evouna gives an early sample of his dribbling prowess, skittering down 
the right and into the Burkinabe box. He then pokes a pass though to Poko, 
who’s closed down before he can get off a clean shot from eight yards. But that 
was encouraging forGabon <https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> 
nonetheless.
 
1 min: Burkina kick off and immediately try to find Pitropia, who immediately 
loses possession under pressure from Poko, the man brought in to replace 
Lemina, who has been dropped asGabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> seek greater solidity in midfield.
 
The Burkinabe players belt out their national anthem and well they might: it 
was written by Thomas Sankara, no less. The Gabonese one is recited more 
nervously, by the players at least; the crowd in the stadium in Libreville, 
which looks about half-full, give it more gusto.
 
The teams present themselves for the pre-match formalities. Burkina Faso 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/burkinafaso> are resplendent in white, 
while Gabon are wearing yellows jerseys, blue shorts and green socks, which is 
essentially their national flag in football kit format.
 
Hello. Let’s not perfume a dungheap: most of the matches in the first round of 
this tournament were total stinkers. Of the most fancied countries only Senegal 
and, at a push, DR Congo have vindicated their status so far, while the other 
most notable performers have been less highly billed sides, with Zimbabwe, 
Guinea Bissau and Togo doing well to justify their presence. Everyone else has 
been varying degrees of plod.

The good thing is that means that the second round of matches should be 
contested by teams doing their utmost to improve, starting with Gabon and
Burkina Faso <https://www.theguardian.com/football/burkinafaso>. There is, of 
course, the danger that the tightness of Group A (both of the opening matches 
ended 1-1) could lead to caution but let’s hope that both sides choose audacity 
and, more to the point, show that they have the talent to match their 
ambitions. Go Panthers! Go Stallions! Pretty please!

The onus is on Gabon, in particular. The hosts first performance was 
error-strewn. Perhaps nerves were a factor, though the first mistake was 
committed by the manager, Jose Antonio Camacho, who deployed an unbalanced 
side, as Merlin Tandjigora turned out to be not quite magical enough to secure 
midfield on his lonesome. Gabon also suffered from a grievous lack of 
creativity, with no sign of Malick Evouna’s dribbling skills or Mario Lemina’s 
passing ability. Poor old Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang was more akin to a blowfly 
than a Panther, left to feed off rotten remains.Gabon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/gabon> need to provide their brilliant 
striker with far better service if they are to progress.

 The players from the Country of Honourable People, meanwhile, looked 
defensively vulnerable and on course for a walloping in their opening match but 
fought back well in the second half to draw with Cameroon. Banou Diawara, the 
super sub who triggered those super scenes in the final game of the qualifying 
campaign by hitting a stoppage time winner against Botswana, made another big 
impact from the bench in the match against Cameroon, though the equaliser was 
scored by Issoufou Dayo. Paulo Durate, Burkina’s Portuguese manager, admitted 
that he got his initial tactics wrong against Cameroon – actually, he said that 
his players, though very experienced, seemed confused by his plan, which is the 
same thing as admitting he messed up – so it’ll be interesting to see whether 
they make a better start today. Duarte should know enough about Gabon and his 
own players to at least devise a clear plot, as he managed the Panthers, 
unsuccessfully, before returning for a second spell in charge of Burkina.

In short, the stakes are high for this one and there’s no telling which way 
it’ll go. But 2-1 to Gabon in a drama-filled contest seems the most likely 
denouement. Will you stay tuned now?
