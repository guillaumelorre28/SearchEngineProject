This week sees the nationwide launch of Burger King’s Whopperrito 
<https://www.bk.com/menu-item/whopperrito>. No, you didn’t read that wrong – 
the fast-food king has really put a Whopper in a burrito.

Like KFC’s burrito project 
<https://www.kfc.co.uk/our-food/for-one/wraps/zinger-burrito> before it, the 
Whopperrito is a bland reminder that mediocre meals remain mediocre even when 
they put on new party clothes.

But it points to a new trend in hipster food: the burritofication of all food 
types. Jeffrey Pilcher, a food historian and author of Planet Taco: A Global 
History of Mexican Food, says the burrito and the taco have become a new kind 
of shorthand for chefs. “Put something in a burrito and it acquires this cool 
edge,” he says. “It’s a way of Americanizing foreign food, but without that 
McDonald’s feel.”

In San Francisco <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco>, the 
birthplace of the “Mission-style” burrito – the meaty, rice-filled, 
bean-and-cheese experience that most will recognize – a growing number of cooks 
are experimenting with the burrito blueprint. The basics remain the same: a 
carpeting of carbs (usually rice), meat or fish, and something fresh (avocado, 
salads or vegetables) twisted up in a tortilla, bread or other wrap. But the 
results vary wildly.

So if the burrito – not the burger – is now America’s favorite food 
playground, who’s getting it right and who’s getting it wrong? I ate my way 
through nine burritos in four days to bring you the answer.

What doesn’t work

The Whopper-rrito

Burger King’s burger in a burrito launched nationwide on Monday. Yes, we tried 
it. And yes, it’s pretty lame. It lacks inspiration, texture and bite. It’s a 
taco-flavored burger in a tortilla and none the better for it.

KFC tried a similar stunt last year by releasing a fried chicken and a pulled 
chicken burrito in the UK. I tried it on a rainy day in London and it was 
miserable, tasting simultaneously of nothing at all and overwhelmingly of 
artificial cheese.

Conclusion: good burritos can be made in the same amount of time it takes to 
get a fast-food burrito and they aren’t much more expensive (my Whopperrito 
meal cost nearly $7). Treat yourself to the real deal.

The ramen-rrito

Some restaurants in California have been putting ramen noodles 
<http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-indomie-burrito-komodo-20151030-story.html>
 insideburritos <https://www.instagram.com/p/-zuzEoI2Oe/> and, while I have not 
actually tried it (nearby restaurants no longer serve them. You work out why), 
the premise is terrifying. Innovation is always commendable – and theramen 
burger 
<https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/what-the-ramen-burger-inventor-thinks-of-red-robin-ripping-off-his-idea>
 has some serious fans – but there are certain foods that should not be 
friends. Slippery ramen noodles and chewy tortillas feel like two of them. It’s 
like putting an octopus in a straight jacket.


The cousin of the ramen-rrito is the pho-rrito. While these LA foodies 
<http://laist.com/2014/11/10/taste_test_guys_theres_a_pho_burrito.php> didn’t 
hate it they did conclude “we might prefer just having a good old bowl of pho”. 
If it ain’t broke …

The heart attack-rrito

No one is pretending burritos are healthy, but there is a line that can be 
crossed. Puttingdoughnuts inside 
<http://www.foodbeast.com/news/doughrito-donut-breakfast-burrito/> a burrito is 
one way to cross it. Two hot dogs, three strips of bacon, cheddar cheese and 
beef chiliis another <http://www.pinkshollywood.com/menu.html>. French fries, 
jalapeños, bacon, mac ‘n’ cheese, hot dogs and beef chili isyet a third 
<http://thevulgarchef.com/2016/05/20/white-trash-burrito/>. And Googling “pizza 
burrito” gets youhere 
<http://beastchow.com/2015/09/pizza-burrito-got-chipotle-burritos-packed-inside/>
; which, be warned, is a corner of the internet that will put you off your 
lunch.

What works

The sushi-rrito

A sushirrito is exactly what it sounds like: a giant piece of sushi rolled 
like a burrito. But this is more than a copycat, it’s something new and 
delicious that combines atypical ingredients (think ginger-spiked avocado, 
lotus chips or sweetcorn) into a dish that’s heartier than sushi but lighter 
than the Mexican-American classic. It’s delicious.

Of all the faux burritos I tried the sushi burrito is the farthest departure, 
but it works by reminding us of everything these two great dishes have in 
common.

The curry-rrito

The curry burrito makes sense – after all, what’s a curry without naan, 
chapati or paratha to mop it up? This is the non-burrito that feels most like a 
burrito.

The depth of spicing in south Asian cooking is a natural complement for 
Mexican cuisine. I ate a Punjabi burrito (from Avatar’s in the Bay Area) which 
swaps Spanish rice for basmati, pico de gallo for pickles and chutney, sour 
cream for yogurt, and carne asada for curried chicken or lamb.

The chicken tikka masala burrito (I tried one from Curry Up Now) is saucy and 
spicy, given levity by a sour chickpea garnish called chana. I spent most of my 
time eating it thinking, why haven’t I eaten this before? And when can I get 
another one?

The fried rice-ritto

Rice is often the unwelcome guest at the burrito party so it’s great to see 
some establishments give it a starring role.

The “korrito” (from a food truck called Seoul on Wheels), featuring bulgogi 
(grilled, marinated beef), cilantro, sour cream, sriracha and cheddar cheese, 
is a good example of rice-minded thinking. Their rice laced with kimchee was so 
good it actually made me excited to eat the rice side of my burrito.

San Francisco’s mega-hip Mission Chinese does a “kung pao” burrito, which 
comes with kung pao pastrami, home fries, cheese, scallions and salt cod fried 
rice. While their pastrami teeters dangerously on the edge of over-salted, the 
rice has deliciously fishy undertones and a pleasant pop of peanuts.

The new meat-ritto

Meat is the burrito’s headline act, and some of the best fusion burritos use 
the format to showcase a signature meat dishes. Roy Choi’s Kogi food truck in 
Los Angeles is a well-loved example, stuffing caramelized Korean barbecue 
inside tacos and burritos.
