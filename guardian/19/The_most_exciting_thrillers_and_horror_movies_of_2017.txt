Baby Driver

Edgar Wright’s latest is a departure in many ways: his first film to shoot in 
the US, his first non-com – and we don’t see Simon Pegg or Nick Frost listed 
anywhere in the credits. Instead, Ansel Elgort plays a near-mute, 
tinnitus-suffering getaway driver who uses his headphones to drown out the 
ringing, and jobs for a mob boss to pay for petrol. Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm 
co-star.

The Commuter

AKA Taken <https://www.theguardian.com/film/taken> on a Train. This Liam Neeson
 <https://www.theguardian.com/film/liam-neeson> vehicle is directed by Jaume 
Collet-Serra, who was onboard for Unknown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/03/unknown-review> (2011), Non-Stop 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/27/non-stop-review-liam-neeson> 
(2014), andRun All Night 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/12/run-all-night-improved-action-outing-for-liam-neeson>

genius horrorOrphan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/07/orphan-film-review> (2009). 
Neeson plays an insurance salesman who must suddenly employ a very special set

the final stop – lest everyone onboard dies.Sam Neill 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/sam-neill>, Elizabeth McGovern

Flatliners

Mr Robot <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mr-robot> director Niels 
Arden Oplev takes the reins on this remake of the 1990 medical student classic, 
this time round starringEllen Page <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ellenpage>

Sutherland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/may/02/kiefer-sutherland-five-best-moments>
, this time as a sinister doc.

It

For six years Cary Fukunaga <https://www.theguardian.com/film/cary-fukunaga> 
worked on this adaptation of the Stephen King child-killing clown horror; he’s 
still on board but Andrés Muschietti, the Argentine film-maker behind genuinely 
spookyMama <https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/21/mama-review> is 
directing. Bill (son of Stellan) Skarsgård is Pennywise, Jaeden Lieberher (the

<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/dec/21/the-mummy-trailer-tom-cruise-talent>
 for thisTom Cruise <https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomcruise> adventure has 
already given it a shot of publicity even the official trailer couldn’t manage. 
The first in Universal’s new monsters universe movies, this stars Cruise as an 
explorer who comes back to life after a plane crash, plusRussell Crowe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/russellcrowe> as friendly physician Dr Henry 
Jekyll.

Red Sparrow

Jennifer Lawrence <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jennifer-lawrence> teams 
up withHunger Games <https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hunger-games> 
director Francis Lawrence once more for this story of “a sexy Russian spy who 
falls for a CIA officer and considers becoming a double agent”. We’re guessing 
Lawrence is the erotic Ruskie and Joel Egerton the Yank. But we’d almost prefer 
it if it were co-starsJeremy Irons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/jeremy-irons> or Matthias Schoenaerts.

The Siege 

Following the wobble of Assassin’s Creed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/19/assassins-creed-film-review-michael-fassbender-videogame-marion-cotillard>
, Justin Kurzel returns with the real-life story of a team of the Pakistani 
militants Lashkar-e-Taiba who killed 31 people in a terrorist attack at the Taj 
Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai in 2008. The involvement ofMichael Fassbender 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-fassbender> and Marion Cotillard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/marion-cotillard> (who have starred in his 
last two films) has not yet been confirmed.

Suburbicon 

Joel and Ethan Coen <https://www.theguardian.com/film/coenbrothers> wrote this 
mystery soon after the release ofBlood Simple 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086979/>. Why it’s taken 31 years to hit the big 
screen, and withGeorge Clooney <https://www.theguardian.com/film/georgeclooney> 
directing rather than them, we’re not sure. But still, this looks very 
promising – a 50s-set suburban crime thriller about a picture-perfect family 
who employ brutal revenge after a burglary turns fatal. Coen regularsMatt Damon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/mattdamon>, Julianne Moore 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliannemoore>, Josh Brolin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/josh-brolin> and Oscar Isaac
