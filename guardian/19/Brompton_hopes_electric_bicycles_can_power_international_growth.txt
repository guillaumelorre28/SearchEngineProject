When Bob Dylan went electric, he was infamously met with cries of “Judas” from 
wounded fans.

Folding bicycle maker Brompton will be hoping to avoid the same accusation 
from its legions of suited and booted commuter devotees when it too “goes 
electric”.

From next year, the business plans to start producing fold-up electric bicycles

 aimed at people who find pedalling too much like hard work.

Brompton Bicycles – the unfolding saga of a two-wheeled success story

The new bikes employ pedelec technology, which stores energy from pedalling 
and releases it when the rider reaches a hill. The Brompton system has been 
developed in partnership with Formula One team Williams and is a slimmed down 
version of the Kers (kinetic energy recovery system) technology that racing 
cars use to gain extra speed.

“The guy on his £2,500 carbon-frame road bike will wonder why you’re cruising 
past him in a suit,” saidWill Butler-Adams 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/17/brompton-bicycles-the-unfolding-saga-of-a-two-wheeled-success-story>
, the chief executive of Brompton.

The move into electric bicycles is part of an ambitious global expansion plan 
orchestrated from a gleaming new factory in the westLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> suburb of Greenford. At 84,000 sq ft, 
the floorspace of the site is bigger than the pitch at Wembley Stadium and four 
times the size of Brompton’s previous home.

The move cost the company about £2m, a sum equal to its pre-tax profit in 
2015, achieved on turnover of £27.5m.

While the factory itself is shiny, new and packed with new technology, the 
work that goes on here hinges on some old-fashioned craftsmanship.

Abdul El Saidi, 56, is Brompton’s brazing manager. He is responsible for 
passing on the decades-old craft, which is similar to welding, to new trainees. 
All 250 staff, from the engineers to the receptionists, have to try their hand 
at brazing when they start work at the business. .

For new recruits the stakes are high – all have their initials stamped on 
individual bike components for the sake of quality control. But the money isn’t 
bad either. A new brazer can expect a starting salary north of £30,000, partly 
because it isn’t easy to find people suited to such a job.

“Not many people know about brazing, which was a problem for Brompton,” said 
El Saidi, who demonstrates the steady hand, patience and eye for detail 
required for a top brazer.

“Technology has taken over engineering and welding jobs so there’s not much 
training. In the 1970s when I started, there were full classes of people 
learning to weld. It was big money. But if I lost my job here, there’s not a 
job elsewhere. The world has changed a lot.”

If El Saidi’s story of industrial decline sounds like a familiar tale of 
Britain’s diminishing place in global manufacturing, Brompton is at least 
bucking the trend.

About 80% of its bikes are exported to 44 markets. Two of the largest markets 
are Germany and South Korea, often held up as shining examples of export-led 
economies.

The working practices at Brompton feel like a cosy reminder of days long past, 
with the production line staffed by people rather than robots.

Do any of them own a Brompton, given that the machines start at a cool £785? 
“Nah, I’ve got a Ferrari,” joked one of Brompton’s bike makers, as he screwed 
in a crucial component.

Every member of the production line staff is responsible for a different part 
of the bike and between them they can assemble one in about three and a half 
minutes. Their target for the year is 47,500 and the company is soon to add a 
second production line in the belief it can roll out 100,000 bikes a year by 
2022.

To do so, it will need to use all of the tools at its disposal.

Although the bicycles help people to save on public transport, they could not 
be described as cheap, and at 9.5kg are technically portable but not for a long 
period of time.

“You have to have ambition,” said Butler-Adams. “There are more than a billion 
people in China. Not all of them are going to ride a Brompton but there’s an 
opportunity there.

“Most people in the world have never seen one [a Brompton] but globally there 
is net migration to cities and they’ve got the same challenges with space and 
lack of exercise.”

While China represents an opportunity, it will not be easy to break into the 
market. Working-class Chinese cannot afford one of the costly machines, while 
many among the burgeoning middle classes see cycling to work as beneath them.

But since founder Andrew Ritchie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/27/how-we-made-the-brompton-folding-bicycle>
 first developed a folding bike in 1975 – naming it after the Brompton Oratory 
church across the road from his flat – the company has defied its critics.

It has also developed a cult following, as evidenced by fan groups such as the 
London Brompton Club <https://www.facebook.com/groups/LondonBromptonClub> page 
on Facebook, which has 2,800 members. There are even competitions for who can 
fold one up the quickest - the record is 5.6 seconds.

“There are Brompton owners who are tall, small, old, young. We don’t give a 
stuff,” said Butler-Adams. “The flipping thing works. If it works in London, it 
can work all over the world.”
