groups. There’s the general city tour, covering the must-see sights of 
Copenhagen, such as the Little Mermaid,Amalienborg Palace 
<http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/amalienborg-palace-gdk492887> and 
Nyhavn <http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/nyhavn-gdk474735>, and there 
are some quirky alternatives. A running tour of the autonomous freetown, 
Christiana, promises “creativity, tolerance and lots of cannabis”, opaquely

Lisbon City Runners <http://lisboncityrunners.com/en/>

Several running routes are on offer through the most interesting parts of 
Lisbon, for those who don’t want their exercise routines disrupted while they 
are away, but don’t want to miss the sights. It’s a very hilly city, but well 
worth the payoff: the views from the top of the castle are spectacular, 
although the 7km run is not for beginners. The 10km city centre run takes in 
the main neighbourhoods of Baixa, Chiado, Bairro Alto and Mouraria, while the 
garden run takes in the city’s parks and allows you to see the main tourist 
attractions through the eyes of a local.
• Per person: 1 runner €35, 2 runners €30, 3 runners €25, 4 or more €20. Long 
run/custom run €40. Discounts apply when you buy multiple runs
