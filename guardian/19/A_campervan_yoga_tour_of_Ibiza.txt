It’s hard to be inconspicuous when you’re driving a psychedelic 
orange-and-yellow 1970s VW campervan around the sun-soaked lanes of Ibiza. 
Schoolchildren wave, boys hoot, strangers want photos and, while eyeballs might 
roll when the van stalls on a steep slope, the general VDub love more than 
makes up for the occasional embarrassment.

I’m on the White Isle with my friend Vicky for a campervan break: this summer, 
classic van hire firmWeDubYou <https://wedubyou.com/> has added Ibiza to the 
destinations where it rents out its old-school kombis. It’s an option perhaps 
worth considering, given the extortionate cost of villas and hotels here in 
peak season.

To add to the fun, I’ve signed us up for an extra yoga package. Rather than 
hedonistic partying, we plan to tap into Ibiza’s laid-back, hippy alter ego – 
pootling along at our own pace and having private yoga classes in beautiful, 
carefully chosen locations around the island.

After a quick intro to the van from Liverpudlian Paul, who runs WeDubYou 
Ibiza, we’re off. It feels like driving a bus, but I soon get the hang of it. 
(Though Vicky’s helpful comments, such as “shouldn’t you be in third now” or 
“the indicator’s still on” suggest she might disagree.) We head north-east to 
Es Canar and Camping La Playa, a cute little campsite with a great bar right on 
the beach, in time for a nightcap under the stars.

 Jane and Vicky’s tour took in hidden coves and beauty spots. 
Going to bed hasn’t been as exciting since I camped in the garden when I was 
six: we pop up the roof and hunker down before midnight (sheets, sleeping bags 
and pillows are provided).

Launched in France in 2013 by Brits Tony and Yvette Martin, WeDubYou is 
already going great guns there in Bergerac, and in Girona, Spain. Ibiza is its 
first franchise, run by Paul and wife Louise, who sold their bistro business 
back home to move here, with four vans available on the island, and plans for 
more. New Zealand is another new option for 2016, with California in the 
pipeline for next year.

It goes without saying that the vans have names: besides Pucci, which I’m 
driving, there’s Flirty, covered in cartoon-style flowers, Twister with decor 
inspired by the ice lolly, and Sadie, a classic in plain white. All have 
everything holidaymakers might need, from fridge/freezer and gas cooker to 
SatNavs and Bluetooth speakers. The add-on VIP package brings local goodies and 
bubbly on arrival, the beach package towels, beach bag, masks and snorkels. The 
vans all have pop-up roofs, and though two would comfortably sleep four, the 
other two are more suited to just three people. Extra bodies could always use a 
tent.

 Jane at the wheel of ‘Pucci’. 
We wake early to the sound of birdsong and drive north for our first yoga 
session with Lindsay Jay, one of those naturally beautiful, sporty young women 
you don’t want to have your photo taken with. Tanned, with long golden hair and 
beaming smile, she relocated to Ibiza two-and-a-half years ago with her husband 
and launchedYogaFit Ibiza <http://yogafitibiza.com/> in April. She offers 
campervanners tailored packages, with as many yoga sessions as people want in 
locations that vary from isolated beaches to hillside watchtowers. “I’m living 
the dream,” she grins.

Today’s session takes place on the terrace of the Invisa hotel on Es Figueral 
beach, where Lindsay runs retreats in April and October. It’s a brilliant place 
to practise yoga, surrounded by sea and sky – so much nicer than a studio. 
Lindsay’s background was in fitness before she ventured into yoga (she held a 
Guinness world record for the biggest-ever zumba class). The class is flowing, 
centring and fun (anyone tried eye yoga?).

But the zen doesn’t stop there – massage is another optional extra and we head 
into the hotel for an “Awakening” treatment with Italian masseur Iuri. It’s a 
mix of ancient Ayurvedic techniques combined with Tibetan singing bowls placed 
on the body, their vibration tingling on the skin, targeting energy pathways. 
If I don’t emerge spiritually awakened, I’m definitely relaxed and ready for 
the day.

We meander back to the campsite, checking out Pou des Lleó’s red cliff 
landscape, hidden beaches and gorgeous green countryside en route. We feel like 
pseudo hippies in our lurid van but Diego, whom we meet back at camp for a bike 
tour of the area, is the real deal, with his flares, flowing locks and fringed 
suede jacket. His hand-built “Harley-Davidson”-style pushbikes are 
super-comfortable to ride (and he can attach motors to them, if required). We 
cycle through pretty countryside and hamlets to Santa Eulalia, stopping at 
places like 100% Ibiza, a Mad Max-style salvage yard that would have been hard 
to find on our own.

The next day we’re off again, to Camping Cala Bassa 
<http://www.campingcalabassa.com/> on the west coast, about an hour away on 
easy roads. It’s a small, shady campsite a short walk from a popular sandy 
beach dominated by slick beach clubs and already crowded on a Saturday in May.

For sunset yoga, Lindsay has chosen a spot on the south-west of the island a 
picturesque drive away in Cala d’Hort nature reserve, overlooking the tiny 
island of Es Vedrà, claimed by some to be the third most magnetic place in the 
world (many scientists say this is not the case) – after the north pole and 
Bermuda triangle – and steeped in local legend.

She takes us to a natural cave used for mediation. A group of long-haired guys 
with guitars are sitting around gazing at the view. “You’re from the UK? I love 
Bournemouth,” drools one. “But the weed, man, it was like smoking grass from 
the garden.”

We leave them to it and follow Lindsay to a quieter spot far from anyone for a 
yin session, a more meditative type of yoga with longer-held poses that work on 
the connective tissues. At one point the sound of singing bowls from a nearby 
meditation session fills the air. It’s all so Ibiza it feels like it’s been 
staged for the occasion.

Campervan living doesn’t preclude tapping into the sleeker side of island 
life: we decide to check outAmante <http://www.amanteibiza.com/>, a stylish 
beach club on a cliff at Cala Llonga. Morning yoga sessions here, followed by 
breakfast overlooking the sea, cost €23, but we go for lunch, parking the van 
next to gleaming Mercs and 4x4s, and feast on fish croquettes and risotto with 
organic homegrown veg. There are sunbeds to hire (€30 a day) or much in-demand 
beanbags for lounging with the beautiful people, but we take Lindsay’s advice 
and drive a short way to Cala Olivera, a pretty little cove with just a few 
locals enjoying a lazy afternoon.

 Sunset Ashram at Cala Conta. 
Watching the sun drop into the sea from Sunset Ashram  
<http://www.sunsetashram.com/en/>at Cala Conta is another of the must-dos on 
our list and we join the crowds chilling on the beach until long after darkness 
falls. We’ve parked the van a stroll away from the bar, hidden among the dunes, 
and at the end of the evening slip back and quietly crash for the night.

Wild camping isn’t legal in Ibiza – and there are seven campsites on the 
island – but if it’s done discreetly, taking care to leave no trace (no awnings 
or barbecues), it’s an option some will no doubt be tempted by. Part of what is 
great about having the van is not being tied to one location – and with public 
transport being sporadic and taxis expensive, having a set of wheels is pretty 
necessary for those who want to explore.

 The campervan quickly became a comfortable home. 
Our long weekend comes to an end all too quickly – there’s so much more to 
discover and more outdoor downward dogs to be done. As I drive back to the 
airport, I feel sad to be leaving Pucci behind and find myself trying to work 
out how I could carry on campervan living and yoga-ing forever.

Yoga and walking in Morocco

These gentle, five-day retreats combine yoga and meditation with daily two- to

them) is rustic and good.
