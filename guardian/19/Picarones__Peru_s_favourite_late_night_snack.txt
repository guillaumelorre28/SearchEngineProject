Lima is famous for its street food. Anticuchos (beef heart kebabs), pork 
tamales andarroz con leche (rice pudding) are among the delicacies sold on 
corners from Surco to Miraflores to the Centro Histórico. But no vendors are 
more sought-after than those fryingpicarones – a particular favourite of 
pisco-fuelled revellers stumbling on to the streets of Barranco, Lima’s 
bohemian nightlife district.

At first glance, they look like fat onion rings, but they’re actually more 
like a variation on the doughnut. Mashed sweet potato, squash and aniseed are 
made into an elastic dough with flour, yeast, egg and sugar. This is shaped by 
hand into rings and deep-fried until golden brown.

The rings are then scooped up with a stick run through their centres, and 
drenched in an aromatic syrup made from cinnamon, cloves and a sort of 
unrefined cane sugar called chancaca.

Peruvians have been eating picarones for more than 200 years. They originated 
withbuñuelos, fried dough balls introduced by Spanish colonialists, and were 
reimagined by African slaves, who added squash and sweet potato to the recipe. 
The result is a warm, fragrant treat that’s crispy on the outside and chewy on 
the inside, with just the right amount of sweetness.

Good places to look for picarone vendors are Parque Kennedy in Miraflores, 
Parque Castilla in Lince and Parque de la Cruz in Barranco.El Tio Mario 
<http://anticucheriatiomario.com/index/> is a restaurant close to the Bridge of 
Sighs in Barranco that does exceptionally good picarones, and, importantly for 
the party crowd, it’s open til 2am every day except Sunday.
