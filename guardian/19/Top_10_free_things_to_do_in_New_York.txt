Outdoor pools

New York can be stiflingly hot and humid in the summer but the city also has 
the perfect remedy: free open-air swimming. A network of dozens of outdoor 
public pools across all five city boroughs open for the summer months (usually 
closing around Labor Day weekend in early September). All you need is your 
swimming suit, towel, bag and a padlock for the locker (you won't be admitted 
without the padlock). The pools range in size and popularity. Red Hook Pool in 
Brooklyn, for instance is huge, with one end of the pool packed with children, 
while the other end is partitioned into lanes for serious swimmers. And while 
you are there, take the short stroll to a fabulous view of the Statue of 
Liberty (and Ikea if you are so moved). As part of the social wellbeing of the 
city, the pools also provide free snack lunches for children during the school 
holidays.

Free concerts in Prospect Park 
 Photograph: Mike Coppola/Getty Images for Tropfest 
Every Saturday night (and some other evenings) throughout the summer, Prospect 
Park in Brooklyn hosts free concerts, featuring an eclectic collection of acts. 
Summer 2013 saw They Might Be Giants, the Waterboys, Calexico, and the 
Barenaked Ladies to name but a few. The small venue allows families to picnic 
on the grass at the back while the more enthusiastic can congregate closer to 
the Bandshell stage. The concerts are a perfect excuse to leave the crowded 
streets of Manhattan to see one of Brooklyn's treasures: Prospect Park was 
created shortly after Central Park by the same landscapers and also features 
its own zoo, boating lake and carousel.

Free friday nights at the Museum of Modern Art
 Photograph: Alamy 
Every Friday, the MOMA stays open until 8pm and hands out free tickets to 
anyone who enters after 4pm – it's best to arrive by 4:30pm to avoid the queue. 
Start with the rotating special exhibition on the top floor, move on to the 
fifth and fourth floor paintings, including Vincent Van Gogh's The Starry 
Night, and end with the second floor and its oversized sculptures, 
technology-infused media collection and the occasional interactive exhibit like 
Roman Ondák's Measuring the Universe, where visitors' names were written on the 
wall to mark their height. (See theFree Museum Day website 
<http://freemuseumday.org/nyc.html> for the schedule of other free admissions.)

Brooklyn Bridge
 Photograph: Alamy 
The most magnificent of the bridges across New York's East River, linking 
Manhattan and Brooklyn was completed in 1883 and is one of the oldest 
steel-wire suspension bridges in the US. A stroll across on the special 
pedestrian walkway affords great views of the city. At the Brooklyn end the 
area has been recently redeveloped with parks, piers and a carousel. The 
Manhattan end is close to the downtown sights of City Hall and the New York 
City Supreme Court, where you can re-enact the final scene from 12 Angry Men 
(white suit optional). A word of warning: pedestrians share the bridge path 
with cyclists, who have little patience for pedestrians wandering into the 
cycle lane – expect to be yelled at, at the very least, if you stray on to the 
wrong side of the path.

Explore Governor's Island
 Photograph: Alamy 
After strolling across Brooklyn Bridge, hop on a ferry to Governor's Island 
from Pier 6 at the bottom end of Brooklyn Bridge Park. Although the 
historically free ferry starts charging $2pp from May this year, there are 
plenty of free activities to try on the island, plus 30 new acres of park open 
to the public this May. Formerly a military base and home to the US Coast 
Guard, the island has been redeveloped as a sprawling public space – a "vibrant 
summer seasonal venue of art, culture and performance." The island's roster of 
events seems to grow each summer, but a few (free!) must-dos include: visiting 
the annualFigment NY sculpture project <http://newyork.figmentproject.org/> 
(this year's, a pavilion made from discarded plastic cups, will be held on 7-8 
June); checking out the latest exhibit at theBuilding 110 Arts Center 
<http://www.lmcc.net/cultural_programs/building_110_lmccs_arts_center>; getting 
in a round of mini-golf;free bike-hire mornings 
<http://govislandblog.com/2014/04/08/free-bike-mornings-from-monday-to-friday/>
; history hikes of the island's historic district; or just packing a picnic and 
taking a leisurely lunch in the park with lower-Manhattan as your backdrop. You 
can also take the ferry from the Battery Maritime Building in Manhattan, next 
door to the Staten Island ferry terminal.
• The island is open to the public from May to September.

New York Public Library

There are two main attractions at the main branch of the city's library in 
Midtown Manhattan – well, three technically. The first is the gorgeous main 
reading room on the third floor of the Beaux-Arts building, where natural light 
bounces off long oak tables and the ceiling's chandeliers, and thousands of 
reference books line the 52ft (almost 16-metre) high walls. Standing in the 
room you can't help but feel inspired, as if you might become a little smarter 
simply by being in the presence of so much elegance. The other can't-miss 
highlights are Patience and Fortitude, two marble Lions who guard the main 
entrance.

High Line
 Photograph: Alamy 
In its 1940s heyday, this section of elevated railway was used to carry goods 
from factories on the west side of Manhattan – including the National Biscuit 
Company, known to generations as Nabisco, the makers of the Oreo cookies and 
Ritz crackers. As manufacturing companies left the city in the following 
decades, the tracks were abandoned and left to rot, until 1999 when anidea was 
hatched to build a New York version of Paris's Promenade Plantée 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/apr/25/new-york-high-line-park>. It 
took another 10 years for permits and construction to be completed, and when 
they finally wereNew Yorkers had a one-mile oasis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/08/high-line-park-new-york>, with 
flowers, fountains, benches and stupendous views of Chelsea below. The tracks 
that delivered Oreo cookies to millions of New Yorkers decades ago now offer a 
different sort of treat to visitors looking to escape the hustle of the city's 
streets.

New York; it's a jungle sometimes. And if you want to keep from going under 
you might want to get away from the concrete variety and head for one of the 
city's tranquil green spaces. The vast, infinitely filmedCentral Park 
<http://www.centralparknyc.org/> is of course unmissable, but there are other, 
smaller, "secret" gardens that also offer the chance to escape.6BC Botanical

community gardens and is a volunteer-run space perfect for a quiet relaxation.
