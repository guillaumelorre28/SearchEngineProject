Inspired Journeys: Travel Writers in Search of the Muse


We all like to imagine our travels have greater meaning, but travel writers 
are fixated on the idea. This anthology compiles pieces by writers in search of 
something, from artistic inspiration to spiritual enlightenment, taking them to 
Dracula’s castle, Mayan temples, Antarctica and the sacred Indian city of 
Varanasi. These are essays to inspire readers to embark on a pilgrimage of 
their own.

Depart is a beautiful collection of 300 photographs from more than 40 
destinations around the world. It’s a very modern photography book, though. The 
collection has been “curated” by theSizoo Brothers 
<https://www.instagram.com/sizoobrothers/?hl=en>, a trio of young Dutch 
Instagrammers who have amassed a global following since they began posting 
images on the photo-sharing app three years ago. The book has been put together 
with the help of their followers, featuring photos from up-and-coming, as well 
as established, photographers.

Maybe one to read after Christmas dinner has gone down, Running Beyond is a 
book that will inspire committed runners, and strike fear in the heart of all 
those who struggle on a five-minute jog. Compiled by photographer and ultra 
runner Ian Corless, the book documents the world’s breathtaking ultra trails: 
from technical routes through the Grand Canyon to high-altitude runs through 
the Italian Dolomites. While the photos give you the impression of how epic the 
challenges are plus maps and profiles for each race, the book also features 
interviews with some of the world’s best ultra runners.

With all eyes on Cuba this year <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/cuba> – 
due to diplomatic relations with the US beginning to thaw and the death last 
month of Fidel Castro – there’s never been a better time to reflect on the 
country’s history. This new photography book does just that, compiling more 
than 150 black-and-white images taken by LA-based photographerManuello Paganelli
 <http://www.manuellopaganelli.com/>, who has been exploring Cuba for more than 
three decades. The images capture everyday life in a country full of spirit and 
style, be it on the street, or through dance, cooking or music.

From Tahiti to Peckham, the south – or at least the idea of the south – has 
always fostered a particular distinction of itself. It’s also been a place of 
fascination for artists and writers, with the likes of Herman Melville and 
Robert Louis Stevenson writing about the South Seas, while the American Deep 
South has inspired many more,including Paul Theroux 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/oct/23/paul-theroux-journey-america-deep-south>
. In this book, Merlin Coverly, author of the Art of Wandering, navigates 
geography, literature, myths, legends and history in this exploration all 
things southern.

The Cyclist Who Went Out In The Cold
 Photograph: Yellow Jersey 
For most people planning a cycle tour, step one is investing in a decent bike. 
Not so for the travel writer Tim Moore, who, having barely ridden for over a 
year, bought himself a £50 vintage East German shopper bicycle on eBay and set 
off to cycle the length of the iron curtain. Moore’s journey follows the new 
5,600-mile cycle route that traverses the old boundary between east and west 
Europe, exploring the relics of communism that dot the landscape from the 
Norwegian-Russian border to the Bulgarian Black Sea.

The best thing about cycling holidays is they can suit riders of any ability. 
All you need is a bike, and the will to ride it. Still, the sheer multitude of 
possibilities can make it difficult to know where to begin. That’s where this 
book comes in, detailing 200 of the best places to ride: from France and Italy 
to Mongolia and Patagonia, family cycle touring in Ecuador to mountain biking 
in Moab. The beautifully illustrated book, which features photography and a map 
for each ride, also comes with all the practical details you need to make your 
trip a reality.

This magical book celebrates the artwork of explorers, bringing together more 
than 400 beautiful sketches and paintings produced by 70 explorers from the 
16th century to the present. The book is compiled by historian and polar guide 
Huw Lewis-Jones and writer-photographer Kari Herbert – daughter of the polar 
explorer Sir Walter “Wally” Herbert – who have had the enviable task of diving 
into the archives to find work from Captain Scott, Charles Darwin and Abel 
Tasman, as well as lesser-known explorers, such as Adela Breton, who recorded 
Mexico’s Maya monuments.

Shortlisted for the 2016 Gordon Burn Prize, The Lonely City charts Olivia 
Laing’s move to New York City in her mid-30s following the end of a 
relationship; a move that led to her experiencing loneliness “on a daily 
basis”. In the absence of others, Laing explores the city, and the state of 
loneliness, through the New York artists that also found themselves absorbed by 
this very state. The book focuses particularly on Hopper and Warhol, as well as 
artist and Aids activist David Wojnarowicz and “outsider” artists Henry Darger, 
while Laing reflects on her own existence, while celebrating the more 
uncomfortable elements of the human experience.

In 2011, at the height of tension between the British and Iranian governments 
an unknown Persian man left a note on travel writer Lois Pryce’s motorcycle, 
which was parked outside the Iranian embassy in London, asking her to journey 
to his hometown of Shiraz to see what Iran was really like. Ignoring official 
warnings against travel, Pryce set off on a 3,000-mile ride across Iran, 
documenting ordinary life in the country through encounters with those she met 
on the way – from carpet sellers to drug addicts, war veterans to housewives.
