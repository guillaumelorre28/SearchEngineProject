Ivory Coast were held to a 0-0 draw by Togo as they began the defence of their 
Africa Cup of Nations <https://www.theguardian.com/football/africannationscup> 
title with an uninspiring display in the opening Group C game on Monday.

It was the fourth draw in the opening five games at this year’s finals where 
none of the pre-tournament favourites have made an impact but will be a seen as 
a moral victory forTogo <https://www.theguardian.com/football/togo>.

The Togolese are the outsiders in the group but looked the sharper of the two 
teams in attack, although the game delivered just a handful of half-chances.

Togo had the first real opportunity in the 24th minute but an over-eager Floyd 
Ayite got in the way of team mate Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba, who then scuffed his shot.

A pass that was slipped through the Ivorian defence handed Mathieu Dossevi a 
chance on the half-hour but the goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo was quickly off his 
line to smother the ball.

Togo also had a handball appeal turned down just before half-time.

The Ivorians improved after the interval but could not break down Togo’s 
well-ordered defensive lines.

Franck Kessie was brought down by Sadat Ouro-Akoriko on the edge of the Togo 
area after an hour, giving the holders prime position for a free-kick, but 
Salomon Kalou, starting his sixth Nations Cup tournament, fired over the bar.

The Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha, who has changed his international 
allegiance from England to Ivory Coast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/28/wilfried-zaha-ivory-coast-squad-africa-cup-of-nations>
, made a mazy run before cutting inside but his 67th-minute effort was blocked 
and he was replaced by Wilfried Bony soon after.

Togo’s 32-year-old captain, Emmanuel Adebayor, without a club since he left 
Palace at the end of last season, looked tired in the final 20 minutes due to a 
lack of match fitness but did set up Dossevi, who chipped the ball on to the 
roof of the net.

The best opportunity of the game fell to the Ivorians two minutes from the end 
when substitute Max Gradel’s cross was headed narrowly wide by Serge Aurier.
