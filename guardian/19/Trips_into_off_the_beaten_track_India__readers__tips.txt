Winning tip: Tribal festival, Nagaland


Eighteen Naga tribes (most Nagas live in Burma) congregate each year (1-10 
December) for the Hornbill festival inKohima, an extraordinary gathering of 
tribal culture and other activities, rarely seen by foreigners.Explore Nagaland 
<http://www.explorenagaland.com/> is a Naga-owned and managed travel company 
and guesthouse operation offering accommodation with Naga families and run by 
the super-friendly Nino Zhasa, who lived in UK and speaks good English. Many 
Nagas (a people who until early in the 20th century practised headhunting) 
speak English and are happy to explain their culture. The festival sits close 
to the site of the famous Battle of Kohima in 1944.

All travellers to Agra know about the Mughal city of Fatehpur Sikri. However, 
it is now commonly overrun by touts. An alternative, lesser-known Mughal city, 
which is also a Unesco world heritage site, is theChampaner-Pavagadh 
archaeological park in Gujarat. The ancient city is full of historical 
fortresses and untouched structures, which represent a perfect blend of 
Hindu-Muslim architecture, and date back to the eighth century. This is a great 
site for travellers interested in photography. Get there before sunrise to 
capture the golden light on the pink and yellow hues on the monuments.

The Andaman Islands are certainly off the beaten track, being nearer to 
Thailand than India. We flew to Port Blair where we were appalled to learn 
about the British treatment of Indian freedom fighters in theCellular Jail 
<http://www.andamanbeacon.com/cellularjail.html> in the 19th century. Then it 
was a short boat trip to stunning Havelock island. Here we stayed at the aptly 
named Barefoot at Havelock. Beach No 7, beside Barefoot, is the most beautiful 
beach I have ever seen. Think stunning white sands, rollicking frothy waves and 
gorgeous sunsets. Even better, it was so peaceful and quiet with barely anyone 
there.

 Tea Break in the Western Ghats. Photograph: buryboy 
I did a great cycling trip through rural India, high up in the Western Ghats, 
using tracks through the tea plantations above Munnar and in the hills above. 
There were lots of small villages to stop in for food and drink. One 
particularly memorable long run was over the top of the Ghats ridge and 
downhill into Tamil Nadu on a narrow cobbled track built by the British to 
serve the tea trade.

Uttarkashi is a place of wonder, white water rafting, mountaineering and 
walking trails. You can also see the breathtaking Yamunotri temple (at 3,000m), 
a Hindu shrine to the goddess Yamuna. Accommodation is generally in village 
house apartments or in small low rise apartment complexes with a garden. We 
stayed at the Pavani, which was about £12 a night per room. It was very 
comfortable and clean. We dined in the Shangri La kitchen, which allowed you to 
select your own seafood and have it cooked in Nepalese fashion. If you are 
looking for a place where no one asks you to buy anything, and very little 
English is spoken, forcing you to pick up some of the language, and you wake up 
to the sounds and smells of the forest, this place is for you.

A train to Indore (a major junction that’s 12 hours by train from Mumbai) then 
a bus to Dhar and a further bus toMandu is probably why most people never get 
to see some of the finest Afghan architecture in the whole of India. We arrived 
to find only two other tourists there and we all found accommodation at the 
local Hindu temple – where the bus stops. Perched on top of a plateau are a 
royal temple, baobab trees from Africa and many other fine examples of Afghan 
art and buildings including Rupmati’s Pavilion. It is said that the Royal 
Palace is a smaller version of the Taj Mahal and it is easy to see why. An 
unforgettable and beautiful place.

We visited Dhula village (between Jaipur and Agra) during a golden triangle 
trip in India. Dhula is not a touristy place; therefore, it gives a true feel 
of rural India, and provides a great place for getting to know locals. Everyone 
is excited to meet you, as they rarely get visitors to the area. However, 
thanks to the amazingDhula Bagh <http://www.dhulabagh.com/>, I trust this will 
soon change. This glamping accommodation allows for a relaxed escape from the 
busy areas of India, with a pool to relax in and organic, home-grown food 
provided. The host also arranges activities, such as walks, henna and bike 
rides to a local farmer’s home. <https://www.facebook.com/Dhulabagh/>

Brahmin’s Soda Factory, Karnataka


Mysore can be a suffocating place in late March, so we were relieved to 
stumble across Brahmin’s, a no-frills soda and ice-cream shop after a day 
exploring the famous markets. Seats are much-coveted inside; there’s always a 
queue for one of the dozen or so berths, which are lined up on opposite walls 
like a dentist’s waiting room. Curious locals and confused visitors exchange 
glances over their 10-rupee bowls of ice-cream. Be sure to try one of the 
delicious juices, although the orange masala – think Fanta with a sprinkling of 
curry powder – is an acquired taste.

My trip in the Indian Himalayas’ Garhwal region involved a trek from the 
village of Lata to see the legendary Nanda Devi peak. It was hard and 
exhilarating and we were thankful for the efforts of the team of porters that 
escorted us. We spent three weeks trekking in these parts in all. A fabulous 
and memorable trip. It was beautifully organised by CS Pandey ofHimalayan Run

The Ajanta caves near Aurangabad were cut out of rock over 2,000 years old and 
only became known by the British when a colonial officer stumbled across them 
in dense jungle in 1819. There are around 30 Buddhist cave monuments including 
temples, monasteries and ancient mural paintings. Everything is carved out of a 
single piece of rock in the mountainside and the scale has to be experienced to 
be believed. It must have taken several generations to complete and is one of 
the most impressive things I’ve ever seen. Although famous among Indian 
tourists, this region of Maharashtra state is often overlooked by foreign 
tourists. Ajanta caves are 220 miles east of Mumbai and can be reached by 
overnight train (6-7 hours) to Aurgangabad.
