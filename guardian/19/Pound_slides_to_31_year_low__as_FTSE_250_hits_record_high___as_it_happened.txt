Closing summary: Shares surge, pound slumps

After a wild day in the markets, it‚Äôs time to wrap things up.

Fears of a Hard Brexit have sent the pound reeling to a new 31-year low 
tonight.

Sterling traded as low as $1.2721, its weakest point since 1985, on growing 
expectations that the UK will leave the single market.

Currency expert Kathleen Brooks <https://twitter.com/kathleenbrooks>, of 
FOREX.com and City Index, pinned the blame on events atthe Conservative party 
conference in Birmingham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live>
.

The Tory party conference is turning into a sell for the pound, as FX traders 
get spooked by May‚Äôs apparent sanguine attitude to leaving the single market, 
preferring to focus on immigration and UK sovereignty rather than the economic 
fallout of Brexit.

PM Theresa May has insisted that the economy is in good shape

, with growth looking solid and unemployment low.

While the pound weakened, Britain‚Äôs stock market went on a tear today. The 
FTSE 100 jumped by 90 points

, having come within a whisker of hitting its alltime intraday high.

The smaller FTSE 250 index did hit a record high

Analysts said the weak pound had helped to drive share prices higher, as it 
will help exports and make overseas earnings more valuable.

Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says:


Reports that UK Prime Minister Theresa May is not looking for any favourable 
treatment for the financial services sector has been cited as one reason behind 
the latest sterling decline.

It wasn‚Äôt all currency effect through ‚Äì the FTSE 250, which does have its fair 
share of firms with foreign earnings, is more domestically focused.

At the moment, UK investors are getting their cake and eating it. The threat 
of more rate cuts and money-printing from the Bank of England if the government 
chooses a ‚ÄúHard Brexit‚Äù has sent the British pound lower, but UK economic data 
continues to impress.

Theresa May: Currencies go up and down

Prime minister Theresa May has insisted tonight that the economic fundamentals 
of the UK economy remain strong.

During an interview with the BBC, May pointed to recent upbeat surveys - and 
the new forecasts issued by the IMF today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/04/pound-dollar-low-construction-imf-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-57f3a6fde4b05e7633c58582#block-57f3a6fde4b05e7633c58582>
.

And asked about the pound hitting a 31-year low today, she said:

Currencies <https://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies> of course go up 
and down. If you look at the fundamentals of the economy, it‚Äôs strong.

If you look at recent economic data, the forecasts coming out now for growth 
this year, it‚Äôs all more positive than people had expected it to be.

She also reiterated that she wants to get the ‚Äúright deal‚Äù for the UK; one 
that lets British businesses both operate in and trade with the single market.

Despite today‚Äôs soaring shares, the weakness of the pound underlines that 
there are big worries about Brexit.

James Andrews, head of investment management at stockbroking firm 
Redmayne-Bentley, warns that a selloff could be painful:

‚ÄúThe heady heights we see in the UK equity markets currently reflect the lack 
of returns to be found in less risky assets, such as cash and bonds. The FTSE 
100 is no longer a gauge of the UK economy, given it is full of large 
multi-national companies, but the more domestic-focussed FTSE 250 is also 
touching all-time highs.

‚ÄúThe likely fallout of messy negotiations around the exit from the EU mean it 
is an uncomfortable view from the summit currently, and it‚Äôs a long way down if 
the future turns out to be less than rosy.‚Äù

We do have a record to celebrate, though.

The FTSE 250 index has closed at its highest ever level, up 0.9% or 158 points

That‚Äôs significant, as this index contains more UK companies than the Footsie

FTSE 100 fails to hit record high

A groan ripples around City trading floors, as the FTSE 100 fails to hit a new 
record closing high.

The blue-chip index closed up 90 points, or 1.3%, at 7074. That is a new 
17-month closing high, but not the record.

It was still a good day for shares, with some internationally focused firms 
like Rolls-Royce and Pearson leading the rally.

But the temptation to take profits took the wind out of the markets‚Äô sails at 
the end.

It was quite a dramatic day, as Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains:

Today‚Äôs incredible rise in the FTSE 100 has been one of the biggest risk on 
moves of the year, with investors seeing in Q4 with a bang.

 Fears over the economic implications of a Brexit have been brushed aside in 
favour of a focus on the benefits a weak pound and loose monetary policy would 
bring to stocks. As Phillip Hammond said, we are in for a roller coaster, yet 
on initial evidence, markets like the idea.

BoE policymaker: Brexit won't be too bad

Michael Saunders, the newest member of the Bank of England‚Äôs monetary policy 
committee, has fired a broadside at his colleagues for being too pessimistic 
over Brexit.

In a speech just released (due to be given tomorrow), Saunders says that the 
EU will probably cause rather less damage than policymakers had feared.

He cites Britain‚Äôs ‚Äúconsiderable supply-side advantages‚Äù, from its flexible 
labour market and openness to foreign investment, to the current ‚Äúlow-ish‚Äù tax 
rates and strong position in high-tech manufacturing and knowledge-intensive 
services.

So Saunders (who was a top economist at Citigroup until he joined the BoE 
rate-setting this summer), reckons growth in 2017 will be stronger than 
expected.

After a good lunch, Saunders will tell the Institute of Directors in 
Manchester tomorrow that:

The process of EU exit may be lengthy and bumpy. It is certainly possible that 
anticipation of EU exit will have a greater near-term adverse effect on the 
economy than the MPC expect, especially if EU nationals currently working in 
the UK decide to leave or business investment weakens really markedly. But, 
unless Brexit-related uncertainties rise sharply and/or global conditions 
disappoint markedly, I suspect that the UK economy will be not too bad in the 
year ahead, with growth in 2017 more likely to be clearly above 1% rather than 
(as the consensus expects) below 1%.

Hence, especially if productivity growth remains modest, there may be little 
or no rise in unemployment in the UK over the coming year, although the current 
degree of slack would remain unless growth is strong enough to cut unemployment 
further.

You can see the speech here (lunch, alas, not included)

Some investors who bought shares after the Brexit vote will be cashing in their
 hard-earned gains winnings this afternoon.

So says Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer at online dealing group TD 
Direct Investing.

‚ÄúWith the FTSE peaking 7,100 this afternoon, our customers are predominantly 
selling today - demonstrating their savviness. Experienced investors have been 
buying up since Brexit and seemingly now enjoying the profits. The important 
thing for the markets is that it holds 7,000 overnight ‚Äì this will be impacted 
by how the S&P 500 behaves.

She also urges small investors to be cautious...

‚ÄúFrom a broader perspective, we hope that those less experienced investors 
aren‚Äôt getting too excited by the excitement and piling in, for the first time, 
while it‚Äôs high ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt the best investment strategy and they will lose 
their confidence yet again.‚Äù

Ben Chu, the economics editor of the Independent, has done a nice piece about 
the causes of the pound‚Äôs weakness.

He says:

This week‚Äôs renewed downward lurch has coincided with Theresa May saying she 
will trigger Article 50 before next March and making it clear that she will not 
compromise on curbing EU immigration to the UK, something that strongly implies 
Britain will be out of the single market by 2019.

The fundamental reason for sterling‚Äôs descent is that traders believe there 
will be lower demand for sterling assets as a result of Brexit ‚Äì that we will 
ultimately do less trade with the rest of the world and that we will be poorer 
as a result. Argue the markets are wrong if you want to ‚Äì but recognise what 
they are saying.

Ooooh the FTSE 100 is pushing even higher as the clock ticks down to 4.30pm.

It just hit 7121 points, a whisker away from the record intraday high of 7122 
(set in April 2015).

Oh, and I made a mistake before. The all-time record closing high is 7104. And 
that record is ON....

With one hour to go, the FTSE 100 index is just three points away from its 
record closing high, at 7009 points.

Richard Stone, chief executive at The Share Centre, explains why the weak 
pound has pushed shares up:


For companies in the FTSE100, some three quarters of their revenues are not 
earned in Sterling so are now worth more in Sterling terms. This makes their 
profits higher in Sterling and therefore their value inSterling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> terms also increases.

After a wild day in the markets, it‚Äôs time to wrap things up.

Fears of a Hard Brexit have sent the pound reeling to a new 31-year low 
tonight.

Sterling traded as low as $1.2721, its weakest point since 1985, on growing 
expectations that the UK will leave the single market.

Currency expert Kathleen Brooks <https://twitter.com/kathleenbrooks>, of 
FOREX.com and City Index, pinned the blame on events atthe Conservative party 
conference in Birmingham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live>
.

The Tory party conference is turning into a sell for the pound, as FX traders 
get spooked by May‚Äôs apparent sanguine attitude to leaving the single market, 
preferring to focus on immigration and UK sovereignty rather than the economic 
fallout of Brexit.

PM Theresa May has insisted that the economy is in good shape

, with growth looking solid and unemployment low.

While the pound weakened, Britain‚Äôs stock market went on a tear today. The 
FTSE 100 jumped by 90 points

, having come within a whisker of hitting its alltime intraday high.

The smaller FTSE 250 index did hit a record high

Analysts said the weak pound had helped to drive share prices higher, as it 
will help exports and make overseas earnings more valuable.

Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says:


Reports that UK Prime Minister Theresa May is not looking for any favourable 
treatment for the financial services sector has been cited as one reason behind 
the latest sterling decline.

It wasn‚Äôt all currency effect through ‚Äì the FTSE 250, which does have its fair 
share of firms with foreign earnings, is more domestically focused.

At the moment, UK investors are getting their cake and eating it. The threat 
of more rate cuts and money-printing from the Bank of England if the government 
chooses a ‚ÄúHard Brexit‚Äù has sent the British pound lower, but UK economic data 
continues to impress.

Prime minister Theresa May has insisted tonight that the economic fundamentals 
of the UK economy remain strong.

During an interview with the BBC, May pointed to recent upbeat surveys - and 
the new forecasts issued by the IMF today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/04/pound-dollar-low-construction-imf-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-57f3a6fde4b05e7633c58582#block-57f3a6fde4b05e7633c58582>
.

And asked about the pound hitting a 31-year low today, she said:

Currencies <https://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies> of course go up 
and down. If you look at the fundamentals of the economy, it‚Äôs strong.

If you look at recent economic data, the forecasts coming out now for growth 
this year, it‚Äôs all more positive than people had expected it to be.

She also reiterated that she wants to get the ‚Äúright deal‚Äù for the UK; one 
that lets British businesses both operate in and trade with the single market.

Despite today‚Äôs soaring shares, the weakness of the pound underlines that 
there are big worries about Brexit.

James Andrews, head of investment management at stockbroking firm 
Redmayne-Bentley, warns that a selloff could be painful:

‚ÄúThe heady heights we see in the UK equity markets currently reflect the lack 
of returns to be found in less risky assets, such as cash and bonds. The FTSE 
100 is no longer a gauge of the UK economy, given it is full of large 
multi-national companies, but the more domestic-focussed FTSE 250 is also 
touching all-time highs.

‚ÄúThe likely fallout of messy negotiations around the exit from the EU mean it 
is an uncomfortable view from the summit currently, and it‚Äôs a long way down if 
the future turns out to be less than rosy.‚Äù
 
We do have a record to celebrate, though.

The FTSE 250 index has closed at its highest ever level, up 0.9% or 158 points 
at 18342.

That‚Äôs significant, as this index contains more UK companies than the Footsie 
100 -- including engineering firm Renishaw (+4% today) and security firm G4S 
(+3.3%).

A groan ripples around City trading floors, as the FTSE 100 fails to hit a new 
record closing high.

The blue-chip index closed up 90 points, or 1.3%, at 7074. That is a new 
17-month closing high, but not the record.

It was still a good day for shares, with some internationally focused firms 
like Rolls-Royce and Pearson leading the rally.

But the temptation to take profits took the wind out of the markets‚Äô sails at 
the end.

It was quite a dramatic day, as Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains:

Today‚Äôs incredible rise in the FTSE 100 has been one of the biggest risk on 
moves of the year, with investors seeing in Q4 with a bang.

 Fears over the economic implications of a Brexit have been brushed aside in 
favour of a focus on the benefits a weak pound and loose monetary policy would 
bring to stocks. As Phillip Hammond said, we are in for a roller coaster, yet 
on initial evidence, markets like the idea.
 
The stock market has gone into its closing auction!.... And we‚Äôre about to 
find out if the FTSE 100 has hit a new record closing high....
 
Michael Saunders, the newest member of the Bank of England‚Äôs monetary policy 
committee, has fired a broadside at his colleagues for being too pessimistic 
over Brexit.

In a speech just released (due to be given tomorrow), Saunders says that the 
EU will probably cause rather less damage than policymakers had feared.

He cites Britain‚Äôs ‚Äúconsiderable supply-side advantages‚Äù, from its flexible 
labour market and openness to foreign investment, to the current ‚Äúlow-ish‚Äù tax 
rates and strong position in high-tech manufacturing and knowledge-intensive 
services.

So Saunders (who was a top economist at Citigroup until he joined the BoE 
rate-setting this summer), reckons growth in 2017 will be stronger than 
expected.

After a good lunch, Saunders will tell the Institute of Directors in 
Manchester tomorrow that:

The process of EU exit may be lengthy and bumpy. It is certainly possible that 
anticipation of EU exit will have a greater near-term adverse effect on the 
economy than the MPC expect, especially if EU nationals currently working in 
the UK decide to leave or business investment weakens really markedly. But, 
unless Brexit-related uncertainties rise sharply and/or global conditions 
disappoint markedly, I suspect that the UK economy will be not too bad in the 
year ahead, with growth in 2017 more likely to be clearly above 1% rather than 
(as the consensus expects) below 1%.

Hence, especially if productivity growth remains modest, there may be little 
or no rise in unemployment in the UK over the coming year, although the current 
degree of slack would remain unless growth is strong enough to cut unemployment 
further.

You can see the speech here (lunch, alas, not included)

Some investors who bought shares after the Brexit vote will be cashing in their
 hard-earned gains winnings this afternoon.

So says Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer at online dealing group TD 
Direct Investing.

‚ÄúWith the FTSE peaking 7,100 this afternoon, our customers are predominantly 
selling today - demonstrating their savviness. Experienced investors have been 
buying up since Brexit and seemingly now enjoying the profits. The important 
thing for the markets is that it holds 7,000 overnight ‚Äì this will be impacted 
by how the S&P 500 behaves.

She also urges small investors to be cautious...

‚ÄúFrom a broader perspective, we hope that those less experienced investors 
aren‚Äôt getting too excited by the excitement and piling in, for the first time, 
while it‚Äôs high ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt the best investment strategy and they will lose 
their confidence yet again.‚Äù
 
Ben Chu, the economics editor of the Independent, has done a nice piece about 
the causes of the pound‚Äôs weakness.

He says:

This week‚Äôs renewed downward lurch has coincided with Theresa May saying she 
will trigger Article 50 before next March and making it clear that she will not 
compromise on curbing EU immigration to the UK, something that strongly implies 
Britain will be out of the single market by 2019.

The fundamental reason for sterling‚Äôs descent is that traders believe there 
will be lower demand for sterling assets as a result of Brexit ‚Äì that we will 
ultimately do less trade with the rest of the world and that we will be poorer 
as a result. Argue the markets are wrong if you want to ‚Äì but recognise what 
they are saying.

Ooooh the FTSE 100 is pushing even higher as the clock ticks down to 4.30pm.

It just hit 7121 points, a whisker away from the record intraday high of 7122 
(set in April 2015).

Oh, and I made a mistake before. The all-time record closing high is 7104. And 
that record is ON....
 
With one hour to go, the FTSE 100 index is just three points away from its 
record closing high, at 7009 points.

Richard Stone, chief executive at The Share Centre, explains why the weak 
pound has pushed shares up:


For companies in the FTSE100, some three quarters of their revenues are not 
earned in Sterling so are now worth more in Sterling terms. This makes their 
profits higher in Sterling and therefore their value inSterling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/sterling> terms also increases.
 
The IMF‚Äôs new report hasn‚Äôt helped the pound; it‚Äôs still wallowing at the 
31-year low of $1.275.

Betway, the gambling firm, are offering odds on it falling further, and even 
hitting parity, before the end of the year.
