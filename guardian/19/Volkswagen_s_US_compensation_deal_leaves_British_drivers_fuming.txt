More than a year after the VW emissions scandal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2015/sep/24/vw-volkswagen-diesel-emissions-carmaker-why-video>
 broke, the owners of more than 1.2m affected vehicles in the UK are no closer 
to being compensated, prompting criticism that those in Britain have been 
treated derisively compared with those in the US.

This week, a US judge approved a $15bn (£12bn) settlement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/26/volkswagen-emissions-scandal> 
that has forced the company to compensate affected VW drivers, with the result 
that each owner will receive between $5,000 and $10,000 (£4,000 and £8,000) 
depending on the age of their vehicle.

It is in stark contrast to what’s happening in the UK, where VW has so far 
refused goodwill payments, and the government has been accused by MPs of 
failing to tackle the company.

US VW owners have been told they will be able to choose between having their 
vehicle purchased back at its pre-scandal trade-in value, or to have VW repair 
the cars once regulators approve the fixes – and receive the cash payments in 
either case.

Compensation for owners will cost the German manufacturer $10bn in America. On 
top, VW has agreed to pay an additional $4.7bn to programmes that offset excess 
emissions and to clean-car projects. The US judge turned down objections from 
owners who thought the compensation should have been higher, saying the 
agreement was “adequate and fair”.

In the UK that will sound hollow to VW owners, as most are no closer to 
getting their vehicles looked at – let alone being compensated for the 
pollution issues involved.

VW says 190,000 of the 1.2m affected vehicles across the group have so far 
been upgraded at a dealer. A solution has been identified for 478,000 cars, it 
said, suggesting there is yet to be an approved solution for more than 700,000 
vehicles.

VW owner Jacobus Alders from Appleton, Cheshire, contacted Guardian Money this 
week to ask why there hasn’t been a greater outcry from owners in the face of 
VW’s lack of action in the UK, that he says has left him and other customers in 
limbo.

“I have just received yet another letter regarding the emission issue that is 
affecting my Volkswagen Jetta. This is the fourth letter, and again the 
measures promised to fix the issue have been postponed. Also, there is still no 
reference to any form of financial compensation by Volkswagen, which I find 
utterly disappointing and totally unacceptable.”

Alders says he is trying to sell his car, but feels the emissions issue has 
had a negative impact on his negotiating position. “I could try my luck via the 
various solicitors and legal firms that are offering me assistance in this 
matter, but I would rather see Volkswagen offer me compensation directly. I 
recently spoke to somebody with a similar Jetta that had now been repaired. He 
told me that all Volkswagen offered him was a cup of coffee and a pen on the 
day of the repair! I wonder how our American friends would react if they were 
treated like that?” he says.

In July, VW’s failure to compensate UK owners of cars affected by the 
emissions scandal was described as “deeply unfair” by the transport select 
committee, which also claimed the government had been too slow to investigate 
whether VW should be prosecuted in the UK for the scandal.

Louise Ellman, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said at the time that 
VW had “acted cynically” to cheat emissions tests, and that the company’s 
evidence to the committee was “not credible”.

“The government has lacked the will to hold VW accountable for its actions. 
Vehicle owners have been refused goodwill payments. That is despite VW 
inflicting a great deal of uncertainty on its own customers, along with the 
prospect of declining residual values and the inconvenience of having to 
undergo repairs,” she said.

Calls for compensation are growing in Europe, but so far VW has rejected 
claims. A number of owners have started legal cases against the car maker, 
including in Ireland.

A spokesman for VW told Money this week: “We have engaged constructively with 
our customers. They are our top priority. We are working hard to make the 
procedure on the affected vehicles as convenient as possible for all our 
customers and have promised to ensure that the implementation of the technical 
measures will not incur costs for any UK customer. We continue to meet 
regularly with the Department for Transport to update them on progress.”

He said nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions limits for vehicles in the US are much 
stricter than those in Europe and the UK, and the engine variants also differ 
significantly.

“This makes the development of technical measures in the US more challenging 
than in Europe and the UK. The situation in the US is not applicable to the 
situation in the UK,” he says.

Andy Cutler, car-value expert at Glass’s, says following the scandal there was 
a drop in values of Volkswagen Group cars, but they recovered and are now 
“almost exactly where we would have expected them to be if it hadn’t happened”.

The DfT told Money: “The government takes the unacceptable actions of VW 
extremely seriously. That is why we have taken swift action to protect the UK 
consumer. We were the first country in Europe to complete our own tests (April 
2016) to ensure the issue was not industry-wide.

“We continue to push VW to take action to compensate the UK consumer. 
Transport minister John Hayes recently met with the MD for VW UK, Paul Willis, 
to reaffirm the government’s calls for compensation and press for a fix to 
affected cars to be carried out as quickly as possible.”
