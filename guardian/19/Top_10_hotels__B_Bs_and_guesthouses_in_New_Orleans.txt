Balcony Guest House

Despite its ascendance beyond being "up and coming", the Marigny neighbourhood 
is still short of accommodation options. Seven blocks away from the French 
Quarter puts you in a tranquil, residential idyll, and the colourful, 
Creole-style rooms of this guest house ooze authenticity. Below you is a 
century-old institution, in the form of former grocery store (and now local 
diner),Schiro's Cafe <http://www.schiroscafe.com>. Book the Deluxe 1 room, and 
you can enjoy balcony views of locals easing into their day as you have your 
morning coffee. You're close to two of the Marigny's highlights: the bar atLost 
Love Lounge <http://lostlovelounge.com> and the brunches of Cake Café & Bakery 
<http://www.nolacakes.com>.

Hotel le Marais

French Quarter accommodation options include a wealth of famous names and big 
historic properties but also this unassuming and quietly impressive boutique 
hotel. It not only adds a dash of colourful modern design to a neighbourhood 
marinated in its own past but it generously piles on the extras that are 
sometimes missing from the big chains: breakfast, Wi-Fi and bottled water are 
all included. Comfy rooms have plush lilac and purple fittings, and though the 
madness of Bourbon Street is only a plastic bead's-throw away, you're 
tastefully set back from the excess.

Hotel Modern
 Hotel Modern, New Orleans 
A parrot called Scarlet the Macaw and a chilled glass of wine make checking in 
at this design-focused addition to the Lower Garden District a delight. The 
rooms occupy a tower overlooking Lee Circle and atmospherics are provided by 
the streetcar trundling across St Charles Avenue. In the rooms, vintage pieces 
and carefully curated libraries add to the charm, as do striking wrought-iron 
bedsteads. On site are a couple of welcome additions to the city's dining 
scene: modern-southern restaurantTivoli & Lee <http://www.tivoliandlee.com/> 
and much-vaunted pre-prohibition cocktail loungeBellocq 
<http://www.thehotelmodern.com/bellocq>. All in all, it's an innovative 
property for a sometimes stubbornly traditional city.

Frenchmen Hotel

There's still time to appreciate the famous old jazz clubs of Frenchmen 
Street, even as it changes. Locals fear it is becoming the new Bourbon Street 
but venues such as theSpotted Cat <http://www.spottedcatmusicclub.com/> and 
d.b.a <http://www.dbaneworleans.com/> still show class musical acts. A few 
steps from the thick of things is this affordable slice of the Marigny 
neighbourhood. The rooms are built around a courtyard pool and feature exposed 
brickwork and canopy beds. The staff instantly become your friends and will 
happily regale you with their favourite spots for gumbo or swing dancing over 
complimentary coffee or wine.

Ashtons B&B
 Ashtons B&B, New Orleans 
Few bed-and-breakfast owners treat the breakfast half of the equation with 
such unabandoned decadence as Patrick and Karma Ashton. You could fill up for 
the day on the feasts they serve, which rival local expensive restaurants. 
Bananas Foster waffles or Mardi Gras eggs Benedict, anyone? The house is an 
exquisite Greek Revival mansion (built in 1861), all high ceilings, chandeliers 
and spacious parlours – an atmospheric quality that seeps through to the rooms 
themselves. From its tranquil Esplanade Avenue location, a pleasant talk takes 
you to City Park or the French Quarter.

Fleur De Lis Mansion

There's a hint of rock'n'roll hedonism permeating this otherwise historic 
mansion in the Lower Garden District. The whole building can be rented but so 
can individual themed rooms. If mirrored ceilings and louche decor are your 
style, the Champagne Room and the Hollywood Bungalow will make you happy, as 
might the 12-person hot tub in the courtyard. The shared outside kitchen boasts 
a barbecue pit and projection TV, though it's easy to wander out to the art 
galleries and hip eateries of the Warehouse District, and it's only a few 
minutes' walk on from there to downtown.

The Lookout Inn

The rise of the Bywater neighbourhood has been irresistible in recent times, 
with new businesses opening up on streets where, 10 years ago, you wouldn't 
really go as a visitor. Eclectic is an overused term but is apt for the suites 
here: choose from Mardi Gras, Elvis, Mission and Bollywood. All have spacious 
bathrooms, and flair: with flying dragons and carnival masks gracing the 
colourful walls. You're almost surrounded by new restaurants, where you'll 
mingle with locals rather than the tourists.Oxalis <http://oxalisbywater.com/>, 
Maurepas <http://maurepasfoods.com/> and Booty's <http://bootysnola.com/> are 
among the best, andSatsuma <http://satsumacafe.com/> has inventive breakfast 
options.

HH Whitney House

Many people come to New Orleans to wallow in its history, to live out their 
A-Streetcar-Named-Desire 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_%28play%29> fantasies 
sipping mint juleps under the oak trees. The greens and golds of the Scarlett 
O'Hara suite at the HH Whitney House would be a suitable backdrop for this, the 
four-poster bed overlooked by a portrait of the eponymous heroine and a 
clawfoot bath waiting at the end of a balmy day. There are five rooms and 
suites, looking out over Esplanade Ridge, a pleasingly old-fashioned district. 
City Park and the Fairgrounds are a leisurely saunter away.

Jazz Quarters
 Jazz Quarters, New Orleans 
Tremé has enjoyed a heightened profile since the HBO show, and now happily 
welcomes visitors overflowing from the neighbouring French Quarter. This newly 
renovated B&B celebrates the musical heritage of the neighbourhood, its nine 
cute cottages named after musicians such as [Harry] Connick and [Louis] 
Armstrong. The rooms have queen-size beds, chandeliers and luxury linens, as 
well as their own kitchens. Communal breakfasts are served on a sun-flecked 
terrace and if you need to walk off your morning meal, Louis Armstrong Park is 
just across the road.

International House Hotel
 International House Hotel, New Orleans 
The modernity of the Central Business District is nicely interrupted by the 
elegant white frontage of this Beaux-Arts hotel, a former bank that has been in 
its current incarnation since 1998. There's an esoteric feel to the place from 
the moment you walk into the lobby, with art installations and altars to 
celebrate the city's myriad days of observance. The rooms are a slightly more 
rock'n'roll affair, all plush velvet chairs and designer lamps. Evenings out 
should be book-ended by aperitifs or nightcaps at the shadowy cocktail bar, 
Loa, which serves up craft cocktails in the glowing candlelight.
