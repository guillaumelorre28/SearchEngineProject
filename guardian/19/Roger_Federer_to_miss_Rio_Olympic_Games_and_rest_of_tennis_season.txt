Federer said: “I’m extremely disappointed to announce I will not be able to 
represent Switzerland at the Olympic Games in Rio and that I will also miss the 
remainder of the season. Considering all options after consulting with my 
doctors and my team, I have made the very difficult decision to call an end to 
my 2016 season as I need more extensive rehabilitation following my knee 
surgery earlier this year.

“ The doctors advised that if I want to play on the ATP World Tour injury-free 
for another few years, as I intend to do, I must give both my knee and body the 
proper time to fully recover. It is tough to miss the rest of the year. 
However, the silver lining is that this experience has made me realise how 
lucky I have been throughout my career with very few injuries. The love I have 
for tennis, the competition, tournaments and of course you, the fans remains 
intact. I am as motivated as ever and plan to put all my energy towards coming 
back strong, healthy and in shape to play attacking tennis in 2017.”
