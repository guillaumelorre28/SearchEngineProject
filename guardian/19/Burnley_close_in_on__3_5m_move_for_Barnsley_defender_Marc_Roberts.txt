Burnley are close to completing a £3.5m move for the Barnsley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/barnsley> defender Marc Roberts.

The 26-year-old, who limped out of Barnsley’s shock defeat in the FA Cup

replay against the League Two side Blackpool, has impressed this season in the 
Championship having joined from non-league Halifax Town in 2015.

Roberts has been a key player in Paul Heckingbottom’s young team who have 
risen to 10th in the Championship and that has not gone unnoticed.

With Kevin Long out injured, Sean Dyche needs cover for the centre-backs 
Michael Keane and Ben Mee, and feels Roberts has the ability to make the step 
up.

Barnsley-born Roberts, who began his career at Wakefield before spells at 
Worksop Town and Buxton, has only 18 months left on his contract and is 
expected to agree personal terms withBurnley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/burnley> in the coming days.

He could be followed out of Oakwell by defensive partner Angus MacDonald. 
Championship rivals Norwich are preparing a £1.5m bid to sign the player who 
moved to Barnsley only last summer from National League side Torquay.

It has not been a happy few days for Barnsley, who had their chief executive, 
Linton Brown, surprisingly leave last week and then sold the striker Sam 
Winnall to Sheffield Wednesday.
