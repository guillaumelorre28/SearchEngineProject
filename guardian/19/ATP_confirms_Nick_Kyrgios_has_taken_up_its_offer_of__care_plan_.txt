Nick Kyrgios <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nick-kyrgios> is set for a 
reprieve, with his ATP Tour ban expected to be slashed.

The Australian was suspended for eight weeks and fined more than $50,000 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/17/nick-kyrgios-suspended-atp-shanghai-conduct-tennis>
 for “not giving his best effort” atthis month’s Shanghai Masters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/12/nick-kyrgios-row-serving-without-effort-not-returning-shanghai-masters>
, but the ATP said it would reduce the ban to three weeks if the troubled star 
engaged a sports psychologist.

While Kyrgios’s management and Tennis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Australia have declined to discuss 
the matter, the sports’ governing body has revealed that the 21-year-old is 
receiving treatment.

“Nick has taken up the care plan on offer to him from the ATP. The details and 
contents of the plan are strictly confidential,” the ATP said.

Despite remaining tight-lipped about the specific details of Kyrgios’s “care 
plan” or how long he was committed to it, it appears Australia’s world No13 
will be allowed to compete again from the week beginning on 7 November.

In any case, Kyrgios’ season is over with no more tournaments scheduled for 
2016 other than next month’s World Tour Finals in London.

He did not qualify for the elite eight-man event despite soaring to his 
career-high ranking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/24/suspended-nick-kyrgios-rises-to-new-high-in-latest-atp-rankings>
 and winning his first three ATP titles in an otherwise successful 2016 
campaign.

The likely easing of his suspension will, though, allow Kyrgios to launch his 
Australian summer at the ITF-run Hopman Cup without any ATP sanctions hanging 
over him.
