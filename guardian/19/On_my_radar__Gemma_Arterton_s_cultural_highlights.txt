Twenty-eight-year-old actress Gemma Arterton grew up in Gravesend, Kent, and 
attended first the Miskin theatre school in Dartford then the Royal Academy of 
Dramatic Art. She secured her first film role – as headgirl Kelly Jones inSt 
Trinian’s – while still at Rada, and shortly after graduating played Bond girl 
Strawberry Fields in 2008’sQuantum of Solace. In 2010, she secured the lead in 
Tamara Drewe <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwHxdsO3o6Q>, for which she was 
nominated for a Bafta rising star award. She is currently appearing in Richard 
Bean’s musicalMade in Dagenham <http://www.madeindagenhamthemusical.com/> at 
the Adelphi theatre, London.

Music: Haley Bonar <http://haleybonar.com/>

My favourite artist is an American singer called Haley Bonar. Her current 
album is calledLast War. It’s amazing – my album of the year. She’s had five 
albums out already, but this is the first one that gained recognition over here.
Bon Iver <http://boniver.org/> – another artist I like – helped her out on 
this. It’s so eclectic and different. Everyone should own this album.

If I have time to see anything in the next six months, Katie Mitchell’s The 
Cherry Orchard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/26/cherry-orchard-review-katie-mitchell-young-vic-review>
 at the Young Vic is on my list, just because it’s the complete opposite of 
what I’m doing at the moment, which is an out-and-out, full-on, uplifting 
musical comedy. It’s a very intense play – I’d like to see some hardcore acting 
and her stuff is always really interesting. I’d also like to seeHenry IV at the 
Donmar <http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/whats-on/donmar-warehouse/2014/henry-iv>
. It’s – an all-female cast directed by Phyllida Lloyd.

Book: We Have Always Lived in the Castle 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/we-have-always-lived-in-the-castle.html> by 
Shirley Jackson <http://shirleyjackson.org/> 

I’m reading this at the moment. It was written in the early 1960s and it’s a 
black comedy. It’s quite haunting – it’s about three characters who have 
agoraphobia. One’s been acquitted of murdering the rest of her family by 
accidental poisoning. It has this weird American period feel. It’s quite 
dark, but funny also.

Restaurant: The 34 <http://www.34-restaurant.co.uk/>

I love the 34. It makes me feel quite chic, because it’s in Mayfair, and they 
do good cocktails. I don’t go out for dinner often, so when I do I like to live 
it up a bit. It has a really good vegetarian menu; I’m not vegetarian but I 
mostly eat vegetarian food. I also likethe Wallace restaurant 
<http://www.peytonandbyrne.co.uk/the-wallace-menu/index.html>. It’s a gorgeous 
setting, really quite romantic.

Exhibition: Paris Photo <http://www.parisphoto.com/>

I live in Paris – it has an amazing art and photography scene. During 
November, they have the Paris Photo – everywhere in Paris is turned into a 
venue featuring photography. If you’re a photography fan, it’s heaven.

In my opinion, Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best directors out there. I 
lovedThe Master <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ1O1vb9AUU> and Magnolia 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYTqhmzROko> and There Will Be Blood 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3THVbr4hlY> – I’ve seen all of his films. 
Boogie Nights <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOk0fsMGyck> is one of my 
favourite films ever. I’m very excited aboutInherent Vice – the trailer 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZfs22E7JmI> looks great. It has a brilliant 
cast, including Joaquin Phoenix. It’s going to be good.
