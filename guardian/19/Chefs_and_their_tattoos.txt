Anyone who has done much dining out over the past 10 years will have likely 
noticed a change coming over the people preparing their food. No longer a 
phalanx of indistinguishable figures in whites and toques, chefs have shrugged 
off the uniform and are hellbent on declaring their individuality. They do this 
in a variety of ways but none more striking than the tattoo, which has spread 
from biceps to hands, from chests to necks and faces. Some, as these 
illustrations from new bookKnives & Ink document, refer to food (pigs, cakes 
and shellfish abound); others have personal meanings that benefit from a little 
explanation.

Of course, chefs are far from the only ones with tattoos these days, nor is 
the tattooed chef anything new. As food impresario Andrea Petrini points out, 
Paul Bocuse has been sporting acoq gaulois on his bicep since his stint in a US 
army hospital during the second world war. “A lot of chefs have been wearing 
tattoos for ages, but they weren’t showing it,” Petrini says. “They were 
hanging around with their funny hats and long-sleeved chef’s jackets – now 
they’re wearing short sleeves.” They are also, thanks to the rise of the open 
kitchen and a general easing of restaurant formalities, more visible to diners 
than before. If you’re offended at the prospect of being catered to by a chef 
with a pig’s head on his throat, best look away now.

My grandfather raised my dad in Yokohama before the family moved to Washington 
Heights. They weregaijin [foreigners], but Japanese art was omnipresent in my 
childhood. Now, it’s omnipresent on my body. Cooking is one of the most 
beautiful gifts you can give to someone. It embodies love, patience and 
balance. Plating, too, is tantamount, just as important as the permanent 
placement of a tattoo.

This tattoo is something I’d planned for a long time. It signifies a lot of 
things: my love of great ingredients, the resourcefulness of my ancestors, and 
the path that I chose for myself, both artistically and professionally. It’s a 
paddy crab, which is a classic Vietnamese ingredient. The crab is a pest to 
rice farmers in Vietnam, but also serves as an immediate source of wild protein 
for them. They eat it fried, boiled, and even use fermented crab as a condiment 
in green papaya salad. It’s important to me to remember where I came from, and 
the humble food that still sustains and satisfies people everywhere.

I realised throughout my career as a chef that my love for the swine had 
grown. I knew the homage needed to be front and centre. Plus, some of my 
favourite preparations come from the head. As chefs, we must honour, respect 
and utilise every part we can. All hail the swine.

I was about six months sober when I got this tattoo and feeling incredible: 
clear-minded, focused, no longer anxiously wondering when that next drink was 
going to come. A burden had been lifted from my shoulders. I already had a 
banner tattoo that read “Bake or Die”, and I decided my new lifestyle called 
for another one. “Sweet n’ Sober” seemed to fit, but I wanted to wait just a 
bit longer to make sure of my commitment. Four months later, I was back under 
the gun. That was almost 10 years ago. There are so many things I wouldn’t have 
accomplished without being sober: my marriage, my business. Life has a funny 
way of trying to teach us lessons and giving us the best direction to grow and 
prosper. All we have to do is listen, implement and create.

A few years ago I had an accident. A very scary one. I was a hotel chef at the 
time, working seven days a week. I came home very late from work one night, 
exhausted, and while I was in the shower I slipped and sliced a tendon in my 
leg wide open. I lost consciousness for 15, 20 minutes. When I came to, blood 
was everywhere. I could have lost my life, but somehow I didn’t. I called 911 
and an ambulance arrived before I bled out. Still, I was bedridden for three 
months. I couldn’t move. So this tattoo reminds me to celebrate the moment I 
lived. I wanted something that spoke to the mix of struggle and hope, dream and 
reality. It’s about doing anything in life that you put your heart to, knowing 
that it doesn’t matter where you are in your life. Any moment is the right 
moment, because none of us know how many moments we have left.
