Well, we now know who the winner of Murray-Kyrgios will play on Wednesday, 
because Gasquet has just conceded his match against Tsonga due to a back injury.
 That’s sad for Gasquet, who has twice been a semi-finalist in SW19 and has 
been playing some brilliant tennis of late. He was trailing 4-2 in the opening 
set at the time.

Tomas Berdych, however, the 10th seed and 2010 finalist, is in a spot of 
bother against Jiri Vesely. Vesely leads the all-Czech clash 4-2 after claiming 
an early break of serve. The winner will play whoever comes out on top between 
Bernard Tomic and Lucas Pouille, who are locked in an almighty struggle on 
Court 12. After almost three hours, Tomic leads 8-7 in the final set. It’s 
going with serve there.

Andy Murray has won the first set 7-5 against Nick Kyrgios, and that’s not the 
only good news for British fans.Because in the girls’ singles, Jodie Anna 
Burrage has won her match against Caty McNally 6-1 in the third. At this point, 
she could well be playing Ioana Minca of Romania in the next round. The 
Romanian is a set up against seventh seed Dayana Yastremska.

Raonic was perhaps a little fortunate with that last shot, digging out the 
deepest of returns from Goffin – hard and true, it almost landed on his toecaps 
– to find an off forehand winner.Still, what a fightback. It’s the first time 
in his career that the Canadian has come back from two sets to love down. 
Spectacular stuff. Which is probably more than can be said of his prospective 
quarter-final against Querrey, a match unlikely to have the connoisseurs 
queuing alongWimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> Park Road. 
I think we can confidently say that one will be service-dominated.

David Goffin must have been sensing blood in the water at 15-30 on the Raonic 
serve, but how well the Canadian snuffed out the danger.An absolute howitzer of 
a forehand from Raonic got him back to 30-30, from where a winning half volley 
and some big serving carried him safely through to 5-3. Impressive stuff, that, 
and Goffin will now have to serve to stay in the match.

As Goffin holds with a cry of “Allez!”, I can tell you that Vesnina has come 
through that titanic tussle against Makarova, winning 9-7 in the third.What an 
effort by the Russian, who can now look forward to the first grand slam 
quarter-final of her career. Not that a contest with Dominika Cibulkova is a 
prospect to be relished just now, as Aggie Radwanska will attest.

Leanings towards the litigious have been an interesting feature of this year’s 
tournament. You’ll recall that, last week, a fuming Gilles Simon threatened to 
sue umpire John Bloom for making him continue on a wet court. Well, nowSerena 
Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> is at it. During 
her win over Kuznetsova, she said to the chair umpire, Marija Cicak: “I’m going 
to fall. I don’t get it. Can’t they just close the roof?” Her response was 
inaudible, but not so Williams’ rejoinder: “If I get hurt, I’m suing.” 
Hopefully the precedent set by Eugenie Bouchard, who is suing the US Tennis 
Association after the locker-room fall at the US Open last year, isn’t about to 
catch on …

“Am I surprising myself?” reflects Venus. “I’ve been in this position before.” 
That you have, Venus. “The first time you win, no one picks you; the last time 
you win, no one picks you. So you have to believe in yourself.”

Meanwhile, Venus Williams is beaming from ear to ear on No1 Court. And no 
wonder, because she’s just served out the match to take down Carla Suarez 
Navarro 7-6, 6-4 in an hour and 36 minutes. Thirty-six years old and she’s 
through to the last eight. Again. What a competitor.

With 88% of first serves in play, including seven aces, it’s no surprise that 
Milos Raonic has just squared his match with David Goffin. That was an 
impressive performance by the Canadian, who also slammed down 15 winners in 
that fourth set. Raonic was so pleased with his efforts that he rewarded 
himself with a comfort break. The winner will play Sam Querrey – conqueror of 
Novak Djokovic, as if I need to remind you – in the last eight.

As Venus Williams prepares to serve for a place in the last eight, things are 
coming to a head nicely on Court Three, where it’s 6-6 in the final set between 
Elena Vesnina and Ekaterina Makarova.They’re the only unseeded players left in 
the women’s draw, and they’ve been going at it now for almost two and a half 
hours. The winner plays Cibulkova.

And in the time it took to write that last sentence, down went another ace and 
up went the sixth seed’s prospects of extending Goffin to a fifth set. Did you

Anyway, back to the tennis, where a certain big-serving Canadian is now 
pounding down 130mph-odd deliveries with the benefit of a break of serve behind 
him. I have in mind Milos Raonic, of course, who is 4-3 up – and has two game 
points for 5-3 …

Wondering how the players spend their downtime during Wimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon>? Well, it turns out that one of 
the many perks of participation in one of the world’s premier tennis events is 
a pair of top-price tickets to a London show. Figures released by the club show 
Matilda and Wicked have been especially popular, with 15 requests. Next comes 
Beyoncé, whose gigs at Wembley stadium have been attended by 13 players, 
including Britain’s Laura Robson. So now you know.

Caty McNally has an early break in the girls’ singles and leads Britain’s 
Jodie Anna Burrage 3-0. At the opposite end of the spectrum, there are no such 
problems for Venus Williams, who is still a break ahead in the second set 
against Suarez Navarro, despite the vocal encouragement of Spanish Fed Cup 
captain and formerWimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> 
champion Conchita Martínez. It’s a set and 3-2 to Williams.

But what of Milos Raonic, I hear you ask? Well, the towering Canadian is still 
battling for his life against Belgium’s David Goffin, who has just held serve 
with a 126mph delivery. It’s 2-1 in the fourth, with the sixth-seeded Raonic 
trailing by two sets to one.

On Court 19, Britain’s Jodie Anna Burrage is in action in the girls’ singles. 
Burrage, you may recall, scored a notable victory over Marion Bartoli – 
reigning if retiredWimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> 
champion at the time – as a 15-year-old. That was two years ago at the 
Liverpool Hope University International. Her opponent today is an American, 
Caty McNally, and Burrage will be keen to put the disappointment of last year – 
when she experienced breathing difficulties during a straight-sets loss to 
Lucie Wargnier of France – firmly behind her. She’s going well so far, having 
just won the first set 6-4. The reward for victory could be a crack at the 
Ukrainian seventh seed Dayana Yastremska, who faces Ioana Minca of Romania 
later. Good incentive, that. Best of luck, Jodie.

Talking of family matters, Serena – who has just taken the second set 6-0 
against Svetlana Kuznetsova to complete a straight sets win on Centre Court – 
isn’t the only Williams making progress towards the last eight.Over on Court 
One, Venus has just pocketed the opening set against Carla Suarez Navarro on a 
tiebreak (7-3, since you ask). She’s amazing, is Venus: back in the top 10 and 
flying high at the All England Club once again. A sixth title may not be beyond 
her, you know.

Many thanks, Jacob – enjoy. Well, what an absorbing day it’s been so far, not 
least with Dominika Cibulkova’s dramatic defeat of the third-seeded Agnieszka 
Radwanska in the women’s draw. In one sense, it wasn’t a surprise: Cibulkova 
has been in fine form of late, and also beat the Pole en route to winning the 
title in Eastbourne. Even so, no one seems more surprised than the likeable 
Slovak herself. She was due to get married this Saturday, but may have to keep 
her fiance Miso Navara waiting if she carries on like this. Reaching aWimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> final wouldn’t be a bad excuse, 
mind.

Is Bernard Tomic back on track? You betcha! The 19th seed has levelled the 
match against Lucas Pouille on Court 12, taking the second set 6-4. It’s never 
simple where Tomic is concerned.

John McEnroe has got rid of the snapback. Time to get serious. The sartorial 
switch seems to have a positive effect on Milos Raonic, who’s moving better now 
and he breaks for the first time in the match when David Goffin knocks a 
backhand long in the third game of the third set. It’s still a long way back 
from here from Raonic, who’s two sets down, but he will fancy his chances of at 
least pushing this into a fourth set now.

Carla Suarez Navarro served for the first set against Venus Williams. She 
failed to see it out. There’s been a lot of that today. Williams now leads 6-5 
and she looks to be turning this one around against the 12th seed on Court 1.

An audience with Roger Federer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer>.

Q. You’ve achieved so much in your career. If there was one thing, one more 
goal in life as much as tennis, what is it? Or have you done the lot?

ROGER FEDERER: In tennis?

Q. One big goal you want to achieve, tennis or in life, what would you say it 
was, or have you done the lot?

ROGER FEDERER: In life? In life there’s so much more to come. In tennis, 
tennis there’s not that much more. I hope there is a bit more in tennis. I hope 
I can winWimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> one more time. 
That would be nice.

In life, gee, I need to speak to my wife about that one, not with you in the 
press (laughter). I don’t know. I’m looking forward to a lovely life with my 
kids and my wife, travel, I don’t know, unbelievable moments.

Milos Raonic has won 62% of his second serves during the tournament. That 
stat’s down to 50% today, however. He’s in major bother. The neat and tidy 
David Goffin is playing extremely well.

There was some rain based controversy in the doubles on Court 7. Welcome to 
England.

Three match points to Marray & Shamasdin over Cuevas/Granollers and their 
opponents sit down because there's a bit of rain in the air

Marray and Shamasdin win it! 14-12 in the fifth to reach QFs. Fantastic match 
- Cuevas and Granollers still arguing with the umpire

Milos Raonic has disappeared down the tunnel on Court 2, where a minor upset 
is brewing. He double faults on a set point and David Goffin, the 11th seed, 
leads 6-4, 6-3. Raonic looks baffled. Maybe it’s John McEnroe’s outfit. Maybe 
because his serve’s not clicking.

Venus Williams appears to be limping a little against Carla Suarez Navarro, 
who’s apparently the best footballer on the WTA.

The ever enigmatic Bernard Tomic was a break up in the first set. He’s lost it 
6-4 to Lucas Pouille, the 32nd seed, who put out Juan Martin del Potro 
yesterday. Meanwhile David Goffin is currently having a stormer. He has a read 
on Milos Raonic’s serve and he’s in control once they’re deep into the rally. 
So it’s not too much of a surprise to see Raonic net a forehand and drop his 
serve to trail 6-4, 3-2 on Court 2.

downing Madison Keys 6-7, 6-4, 6-3 to reach the last eight. Keys put up a good 
fight and at one point appeared to be heading for victory, leading by a set and 
a break, but she was struggling with a knee problem by the end and whacked a 
forehand long on match point. Halep is through to face Angelique Kerber. She 
leads their head-to-head record 3-1.

David Goffin has been threatening for a while on Court 2 and he makes the 
breakthrough in the seventh game of the first set, walloping a forehand down 
the line to break Milos Raonic for a 4-3 lead.Meanwhile the Sam Querrey story 
goes on as the American whips an ace past Nicolas Mahut to reach his first 
grand slam quarter-final with a surprisingly composed 6-4, 7-6, 6-4 win. 
Beating Novak Djokovic can’t have taken too much out of him, then.

Well, that’s just about it from me for tonight. Andy Murray has just gone two 
sets to love up against Nick Kyrgios, sealing the second set 6-1 in 26 minutes. 
You can follow that matchhere 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/jul/04/wimbledon-2016-andy-murray-v-nick-kyrgios-fourth-round-live>
 with Jacob Steinberg. Thanks for reading, have a good evening and don’t forget 
to join us again tomorrow.
 
Well, we now know who the winner of Murray-Kyrgios will play on Wednesday, 
because Gasquet has just conceded his match against Tsonga due to a back injury.
 That’s sad for Gasquet, who has twice been a semi-finalist in SW19 and has 
been playing some brilliant tennis of late. He was trailing 4-2 in the opening 
set at the time.
 
Tomas Berdych, however, the 10th seed and 2010 finalist, is in a spot of 
bother against Jiri Vesely. Vesely leads the all-Czech clash 4-2 after claiming 
an early break of serve. The winner will play whoever comes out on top between 
Bernard Tomic and Lucas Pouille, who are locked in an almighty struggle on 
Court 12. After almost three hours, Tomic leads 8-7 in the final set. It’s 
going with serve there.
 
Elsewhere, it’s going with serve in the all-French tussle between Richard 
Gasquet and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on No1 Court. Tsonga leads 3-2. 
 
Andy Murray has won the first set 7-5 against Nick Kyrgios, and that’s not the 
only good news for British fans.Because in the girls’ singles, Jodie Anna 
Burrage has won her match against Caty McNally 6-1 in the third. At this point, 
she could well be playing Ioana Minca of Romania in the next round. The 
Romanian is a set up against seventh seed Dayana Yastremska.
 
Raonic was perhaps a little fortunate with that last shot, digging out the 
deepest of returns from Goffin – hard and true, it almost landed on his toecaps 
– to find an off forehand winner.Still, what a fightback. It’s the first time 
in his career that the Canadian has come back from two sets to love down. 
Spectacular stuff. Which is probably more than can be said of his prospective 
quarter-final against Querrey, a match unlikely to have the connoisseurs 
queuing alongWimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> Park Road. 
I think we can confidently say that one will be service-dominated.
 
What a comeback from Milos Raonic! He was two sets to love down but has turned 
it around against David Goffin, slamming a final forehand winner to reach the 
last eight.
 
Raonic perhaps betrays his state of mind with a double fault, but a big 
forehand and a 140mph first serve bring up two match points at 40-15 …
 
Raonic makes a nervy start, slamming a first serve hideously long. But a 
118mph second serve leaves Goffin helpless …
 
The talented Belgian responds in typically defiant manner, sealing a 
comfortable hold with a meaty forehand approach to which Raonic has no answer.
Nonetheless, Raonic will now serve for it at 5-4. Watch this space …
 
David Goffin must have been sensing blood in the water at 15-30 on the Raonic 
serve, but how well the Canadian snuffed out the danger.An absolute howitzer of 
a forehand from Raonic got him back to 30-30, from where a winning half volley 
and some big serving carried him safely through to 5-3. Impressive stuff, that, 
and Goffin will now have to serve to stay in the match.
 
As Goffin holds with a cry of “Allez!”, I can tell you that Vesnina has come 
through that titanic tussle against Makarova, winning 9-7 in the third.What an 
effort by the Russian, who can now look forward to the first grand slam 
quarter-final of her career. Not that a contest with Dominika Cibulkova is a 
prospect to be relished just now, as Aggie Radwanska will attest.
 
Raonic, meanwhile, is storming through the fifth set against Goffin. After an 
early break, he’s 4-2 up.
 
Leanings towards the litigious have been an interesting feature of this year’s 
tournament. You’ll recall that, last week, a fuming Gilles Simon threatened to 
sue umpire John Bloom for making him continue on a wet court. Well, nowSerena 
Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams> is at it. During 
her win over Kuznetsova, she said to the chair umpire, Marija Cicak: “I’m going 
to fall. I don’t get it. Can’t they just close the roof?” Her response was 
inaudible, but not so Williams’ rejoinder: “If I get hurt, I’m suing.” 
Hopefully the precedent set by Eugenie Bouchard, who is suing the US Tennis 
Association after the locker-room fall at the US Open last year, isn’t about to 
catch on …
 
It’s going with serve on Centre Court, where Andy Murray leads Nick Kyrgios 
3-2 in the opening set. You can follow that one with Jacob Steinberg here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/jul/04/wimbledon-2016-andy-murray-v-nick-kyrgios-fourth-round-live>
.
 
“Am I surprising myself?” reflects Venus. “I’ve been in this position before.” 
That you have, Venus. “The first time you win, no one picks you; the last time 
you win, no one picks you. So you have to believe in yourself.”
 
Meanwhile, Venus Williams is beaming from ear to ear on No1 Court. And no 
wonder, because she’s just served out the match to take down Carla Suarez 
Navarro 7-6, 6-4 in an hour and 36 minutes. Thirty-six years old and she’s 
through to the last eight. Again. What a competitor.
 
With 88% of first serves in play, including seven aces, it’s no surprise that 
Milos Raonic has just squared his match with David Goffin. That was an 
impressive performance by the Canadian, who also slammed down 15 winners in 
that fourth set. Raonic was so pleased with his efforts that he rewarded 
himself with a comfort break. The winner will play Sam Querrey – conqueror of 
Novak Djokovic, as if I need to remind you – in the last eight.
 
As Venus Williams prepares to serve for a place in the last eight, things are 
coming to a head nicely on Court Three, where it’s 6-6 in the final set between 
Elena Vesnina and Ekaterina Makarova.They’re the only unseeded players left in 
the women’s draw, and they’ve been going at it now for almost two and a half 
hours. The winner plays Cibulkova.
 
And in the time it took to write that last sentence, down went another ace and 
up went the sixth seed’s prospects of extending Goffin to a fifth set. Did you 
ever doubt it?
 
Anyway, back to the tennis, where a certain big-serving Canadian is now 
pounding down 130mph-odd deliveries with the benefit of a break of serve behind 
him. I have in mind Milos Raonic, of course, who is 4-3 up – and has two game 
points for 5-3 …
 
Wondering how the players spend their downtime during Wimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon>? Well, it turns out that one of 
the many perks of participation in one of the world’s premier tennis events is 
a pair of top-price tickets to a London show. Figures released by the club show 
Matilda and Wicked have been especially popular, with 15 requests. Next comes 
Beyoncé, whose gigs at Wembley stadium have been attended by 13 players, 
including Britain’s Laura Robson. So now you know.
 
Caty McNally has an early break in the girls’ singles and leads Britain’s 
Jodie Anna Burrage 3-0. At the opposite end of the spectrum, there are no such 
problems for Venus Williams, who is still a break ahead in the second set 
against Suarez Navarro, despite the vocal encouragement of Spanish Fed Cup 
captain and formerWimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> 
champion Conchita Martínez. It’s a set and 3-2 to Williams.
 
But what of Milos Raonic, I hear you ask? Well, the towering Canadian is still 
battling for his life against Belgium’s David Goffin, who has just held serve 
with a 126mph delivery. It’s 2-1 in the fourth, with the sixth-seeded Raonic 
trailing by two sets to one.
 
You can follow Andy Murray’s match against Nick Kyrgios right here 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/jul/04/wimbledon-2016-andy-murray-v-nick-kyrgios-fourth-round-live>
. That’s over on Centre Court. On No1, meanwhile, Venus has just broken Suarez 
Navarro to move 2-1 ahead.
 
On Court 19, Britain’s Jodie Anna Burrage is in action in the girls’ singles. 
Burrage, you may recall, scored a notable victory over Marion Bartoli – 
reigning if retiredWimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> 
champion at the time – as a 15-year-old. That was two years ago at the 
Liverpool Hope University International. Her opponent today is an American, 
Caty McNally, and Burrage will be keen to put the disappointment of last year – 
when she experienced breathing difficulties during a straight-sets loss to 
Lucie Wargnier of France – firmly behind her. She’s going well so far, having 
just won the first set 6-4. The reward for victory could be a crack at the 
Ukrainian seventh seed Dayana Yastremska, who faces Ioana Minca of Romania 
later. Good incentive, that. Best of luck, Jodie.

 
Talking of family matters, Serena – who has just taken the second set 6-0 
against Svetlana Kuznetsova to complete a straight sets win on Centre Court – 
isn’t the only Williams making progress towards the last eight.Over on Court 
One, Venus has just pocketed the opening set against Carla Suarez Navarro on a 
tiebreak (7-3, since you ask). She’s amazing, is Venus: back in the top 10 and 
flying high at the All England Club once again. A sixth title may not be beyond 
her, you know.
 
Many thanks, Jacob – enjoy. Well, what an absorbing day it’s been so far, not 
least with Dominika Cibulkova’s dramatic defeat of the third-seeded Agnieszka 
Radwanska in the women’s draw. In one sense, it wasn’t a surprise: Cibulkova 
has been in fine form of late, and also beat the Pole en route to winning the 
title in Eastbourne. Even so, no one seems more surprised than the likeable 
Slovak herself. She was due to get married this Saturday, but may have to keep 
her fiance Miso Navara waiting if she carries on like this. Reaching aWimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> final wouldn’t be a bad excuse, 
mind.
 
That’s all from me today. I’m off to cover Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> and Nick Kyrgios, so I’ll leave 
you in the capable hands of Les Roopanarine.
 
Serena Williams roars as she wins the first set 7-5 against Svetlana 
Kuznetsova.The roof is back on Centre Court and the world No1 has raised her 
level, responding to dropping her serve by winning consecutive games to burst 
into the lead.

The rain has stopped and the players are returning on the outside courts. The 
action will resume shortly.
 
It’s raining. I was assured there would be no rain!

Is Bernard Tomic back on track? You betcha! The 19th seed has levelled the 
match against Lucas Pouille on Court 12, taking the second set 6-4. It’s never 
simple where Tomic is concerned.
 
John McEnroe has got rid of the snapback. Time to get serious. The sartorial 
switch seems to have a positive effect on Milos Raonic, who’s moving better now 
and he breaks for the first time in the match when David Goffin knocks a 
backhand long in the third game of the third set. It’s still a long way back 
from here from Raonic, who’s two sets down, but he will fancy his chances of at 
least pushing this into a fourth set now.
 
Carla Suarez Navarro served for the first set against Venus Williams. She 
failed to see it out. There’s been a lot of that today. Williams now leads 6-5 
and she looks to be turning this one around against the 12th seed on Court 1.
 
An audience with Roger Federer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/roger-federer>.

Q. You’ve achieved so much in your career. If there was one thing, one more 
goal in life as much as tennis, what is it? Or have you done the lot?

ROGER FEDERER: In tennis?

Q. One big goal you want to achieve, tennis or in life, what would you say it 
was, or have you done the lot?

ROGER FEDERER: In life? In life there’s so much more to come. In tennis, 
tennis there’s not that much more. I hope there is a bit more in tennis. I hope 
I can winWimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> one more time. 
That would be nice.

In life, gee, I need to speak to my wife about that one, not with you in the 
press (laughter). I don’t know. I’m looking forward to a lovely life with my 
kids and my wife, travel, I don’t know, unbelievable moments.
 
Milos Raonic has won 62% of his second serves during the tournament. That 
stat’s down to 50% today, however. He’s in major bother. The neat and tidy 
David Goffin is playing extremely well.
 
There was some rain based controversy in the doubles on Court 7. Welcome to 
England.

Marray and Shamasdin win it! 14-12 in the fifth to reach QFs. Fantastic match 
- Cuevas and Granollers still arguing with the umpire

Milos Raonic has disappeared down the tunnel on Court 2, where a minor upset 
is brewing. He double faults on a set point and David Goffin, the 11th seed, 
leads 6-4, 6-3. Raonic looks baffled. Maybe it’s John McEnroe’s outfit. Maybe 
because his serve’s not clicking.
 
Venus Williams appears to be limping a little against Carla Suarez Navarro, 
who’s apparently the best footballer on the WTA.
 
Ekaterina Makarova has the first set in the bag against Elena Vesnina. The 
Russian wins it 7-5 against the other Russian on Court 3.
 
The sun has gone behind the clouds and it’s getting dark. A few umbrellas are 
up.
 
David Goffin saves two break points, then holds thanks to a laser guided 
volley.He leads 6-4, 4-3 against Milos Raonic. Venus Williams, meanwhile, 
trails by an early break against Carla Suarez Navarro. And there’s a spot of 
rain in the air.

The ever enigmatic Bernard Tomic was a break up in the first set. He’s lost it 
6-4 to Lucas Pouille, the 32nd seed, who put out Juan Martin del Potro 
yesterday. Meanwhile David Goffin is currently having a stormer. He has a read 
on Milos Raonic’s serve and he’s in control once they’re deep into the rally. 
So it’s not too much of a surprise to see Raonic net a forehand and drop his 
serve to trail 6-4, 3-2 on Court 2.
 
John McEnroe is watching Milos Raonic on Court 2. He’s wearing a black suit, a 
black tie, a white shirt and sunglasses. And a snapback.
 
Nick Kyrgios is preparing for his match against Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> by watching Lleyton Hewitt play 
doubles on Court 18. I hope he’s enjoying himself.
 
Simona Halep is beaming. The Romanian can’t keep the smile off her face after 
downing Madison Keys 6-7, 6-4, 6-3 to reach the last eight. Keys put up a good 
fight and at one point appeared to be heading for victory, leading by a set and 
a break, but she was struggling with a knee problem by the end and whacked a 
forehand long on match point. Halep is through to face Angelique Kerber. She 
leads their head-to-head record 3-1.

David Goffin has been threatening for a while on Court 2 and he makes the 
breakthrough in the seventh game of the first set, walloping a forehand down 
the line to break Milos Raonic for a 4-3 lead.Meanwhile the Sam Querrey story 
goes on as the American whips an ace past Nicolas Mahut to reach his first 
grand slam quarter-final with a surprisingly composed 6-4, 7-6, 6-4 win. 
Beating Novak Djokovic can’t have taken too much out of him, then.
