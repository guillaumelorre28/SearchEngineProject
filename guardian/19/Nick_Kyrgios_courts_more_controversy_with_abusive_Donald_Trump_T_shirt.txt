Nick Kyrgios’s controversial career took another turn on Monday night when he 
was pictured wearing a “Fuck Donald Trump” T-shirt at a press conference in 
Sydney.

The Australian changed into the top, which also displayed a picture of the US 
president-elect complete with devil horns, shortly after defeating Rafael Nadal 
in five sets in a Fast4 exhibition match in his homeland.

When asked about wearing the T-shirt, Kyrgios told the Australian media: “It’s 
pretty explanatory.”

The 21-year-old, currently managing a knee injury ahead of the start of the 
Australian Open next week, returned to his dressing room and changed back into 
his branded sports top after the interview.

Kyrgios has hit the headlines for the wrong reasons on several occasions 
during his brief career. He was fined twice by the Association ofTennis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Professionals, first for an on-court 
remark about Stan Wawrinka’s girlfriend during their Rogers Cup match in 
Montreal in 2015 and then a year later for his behaviour during a defeat to the 
qualifier Mischa Zverev at the Shanghai Masters.

Kyrgios also pulled out of the Rio Olympics last year due to a continuing row 
with the Australian Olympic Committee.
