The Old No 77 Hotel and Chandlery

This is how to refurb a hotel. Not by over-stuffing it with designer gubbins 
but by paring the whole place (including the rooms) right back and letting the 
history of the building – an 1850s warehouse with hardwood floors and exposed 
brick walls made from Mississippi mud clay – shine through. There are 166 rooms 
but it has the feel of an easygoing and very friendly boutique hotel. The new 
restaurant,Compère Lapin <http://comperelapin.com/> is also several cuts above 
your standard hotel eatery. St Lucia-born chef Nina Compton blends the tropical 
flavours of her homeland with the rich New Orleanean cuisine – a heady, 
flavourful mix that includes curried goat with plantain gnocchi, spiced pig 
ears, snapper crudo and marinated shrimp with roasted jalapeño jus. The bar 
mixes great cocktails, too, and it’s only four blocks from the French Quarter.

With the city booming and Katrina causing an unprecedented population shift 
(to and from the city), gentrification conundrums abound in New Orleans, and 
the exciting but controversial new St Roch food market is a textbook example. 
The beautiful building is home to 15 different types of vendor, selling 
oysters, coffee, seafood, charcuterie, Creole-fusion food and so on, plus a 
well-stocked bar at the back. The problem is that for over a century this very 
cool, and sensitively restored space was home to a fish market until it closed 
right after Katrina, and that is exactly what the local community says it 
wanted back … but wasn’t consulted on. Politics aside, the place has a friendly 
and welcoming vibe and all the food I tried was excellent – and affordable 
enough that few could complain of being priced out of here.

 Speakeasy charm … Cellar Door. Photograph: Brandt Vicknair 
The New Orleans cocktail fraternity speak of Jeff “Beachbum” Berry in 
reverential terms, and after spending a couple of hours in his bar,Latitude 29 
<http://latitude29nola.com/>, which opened in the French Quarter at the end of 
last year, I can see why. The signature Latitude 29 (eight-year Demerara rum, 
passion fruit puree, Madagascar vanilla syrup, orange, pineapple and lemon) is 
a delicious drink, a perfect modern-day example of the tiki art. The bar snacks 
are great here, too (bahn mi, steak frites, curly fries), and during happy hour 
these cost just a few dollars.

A large number of restaurants and cocktail bars have opened in New Orleans in 
the last couple of years – theCellar Door <http://www.cellardoornola.com/#about>
 is a bit of both. It’s housed in one of the city’s oldest buildings (once one 
of its longest-running brothels), and has an atmospheric speakeasy feel. The 
craft cocktails are on the money and small plates (tuna tartare, chicken wings, 
fried green tomato sandwich) soak up the booze nicely.

 Way to go … the proposed Lafitte Greenway will from City Park to Louis 
Armstrong Park 
Chosen by Lindsay Pick, co-founder, Louisiana Lost Lands Environmental Tours
The Lafitte Greenway is a 2.6-mile park that will run through the heart of New 
Orleans fromCity Park <http://neworleanscitypark.com/> to Louis Armstrong Park 
<http://www.nola.gov/parks-and-parkways/parks-squares/congo-square-louis-armstrong-park/>
. Originally a canal connecting Bayou St John to the edge of the French 
Quarter, it was a vital historical transportation corridor that has been unused 
since the mid-20th century. The Greenway will include scenic transportation 
routes via a bike and walking path, and provide much needed storm 
water-retention areas with native plant meadows and bioswales. It will also 
provide recreational areas with football and soccer fields. The Greenway is 
scheduled to open this summer.

Out of town kayak tours

Lost Lands’ kayaking trips couldn’t be more different from a touristy 
feed-the-gators swamp tour. It offers a chance to paddle Louisiana’s cypress 
and tupelo forests, meandering bayous, and the sprawling wetlands that sit on 
New Orleans’ doorstep and once laced the city itself. It is a fascinating but 
also sobering tour, focussing not only on the region’s mesmerising beauty but 
also its natural history and the catastrophic environmental damage – as a 
result oil drilling, dredging and mining – that is causing the Louisiana coast 
to steadily sink into the Gulf of Mexico.

 The new Krewe store in the French Quarter. Photograph: Hunter Holder 
People don’t give a damn what you wear in New Orleans – and I mean that in a 
good way – but in such sultry climes, a cool pair of sunglasses is a must.Krewe 
<http://www.kreweduoptic.com/> (as in a Mardi Gras crewe) is a local sunglasses 
company that has become phenomenally successful across the States and beyond 
(Beyonce has worn them) in just two years. The high-quality shades created by 
founder Stirling Barrett have a classic retro look, and were in such demand 
locally that it opened a small impromptu shop under the office (800 Common 
Street) and is launching another in the French Quarter (809 Royal Street) any 
day now.

Solange Knowles, Beyonce’s little sister, opened Exodus Goods 
<http://exodusgoods.us/> (518 Conti Street) in the French Quarter last year. 
It’s the kind of minimalist boutique that has just one rail of very expensive 
clothes (though I did spot a bargain or two) and the male assistant wears a 
turban as a fashion statement. And the brilliantEuclid Records 
<http://www.euclidnola.com/>, which we featured last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/mar/18/top-10-shops-vintage-stores-new-orleans>
, has moved just around the corner to 3401 Chartres Street and now has an even 
bigger selection of vinyl over two floors.

This modern, buzzing Israeli-owned steakhouse typifies the city’s booming 
restaurant scene: you would never have seen anything remotely this 
sophisticated at the touristy end of the French Quarter pre-Katrina. My steak 
(butcher’s cut with mushroom ragù, $38) was as flavourful and well-cooked as 
you’d expect from a restaurant that hangs aged hunks of beef in its window like 
pieces of art and has a Japanese Wagyu Striploin for a ridiculous $185 on the 
menu. But even better was my tuna tartar starter ($15), laced with ginger 
emulsion, tobiko, salicornia, radish, avocado, soy pearls, wasabi – a memorably 
beautiful and delicious plate of food. And while this is anything but a typical 
Nola restaurant, it is still big on the region’s gorgeously rich seasoning – 
the French fries are flavoured with truffle oil and the mashed potatoes (I had 
both, for research purposes) thick with cream and garlic.

Until you visit New Orleans, you may not realise how walkable this city is. 
Or, in my case, bike-able. Most of my favourite haunts are a few hundred 
peddles from my front door, but restaurant number one these days happens to be 
a few steps away. Pêche, owned by Louisiana chef Donald Link 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/jan/30/jay-mcinerney-in-new-orleans>, 
is one the busiest restaurants in the city. It has a fresh, modern take on our 
coastal seafood and cooks many of its dishes on an open hearth over hardwood 
coals – which you can see in the open kitchen. But I usually bypass the line at 
the door, take a bar seat and settle in for the best oysters in town, smoked 
tuna dip and something crispy from the wine list.

These guys started out as a food truck called the Fat Falafel in 2012, and 
opened this restaurant a few months ago. It’s in Mid-City, a world away from 
the French Quarter, the place is tiny (about 25 seats), it doesn’t take 
reservations, and it’s BYOB. Go to Swirl, the wine shop next door, and ask for 
a suggestion on what would go with the restaurant’s current seasonal menu. We 
went for the Falafel Feast for Two ($28), with hummus, baba ghanoush, yogurt, 
pickled vegetables, root slaw, local greens, tahini, cilantro chile sauce, and 
toum. It was delicious.

I have been very impressed by the Private Dining Room; it reflects something 
unique about New Orleans culture and also took great start-up gumption. Rita 
and Will opened a weekly speakeasy supper club in their kitchen and dining 
room, something I think you’ll see more of as people jump into business in new 
and different ways when they have something to add to the local food scene. 
Hesitation goes out of the window and people try new models. That ties back 
into the rich and innovative creative culture we have here in New Orleans. And 
most importantly, the food is excellent!

If you play trad jazz at any level, even in your bedroom, the New Orleans 
Traditional Jazz Camp would be the holiday of a lifetime. It is in it’s seventh 
year but still growing, and in 2016 there will be two camps. Participants from 
all over the world are based at the grand oldBourbon Orleans hotel 
<http://www.bourbonorleans.com/> in the French Quarter, and take classes and 
rehearsals led by professional local musicians, building up to a double-finale 
at the end of the week: playing a concert at legendary jazz venuePreservation 
Hall <https://www.preservationhall.com/> and in a marching band through the 
French Quarter. For an amateur musician this is the equivalent of a pub 
football team playing at Wembley, twice in one week.
• 2016 camps run 19-24 June and 30 July-4 August and cost $1,800pp, including 
instruction and six nights half-board at the Bourbon Orleans hotel but 
excluding flights,neworleanstraditionaljazzcamp.com

Where Y’Art came into existence almost exactly a year ago with the mission of 
creating a community of artists and art-lovers throughout New Orleans. 
Co-founders Collin Ferguson and Cat Todd have a unique and collaborative 
approach to showcasing local artists and designers. They do so not only through 
their gallery space on Julia Street but also on their website. It’s a brilliant 
way to provide a venue for artists to reach a global audience and an equally 
marvellous way for art-lovers to connect with some of the ground-breaking work 
that is emerging in New Orleans’ art scene. Where Y’Art is a great example of 
that wonderful synthesis that is happening in New Orleans: the merging of 
traditional culture with more of a contemporary approach – and creating a 
distinctive nuance of the sharing-economy.

The Country Club outdoor pool

New to this Bywater neighbourhood institution this year – ending 35 years of 
au naturel bathing – is compulsory swimwear, after a ruling by the state’s 
alcohol and tobacco control board put a stop optional nude bathing. This 
strikes me as an odd piece of legislation, given that bathers are not only 
still allowed to smoke and drink around the pool but actuallyin it, too. The 
baking afternoon I visited, I counted 17 people in the water, and I was the 
only one swimming lengths. Everyone else was just hanging out in the water, 
cocktail in hand, to cool off. So I gave up, ordered a margarita and joined 
them. Only in New Orleans …
