The 28-year-old Benin international has signed a deal tying him to the 
Riverside Stadium club until June 2020 after agreeing personal terms on Tuesday.

Gestede made 19 appearances for Villa this season, scoring four goals, but had 
fallen out of favour with their new manager, Steve Bruce. He had been linked 
with West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace.

The signing casts further doubt on the future of the Middlesbrough strikers 
Jordan Rhodes and David Nugent, with Fulham reportedly interested in signing 
the latter.

Middlesbrough confirmed the move on their website, stating: “Boro have 
completed the signing of Rudy Gestede fromAston Villa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa> for an undisclosed fee.”

Boro’s third-choice goalkeeper, Tomas Mejias, is set to join Rayo Vallecano on 
loan.
