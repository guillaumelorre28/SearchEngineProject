A revolutionary new way to see city sights is on offer in Boston where The 
Boston Audissey has launched an iPod/MP3 walking tour, focusing on the city's 
more "secret" sites and delivering haunting sound effects with vivid accounts 
of historical events. "MP3 technology allowed us to use music and sound effects 
to really make the stories come alive," says 27-year-old Bostonian Rob Pyles, 
one of the innovators behind the idea. The tour leads you in the footsteps of 
fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad on Beacon Hill, to the Boston Tea 
Party and to the former headquarters of the Boston Mafia in the North End, all 
narrated by Bostonians in the know.

The 78-minute tour is available on MP3 for $12.95 and CD for $19.95 and 
includes a map:AudisseyGuides.com <http://www.AudisseyGuides.com>.
