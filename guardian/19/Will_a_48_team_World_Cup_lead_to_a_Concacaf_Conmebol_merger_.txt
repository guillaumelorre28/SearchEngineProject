When Fifa decided to expand the 2026 World Cup to 48 teams in a 16-group 
tournament on Tuesday, the worry from many soccer associations was not theWorld 
Cup <https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football> itself – but, 
rather, how they’d get there.

With 211 nations going for 48 spots, how can Fifa implement a qualifying 
system that will distribute a fair number of places for one confederation body 
without alienating another? More, in this case, may not necessarily mean 
better: an increase in berth allocation will also start a bidding war among 
continents.

It’s a monumental task that will forever change the nature of the World Cup 
qualifying process – and when it comes to the Americas and its 45 members, the 
stakes could not be higher.

South America currently has four-and-a-half World Cup places 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/08/fa-powerless-world-cup-expansion-fifa>
, while Concacaf, which represents North and Central America as well as the 
Caribbean, has only three-and-a-half from 35 members. Europe’s Uefa currently 
has 13 places for 55 teams, plus the additional spot for Russia, who will host 
2018’s tournament.

As a result of Tuesday’s decision and the increase in teams, it is estimated 
that Concacaf and Conmebol would receive six and six-and-a-half places for 
2026, but the official decision will not be made until May.

There is, however, another possibility.

“There is a proposal from Gianni Infantino to merge the Conmebol and Concacaf 
qualifiers,” said Laureano Gonzalez, president of the Venezuelan Football 
Association, talking tosports daily Meridiano last week 
<http://www.meridiano.com.ve/futbol/la-vinotinto/144219/gonzalez---infantino-propone-una-eliminatoria-de-conmebol-concacaf-en-2026-.html>
. “This can work if they gave us more places. Right now, between the two 
confederations we have seven, plus two half places,” said Gonzalez, who is also 
Conmebol’s vice-president. “If this went up to 14, similar to what Europe has 
for more or less the same number of teams, the idea would catch on the 
continent.”

Late on Tuesday evening, Victor Montagliani, Concacaf president and Fifa’s 
vice president contradicted Gonzalez’s statement by declaring the merger might 
not be a realistic solution. “Conmebol and Concacaf will maintain separate 
qualifiers,” he toldSpanish-speaking radio Futbol de Primera. 
<http://fdpradio.com/montagliani-no-habra-eliminatoria-conjunta-concacaf-conmebol/>
 “Conmebol is Conmebol and Concacaf is Concacaf. We have other events that will 
allow for both confederations to come together but it won’t be for the 
qualifiers.”

Montagliani appeared confident but his responsibilities lie solely within 
Concacaf and not with South America, therefore the possibility of a merger 
could still be a real option if Conmebol believes it can benefit their members.

There is a strong possibility that the 2026 World Cup will be hosted in North 
America: Concacaf nations are preparing to launch a two-nation bid out of 
Mexico,Canada <https://www.theguardian.com/football/canada> and the United 
States. The idea to merge Conmebol and Concacaf could be supported by the 
notion that in 2026, Fifa would want to have as many members from those two 
confederations in the tournament as possible.

So what are the advantages and disadvantages of a merger? Who benefits and who 
suffers? First, we need to assume that Conmebol and Concacaf will combine for 
14 berths, and if this is the case then South American nations have an 
overwhelming advantage.

If we look at the top teams from each body, and use last year’s Copa America 
Centenario as a barometer, we can see the major difference in quality. 
Argentina, Colombia and champions Chile clearly showed the gap between them and 
their Concacaf counterparts, USA, Mexico and Costa Rica. USA were embarrassed 
by Messi andArgentina <https://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina> in the 
semi-finals and lost 4-0, while Chile demolished Mexico 7-0 in their 
quarter-final match. Brazil and Uruguay, meanwhile, who did not enter last 
summer’s tournament with their strongest squads and were knocked out early, are 
currently first and second for Russia qualifiers.

Do South American World Cup qualifiers put the Champions League to shame?

In addition, South American teams at the lower end of the spectrum such as 
Peru,Venezuela <https://www.theguardian.com/football/venezuela> and Bolivia 
have much more international experience than nations like Guatemala, El 
Salvador and Haiti. These countries could find an easier path to the World Cup.

Aesthetically, we would also lose something. South American matches have 
always beenthe most exciting qualifiers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/06/south-american-world-cup-qualifiers-lionel-messi-neymar>
, a perfect mix between skill and passion. From Peru’s tumultuous relationship 
with Chile in the Pacific classic, to one of the most exciting rivalries in 
world soccer when Brazil faces Argentina, Conmebol has always given fans an 
entertaining show. A merger would banish all of that.

But the quality of South America’s teams are exactly why Concacaf might see 
the merge as a pro. By combining with Conmebol, Central American and Caribbean 
nations can improve and develop the quality of their game by playing against 
tougher opposition. It may take longer to raise standards, but at least the 
quality of competition within the qualifiers will improve.

Using European countries like Iceland and Albania as an example and their 
performances at the European Championship, raising the level of competition as 
well as a busier calendar (teams like Bahamas and the US Virgin Islands haven’t 
played a competitive match since March 2015) can help certain teams become a 
stronger squad.

Bigger countries like Mexico <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mexico> and 
the United States could benefit from regular matches against South American 
teams who can help them prepare them better for the bigger stage. In 2006, 
Australia left Oceania and joined the Asian Football Confederation for better 
competition. They soon became a top four member alongside Japan, South Korea 
and Iran. All qualified to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

Additionally, the popularity of World Cup qualifiers in the US could also 
increase, thanks to new and attractive opposition in American territory. There 
is something rather appealing about Gabriel Jesus playing in Columbus on a cold 
night in November.

The argument for or against the merger depends on its structure and how the 
berths will be allocated, but until then, not much can be done. Will 
Conmebol-Concacaf be divided into mini-groups, or will it be one giant table? 
Will some skip the first round, and will we have a playoff system? How will 
Caribbean teams or weaker South American nations take advantage of the format?

Only time will tell, but one thing is for certain. The merge will 
revolutionize the competitive nature in the Americas. For better or worse.
