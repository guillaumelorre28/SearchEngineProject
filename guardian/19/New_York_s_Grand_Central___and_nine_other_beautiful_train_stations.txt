This week it was announced that relief may finally come to long-suffering New 
York rail commuters, with the news that the lease for Madison Square Garden, 
which since 1968 has crushed Pennsylvania Station underfoot, has been renewed 
only for 10 years. The city council now has the chance to right the calamitous 
wrong that was perpetrated by the destruction of the old Penn Station, by 
coming up with plans to replace the Garden with a new structure. 

Our earlier post on the ugliness of New Penn,  
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2013/jul/25/new-york-penn-station-ugly-train-world>
and other stations around the world, brought calls for a more positive outlook 
on railway stations. Here, then, is a celebration of 10 of the world's finest.

Grand Central Terminal, New York

In the late 1960s, the finest railway station in America nearly suffered the 
same fate as the old Penn Station, when developers attempted to replace the 
Beaux-Arts terminal with an office building. But Grand Central, thanks in large 
part to a campaign by Jackie Kennedy, survived – and is looking better than 
ever in this its 100th anniversary year. With its Tiffany clock on the south 
facade and its spiffed-up zodiac mural in the central concourse, it's a tourist 
destination in its own right and one of the rare stations worth lingering in 
for a meal or a drink. The oldest establishment in the station is the Grand 
Central Oyster Bar, on the lower level; the bivalves there are all right, yes, 
but the martinis upstairs at the Campbell Apartment bar are even finer. 
One knock against Grand Central: the incongruous, disruptive Apple Store that 
has taken up residence on the eastern staircase.

Arriving at Union Station transports you back to Chicago in the 1920s, when 
the Second City was building some of the most architecturally ambitious 
projects anywhere in the world. Now the third-busiest station in the country, 
Union Station is a riot of marble and glass that soars more than 100ft into the 
air. The soaring, skylit Great Hall is a fantastic place to wait for a train. 
Unfortunately, the train you'll be getting on will probably be a rundown Amtrak 
job.

Like many 19th-century railway stations in European capitals, Atocha was built 
in a wrought-iron style, with the platforms lit through
massive skylights. (Gustave Eiffel collaborated on the design.) But what
makes Atocha stand out today is something else: after a successful
modern addition in the 1990s, the old section has been converted into
a massive botanical garden, where passengers waiting for trains can
see more than 260 varieties of plants under the vaulted ceiling. There
are even turtles!

The former Victoria Terminus in the former Bombay was built in 1887 and is now 
the busiest station in India. It's certainly hectic, but the thrilling 
combination of Victorian Gothic and Mughal styles is a feat of imagination as 
much as engineering. VT, as some locals still call it, was the site of one of 
Mumbai's 2008 terror attacks. Much more happily, it was also the scene for the 
grand finale of Slumdog Millionaire. It has Unesco World Heritage Site 
designation.

Inspired partly by the Pantheon in Rome, the main railway station of the 
Flemish capital is closer to a palace than a transportation hub. It's obscenely 
extravagant – featuring 20 different kinds of marble. In fact, it's hard to 
look at all its lavishness and not be reminded of what paid for it: Belgium's 
horrific colonial enterprise. But as WG Sebald wrote in Austerlitz, a novel set 
partly at Antwerpen Centraal, "when we step into the entrance hall we are 
seized by a sense of being beyond the profane, in a cathedral consecrated 
to international traffic and trade".

Melbourne's transport hub, which until 2005 was known as Spencer Street 
Station, used to consist of some shabby concrete structures that barely 
joined up. It has now been unified under a new undulating roof that covers 
an entire city block. The roof keeps the station cool in the long Victorian 
summers, and it also allows fumes from the trains to escape through 
perforations cut in the top.

They service only a 1.8-km funicular track, but the four swooping stations 
that Zaha Hadid designed for this Austrian alpine town are the most

features the British-Iraqi architect's signature fluid forms, inspired by 
glaciers and ice formations.

Britain has no shortage of impressive railway stations, from the renovated St 
Pancras in London to the elegantly industrial York. But no British hub has the 
civic force of Newcastle's main station, with its neoclassical facade and train 
shed comprising three arched spans. It could definitely use a little scrub-up, 
and like most British stations it desperately needs a better newsstand. But 
it's still a delight to see, recalling the glories of an earlier era of rail 
travel.

Western Europeans may be more familiar with Sirkeci Terminal, the end of the 
line for the Orient Express. But Istanbul's more impressive station, a 
castle-like affair surrounded on three sides by water, is on the other side of 
the Bosphorus. Its future is uncertain, however. Damaged by fire in 2010, the 
station is currently closed. Although there had been plans for Haydarpasa to 
serve as the terminus for high-speed trains to Ankara, it may end up as a hotel 
or shopping center.

We all know the stupid excuse for fascism: at least Mussolini made the trains 
run on time. That was a myth – but Milan's monumental central station is real, 
and its problematically beautiful combination of neoclassical and Art Deco 
styles still packs a punch. The train shed is a tremendous steel structure, 
joined up to a gargantuan marble station, 200m wide with motifs scrolls and 
eagles' wings fixed into the walls.
