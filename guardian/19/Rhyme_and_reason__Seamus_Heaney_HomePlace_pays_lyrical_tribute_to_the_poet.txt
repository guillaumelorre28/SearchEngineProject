There are two pubs and a couple of shops in Bellaghy, County Derry, a small 
village in the rural heart of mid-Ulster. To many people, it is an ordinary 
place, and yet something extraordinary has just happened. A former RUC police 
station has been restored and turned into a contemporary arts and literary 
centre, with fans flying in from all directions to celebrate the life of 
Bellaghy’s local son and national hero – the late Seamus Heaney. Given the full 
blessing of the Heaney family, the first thing that strikes you as you walk into
Seamus Heaney HomePlace <http://seamusheaneyhome.com/> is a 4.5m-high, 
black-and-white photo of Heaney, along with the words from his most celebrated 
poem, Digging, which closes with:

“Between my finger and my thumb
The squat pen rests.
I’ll dig with it.”

The centre covers two floors – with a theatre at its heart. The ground floor 
is dedicated to the poet’s life and family, and photographs (donated by the 
family) are displayed with poems to match them, such as A Hazel Stick for 
Catherine Ann, his daughter, A Kite for Michael and Christopher, dedicated to 
his sons, and Mossbawn for his aunt Mary.

There are video tributes from fans, the likes of Stephen Fry and Mary 
Robinson, talking about the power of Heaney’s work, along with local 
schoolchildren talking about the influence the man has had on them. And then, 
of course, there is footage of Heaney, including a rousing rendition –from an 
RTÉ interview in 1995 
<http://www.rte.ie/archives/2015/0930/731411-seamus-heaney-on-his-nobel-prize-win/>
 – of When all the others were away at Mass, written after his mother died, and 
which was, in 2015, voted as Ireland’s best-loved poem of the last 100 years.

There is no better way to discover the “everyday” landscapes that inspired 
much of Heaney’s poetry than with Eugene Kielt, who not only runs the elegant
Laurel Villa guesthouse <http://laurel-villa.com/> (rooms from £40, guided tour 
from £12pp) in Magherafelt, just five miles from Bellaghy, but is also a Blue 
Badge Guide specialising in Heaney country. The countryside here is ordinary, 
flat and bog-filled, theSperrin Mountains 
<https://www.discovernorthernireland.com/sperrins/> to the west and Lough Neagh 
to the south east, butHeaney found beauty in the ordinary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/06/seamus-heaney-poet-blake-morrison>
.

And now Eugene helps visitors see the unremarkable surroundings through 
Heaney’s eyes, sometimes reading poems aloud from his well-leafed books, other 
times playing a reading by the man himself. Such as in the small town of 
Castledawson, where we sheltered from the rain under trees in a churchyard, 
overlooking an empty field in the grounds of the adjoining Moyola Park house. 
We were unable to enter the grounds, however, because these days it is private 
property. In Heaney’s youth, its then owner, Unionist Prime Minister James 
Chichester-Clark, had allowed footballers to play there – and it features in 
Heaney’s poem, The Old Team.

Nearby, the river Moyola runs through the town. When I hear Heaney’s voice 
narrating from A New Song I’m reminded to look up and out, to take in the alder 
trees, inhale the aroma of the mossy banks and listen to the slow-flowing 
waters pass:

“And stepping stones like black molars
Sunk in the fjord, the shifty glaze
Of the whirlpool, the Moyola
Pleasuring beneath alder trees.”

From Castledawson I go to The Wood, a farm where Heaney lived when he was a 
teenager, and where his brother Hugh still resides. A small homestead, with 
washing hanging on the line and a pristine yard, I had a chance meeting with 
Hugh, who gave us a warm welcome, taking time to talk about the loss of Seamus 
and also his skill as a poet. “I think my favourite poem is probably Keeping 
Going,” he said. “He dedicated that one to me. It’s wonderful, but it’s sad, of 
course.”

“My dear brother, you have good stamina
You stay on where it happens. Your big tractor
Pulls up at the Diamond, you wave at people,
You shout and laugh about the revs, you keep
old roads open by driving on the new ones.”

We visit the poet’s grave at St Mary’s Church in Bellaghy. In a sheltered 
corner, beside an old stone wall, with a plain headstone made of Kilkenny 
limestone mottled by raindrops, it is unassuming, modest, engraved with a few 
words: “Walk on air against your better judgement,” from his poem The Gravel 
Walks.

 Laurel Villa, Magherafelt 
Back in Laurel Villa, I am able to absorb even more Heaney perusing Eugene and 
his wife Gerardine’s well-stocked library. There are four en suite bedrooms, 
each dedicated to an Ulster poet: Kavanagh, McNiece, Longley and Heaney, 
decorated with fine linen, local art pieces, mahogany wardrobes and, of course, 
books. Breakfast is not only a delicious start to the day but also an artistic 
one, the walls bedecked with 10 limited-edition linen scrolls with a Heaney 
poem on each, created by Queen’s University Belfast after he received the Nobel 
prize for literature.

My final stop in his country is at dawn, in a misty field overlooking Lough 
Beg, a nearby nature reserve and site of Heaney’s famous The Strand at Lough 
Beg. One of his more political poems, it also captures the peace that now, 
thankfully, emanates across his homeland, where:

“Across that strand of ours the cattle graze
Up to their bellies in an early mist
And now they turn their unbewildered gaze
To where we work our way through squeaking sedge
Drowning in dew. Like a dull blade with its edge
Honed bright, Lough Beg half shines under the haze.”
