90+2 min: After some stale possession, Coutinho blurts a shot into the fans 
behind the goal from 35 yards out. I say “fans behind the goal” but a more 
accurate description would be “fans 20 rows above the goal and a fair bit to 
the right”.

90 min: Coutinho – who has been at the centre of everything for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> since springing from the bench 
– wriggles into space 30 yards out but his pass is only in the vague direction 
of Origi and out for a goal-kick. There’ll be a minimum of FOUR added minutes.

88 min: … which is headed clear. There was a Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> fan behind Milner, the 
corner taker, who seemed to becomplaining to a steward about the ball being 
outside the quadrant, which is – I suppose – optimistic.

85 min: Sturridge spanks an effort from distance yards over the bar. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have generally been restricted 
to efforts from long range this evening, while the best chances have all fallen 
to the home side. With that being the case, this isn’t too bad a result for 
Klopp’s side as it stands.

left after a Lucas slip. He looks up and finds Redmond onrushing at the back 
post but his dinked effort is headed off the line, via the underside of the bar.

70 min: Lucas blocks off Romeu to prevent another Southampton

67 min: … Rodriguez rises highest to nod clear and Redmond is away on the 
break. He glides into theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> half and neatly slips in 
Cedric inside the area. After a lung-bursting run, he opts to shoot rather than 
find Rodriguez in the middle and hits the side-netting. What a chance.

61 min: Firmino brings Forster into action for the first time in the second 
half – his shot from distance is a bobbler, though, and straight at the keeper.

56 min: Sturridge goes to ground under pressure from Van Dijk in the 
Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> area. It was an 
apologetic slouch more than a dive, to be fair, but it had an air of 
desperation about it.

53 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> are a 
real threat on the break now. Tadic and Rodriguez again have the Liverpool 
defence scrambling, though it comes to nothing. Moments later Van Dijk goes 
down the right and looks to cross but can find only Karius.

50 min: Klopp heresy! “Can someone explain how a club like Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> ends up with Lovren, Klavan, 
and Lucas on the team, much less on the field?” wonders Josh Sutherland. “Lucas 
has been a loyal club servant, but how can this lack of quality stay here? I 
recognise they went out for Matip, but still, this is poor squad management.”

another corner but is inexplicably missed by the officials.

Peep! Off we go then with the second half. No changes for either side, though 
Daniel Sturridge can expect the hook if he doesn’t improve. And an improvement 
on his first half display would be “touching the ball”.

And a plug! For charity!

In a few months I’m joining my good friend Dave (he’s a Sheffield Wednesday 
fan but if I can overlook that then so can you) on a 180-mile ride from 
Sheffield to London in aid of the mental health charity Mind. It’s a great cause
to which you can donate here if you can spare anything

Half-time emails!

Here’s Peter Oh! “Re: your observation that “The Arms of Karius” has a 
Dungeons & Dragons ring to it (16 mins.). If theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> keeper can play himself back 
into the regular number one spot, I suppose it could the dawning of the Age of 
a Karius.”

And here’s Bryan Tissinger: “Habe Senegal been eliminated yet from the Africa 
Cup of Nations? I was very worried that Liverpool would struggle without Mane 
for the next few weeks. He’s been their best, and most consistent, player all 
year.”

And here’s Niall Mullen: “Liverpool without a cutting edge: Pass pass pass 
pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass lose possession PANIC PANIC PANIC 
PANIC regain possession Pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass 
…”

44 min: Superb save from Karius! Bertrand beats two Liverpool defenders close 
to the byline then pops the ball off to Tadic. His pass across goal finds 
Redmond, eight yards out, but his effort is brilliantly turned away by the
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> goalkeeper.

Free-kick to the visitors … which is slung in far too deep by Milner. Lucas 
took a tumble in the area and the replays suggest he might have deserved a 
free-kick just outside the box.

Right, that’s it from me. Stick around on the site for all the reports and 
reaction. But for now cheerio!
 
Peep! Peep! PEEEEEEP!!! A deserved win for Saints though they’ll be kicking 
themselves that they did not take more of their chances.Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>, in a weird way, will be a 
little relieved to take just a one-goal deficit back to Anfield,

90+4 min: One last attack for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool>. Origi beats Yoshida buts 
scuffs his cross behind.
 
90+2 min: After some stale possession, Coutinho blurts a shot into the fans 
behind the goal from 35 yards out. I say “fans behind the goal” but a more 
accurate description would be “fans 20 rows above the goal and a fair bit to 
the right”.
 
90 min: Coutinho – who has been at the centre of everything for Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> since springing from the bench 
– wriggles into space 30 yards out but his pass is only in the vague direction 
of Origi and out for a goal-kick. There’ll be a minimum of FOUR added minutes.
 
88 min: … which is headed clear. There was a Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> fan behind Milner, the 
corner taker, who seemed to becomplaining to a steward about the ball being 
outside the quadrant, which is – I suppose – optimistic.
 
87 min: Coutinho and Milner combine to win Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> a late corner …
 
85 min: Sturridge spanks an effort from distance yards over the bar. Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> have generally been restricted 
to efforts from long range this evening, while the best chances have all fallen 
to the home side. With that being the case, this isn’t too bad a result for 
Klopp’s side as it stands.
 
84 min: Off the line! Another lightning break from Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> sees Long clear down the 
left after a Lucas slip. He looks up and finds Redmond onrushing at the back 
post but his dinked effort is headed off the line, via the underside of the bar.

83 min: And Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> make a 
change: Firmino is replaced by Origi.
 
82 min: And Ward-Prowse replaces Davis in midfield.
 
81 min: Rodriguez goes into the book for a cynical pull-back on Klavan. And he 
is immediately replaced by Long
 
80 min: Coutinho looks to find Firmino but Yoshida cuts out the pass.
 
78 min: Coutinho takes aim at goal from 30-odd yards but his first-time effort 
is well wide.
 
77 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> set up 
camp on the edge of their own box once more. Liverpool prod and probe without a 
huge amount of conviction.
 
75 min: Slightly bizarrely, Sturridge has a piece of paper from the bench and 
is running around showing it to his team-mates as play goes on. Eventually he 
crumples it up and tosses it away but that was an odd moment.

73 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> make 
their first substitution: off goes Clasie, who has taken a knock, on comes 
Hojbjerg.
 
71 min: Brilliant from Rodriguez, whose backheel puts Redmond behind the 
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> backline. He can’t 
find Davis with his cross, though.
 
70 min: Lucas blocks off Romeu to prevent another Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> break and is perhaps a touch 
fortunate not to join Tadic in the book.
 
68 min: It’s very open now. 
 
67 min: … Rodriguez rises highest to nod clear and Redmond is away on the 
break. He glides into theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> half and neatly slips in 
Cedric inside the area. After a lung-bursting run, he opts to shoot rather than 
find Rodriguez in the middle and hits the side-netting. What a chance.
 
66 min: Coutinho dances into the area and wins his side a corner … 
 
65 min: Tadic goes into the book after remonstrating over-zealously with 
Swarbrick over the non-award of a free-kick against Clyne.
 
63 min: Coutinho’s first contribution is to beautifully pick out Milner with a 
delightful outside-of-the-boot pass. Milner, ruining the moment somewhat, is 
offside.
 
62 min: And here is Coutinho after seven weeks out with injury. Wijnaldum, who 
has been fairly anonymous, makes way. Lallana drops deeper into theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> midfield.

61 min: Firmino brings Forster into action for the first time in the second 
half – his shot from distance is a bobbler, though, and straight at the keeper.
 
60 min: Coutinho is preparing himself for battle. By which I mean he’s putting 
his shinpads on in readiness for a substitute appearance, not running a wooden 
bayonet through a sack stuffed with hay.
 
58 min: This will surely put the kibosh on it but You Definitely Feel There 
Are More Goals In This.
 
56 min: Sturridge goes to ground under pressure from Van Dijk in the 
Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> area. It was an 
apologetic slouch more than a dive, to be fair, but it had an air of 
desperation about it.
 
55 min: Romeu is having an exceptional game but he fouls Firmino in midfield 
here.
 
53 min: Southampton <https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> are a 
real threat on the break now. Tadic and Rodriguez again have the Liverpool 
defence scrambling, though it comes to nothing. Moments later Van Dijk goes 
down the right and looks to cross but can find only Karius.
 
52 min: Tadic dons a wig and booms three or four lines from Shakespeare’s 
Henry V then tumbles theatrically to the turf. Referee Swarbrick isn’t 
interested.

50 min: Klopp heresy! “Can someone explain how a club like Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> ends up with Lovren, Klavan, 
and Lucas on the team, much less on the field?” wonders Josh Sutherland. “Lucas 
has been a loyal club servant, but how can this lack of quality stay here? I 
recognise they went out for Matip, but still, this is poor squad management.”
 
49 min: The resultant corner is a beauty, inswinging and deep, but Karius does 
just enough to get his fist to the ball and deflect away for what should be 
another corner but is inexplicably missed by the officials.

48 min: … Davis takes short to Tadic who hammers an effort at goal. Milner 
manages to flick behind with his head.
 
47 min: Lovely one-touch stuff from Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> gets Cedric scampering away 
down the right. Milner, at the second attempt, manages to bring him down. 
Dangerous free-kick this …
 
Peep! Off we go then with the second half. No changes for either side, though 
Daniel Sturridge can expect the hook if he doesn’t improve. And an improvement 
on his first half display would be “touching the ball”.
 
And a plug! For charity!

In a few months I’m joining my good friend Dave (he’s a Sheffield Wednesday 
fan but if I can overlook that then so can you) on a 180-mile ride from 
Sheffield to London in aid of the mental health charity Mind. It’s a great cause
to which you can donate here if you can spare anything

Half-time emails!

Here’s Peter Oh! “Re: your observation that “The Arms of Karius” has a 
Dungeons & Dragons ring to it (16 mins.). If theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> keeper can play himself back 
into the regular number one spot, I suppose it could the dawning of the Age of 
a Karius.”

And here’s Bryan Tissinger: “Habe Senegal been eliminated yet from the Africa 
Cup of Nations? I was very worried that Liverpool would struggle without Mane 
for the next few weeks. He’s been their best, and most consistent, player all 
year.”

And here’s Niall Mullen: “Liverpool without a cutting edge: Pass pass pass 
pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass lose possession PANIC PANIC PANIC 
PANIC regain possession Pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass pass

Peep! Half-time and a hugely satisfactory half for Southampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton>. A carbon copy after the 
break will do them nicely. Liverpool have been flat.

Sibley/Reuters  
44 min: Superb save from Karius! Bertrand beats two Liverpool defenders close 
to the byline then pops the ball off to Tadic. His pass across goal finds 
Redmond, eight yards out, but his effort is brilliantly turned away by the
Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> goalkeeper.
 
43 min: Van Dijk tidies up well as Firmino hares after a through-ball.
 
41 min: Davis plops a cross into the Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> area and Karius is out calmly 
to collect.
 
39 min: Liverpool are struggling to find a gap, or even a loose brick, in the 
red and white wall ahead of them. Firmino’s control lets him down when they do 
find a way through andSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> have a goal kick.
 
37 min: … Karius punches clear as far as Clasie, whose returned volley is on 
target but lacking the venom to trouble theLiverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> goalkeeper, who was 
comfortably back in position.
 
36 min: Bertrand and Redmond combine neatly on the left before finding 
Rodriguez, whose shot is deflected wide for aSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> corner, their first of the 
match …
 
35 min: A lull.
 
33 min: “Now Nathan Redmond knows the key to success,” writes Krishnan Patel. 
“It’s not hardwork, it’s not dedication. It’s gettingPaul Doyle to do a 
Guardian piece on you on the day before the match 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/11/nathan-redmond-southampton-liverpool-efl-semi-final>
.”
 
32 min: Tadic does well to win a free-kick off Lovren in midfield.
 
30 min: Clyne goes clutching his foot as Clasie overstretches into a tackle. 
Free-kick to the visitors … which is slung in far too deep by Milner. Lucas 
took a tumble in the area and the replays suggest he might have deserved a 
free-kick just outside the box.
