Air pollution from traffic and industry is leading to the premature death 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/16/more-people-die-from-air-pollution-than-malaria-and-hivaids-new-study-shows>
 of more than three million people a year. Globally, that’s more than malaria 
and HIV/Aids combined.

Pollutants including nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter from road traffic 
and sulphur dioxide, from the burning of fossil fuels, have beenlinked

 to suppressed lung growth in children, asthma, heart disease and the onset of 
type 2 diabetes. The exposure of pregnant women to air pollution has also been 
found to affect to foetal brain growth.

It is an avoidable and unequal health burden. In London, for example, more 
than 400 schools are located in areas thatexceed limits

 for nitrogen dioxide pollution, but four-fifths of those are in deprived areas.


Even in countries with a long history of tackling air pollution, the problem 
has not gone away. The UK, which passed its first anti-air pollutionlegislation 
<http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/4-5/52/enacted> 60 years ago today, 
is currently involved in along-running legal battle

 over its failure to cut pollution to legal levels.
