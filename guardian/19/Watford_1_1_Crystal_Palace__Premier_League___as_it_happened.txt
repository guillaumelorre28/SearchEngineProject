Full-time: Watford 1-1 Crystal Palace

Palace will take that point on the balance of play. But it could have been a 
different story had Benteke scored that penalty to put Palace 2-0 up in the 
first half.

Apparently Watford’s mascot, Harry the Hornet, simulated a dive in front of 
Zaha after the final whistle, as the Palace man went over to applaud the 
travelling fans. Pathetic and hilarious in equal measure.

Clattenberg isn’t the most popular man at Vicarage Road, but he had a 
fantastic game. Got all the big decisions right.

Current mood:

90+3 min: Mutch goes down under the challenge of Kaboul. Again Clattenberg 
waves the play on. Big Sam smiles wryly. It will be interesting to hear his 
take on the referees’ performance in his post-match interview.

87 min: Palace break in numbers, Zaha this time on the right, running at 
Britos. Just as he is entering Watford’s penalty area, Zaha hits the deck but 
Clattenburg awards a free kick toWatford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford>, and a yellow card to Zaha for 
diving. Replays show it is another excellent decision by Clattenberg. Needless 
to say, Allardyce isn’t best pleased, clearly mouthing two words that begin 
with an F and a W.

Bit of trivia for you: if you’ve ever wondered why Clattenberg wears a 
long-sleeved shirt, it is because thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> force him to, on account 
of his tattoos. He also has a Porsche and a BMW, one of which has the license 
plate “C19TTS”. True story.

82 min: Deeney gets a blow in the back of the head from Mutch, requiring 
treatment. That’s a welcome break for Palace, who have been struggling to keep 
pace with Watford’s tempo. And breathe.

Palace sub - Flamini off, Campbell on.

80 min: The ball is in the air for appoximately 93% of all play. This is an 
ugly game, that is going to be won and lost by a header.

Never has this quote from Palace’s co-chairman Steve Parish 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/22/crystal-palace-alan-pardew-sacked>
 (made after sacking Pardew and before Allardyce’s appointment) felt more 
appropriate:


We all bought into the decision to play a more expansive style of football. We 
all believed in it. That hasn’t worked. It’s no-one’s fault. But now we’re 
going to wind the dial back the other way.

78 min: Palace win a free-kick, and lump it into the box, Gomes clattering

76 min: There’s only one winner here at present: the home side. Delaney gets 
two conflicting calls from his team-mates under a high ball, and heads the ball 
out for a corner, needlessly. But it’s well defended by Benteke again at that 
near post. He’s known for his goals scored, but I wonder how many goals he 
prevents defensively.

74 min: Watford’s fans have had a huge effect on their team. Every tackle is 
being cheered, and Palace’s defenders look extremely shaky in clearing the 
ball, with Deeney and Ighalo breathing down their necks and Vicarage Road 
screaming in their ears.

Palace make a change: Townsend off, Mutch on, his first appearance for Palace 
since August.

Penalty to Watford! Delaney is penalised for dragging back Prodl!

He’s taken his fair share of stick this game, but that is a magnificent 
decision from Clattenburg. Spotted a clear foul in a crowd of players, as the 
corner was whipped in.

70 min: Zuniga tricks his way past Kelly, and wins a corner. I’ll shut up.
Jeff Ives (@jeffreydives) 
@michaelbutler18 <https://twitter.com/michaelbutler18> Zuniga is best known 
for kneeing Neymar in the back and knocking him our of the 2014 World Cup. I 
would say no.

68 min: Is Zuniga actually any good? Can’t say I’ve seen a lot of him, but as 
he skies a shot a good 20 yards over the bar, I’d been inclined to say: no.

60 min: Palace are struggling with the physicality of Deeney and Ighalo, under 
the high ball. Deeney forces Dann to concede a corner, from which Benteke 
misses his clearance at the near post, with the ball fizzing across Palace’s 
six-yard box. It could have gone anywhere, but luckily for Palace, it falls to 
Zuniga who is unable to turn the ball back into the danger zone.

58 min: Watford go route one, and it nearly works! Gomes launches a huge kick 
upfield, Dann misjudges the bounce, and just for a moment it looks as though 
Ighalo sneaks in to fire past Hennessey, but the Nigerian is forced wide and in 
the end his shot is off target.

55 min: A lull in play. Did anybody get any nice football-related presents? I 
asked for some boots, but got a 2017 diary instead. It does have a ‘Graph’ 
section at the back, should I want to accurately sketch an X-Y axis, so swings 
and roundabouts.

53 min: Holebas is given a yellow card for a late challenge on Puncheon. 
Deserves. I’ve just noticed that the Greek defender has ‘J.C HOLEBAS’ on the 
back of his shirt today. Does anybody know why? Perhaps a tribute to Jesus 
Christ?

51 min: Palace embark on another counter-attack, and Zaha finds himself in 
acres of space, with just Kaboul to beat. Zaha feints and dances, but just when 
you think he’s going to pull the trigger, he delays once more, passes square to 
Townsend and the momentum is taken out of the move. Zaha’s decision making is 
perhaps the reason why he is yet to be regarded as a top-level player. Zaha is 
at his best when he doesn’t have time to think, and makes instinctive decisions.

49 min: Guedioura does well down Watford’s left, wriggling clear of Dann and 
is brought down on the byline. The ball is hung right under Palace’s crossbar, 
but Hennessey does extremely well to claim the ball under pressure from Prodl.

48 min: “Clattenberg scores well with football organizations because he 
favours the big clubs over the small clubs every time,” emails Ray Ward. “He is 
their thumb on the scale, ensuring the big names succeed.”

Which one is the big/small club here? I genuinely can’t say which of Palace or 
Watford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> is the bigger club.

46 min: Good start from Watford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford>
. Nothing more than a few hopeful crosses and long-throws into the box, but 
Palace are struggling to clear their lines. You would back Deeney or Ighalo to 
make one of those centres count as the half goes on.

45+4 min: Deeney holds the ball up well with his back to goal, and slips in 
Ighalo round the corner, but Ward just gets a toe to the ball before the 
Nigerian. Free-kick to Palace inside their own six-yard box. This time, 
Watford’s fans tell Clattenburg where to go.

45+2 min: Zaha stretches his legs for the first time in forever, tempting 
Kaboul with an ill-timed challenge. Puncheon has an opportunity to whip the 
ball into Watford’s box, with Dann and Delaney both up from the back … straight 
into the hands of Gomes.

Palace will take that point on the balance of play. But it could have been a 
different story had Benteke scored that penalty to put Palace 2-0 up in the 
first half.

Apparently Watford’s mascot, Harry the Hornet, simulated a dive in front of 
Zaha after the final whistle, as the Palace man went over to applaud the 
travelling fans. Pathetic and hilarious in equal measure.

Clattenberg isn’t the most popular man at Vicarage Road, but he had a 
fantastic game. Got all the big decisions right.

90+3 min: Mutch goes down under the challenge of Kaboul. Again Clattenberg 
waves the play on. Big Sam smiles wryly. It will be interesting to hear his 
take on the referees’ performance in his post-match interview.
 
90+1 min: Britos is booked for a foul of Benteke, he will now miss Watford’s 
next match against Tottenham on New Year’s Day through suspension.
 
90 min: Guedioura hits a effor the volley, but Hennessey is down low to save 
to his right. Four minutes added on for injury-time.
 
87 min: Palace break in numbers, Zaha this time on the right, running at 
Britos. Just as he is entering Watford’s penalty area, Zaha hits the deck but 
Clattenburg awards a free kick toWatford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford>, and a yellow card to Zaha for 
diving. Replays show it is another excellent decision by Clattenberg. Needless 
to say, Allardyce isn’t best pleased, clearly mouthing two words that begin 
with an F and a W.

Bit of trivia for you: if you’ve ever wondered why Clattenberg wears a 
long-sleeved shirt, it is because thePremier League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> force him to, on account 
of his tattoos. He also has a Porsche and a BMW, one of which has the license 
plate “C19TTS”. True story.

84 min: Watford make their final change: Zuniga off (who himself came off the 
bench in the third minute), Sinclair on.Watford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> look like they are playing three 
up top now: Deeney, Ighalo and Sinclair.

82 min: Deeney gets a blow in the back of the head from Mutch, requiring 
treatment. That’s a welcome break for Palace, who have been struggling to keep 
pace with Watford’s tempo. And breathe.

Palace sub - Flamini off, Campbell on.
 
80 min: The ball is in the air for appoximately 93% of all play. This is an 
ugly game, that is going to be won and lost by a header.

Never has this quote from Palace’s co-chairman Steve Parish 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/22/crystal-palace-alan-pardew-sacked>
 (made after sacking Pardew and before Allardyce’s appointment) felt more 
appropriate:


We all bought into the decision to play a more expansive style of football. We 
all believed in it. That hasn’t worked. It’s no-one’s fault. But now we’re 
going to wind the dial back the other way.
 
78 min: Palace win a free-kick, and lump it into the box, Gomes clattering 
into his own man, Prodl, as he catches the ball.
 
76 min: There’s only one winner here at present: the home side. Delaney gets 
two conflicting calls from his team-mates under a high ball, and heads the ball 
out for a corner, needlessly. But it’s well defended by Benteke again at that 
near post. He’s known for his goals scored, but I wonder how many goals he 
prevents defensively.
 
74 min: Watford’s fans have had a huge effect on their team. Every tackle is 
being cheered, and Palace’s defenders look extremely shaky in clearing the 
ball, with Deeney and Ighalo breathing down their necks and Vicarage Road 
screaming in their ears.

Palace make a change: Townsend off, Mutch on, his first appearance for Palace 
since August.
 
Watford’s captain smashes it down the middle. His 100th goal for Watford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford>, his first since early October.

He’s taken his fair share of stick this game, but that is a magnificent 
decision from Clattenburg. Spotted a clear foul in a crowd of players, as the 
corner was whipped in.
 
70 min: Zuniga tricks his way past Kelly, and wins a corner. I’ll shut up.
Jeff Ives (@jeffreydives) 
@michaelbutler18 <https://twitter.com/michaelbutler18> Zuniga is best known 
for kneeing Neymar in the back and knocking him our of the 2014 World Cup. I 
would say no.
 <https://twitter.com/jeffreydives/status/813384736517275648> December 26, 2016
 <https://twitter.com/jeffreydives/status/813384736517275648>  
68 min: Is Zuniga actually any good? Can’t say I’ve seen a lot of him, but as 
he skies a shot a good 20 yards over the bar, I’d been inclined to say: no.
 
64 min: “Where is Mike Dean on that illustrious list of the world’s top 
referees?” asks Sean Revill. “Surely some mistake...”
 
62 min: This is very quickly descending into an ugly, scrappy game, which is 
just how Big Sam likes it.
 
60 min: Palace are struggling with the physicality of Deeney and Ighalo, under 
the high ball. Deeney forces Dann to concede a corner, from which Benteke 
misses his clearance at the near post, with the ball fizzing across Palace’s 
six-yard box. It could have gone anywhere, but luckily for Palace, it falls to 
Zuniga who is unable to turn the ball back into the danger zone.

58 min: Watford go route one, and it nearly works! Gomes launches a huge kick 
upfield, Dann misjudges the bounce, and just for a moment it looks as though 
Ighalo sneaks in to fire past Hennessey, but the Nigerian is forced wide and in 
the end his shot is off target.
 
55 min: A lull in play. Did anybody get any nice football-related presents? I 
asked for some boots, but got a 2017 diary instead. It does have a ‘Graph’ 
section at the back, should I want to accurately sketch an X-Y axis, so swings 
and roundabouts.
 
53 min: Holebas is given a yellow card for a late challenge on Puncheon. 
Deserves. I’ve just noticed that the Greek defender has ‘J.C HOLEBAS’ on the 
back of his shirt today. Does anybody know why? Perhaps a tribute to Jesus 
Christ?

michael.butler@theguardian.com <mailto:michael.butler@theguardian.com> or 
@michaelbutler18 <https://twitter.com/michaelbutler18>, if you’ve any answers. 
 
51 min: Palace embark on another counter-attack, and Zaha finds himself in 
acres of space, with just Kaboul to beat. Zaha feints and dances, but just when 
you think he’s going to pull the trigger, he delays once more, passes square to 
Townsend and the momentum is taken out of the move. Zaha’s decision making is 
perhaps the reason why he is yet to be regarded as a top-level player. Zaha is 
at his best when he doesn’t have time to think, and makes instinctive decisions.
 
49 min: Guedioura does well down Watford’s left, wriggling clear of Dann and 
is brought down on the byline. The ball is hung right under Palace’s crossbar, 
but Hennessey does extremely well to claim the ball under pressure from Prodl.
 
48 min: “Clattenberg scores well with football organizations because he 
favours the big clubs over the small clubs every time,” emails Ray Ward. “He is 
their thumb on the scale, ensuring the big names succeed.”

Which one is the big/small club here? I genuinely can’t say which of Palace or 
Watford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> is the bigger club.
 
46 min: Good start from Watford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford>
. Nothing more than a few hopeful crosses and long-throws into the box, but 
Palace are struggling to clear their lines. You would back Deeney or Ighalo to 
make one of those centres count as the half goes on.
 
Peeeeeeeeep! And we’re underway again.
 
Something to warm the hearts of Palace fans: Mark Clattenburg has just won the 
World’s Best Referee Award for 2016 (by some distance), as voted for by The 
International Federation of Football History & Statistics. He took charge of 
the FA Cup final, the Champions League final and the Euro 2016 final this year.

45+4 min: Deeney holds the ball up well with his back to goal, and slips in 
Ighalo round the corner, but Ward just gets a toe to the ball before the 
Nigerian. Free-kick to Palace inside their own six-yard box. This time, 
Watford’s fans tell Clattenburg where to go.
 
45+2 min: Zaha stretches his legs for the first time in forever, tempting 
Kaboul with an ill-timed challenge. Puncheon has an opportunity to whip the 
ball into Watford’s box, with Dann and Delaney both up from the back … straight 
into the hands of Gomes.
 
45 min: Five minutes added on here, owing to the injuries sustained by Behrami 
and Janmaat at the beginning of this half.
