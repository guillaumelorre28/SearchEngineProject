The euro has fallen to a 20-month low against the dollar and investors fled 
riskier assets after Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said he would resign 
on Monday following a crushing defeat on constitutional reform.

Renzi’s defeat threatens to undermine efforts to stabilise the country’s shaky 
banking system and deals a wider body blow to theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, which is already reeling under 
anti-establishment anger in the wake of June’s Brexit vote.

 The single currency, which opened at around $1.0685, slumped as much as 1.4% 
to $1.0505, its lowest since March 2015, before recovering a bit to $1.0539.

The drop to its session low was the sharpest since June and could pave the way 
for further falls when European trading gets under way later on Monday.

Analysts at RBC Capital Markets in Sydney argued that, based on what happened 
in 2012 at the height of the Greek crisis, the risk of a eurozone crisis could 
see the euro trade as low as $0.8000.

“It may sound extreme, but if a second euro zone crisis were to hit, with the 
US dollar at a much stronger starting point, the euro could arguably trade 
lower still,” they wrote.

“It’s not very hard to see a new election, and it’s not very hard to see the 
[opposition] 5-Star Movement taking power and they’ve basically said they want 
to get out of either the European Union or the euro or both,” said Mark Wills, 
head of State Street Global Advisors’ investment solutions group for the Asia 
Pacific.


Against the pound, the common currency slipped 0.76% with one euro buying 83p.


The euro slid as much as 2.1% to 118.71 yen, but pared some of the losses to 
trade down 1.2% at 119.73 yen.

Some observers focused on the more immediate impact of the result on efforts 
to contain the growing crisis in the country’s banking system, especially the 
debt-ridden Monte dei Paschi bank, amid an expected spike in Italian borrowing 
costs.

“The ‘no’ vote was priced in to a certain extent in advance. So I do not 
expect a freefall in the euro in the near term,” said Minori Uchida, chief 
currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in Tokyo.

“In the long run, this will delay progress in Italy’s efforts to get rid of 
banks’ bad debt and is likely to widen the yield spread of German and Italian 
bonds,” he added, a development which would make it much more expensive for 
Italian banks to raise much-needed capital.

European shares are likely to be sold off along with Italian bonds when 
trading opens in Europe on Monday. Futures trading indicated that the FTSE100 
would fall around 0.6% and the Dow Jones average would dip about 0.2% on the 
open in New York.

Stock markets <https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets> in Asia 
dipped following news of the referendum result. Japan’s Nikkei slid 0.7% and 
the Sydney markey slumped 0.65%. Korea was down 0.21% and the Hang Seng was off 
0.36%.

 Renzi’s resignation represents a fresh blow to the European Union, which is 
struggling to overcome a raft of crises, and was eager for Renzi to continue 
his reform push in the euro zone’s heavily indebted third-largest economy.

 Analysts at RBC Capital Markets in Sydney argued that, based on what happened 
in 2012 at the height of the Greek crisis, the risk of a eurozone crisis could 
see the euro trade as low as $0.8000.

 “It may sound extreme, but if a second euro zone crisis were to hit, with the 
US dollar at a much stronger starting point, the euro could arguably trade 
lower still,” they wrote.

 Markets had earlier taken some encouragement when Austria’s far-right 
presidential candidate was soundly defeated by a pro-European contender, 
confounding forecasts of a tight election.

The European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> meets on Thursday 
amid much speculation it will announce a six-month extension of its asset 
buying program and widen the type of bonds it can purchase.

 “There has been some speculation that the ECB would step and front load 
purchases of Italian bonds if markets became unsettled by a No result, so 
perhaps it is the thoughts of a central bank liquidity sugar pill driving 
things again,” said ANZ economist Jo Masters.
