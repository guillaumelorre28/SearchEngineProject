Inexpensive, thirst-quenching and very old-fashioned: keep a jug in the fridge 
as a pick-me-up for when you can’t face yet another boozy Christmas drink. Keep 
the cooked barley and use as pearly ballast in savoury wintry salads. And use 
lemon instead of orange, if you prefer. Serves four.

2 oranges, washed, zested and juiced 
65g pearl barley
1.5 litres cold water
1cm piece ginger, peeled and sliced
2-3 tbsp caster sugar, to taste

Put the zest in a pan with the barley, water and ginger. Bring to a boil, 
skim, then turn to a simmer and cook until the barley is tender: 15-20 minutes. 
Strain into a jug, add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Add the juice, chill and 
serve in tall glasses over ice.
