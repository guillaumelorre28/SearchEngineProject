The trick, we soon saw, was not to get between a pig and its food. A pig may 
well look distracted by other things lurking in the muddy hay, but when it 
hears some feed jiggling inside a bucket, it really gains focus. If our 
family’s pig farming taster session at Smallicombe Farm was to teach us nothing 
else, it was that you stand clear and ensure a stable footing when a pink snout 
is moving your way.

In a quiet fold of a valley between Honiton in east Devon and Lyme Regis on 
the edge of Dorset, Smallicombe is run by Ian Todd, a former lawyer who some 
years ago swapped legal work for the mud of a rural idyll, and his wife Maggie. 
I’d come for a weekend farmstay with my husband Martin and our sons, Felix, 12, 
and Victor, 9, to try out its new half-day “piggy experience” (suitable for 
anyone considering a career move or just wanting to learn more about our 
curly-tailed friends).

The farm has neat self-catering units down one side of a central courtyard 
and, on the other side, adjacent to the main farmhouse, a spacious bed and 
breakfast suite – brilliantly fitted out with a separate bunkroom for children 
– where we stayed.

After a Devon breakfast cooked by Ian’s daughter, we headed to the pigsty 
where a rare British lop sow, pale and about the size of a one-man tent, was 
dozing on her side. First, Farmer Todd told us to mix pig feed with water to 
make a moist meal for those mothers still in charge of piglets. Dry food was 
then emptied into another bucket for us to tip out – the warning to move aside 
quickly was essential: a hungry pig can push over an unwary human, and plywood 
panels, or pig boards, were handed out to protect our knees from a barge-by. 
Pretty soon we were all smiling and swinging buckets and sty gates as if born 
to the life. A litter of piglets had been kept aside for us to see and the best 
moment was when all seven leapt up to a fence together on their hind legs to 
watch us approach.

 Smallicombe Farm is home to several breeds of pig. 
The lop, we learned, is Britain’s rarest breed. The nine breeding sows, three 
boars and three fattening pigs kept at Smallicombe are part of a population of 
only 300 or 400 in the country. The other adult pigs on the farm are mostly 
Berkshires, although there is a saddleback too, with its distinctive patches. 
Smallicombe pigs have won prizes at county shows: height of trotter heel 
matters, apparently, as do strong haunches, which indicate a sow will be a good 
breeder.

As a finale before lunch, we had to demonstrate what we had learned about the 
porcine mind and move two pigs, unaided, from a swampy pen at the top of a 
field down into a covered sty. It was a comedy set-up and my family duly 
delivered. By the end we were running around like swineherds on scrumpy. I 
would say we were sweating like pigs, but apparently pigs don’t sweat, despite 
their reputation. They are very good, however, at finding gaps in fences. As my 
elder son tried to block an escape route, one porker jumped a foot in the air 
to get over the other. “So pigs can fly, given half a chance,” he said.

 Self-catering cottages at Smallicombe Farm. 
Even if you’re not here to learn about pigs, the farm is a lovely place to 
stay – it also has hens, 12 head of beguiling ruby Devon cattle and during our 
visit were busily lambing 50 Dorset Down ewes. There’s a small playground for 
younger children and the large trampoline set into a lawn captivated my sons 
while I read a book and gazed at the gentle roll of the hills. It’s a good base 
for exploring the area, too. We ate inHugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s River 
Cottage Canteen in Axminster <https://www.rivercottage.net/canteens/axminster> 
(Farmer Todd’s hand, we were told, features in HFW’s Meat Book) and went to the 
beach, taking the dramatic coastal path from Beer to Branscombe.

But when we finally drove away from Smallicombe it was the sound of the large 
sow snoring in the evenings that we took away with us. It was unnervingly human.
