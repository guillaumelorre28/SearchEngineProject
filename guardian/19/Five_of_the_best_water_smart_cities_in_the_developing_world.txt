With the majority of the world’s population now living in cities 
<https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-urbanization-prospects.html>
, solving water problems specific to metropolitan areas is crucial. Whether 
there’s too much water or not enough, whether it’s too polluted or too salty, 
these issues can be solved with thought, ingenuity, money and organisation. 
Here are some innovative ways cities are managing, protecting and conserving 
water supplies.


Bangalore, India

Protecting lakes from land grabbers

The capital of Karnataka State is the third most populous city in India and 
home tonearly 10 million people 
<http://www.citypopulation.de/php/india-karnataka.php>. In 2010, the city’s 450 
lakes were under threat of privatisation, leading to concerns that the water 
would not be used sustainably.

Water <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water> from the lakes 
percolates down into underground aquifers, which supply neighbourhood wells 
across the region. If lake levels drop, the aquifers may not refill effectively 
and people’s wells would begin to dry up.

Workshops mobilised by the Environment Support Group (ESG) were held to build 
awareness about the importance of protecting the lakes for present and future 
generations. Local people quickly decided that privatisation was a bad idea and 
began to organise against it.


The ESG took the matter to Karnataka’s high court 
<http://judgmenthck.kar.nic.in/judgments/handle/123456789/798654> and filed a 
public interest writ which resulted in theprohibition of the ongoing 
privatisation of lakes 
<http://judgmenthck.kar.nic.in/judgments/bitstream/123456789/798654/1/WP817-08-11-04-2012.PDF>
. A committee of government agencies was also set up to protect and conserve 
Bangalore’s lakes for posterity.


When the 450 remaining lakes are rehabilitated, it is expected that 
underground aquifers will be recharged. For urban communities, this will have 
significant benefits: greater quantities of quality water means that 
surrounding communities – mostly subsistence farmers – will have better crop 
growth and yields. As such, the initiativewon an UN award in 2012 
<http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/winners2012.shtml> for best water 
management practices.

Cape Town has been internationally recognised 
<https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/MediaReleases/Pages/CapeTownscoopsC40CitiesAwardatCOP21conferenceinParis.aspx>
 for its efforts in water management. Over the past 15 years the city has 
managed to reduce water use by 30%, despite a populationincrease of 30% over 
the same period <https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/stats/Documents/Population.htm>.

The city’s water conservation programme has a two-pronged approach: persuading 
people to use less water, and deploying the latest technology to use water 
efficiently.

The city has adjusted the water pressure to reduce wastage, replaced old 
pipes, improved leak detection, carried out extensive repairs and improved the 
management of water meters. In 2011, Cape Townreplaced 20,574 faulty water 
meters 
<https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/Water/WaterservicesDevPlan/Documents/WSDP_2012_2013/Topic8_WCWDM_STRATEGY_2.pdf>
 and trained 100 school caretakers in 60 schools about water conservation. It 
also persuaded 95 parks and golf courses to irrigate with treated effluent 
rather than potable water, saving millions of gallons a year. The project has 
even enabled the city to put plans for a new dam on hold.

The people of Sorocaba are working hard to clean up the city’s rivers which 
have been badly polluted by industry, mining and sewage. In a single day in 
June 2015, residents removed 228kg of rubbish from the Sorocaba river. City 
workers regularly remove 10 tonnes of dirt, leaves, branches, rubbish and 
recyclables in a month. Attempts are also being made to change the riverside 
into a place of beauty rather than a place to tip rubbish. Linear parks are 
being created along the river banks to provide space for leisure and recreation 
when the river is flowing normally, and to hold the extra water in times of 
high flows. Trees are also being planted to provide a habitat for wildlife.

Mozambique’s second-largest city, Beira, is a port town on the Pungue River, 
at the spot where the river meets the Indian Ocean. With help from the Dutch, 
including the NGOAlterra 
<http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Research-Institutes/alterra.htm>
, the city has createdBeira 2035 
<http://www.rvo.nl/subsidies-regelingen/projecten/green-infrastructure-solutions-solving-beiras-stormwater-problems>
, a master plan totackle the urgent problem of urban storm water 
<http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/project/GREENINFRA-4BEIRA-Green-infrastructure-solutions-for-solving-Beiras-stormwater-and-other-problems.htm>
 which has repeatedly caused flooding and soil erosion, and posed a threat to 
infrastructure and human health in the city.

In a smart move, Beira 2035 also takes the opportunity to plan for urban 
expansion. The city is bursting at the seams and its growing population 
urgently needs more housing, so the city is funding its flood protection by 
attracting 300 investors who are interested in developing the port area.

Money will be used to dredge the harbour, build low-cost housing, develop 
local industry, improve transport links and drainage and extend the provision 
of water services.

In 2007, Lima’s public officials wisely decided that to cope with severe water 
shortages, they needed the urban population to be tuned into those issues. The 
Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation together with theWorld Bank’s 
water and sanitation programme 
<https://www.wsp.org/featuresevents/features/lima-running-dry-%E2%80%93-promoting-water-culture-second-driest-capital-world>
 aims to promote water saving, cultivate willingness to pay proper water 
tariffs and make people more environmentally aware.

The initiative targeted 12 to 30-year-olds after a study of the age group 
showed that awareness of the problem was very low. A national writing 
competition for school children was held and the 50 best stories about water 
were published on World Water Day in 2014, in a book calledMitos y leyendas del 
agua en el Peru which translates as “Myths and legends of water in Peru”. A 
full time schools officer is now employed to help schools throughout Lima 
provide good quality education about water issues.
