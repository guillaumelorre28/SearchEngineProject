Winning tip: Cycle, camp and explore

For affordable shelter and transport, just bring a tent and a bike. There’s a 
free campsite <http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/camp/#Bicentennial> just a 
mile away from the northern (Marin county) end of Golden Gate, where a visitor 
centre offers clean washrooms. From there, cycle across the bridge and catch a
bike-rack-equipped Muni bus <https://www.sfbike.org/resources/bikes-transit/>. 
You can have the run of the whole bus system for a $31three-day bus pass 
<https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/transit/fares-passes/visitor-day-passes>; 
the bike-and-bus combo gets you anywhere in town.

For $25 you can luxuriate in Kabuki Springs’ superb Japanese spa in the 
Kinokuniya Building on the corner of Fillmore and Geary. There’s a sauna, steam 
room, series of pools and showers, salts and teas. It’s amazing how refreshed 
and recharged you feel once you’ve been there, and it gives you another reason 
to visit Japantown.

My dad moved to San Fran five years ago and I’ve visited regularly since. 
There’s so much to see, but the one place we return to time and time again is
Kate’s Kitchen, in the Haight. Kate serves up huge breakfasts at amazing 
prices. The orange spiced french toast (actually two light-as-air pancakes) is 
utterly divine, and a steal at $8.75. Add bacon to make it truly American. 
There are fab healthy options on offer too if you are slimming – but be 
prepared for killer food envy! Afterwards, walk off the food by heading to
Amoeba Records <http://www.amoeba.com/> up the road for some vinyl bargains. 
You’ll pass some of the best street art in the city on the way – and get a feel 
for the neighbourhood that Fleetwood Mac, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin made 
cool.

Airbnb and other rentals have skyrocketed in recent years and you’ll be hard 
pressed to find a room or an apartment that is cheaper than in this gorgeous 
old hotel/hostel. It’s in North Beach, just far enough from the tourist 
craziness of the wharf, but near enough so you can wander to the ocean. The 
hotel is a tumbledown place with a decor that includes plastic vines and 
doilies and the building houses an Italian restaurant that has jazz nights on 
Wednesdays. It’s noisy, rundown, and has rooms with brass beds that squeak, but 
there is nothing sterile or over-gentrified here – a relief after all the 
industrial-chic barebones places nearby.

Skip the touristy Chinatown on Grant and explore its more authentic side. Head 
up the hill to Stockton Street (between Sacramento and Jackson Streets) for a 
chaotic assault on your senses. This is where the Chinese grannies come to buy 
all kinds of unrecognisable goods. If you go on a Saturday or Sunday, you’ll 
find yourself elbowing your way through crowds, spotting buckets of snakes and 
frogs, absorbing unusual smells from traditional medicine shops and watching a 
guy on the sidewalk taking a hatchet to a live fish. For a slower pace, head 
down to Waverly Place, a small alley, to listen to the sound of mahjong tiles 
games. Make sure to look up to see the beautiful painted balconies on buildings 
that used to be the headquarters of feudingtongs (Chinese gangs).

The Tenderloin neighbourhood is one of the few places in San Francisco that 
hasn’t really changed or been affected by the tech boom so gives a better 
representation of what the city was like back in the day. Two ways of finding 
out more are by visiting theTenderloin museum <http://tenderloinmuseum.org/> 
and taking theTenderloin walking tour <http://www.tlwalkingtours.com/> ($10 
each or $15 for admission and tour). It’s led by Deleano Seymour, who lived 
here for almost 30 years. Then after that you can go to Aunt Charlie’s bar 
<http://www.auntcharlieslounge.com/> on Turk Street. It’s got the cheapest, 
strongest drinks I’ve ever had and you can drink them while watching a drag 
show in the tiny bar.

My friends and I stumbled into the Romper Room last week after checking out the
First Thursday Gallery Walk <http://sf.funcheap.com/thursday-art-walk-sf/> (an 
art walk organised by the San Francisco Art Dealers Association) and I’d 
forgotten how much I like this bar. It’s in an unassuming little spot on Maiden 
Lane, surrounded by expensive boutiques like Chanel and Diptyque, and Frank 
Lloyd Wright’s original model of the Guggenheim in NYC. The bar attracts a 
diverse after-work crowd as well as shoppers. There is great, kitschy decor and 
the upstairs Leopard Lounge offers plenty of seating and a great view of what’s 
happening below. The best part of all though is that happy hour goes until 8pm! 
(Mon-Fri). It’s $6 for drink of the day and $5 for a sparkling wine. Definitely 
a unique spot worth checking out when you need a break from the shopping 
madness of Union Square.

The 33 bus 
<http://transit.511.org/schedules/index.aspx#m1=S&m2=bus&routeid=43934&cid=SF> 
is SF’s best alternative sightseeing tour. Whether you’re after a kitsch 
souvenir at Cliff’s Variety in the Castro, communing with burritos in the 
Mission or seeking tranquillity at Golden Gate Park’s Japanese Tea Garden 
<http://japaneseteagardensf.com/> (free before 10am Mon/Wed/Fri), this bus 
provides perfect people-watching through some of the city’s most colourful 
neighbourhoods. The perpendicular ascent towards Twin Peaks is thrilling and 
saves your knees for the final climb to the top. Enjoy panoramic views of the 
city and watch out for the parrots that congregate nearby.

There’s a hidden gem to be found in San Francisco; it’s free, fun and there’s 
more to it than meets the eye.The Pirate Store <http://826valencia.org/store/> 
is a perfect diversion from trudging the streets of Fog City. If you are in 
need of a beard extension, fool’s gold or a small paddle boat, this is the 
place to visit. Go equipped with a joke and you get a special treat from the 
pirates behind the counter. Watch out you don’t get netted though. Stuffed full 
of odd things, like wooden legs and directional dice, this little store in the 
Valencia neighbourhood was set up to help fund and be the shopfront (literally) 
for a fantastic literacy project for disadvantaged 6-18 year olds – 826Valencia 
<http://826valencia.org/>, which shares the same building. There’s a small 
cinema in the corner which has a fish tank in lieu of a screen and a sign 
warning you not to speak loudly in French for fear of upsetting the fish.

I’d implore anyone not to miss a walk on the Lands End trail in the Golden 
Gate recreation area. There are multiple mini-trails down the rocky shoreline 
that take in caves, old train lines, the ruins of the 19th century-built Sutro 
Baths family swimming and amusement centre, which burned down in the 1960s, and 
a rock labyrinth. Pretty much anywhere along the journey makes for a great view 
of the Golden Gate Bridge and SF’s coastline and if you make the trip of an 
evening then getting to watch the sun set over the Pacific from the cliffs is 
magical. And parking is free.

Golden Boy Pizza on Green Street in historic Italian North Beach does slices 
for under $4 and sells pillowy focaccia bread. Craft beer is on tap. It has a 
punk rock spirit, and stickers and graffiti from travellers are posted all over 
the walls. It’s always alive at night and is fantastic in the afternoon. 
Excellent used record stores nearby.
