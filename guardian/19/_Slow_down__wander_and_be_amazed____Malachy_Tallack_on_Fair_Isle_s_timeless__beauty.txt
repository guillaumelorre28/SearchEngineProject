Geographically speaking, Fair Isle is the most remote inhabited island in the 
UK. It’s about 25 miles from the Shetland mainland, and there are many days 
when no land is visible on the horizon at all. This sense of isolation is 
amplified when the weather is bad and transport links are cancelled. The little 
seven-seater plane is vulnerable to both wind and fog, and the island can be 
cut off for days, sometimes even weeks, particularly in winter.

It is the sense of community that is most affecting about the place. Certainly 
it was for me in 2003, when I first arrived. It was that sense of a group of 
about 60 individuals who cared about each other – and about the wellbeing of 
the place they shared – that helped convince me to move there, which I did two 
years later. And it’s that sense of inclusiveness and welcome that I miss most 
now that I don’t live there any longer.

The island is small, really small. Just three miles long by one-and-a-half 
miles wide – and, from the highest point, at Ward Hill, you can see right 
across it and beyond, to a horizon of 360 degrees. The north is mostly 
moorland, blanketed in heather, with shared grazing for native Shetland sheep. 
Further south, the croft land is greener, more fertile, and the islands’ two 
dozen houses are spread out there. The cliffs are truly spectacular – if you’re 
feeling energetic, you can walk the entire coastline in a day.

Life goes on in winter. Some visitors think that Fair Isle closes down 
entirely outside the summer months. In fact, most people do the same things – 
many things – all year round. When I lived there my roles included: road 
worker, magazine editor, classroom assistant, and even relief deckhand on the 
ferry. Every job must be done by someone and, with a limited supply of labour, 
that someone could be you.

The best night out has to be New Year’s Eve. The local tradition of “guising” 
is still going strong, and nearly everyone gets involved. About half the 
islanders put on masks and fancy dress, disguising themselves as other 
islanders or celebrities, then visit every house to perform an “act” or sketch. 
The job of those watching is to guess who is behind each mask. It makes for a 
fun, and sometimes exhausting, night.

Fair Isle’s best culinary experience is one that, unfortunately, many visitors 
will miss. The local lamb is wonderful but strict rules prohibit the selling 
and sharing of home-killed meat, so the chance to eat it doesn’t come along 
often. Instead, try Shetland speciality reestit mutton. It’s an acquired taste, 
salt-cured and very strong, but it makes an excellent winter soup. In summer, 
you might be lucky enough to get local lobster or crab for dinner.

You don’t have to be interested in birds to stay at the Fair Isle Bird 
Observatory and Guesthouse <http://www.fairislebirdobs.co.uk/> – though it 
helps. It’s the largest guesthouse on the island and it’s a social hub in 
summer. The observatory was founded by George Waterston back in the 1940s, and 
it’s become a hugely important part of community life, as well as a centre for 
ornithological research. And it has a very well-stocked bar, open to guests and 
visitors, and you’ll sometimes find informative talks or local music here.

The key to a holiday here is: take your time. Because it’s such a small 
island, it’s easy to think you can see everything in a day or two. But to do so 
would be to miss the point of the place. There are things every visitor should 
see: the lighthouses, Sheep Rock, the North Haven, and perhaps a local knitter. 
But beyond that, just slow down. Don’t stride from one end of the island to the 
other. Wander, and you’ll be amazed how much there is to experience.

Take a dip in the local swimming pool, Gunglesund. It’s essentially a very 
deep rock pool, complete with weed and other marine life. While it’s certainly 
warmer than the sea, it’s not exactly cosy. Still, on sunny days you’ll find 
islanders of all ages drying themselves on its barnacle-encrusted banks. And, 
with the waves of the Atlantic crashing a few metres away, there can’t be many 
more spectacular places for a swim in the British Isles.
