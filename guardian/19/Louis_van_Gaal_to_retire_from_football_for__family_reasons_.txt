The Dutchman, 65, has been out of work since leaving Manchester United in May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/22/louis-van-gaal-its-over-manchester-united>
 – just two days after he led them to victory in the FA Cup final.

Despite initially stating that he was keen to work again after two years at 
Old Trafford, Van Gaaltold the Dutch newspaper the Telegraaf 
<http://m.telegraaf.nl/telesport/article/27445709/van-gaal-stopt+definitief> on 
Monday that “events in his family” have persuaded him not to despite the chance 
to earn a lucrative salary overseas.

“I could go there, but I’m still here,” Van Gaal said. “So much has happened 
in my family.”

Van Gaal also managed Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Holland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland> in a coaching career that began 
in 1991. He said after leaving United that he was interested in coaching again, 
but that door now seems to have closed.

The report said that last month one of his daughters lost her husband, and 
that has weighed heavily on his decision. “I thought maybe I would stop, then I 
thought it would be a sabbatical, but now I do not think I will return to 
coaching,” he said.
