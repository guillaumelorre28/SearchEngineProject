Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are to play a summer 
friendly in America against Seattle Sounders. The MLS club, who are preparing 
for their first season in the top flight, have announced the match will take 
place at Xbox Pitch, in their Qwest Field ground, on July 18.

"This will be unlike any international game ever played in the Pacific 
Northwest," said the Sounders' majority owner Joe Roth. "The atmosphere that 
afternoon will be incredible."

Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon added: "We are delighted to be opening 
our pre-season preparations in Seattle. It is a fantastic city, and we have 
great memories of our time there in the summer of 2004 â€“ which went on to be a 
great season for us. We will be bringing a full-strength squad, so it should be 
a great game."

Chelsea beat Celtic 4-2 in Seattle in 2004, going on to win the Premier League 
that season. They also lost 2-0 to the Sounders, then of the North American 
Soccer League, in 1977. Their pre-season visits to America have been more 
regular in recent years: they lost to anMLS

in 2007 to face David Beckham and the Los Angeles Galaxy, winning 1-0.
