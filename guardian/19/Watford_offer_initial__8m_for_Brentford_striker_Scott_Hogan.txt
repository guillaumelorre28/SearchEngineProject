He has identified Hogan as a solution, with the former Rochdale striker the 
Championship’s third highest goalscorer with 14 from 25 appearances.Brentford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brentford> value him at more than £12m 
but with 18 months remaining on his contract they are expected to cash in this 
month.

Watford’s offer contains up to £2m in add-ons and is likely to be matched by 
West Ham, who made an unofficial approach this week. Slaven Bilic is also keen 
to add to his firepower after the failure ofthe summer signings Simone Zaza 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/west-ham-search-striker-simone-zaza>
 and Jonathan Calleri to make an impact, while Diafra Sakho is injured.

Newcastle had also expressed an interest in signing Hogan but it is understood 
the player is interested only in a move to the Premier League. Having begun his 
career at Rochdale, Hogan dropped out of the league in 2009 and joined the 
Northern Premier League Division One North side Woodley Sports. He played for 
Halifax Town, Jamie Vardy’s former club Stocksbridge Park Steels, Ashton United 
and Hyde before rejoining Rochdale in 2013.
