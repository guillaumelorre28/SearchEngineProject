over to the composers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/23/70-years-radio-3-rethink-unleash-composers>
, 24 September) offers some interesting prescriptions for revitalising Radio 3. 
Fundamentally, though, it’s the station’s rootedly conservative ideology that 
hinders it from exciting audiences by any more imaginative means than apeing 
commercial radio stations via regular quizzes coupled with tedious 
round-the-clock “selling” of musical works as if they were brands of soap 
powder.

Truly popularising Radio 3 would require the sort of attitude-shift called for 
by Nicholas Cook in his bookMusic: A Very Short Introduction 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/20620> – undermining 
the “musical museum” mindset by foregrounding the contemporary and representing 
the music of past centuries as not trapped in dead history but continuing, 
fluid, vital.

Presentations by current composers could do this, but no one move would better 
symbolise a new beginning than moving the wonderfulHear and Now 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tnsx> programme from its graveyard slot of 
10pm on Saturday and repeating it (rather than Composer of the Week) most 
weekdays.

• The rethink of Radio 3 <https://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-3> whereby 
composers would be put in charge of the station reminded me of a rearguard 
heroically defending a lost cause.

The BBC gave us the iPlayer internet streaming catchup service and yet it is 
bounded by the rationality of yesterday. For example, it could devolve Radios 
1, 2 and 6 to its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide. Radio 4 could be retained and
Radio <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/radio> 3 reconfigured into a digital 
platform for jazz, folk, world music, classical music and opera. The BBC could 
also assist fledgling online radio stations in delivering the widest range of 
music and serving every niche and genre.

A multigenre channel could be developed, called something like BBC Music Live, 
to ensure that cultural assets such as the BBC orchestras and live music output 
were retained, and enhanced with the opportunity for new work of all kinds. A 
prime example is theProms <https://www.theguardian.com/music/proms>, which 
should be a vibrant reflection of the diversity of the UK music scene instead 
of (bar a few cosmetic changes) being locked in the past.

• Radio 3 needs all the freedom it can be offered, as it is unconcerned with 
politics, economics, fashion etc. If this unique channel were made available to 
creative people – composers, painters, writers and others in different areas of 
science – who are able to innovate and astonish with their ideas, it would over 
time come to be accepted as a leading force in our culture.

Its audience may be small at the moment, but with adept promotion it could 
grow considerably. I see it thus as a major investment in the future.

• Charlotte Higgins is so right. Far too few composers’ voices, lavish airtime 
for yet more brilliant young clarinettists, a suffocating conviction that 
“classical” music is all wonderful, and always belongs to the past – that’s 
Radio 3.

Here are two provocations to make the point. I suggest, first, that twice 
every month the Composer of the Week should be a living person; and, second, 
that every day some dissenting and quarrelsome voices should be heard (for 
instance, dismissing Beethoven as boring or Benjamin Britten as shallow).

I suspect that the staff of Radio 3 would love both of these ideas; not so 
sure about the listeners.

• If we hand over Radio 3 to the composers, perhaps there should be a discrete 
programming time for them, as there is for jazz. If we have enough notice, we 
music lovers can then switch off and turn to our CD or vinyl collections for 
the duration.

And to make matters fair, Radio 1 and Radio 2 could be obliged to broadcast at 
least an opera a week and two or so hours of Beethoven, Mozart, etc every day. 
That would make sense, wouldn’t it?

• Radio 3’s audience “too narrow”? It has me as a listener and I am keen as 
well on sciences, arts, geography, history and politics, and I belong to two 
campaigns in Brighton and Chichester against privatisation of the NHS, and with 
some successes. Too narrow?
