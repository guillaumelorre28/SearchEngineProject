Horse-riding, Turkey

The Persians named Cappadocia “the land of beautiful horses” after its wild 
mountain ponies – and the striking landscape of deep canyons and strangely 
shaped rocks is perfect for an unusual horseback adventure. Ride Worldwide has 
an eight-day group trip that crosses plateaux, canters along valley floors and 
explores remote villages. With up to six hours in the saddle each day, it’s 
best for intermediate riders and above. Riders camp each night in a tipi 
(putting them up themselves), and dine in traditional style on kilims and rugs 
in the central tent. There’s also an option of guesthouse or boutique hotel 
accommodation.

Oxford/Corbis 
The Iberian lynx once roamed over half of the Iberian peninsula. Today it’s 
the rarest cat in the world and only found in two locations: the vast, coastal 
Doñana national park south of Seville, and the rugged Andújar natural park in 
the north of Andalucia. There’s plenty of adventure to be had in both parks – 
from 4x4 safaris to guided hikes – but for a good chance to see the elusive 
lynx, The Travelling Naturalist has a seven-night, expert-led group trip to 
both parks, where visitors also learn about conservation, and might spot other 
wildlife such as mouflon wild sheep and Spanish imperial eagles.
• From £1,395pp, including flights to Seville, all meals and guided activities,

With ancient forests, high mountains and Unesco-protected villages where life 
hasn’t changed for centuries, Transylvania offers one of Europe’s last great 
wildernesses, and plenty of fascinating history and culture, too. Adventure 
doesn’t need to be fast-paced; British firm The Slow Cyclist has new group and 
independent trips for 2016, lasting from three days to three weeks. Its 
four-day Enchanted Saxon Transylvania trip covers 90 miles, from the Saxon 
village of Cund south-east to Viscri at an unhurried pace with plenty of time 
to stop at local homes, visit shepherds on hilltops and discover little-visited 
historic sites.

Estonia’s Baltic coast is wild and unspoilt. Many of its 1,500 islands, which 
were used in the 1950s for Soviet military testing, are now wildlife havens. 
Explore by kayak, paddling between islands with eerie remains of Russian 
watchtowers and abandoned farmhouses, and prolific birdlife. Adventure operator 
Reimann Retked offers several kayaking group trips, with hikes and camping on 
remote isles. Its two-day Prangli and Kolga Bay Islands tour visits four 
islands, with a stay on Prangli, still home to about 150 people. Scuba diving 
is an option on some trips.

Mountain walkers have plenty of options in Europe, with countless adventurous 
routes (Switzerland alone has over 30,000 miles of marked trails). For a less 
expensive alternative to the Alps, try Slovakia’s High Tatra, which runs along 
the border with Poland, offering dramatic walks with 20 summits of over 2,500m 
in just 26km. The soaring views of rocky peaks, lush valleys and sparkling 
lakes are reward for burning thigh muscles. To plan an independent trip,
slovak-republic.org <http://www.slovak-republic.org/hiking/> has details of 
routes and hotels. Alternatively,Utracks 
<http://www.utracks.com/utuk/index.php?section=trips&id=3763990> offers a new 
challenging guided eight-day group hut-to-hut trip: a head for heights and 
ability to walk with your own backpack for up to eight hours a day is 
recommended.

This ruggedly beautiful French island might be a favourite for stylish beach 
holidays, but with more than 50 summits of over 2,000 metres, it offers 
challenging hiking, too (the GR20 trail is one of the toughest in Europe). It’s 
also something of a canyoning and climbing mecca, and local operator Altipiani 
Corsica’s trips include a seven-day individually tailored canyoning adventure, 
abseiling and scrambling down cliffs and jumping into rivers in some of the 
more remote areas of the island. There’s a choice of camping or hotel 
accommodation.

With its mix of mountains, fjords, remote villages and quiet coastal roads, 
Norway is a strong contender for an adventurous self-drive. Go in summer when 
the days are long, pack a tent and wild camp along the way (it’s legal here, 
though there aregreat campsites and cabins <http://www.camping.no/en>, too). 
Among the most spectacular drives is from Bergen north to Trondheim which 
includes a stretch on the Atlantic Road, with eight bridges linking islands, 
and the chance to spot seals and whales. It’s about 430 miles, and winds 
through the longest road tunnel in the world and the zig-zag bends of 
Trollstigen. Fly back from Trondheim or, time-permitting, head back to Bergen 
via Sogndal.Norwegian <https://www.norwegian.com/> flies to Bergen and 
Trondhein from Gatwick. A week’s car hire withHertz <http://hertz.co.uk/> costs
