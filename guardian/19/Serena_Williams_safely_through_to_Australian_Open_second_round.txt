The six-times champion wobbled trying to close out the match, losing three 
successive games from 3-0 in the second set, before advancing.


“She’s such a great player. She was just recently in the top 10 so she’s been 
playing great,” the second seed said. “It was one of the toughest first-round 
matches I’ve played so I knew I had to come out strong.”

Williams next plays Czech Lucie Safarova on Thursday in a rematch of their 
2015 French Open final.


At 35, the 22-times major winner says she will continue to free-roll in her 
quest to catch Margaret Court’s all-time record 22 grand slam singles titles.


“Right now I have nothing to lose. Every match, every point, I’m playing for 
fun,” Williams said. “I get to travel the world and play in these great areas 
so it’s self motivating.”

Safarova earlier survived nine match points in her opener against Yanina 
Wickmayer, the Czech left-hander finally progressing 3-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-1.
