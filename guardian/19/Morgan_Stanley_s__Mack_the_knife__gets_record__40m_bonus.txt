One of the biggest bonuses ever awarded to the chief executive of a Wall 
Street investment bank has been handed to John Mack, the legendary banker who 
was parachuted intoMorgan Stanley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/morganstanley> 18 months ago. Mr Mack has 
received shares and options for his work in 2006 worth $40m (£20m).

His record pay deal, though, may soon be surpassed by his counterparts at 
rival Wall Street firms, which have also enjoyed a record-breaking year, 
boosted by an unprecedented level of mergers and acquisitions.

Morgan Stanley does not publish its results for 2006 until next week, but told 
its bankers the size of their bonuses on Thursday. Goldman Sachs, its arch 
rival, published its record results on Tuesday and has also started handing out 
its bonuses.

The previous record for a pay deal for a chief executive on Wall Street was 
held by former Goldman chief executive Henry Paulson who received $38.3m in 
2005. His successor Lloyd Blankfein could receive as much as $50m this year, 
according to reports in the US.

Unlike their star traders and bankers whose pay can be kept secret, 
regulations in the US require the pay of chief executives and their close 
associates to be disclosed. Rumours swirl about pay deals for traders outside 
the top echelons of investment banks and such speculation culminated this week 
in suggestions that Goldman trader Driss Ben-Brahim had received a £50m bonus. 
The bank denied the figure.

But Goldman has indicated its 26,000 or so employees are receiving record 
bonuses after it revealed its pay bill in 2006 reached $16.5bn, the highest 
incurred by a Wall Street firm.

The bonuses are a mixture of cash, shares and options. Mr Mack received 
461,821 shares worth $36.2m as well as 178,945 options worth around $4m. He 
joined Morgan Stanley - the investment bank where he had spent most of his 
career - in 2005 when the man who had played a part in ousting him in 2001, 
Philip Purcell, was himself pushed out.

When he was hired Mr Mack was given 500,000 of restricted stock, worth $26.2m, 
which he cannot cash in yet.

Mr Mack is often dubbed "Mack the Knife" after he cut more than 7,000 jobs at 
Credit Suisse First Boston, the bank he ran until 2004.
