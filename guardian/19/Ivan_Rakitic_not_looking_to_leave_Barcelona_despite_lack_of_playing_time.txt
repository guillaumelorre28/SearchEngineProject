The midfielder has featured in the Copa del Rey, but he has not played in the 
league for Barcelona since he was replaced against Real Madrid over a month 
ago, missing three consecutive games. On Sunday, he was left out of the squad 
thatdrew 1-1 at Villarreal

and the club’s vice-president, Jordi Mestre, did not take the opportunity to 
dismiss the stories, although he did say that the club was “delighted with 
Rakitic” and busy “negotiating his renewal.”

Rakitic has played more minutes than any other midfielder apart from Sergio 
Busquets this season, but he has not been the automatic first choice he was in 
the past. André Gomes, Denis Suárez and Rafinha have competed for his place. A 
niggling ankle injury and a dip in form, plus Luis Enrique’s experimentation in 
the right-sided midfield role, have led to suggestions that he will depart for 
City, but it is understood there is no hidden reason for his absence on Sunday. 
There is no imminent departure expected and it is not related to negotiations 
over a contract extension. His current deal expires in 2019.

The Barcelona coach, Luis Enrique, said that his absence was “nothing to do” 
with his future. “Not even 25% of reports are reliable, whether they are from 
Croatia, Spain or England,” he said.
