Summary

We’re going to pause our live coverage of the failed coup by a Turkish 
military faction, its defeat at the hands of protesters, police and loyalists, 
and the subsequent crackdown in the military and courts by victorious president
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan>.

The attempted coup

 * On Friday night a faction of the Turkish military tried and failed to stage 
a coup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/turkey-coup-attempt-president-declares-his-government-remains-in-charge>
 to overthrow Erdoğan, and tanks, helicopters and soldiers clashed with police 
and protesters in the streets of Istanbul and Ankara.

 * Erdoğan delivered an iPhone address 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jul/15/erdogan-facetime-turkey-coup-attempt>
 to the nation, calling on people to resist the coup and defend their democracy.
Thousands turned out, and the president landed in Istanbul, where he denounced 
the “treason” by the rebellious faction. 
 * Parliament was struck by at least one bomb, and graphic videos and photos 
social media showed clashes, surrenders and chaos. Helicopters fired at people 
on the ground, mobs grappled with soldiers, and tanks barreled through crowds 
or were overrun by protesters. On Saturday the defense minister said the 
control was fully in control of the government. 
 * At least 265 people were killed in the violence and at least 1,440 wounded. 
Prime minister Binali Yildirim said on Saturday that 161 “martyrs” were killed, 
including civilians and police. The general acting as chief of staff, Umit 
Dundar, said earlier in the day that 104 “coup plotters” were killed in the 
fighting.

 * Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and other world leaders condemned the coup. 
“All parties in Turkey should support the democratically-elected government of 
Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence or bloodshed,” the US president 
said. 
The aftermath 

 * Authorities arrested 2,839 army members and ordered 2,745 judges and 
prosecutors detained, as officials began to purge the ranks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/how-recep-tayyip-erdogan-inflamed-tensions-in-turkey>
 of accused conspirators. 
 * Erdoğan demanded that Obama arrest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-gunfire-ankara?page=with:block-578a7013e4b073c22786c98b#block-578a7013e4b073c22786c98b>

, from his home in Pennsylvania.Secretary of state John Kerry said the US would 
consider extradition but required evidence of the imam’s wrongdoing. 
 * Gülen rejected the conspiracy accusations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-gunfire-ankara?page=with:block-578a7484e4b073c22786c993#block-578a7484e4b073c22786c993>
 in a rare interview with the Guardian and other reporters, and suggested that 
Erdoğan could have staged the coup. He also condemned the coup attempt, saying, 
“now that Turkey is on the path to democracy, it cannot turn back.” 
 * Turkey shut down US military flights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/isis-airstrike-turkey-airspace-us-air-force>
 from a base near the southern border, which the foreign minister said was 
because conspirators had been stationed there. He promised that air strikes 
from the base would resume after anti-coup operations, but the halt has 
disrupted the campaign against jihadi militants in Syria. 
 * Yildirim said that Turkey would consider reinstating the death penalty to 
punish coup-plotters and the “black stain” they had left on the nation’s 
democracy.

 * Turkey’s four major parties denounced the attempted coup, including those 
that have vehemently opposed Erdoğan’s AKP. But fears remained that the 
pro-democracy protestsmay have emboldened Erdoğan’s increasing authoritarianism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/turkey-failed-coup-attempt-public-resistance-president-erdogan>
. 
 * Anti-coup demonstrations returned to the streets of Istanbul and Ankara, 
where police restored order and a celebratory mood reigned. Injured people 
still waited for medical care at Ankara’s biggest hospital, and peoplerecounted 
scenes of horror and death from clashes with tanks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-gunfire-ankara?page=with:block-578a7722e4b08239dbab7a38#block-578a7722e4b08239dbab7a38>
 and soldiers the night before. 
 * Two Turkish majors, a captain and five privates requested asylum in Greece 
after landing in a military helicopter. Greece’s defense ministry acknowledged 
a landing near Alexandroupolis, and said the passengers were arrested for 
illegal entry.

Defense minister: government has total control

Defense minister Fikri Isik has said forces loyal to president Recep Tayyip 
Erdoğan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan> have regained 
full control of all areas in Turkey, but warned that authorities will stay on 
high alert for any continued threat.

AP reports:

The uprising appears not to have been backed by the most senior ranks of the 
military. General Umit Dundar said the plotters were mainly officers from the 
Air Force, the military police and the armored units.

But Turkish authorities have detained General Adem Huduti, commander of the 
Second Army, and Alparslan Altan, one of the judges on Turkey’s highest court. 
There are also unconfirmed reports that General Erdal Ozturk, commander of the 
Third Army Corps, was detained, according to an unnamed official cited by 
Reuters.

Defiant Turks defended their democracy on Friday night – but not necessarily 
the man elected by that democracy, Recep TayyipErdoğan, the Guardian’s Istanbul 
correspondentConstanze Letsch reports.


“The resistance against the coup attempt last night was quite heterogenic,” 
said Erol Önderoglu, Turkey’s Reporters Without Borders representative who is 
currently on trial on terrorist propaganda charges after participating in a 
solidarity campaign with a pro-Kurdish newspaper.“The most valuable outcome of 
last night’s events is that many people who are not AKP supporters stood up for 
democratic values despite the recent crackdowns on the opposition, and despite 
the tension and the polarisation of the country.”


However, not everyone shared his optimism. “Everyone spoke out against the 
coup last night and that gave me hope,” said an academic who wished to remain 
anonymous. “But watching events unfold today this hope has shrunk quickly. Last 
night there was the possibility that the government would use this to return to 
a more unifying language, to return to the peace talks, to unite the country. 
But today it looks like they will use [the coup attempt] simply to consolidate 
power.”

The academic said that the trauma of past military interventions, and not 
sympathy for the government, drove people to oppose Friday night’s bloody coup 
attempt.

“These people do not support Erdoğan, but they oppose the idea of a military 
coup.Turkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> has a history of very 
painful, traumatic military interventions, so I was not surprised to see such 
united opposition to this attempt.”

Turkey has faced a number of military coups since the foundation of the 
republic in 1923. The military, once the most trusted institution in the 
country, has long defined itself as the guardian of the secular Turkey 
established by the country’s founder, MustafaKemal Atatürk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/kemal-ataturk>. As recently as 1997, the 
army intervened and forced Turkey’s first Islamic-led government to resign.

But since 2007, when high-ranking military staff went on trial for an alleged 
coup attempt, trust in the military has waned considerably, and the AKP has 
long been credited with pushing the army back into the barracks and 
establishing civilian rule.

“Turkey has experienced a coup once every 10 years. Each time that happened, 
the country was thrown back by around 50 years,” said Levent Gültekin, an 
opposition writer and columnist. “The deaths, the torture, the horrible scenes 
in the street – all this is still very fresh in the collective memory in 
Turkey, and this memory is easily activated by scares of yet another military 
intervention.”

Evren, who died last year at age 97, left the country with a deeply 
undemocratic constitution, which, after being implemented in 1982, restricted 
the right to freedom of assembly and expression, seriously curtailed labour 
unions and put universities under strict state control.

Gültekin underlined that this was the first time that civilian resistance 
forced the army to back down from a violent intervention. “That is of course a 
good thing. But the real question is how these crowds who professed their 
loyalty to Erdoğan, will be used,” he said.

“Some of the people we saw on the streets are people who do everything Erdoğan 
asks them to do. He has turned voters into militant followers. It would be a 
positive development if the government will use them to further democracy, but 
if they are used to further authoritarianism, it would be a catastrophe.”

For the moment, however, fears that Erdoğan will undermine what Turks have 
achieved were overwhelmed by celebration of that very achievement.

Anti-coup demonstrators, nearly all of whom draped in the red and white of the 
Turkish flag, have taken to the streets in cities around the country as their 
leaders asked them. Earlier on Saturday the president and prime minister called 
on people to return to pro-democracy demonstrations in case of a “second coup” 
attempt.

My colleague Kareem Shaheen is in the capital, Ankara, and Ghaith Abdul-Ahad 
is in Kassimpasa, president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Istanbul neighborhood.

Large crowds of several thousand people have gathered in Ankara’s central 
Kilizay Square, where Prime Minister Binali Yildirim was scheduled to make an 
appearance – but failed to show. The crowd hung around with several large 
portraits of Erdogan declaring him “Benim Baskanim” – “my president”.

In Kassimpasa, flag waving crowds of mostly religious and conservative people 
– the backbone of Erdoğan’s ruling AKP party – were whipped to a frenzy by a 
speaker telling them: “you stood for your neighbor! Recent Tayyip is our son, 
and we went into the street to defend him!”

The crowd responded with songs repeating Erdoğan’s name, kids on motorbikes 
drove by waving flags and chanting and a stocky and bearded religious student 
named Emirrat said he would not leave the celebration for anything.

“I haven’t slept for 29 hours, this a very good day for us but the struggle 
will continue.”

Elsewhere in Istanbul, crowds have swarmed onto the main thoroughfares and 
most famous streets of the city.

What we know

As night falls almost a full day after a group within the military tried to 
stage a coup, presidentRecep Tayyip Erdoğan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan> has reasserted 
control, detained thousands of people in the military and courts, and demanded 
that Barack Obama arrest or deport a political opponent.

 * On Friday night a faction of the Turkish military tried and failed to stage 
a coup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/turkey-coup-attempt-president-declares-his-government-remains-in-charge>
 to overthrow Erdoğan, and sent tanks, helicopters and soldiers clashed with 
police and protesters in the streets of Istanbul and Ankara.

 * An estimated 265 people were killed in the violence, though authorities 
have given distinct tallies. Prime minister Binali Yildirim said on Saturday 
that 161 “martyrs” were killed, including civilians and police, and that at 
least 1,440 people were wounded. The general acting as chief of staff, Umit 
Dundar, said earlier in the day that 104 “coup plotters” were killed in the 
fighting. 
 * Loyalists arrested 2,839 army members and ordered detained 2,745 judges and 
prosecutors, as Erdoğan’s government began to purge the government and military 
ranks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/how-recep-tayyip-erdogan-inflamed-tensions-in-turkey>
 of suspected dissidents. 
 * Erdoğan demanded that Barack Obama arrest

, from his home in Pennsylvania.Secretary of state John Kerry said the US would 
consider extradition but required evidence of the imam’s wrongdoing. 
 * Gülen rejected the conspiracy accusations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-gunfire-ankara?page=with:block-578a7484e4b073c22786c993#block-578a7484e4b073c22786c993>
 in a rare interview with the Guardian and other reporters, and suggested that 
Erdoğan could have staged the coup. He also condemned the coup attempt, saying, 
“Now that Turkey is on the path to democracy, it cannot turn back.” 
 * Yildirim said that Turkey would consider reinstating the death penalty to 
punish coup-plotters and the “black stain” they had left on the nation’s 
democracy. Erdoğan, in Istanbul afteran extraordinary iPhone address 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jul/15/erdogan-facetime-turkey-coup-attempt>
on Friday, vowed to “clean up” the military and government of enemies.

 * Anti-coup demonstrations returned to the streets of Istanbul and Ankara, 
where police restored order and soldiers surrendered in tense scenes around the 
cities. Injured people still waited for medical care at Ankara’s biggest 
hospital, and peoplerecounted scenes of horror and death from clashes with tanks

 and soldiers the night before. 
 * Parliament resumed sessions amid rubble from at least one explosion Friday, 
and all the major parties, including those that have vehemently opposed 
Erdoğan’s AKP, denounced the attempted coup. 
 * Two Turkish majors, a captain and five privates requested asylum in Greece 
after landing in a military helicopter. Greece’s defense ministry acknowledged 
a landing near Alexandroupolis, and said the passengers were arrested for 
illegal entry. 
 * The Pentagon lost Turkish airspace access and was forced to stop flying 
from a southern base 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/isis-airstrike-turkey-airspace-us-air-force>
, which Ankara’s foreign minister explained by saying that suspected coup 
plotters were arrested at the base. He promised that counter-terror cooperation 
would resume as normal after anti-coup operations ended. 
 * Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk and other world leaders condemned 
the coup in emphatic terms. “All parties in Turkey should support the 
democratically-elected government of Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any 
violence or bloodshed,” the US president said in a statement.

Kareem Shaheen

At Numune hospital, the largest in Ankara, hundreds of wounded people have 
been brought for treatment, my colleagueKareem Shaheen reports.

Cagri, a 29-year-old, was wounded by shrapnel when a military helicopter fired 
at loyalist security forces in his neighborhood of Kazan. “We just panicked,” 
he said.

A friend of his who was 2 miles away died in the fire from helicopter machine 
guns, he said. A taxi driver nearby grabbed him and took him to the hospital, 
where he had to lie down outside waiting to be treated because of the huge 
crowds of victims seeking help. Another friend lost his hand, Cagri said, his 
own shrapnel wounds in his chest and leg, bandaged. He added that has lost all 
feeling in his injured thigh.

Osman Konmaz, an EMT, said he treated between 350 to 400 people in the 
attack’s aftermath. He described the most heartbreaking cases he saw: one man 
who lost his leg after it was run over by a tank, and another when he saw the 
body of a man who was crushed by a tank controlled by the coup plotters.

“There was no humanity in any of this,” he said. Most of the injuries he saw 
were wounds from shrapnel or bullets. He said the incident took a grave 
psychological toll, and was even worse than the attack in Ankara last October 
by Isis that targeted a peace rally.

“This was the worst massacre I’ve ever witnessed,” he said, before alluding to 
a bombing months earlier. “At least October 10 was terror by a terrorist group, 
but this was done by our own military.”

Meanwhile people continued to gather at Kizilay Square, where prime minister 
Binali Yildirim is set to speak to the crowds.

Kareem Shaheen

People have started amassing in the streets and squares of Ankara, my colleague
Kareem Shaheenreports from Kizilay Square, which is awash in waves of red 
Turkish flags.

There’s a carnival like atmosphere and a couple thousand protesters in 
Ankara’s Kizilay square, celebrating the coup’s defeat. Under towering 
portraits of President Erdogan that declare “we own democracy.”

Protesters are chanting “the martyrs will not die, the country won’t be 
divided,” “God is great,” and praising Erdogan amid music and jubilant flag 
waving. One chant said: “There is no left or right wing, only Ankara, the last 
castle.”

Ahmet, a 23-year-old protester, said he came to the demonstrations to stand 
alongside the elected president, saying he had also joined civilians who 
marched upon the presidential palace last night against the military.

“We are here together against it, and if they try a second time, we will stay 
here,” he said

A young couple who requested anonymity said they saw their presence as a 
defence of the homeland.

“They tried to divide our country,” said the man. “This is about our homeland 
and we will die for it, and they shot at us with their helicopters and their 
jets flew over our heads.”

The couple urged greater cooperation between Turkey’s political factions, 
saying the whole country was “one heart” in the immediate aftermath of the coup 
attempt.

Gülen: Erdoğan could have staged coup

Amana Fontanella-Khan

In a rare interview with a small group of journalists at his residence in 
Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, the reclusive FethullahGülen has told my colleague 
Amana Fontanella-Khan that he rejects all accusations that he was behind 
Friday’s coup attempt.

“I don’t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President 
Erdoğan,” Gülen said. “There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup 
and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gulenists],” he 
said, a small prayer room, lined with woven rugs, decorated with Islamic 
calligraphy and leather bound religious books.

Gülen said he rejects all military interventions, and said he has personally 
suffered every time a coup has happened in Turkey in recent years. “Now that
Turkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> is on the path to democracy, 
it cannot turn back,” he said.

The last time the reclusive leader of the Gülen movement spoke live to 
international press was in 2014. Gülen rarely leaves the Golden Generation 
Worship and Retreat Center complex, where his movement offers religious 
instruction. The exiled imam is in fragile health. Before the interview he was 
attended to by a stethoscope-carrying physician who measured his blood pressure.

The sprawling compound is guarded by around the clock security. Following the 
news of the coup, Alp Aslandogan, the executive director of Alliance for Shared 
Values, and the media advisor to Gülen, said that security is on “high alert” 
following threats of violence on social media.

While Erdoğan is attempting to extradite Gülen for charges related to the coup 
Aslandogan said: “The US government position has always been that if there is 
any evidence of Mr Gulen breaking the laws, they will look into it.

“So far, the Turkish government hasn’t produced anything. Thank God, this is a 
country of laws, and we depend on that.”

Elaborating on the idea that Erdoğan may have staged a coup, Aslandogan noted 
Friday’s events did not match the pattern previous coups have followed: “The 
coup appears to be poorly planned, very poorly executed and everything seems to 
be paying into Erdogan’s hands.”

“There are many big question marks of how [this attempted coup] was executed,” 
he added.

We’re going to pause our live coverage of the failed coup by a Turkish 
military faction, its defeat at the hands of protesters, police and loyalists, 
and the subsequent crackdown in the military and courts by victorious president
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan>.

The attempted coup

 * On Friday night a faction of the Turkish military tried and failed to stage 
a coup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/turkey-coup-attempt-president-declares-his-government-remains-in-charge>
 to overthrow Erdoğan, and tanks, helicopters and soldiers clashed with police 
and protesters in the streets of Istanbul and Ankara.

 * Erdoğan delivered an iPhone address 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jul/15/erdogan-facetime-turkey-coup-attempt>
 to the nation, calling on people to resist the coup and defend their democracy.
Thousands turned out, and the president landed in Istanbul, where he denounced 
the “treason” by the rebellious faction. 
 * Parliament was struck by at least one bomb, and graphic videos and photos 
social media showed clashes, surrenders and chaos. Helicopters fired at people 
on the ground, mobs grappled with soldiers, and tanks barreled through crowds 
or were overrun by protesters. On Saturday the defense minister said the 
control was fully in control of the government. 
 * At least 265 people were killed in the violence and at least 1,440 wounded. 
Prime minister Binali Yildirim said on Saturday that 161 “martyrs” were killed, 
including civilians and police. The general acting as chief of staff, Umit 
Dundar, said earlier in the day that 104 “coup plotters” were killed in the 
fighting.

 * Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and other world leaders condemned the coup. 
“All parties in Turkey should support the democratically-elected government of 
Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence or bloodshed,” the US president 
said. 
The aftermath 

 * Authorities arrested 2,839 army members and ordered 2,745 judges and 
prosecutors detained, as officials began to purge the ranks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/how-recep-tayyip-erdogan-inflamed-tensions-in-turkey>
 of accused conspirators. 
 * Erdoğan demanded that Obama arrest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-gunfire-ankara?page=with:block-578a7013e4b073c22786c98b#block-578a7013e4b073c22786c98b>

consider extradition but required evidence of the imam’s wrongdoing.

 in a rare interview with the Guardian and other reporters, and suggested that 
Erdoğan could have staged the coup. He also condemned the coup attempt, saying, 
“now that Turkey is on the path to democracy, it cannot turn back.” 
 * Turkey shut down US military flights 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/isis-airstrike-turkey-airspace-us-air-force>
 from a base near the southern border, which the foreign minister said was 
because conspirators had been stationed there. He promised that air strikes 
from the base would resume after anti-coup operations, but the halt has 
disrupted the campaign against jihadi militants in Syria. 
 * Yildirim said that Turkey would consider reinstating the death penalty to 
punish coup-plotters and the “black stain” they had left on the nation’s 
democracy.

 * Turkey’s four major parties denounced the attempted coup, including those 
that have vehemently opposed Erdoğan’s AKP. But fears remained that the 
pro-democracy protestsmay have emboldened Erdoğan’s increasing authoritarianism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/turkey-failed-coup-attempt-public-resistance-president-erdogan>
. 
 * Anti-coup demonstrations returned to the streets of Istanbul and Ankara, 
where police restored order and a celebratory mood reigned. Injured people 
still waited for medical care at Ankara’s biggest hospital, and peoplerecounted 
scenes of horror and death from clashes with tanks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-gunfire-ankara?page=with:block-578a7722e4b08239dbab7a38#block-578a7722e4b08239dbab7a38>
 and soldiers the night before. 
 * Two Turkish majors, a captain and five privates requested asylum in Greece 
after landing in a military helicopter. Greece’s defense ministry acknowledged 
a landing near Alexandroupolis, and said the passengers were arrested for 
illegal entry.

Defense minister Fikri Isik has said forces loyal to president Recep Tayyip 
Erdoğan <https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan> have regained 
full control of all areas in Turkey, but warned that authorities will stay on 
high alert for any continued threat.

AP reports:

The uprising appears not to have been backed by the most senior ranks of the 
military. General Umit Dundar said the plotters were mainly officers from the 
Air Force, the military police and the armored units.

But Turkish authorities have detained General Adem Huduti, commander of the 
Second Army, and Alparslan Altan, one of the judges on Turkey’s highest court. 
There are also unconfirmed reports that General Erdal Ozturk, commander of the 
Third Army Corps, was detained, according to an unnamed official cited by 
Reuters.
 
What is the Gülenist movement, and why does Recep Tayyip Erdoğan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan> consider it an 
existential threat?

My colleagues in London explain, and Amana Fontanella-Khan reports from 
Fethullah Gülen’s compound in central Pennsylvania.

Defiant Turks defended their democracy on Friday night – but not necessarily 
the man elected by that democracy, Recep TayyipErdoğan, the Guardian’s Istanbul 
correspondentConstanze Letsch reports.


“The resistance against the coup attempt last night was quite heterogenic,” 
said Erol Önderoglu, Turkey’s Reporters Without Borders representative who is 
currently on trial on terrorist propaganda charges after participating in a 
solidarity campaign with a pro-Kurdish newspaper.“The most valuable outcome of 
last night’s events is that many people who are not AKP supporters stood up for 
democratic values despite the recent crackdowns on the opposition, and despite 
the tension and the polarisation of the country.”


However, not everyone shared his optimism. “Everyone spoke out against the 
coup last night and that gave me hope,” said an academic who wished to remain 
anonymous. “But watching events unfold today this hope has shrunk quickly. Last 
night there was the possibility that the government would use this to return to 
a more unifying language, to return to the peace talks, to unite the country. 
But today it looks like they will use [the coup attempt] simply to consolidate 
power.”

The academic said that the trauma of past military interventions, and not 
sympathy for the government, drove people to oppose Friday night’s bloody coup 
attempt.

“These people do not support Erdoğan, but they oppose the idea of a military 
coup.Turkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> has a history of very 
painful, traumatic military interventions, so I was not surprised to see such 
united opposition to this attempt.”

Turkey has faced a number of military coups since the foundation of the 
republic in 1923. The military, once the most trusted institution in the 
country, has long defined itself as the guardian of the secular Turkey 
established by the country’s founder, MustafaKemal Atatürk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/kemal-ataturk>. As recently as 1997, the 
army intervened and forced Turkey’s first Islamic-led government to resign.

Defiant Turks stood up for democracy – but not necessarily for Erdo​​ğan

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/turkey-failed-coup-attempt-public-resistance-president-erdogan>
But since 2007, when high-ranking military staff went on trial for an alleged 
coup attempt, trust in the military has waned considerably, and the AKP has 
long been credited with pushing the army back into the barracks and 
establishing civilian rule.

“Turkey has experienced a coup once every 10 years. Each time that happened, 
the country was thrown back by around 50 years,” said Levent Gültekin, an 
opposition writer and columnist. “The deaths, the torture, the horrible scenes 
in the street – all this is still very fresh in the collective memory in 
Turkey, and this memory is easily activated by scares of yet another military 
intervention.”

Evren, who died last year at age 97, left the country with a deeply 
undemocratic constitution, which, after being implemented in 1982, restricted 
the right to freedom of assembly and expression, seriously curtailed labour 
unions and put universities under strict state control.

Gültekin underlined that this was the first time that civilian resistance 
forced the army to back down from a violent intervention. “That is of course a 
good thing. But the real question is how these crowds who professed their 
loyalty to Erdoğan, will be used,” he said.

“Some of the people we saw on the streets are people who do everything Erdoğan 
asks them to do. He has turned voters into militant followers. It would be a 
positive development if the government will use them to further democracy, but 
if they are used to further authoritarianism, it would be a catastrophe.”

For the moment, however, fears that Erdoğan will undermine what Turks have 
achieved were overwhelmed by celebration of that very achievement.

Anti-coup demonstrators, nearly all of whom draped in the red and white of the 
Turkish flag, have taken to the streets in cities around the country as their 
leaders asked them. Earlier on Saturday the president and prime minister called 
on people to return to pro-democracy demonstrations in case of a “second coup” 
attempt.

My colleague Kareem Shaheen is in the capital, Ankara, and Ghaith Abdul-Ahad 
is in Kassimpasa, president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Istanbul neighborhood.

Large crowds of several thousand people have gathered in Ankara’s central 
Kilizay Square, where Prime Minister Binali Yildirim was scheduled to make an 
appearance – but failed to show. The crowd hung around with several large 
portraits of Erdogan declaring him “Benim Baskanim” – “my president”.

In Kassimpasa, flag waving crowds of mostly religious and conservative people 
– the backbone of Erdoğan’s ruling AKP party – were whipped to a frenzy by a 
speaker telling them: “you stood for your neighbor! Recent Tayyip is our son, 
and we went into the street to defend him!”

The crowd responded with songs repeating Erdoğan’s name, kids on motorbikes 
drove by waving flags and chanting and a stocky and bearded religious student 
named Emirrat said he would not leave the celebration for anything.

“I haven’t slept for 29 hours, this a very good day for us but the struggle 
will continue.”

Elsewhere in Istanbul, crowds have swarmed onto the main thoroughfares and 
most famous streets of the city.

At Numune hospital, the largest in Ankara, hundreds of wounded people have 
been brought for treatment, my colleagueKareem Shaheen reports.

Cagri, a 29-year-old, was wounded by shrapnel when a military helicopter fired 
at loyalist security forces in his neighborhood of Kazan. “We just panicked,” 
he said.

A friend of his who was 2 miles away died in the fire from helicopter machine 
guns, he said. A taxi driver nearby grabbed him and took him to the hospital, 
where he had to lie down outside waiting to be treated because of the huge 
crowds of victims seeking help. Another friend lost his hand, Cagri said, his 
own shrapnel wounds in his chest and leg, bandaged. He added that has lost all 
feeling in his injured thigh.

Osman Konmaz, an EMT, said he treated between 350 to 400 people in the 
attack’s aftermath. He described the most heartbreaking cases he saw: one man 
who lost his leg after it was run over by a tank, and another when he saw the 
body of a man who was crushed by a tank controlled by the coup plotters.

“There was no humanity in any of this,” he said. Most of the injuries he saw 
were wounds from shrapnel or bullets. He said the incident took a grave 
psychological toll, and was even worse than the attack in Ankara last October 
by Isis that targeted a peace rally.

“This was the worst massacre I’ve ever witnessed,” he said, before alluding to 
a bombing months earlier. “At least October 10 was terror by a terrorist group, 
but this was done by our own military.”

Meanwhile people continued to gather at Kizilay Square, where prime minister 
Binali Yildirim is set to speak to the crowds.

People have started amassing in the streets and squares of Ankara, my colleague
Kareem Shaheenreports from Kizilay Square, which is awash in waves of red 
Turkish flags.

There’s a carnival like atmosphere and a couple thousand protesters in 
Ankara’s Kizilay square, celebrating the coup’s defeat. Under towering 
portraits of President Erdogan that declare “we own democracy.”

Protesters are chanting “the martyrs will not die, the country won’t be 
divided,” “God is great,” and praising Erdogan amid music and jubilant flag 
waving. One chant said: “There is no left or right wing, only Ankara, the last 
castle.”

Ahmet, a 23-year-old protester, said he came to the demonstrations to stand 
alongside the elected president, saying he had also joined civilians who 
marched upon the presidential palace last night against the military.

“We are here together against it, and if they try a second time, we will stay 
here,” he said

A young couple who requested anonymity said they saw their presence as a 
defence of the homeland.

“They tried to divide our country,” said the man. “This is about our homeland 
and we will die for it, and they shot at us with their helicopters and their 
jets flew over our heads.”

The couple urged greater cooperation between Turkey’s political factions, 
saying the whole country was “one heart” in the immediate aftermath of the coup 
attempt.

In a rare interview with a small group of journalists at his residence in 
Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, the reclusive FethullahGülen has told my colleague 
Amana Fontanella-Khan that he rejects all accusations that he was behind 
Friday’s coup attempt.

“I don’t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President 
Erdoğan,” Gülen said. “There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup 
and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gulenists],” he 
said, a small prayer room, lined with woven rugs, decorated with Islamic 
calligraphy and leather bound religious books.

Gülen said he rejects all military interventions, and said he has personally 
suffered every time a coup has happened in Turkey in recent years. “Now that
Turkey <https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey> is on the path to democracy, 
it cannot turn back,” he said.

The last time the reclusive leader of the Gülen movement spoke live to 
international press was in 2014. Gülen rarely leaves the Golden Generation 
Worship and Retreat Center complex, where his movement offers religious 
instruction. The exiled imam is in fragile health. Before the interview he was 
attended to by a stethoscope-carrying physician who measured his blood pressure.

The sprawling compound is guarded by around the clock security. Following the 
news of the coup, Alp Aslandogan, the executive director of Alliance for Shared 
Values, and the media advisor to Gülen, said that security is on “high alert” 
following threats of violence on social media.

While Erdoğan is attempting to extradite Gülen for charges related to the coup 
Aslandogan said: “The US government position has always been that if there is 
any evidence of Mr Gulen breaking the laws, they will look into it.

“So far, the Turkish government hasn’t produced anything. Thank God, this is a 
country of laws, and we depend on that.”

Elaborating on the idea that Erdoğan may have staged a coup, Aslandogan noted 
Friday’s events did not match the pattern previous coups have followed: “The 
coup appears to be poorly planned, very poorly executed and everything seems to 
be paying into Erdogan’s hands.”

“There are many big question marks of how [this attempted coup] was executed,” 
he added.
