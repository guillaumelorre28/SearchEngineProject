Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> are 
considering appealing against Bacary Sagna’s £40,000 fine for an Instagram 
post, with the club dismayed at the severity of the tariff given to the 
defender by a Football Association independent regulatory commission.

City believe Sagna’s previous good character and the fact that he admitted the 
charge and erased the “10 against 12” comment about the referee Lee Mason, who 
had sent off Fernandinho in the2-1 win over Burnley

 on 2 January, mean the fine is too harsh.

The club also believes there are precedents which indicate the 33-year-old has 
received an excessive punishment. City do not understand whyin September 
Burnley’s Andre Gray

, who tweeted homophobic comments in 2012, was fined £25,000 – £15,000 less 
than Sagna – although the forward did also receive a four-match ban. West Ham 
United’s Andy Carroll was only warned in April after claiming the referee Jon 
Moss had tried to “even things up” by awarding a late penalty to Leicester City 
in a 2-2 draw.
