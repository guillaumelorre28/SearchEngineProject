Even though this was where Spanish pobladores founded the city, Angelenos used 
to avoid downtown; to many it meant the grind of jury duty, going to court for 
speeding tickets or avoiding the homeless people in and around Skid Row. But 
over the past decade, large-scale renovation has transformed many of the 
beautiful old banks and hotels into apartments, the enormous $2.5bn LA Live 
complex has drawn huge crowds, and with an American football stadium due to 
open in late 2016 (team to be announced), the area has firmly established 
itself with a buzzing hive of galleries, coffee shops, bars and restaurants. 
Today, the area confidently flaunts its own acronym: DTLA.

Walt Disney Concert Hall Community Park

Since Frank Gehry's <http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/frank-gehry> 
creation was revealed to the world in 2003, the wavy, dazzling stainless steel 
silver Disney Hall has become a landmark – and has appeared in plenty of 
television ads and films, includingIron Man 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/123770/iron.man>. But if you go round the 
back and look about 30ft up, you'll see the trees of the Walt Disney Concert 
Hall Community Park. A tiny elevated public park, it has a performance 
amphitheatre and the Blue Ribbon Garden, home of the blue lotus flower 
fountain, another Geary creation made from hundreds of smashed porcelain vases 
and tiles. Barely publicised, this park offers great views across downtown and 
is a peaceful place to escape from the skyscrapers.

Grand Park
 Grand Park, LA 
Just a few blocks away is the 12-acre Grand Park, another state-run public 
space that stretches four blocks and opened late last year. Carved out of the 
bureaucratic skyline, the park faces City Hall and is surrounded by the 
imposing County Courthouse and Hall of Administration, but it's cheering to see 
that the benches and seats are a gaudy pink and that there's a huge fountain 
and water spouts for kids (of all ages) to play in. Plants from all continents 
break up the concrete paths, and of course there are plenty of palm trees, a 
coffee shop, artworks, memorials and statues. You can take a free yoga class, 
and future plans include outdoor film screenings, concerts and a farmers' 
market.

Electric Dusk Drive-In
 Electric Dusk Drive-In, LA 
Come downtown on a Sunday and you'll probably see a film crew on location. 
Nearly every US car advert is shot here, with the 2nd Street Tunnel a 
particular favourite (it featured in Blade Runner). You can also experience 
that most American of automobile delights: a drive-in movie. The Electric Dusk 
Drive-In runs twice a month, and is a "rooftop experience." You drive up to the 
first floor of the building, park at the back and turn on the radio to hear the 
soundtrack. Or, to enjoy the city lights, relax on the Astroturf mats at the 
front and watch the classic or cult film that's projected big and tall on the 
side of the building.

Philippe The Original
 A French dipped sandwich at Phillipe The Original 
Located near Union Station, Philippe The Original is one of the most famous 
restaurants in LA. Originally established more than 100 years ago, Philippe's 
claims to be the inventor of the French dipped sandwich – a split beef-filled 
French loaf dipped in roasting pan juices – and is an old-fashioned, 
sawdust-on-the-floor, jar-of-boiled-eggs-in-beet-juice kind of place. You're 
just as likely to end up next to a lawyer, construction worker, cop or Dodgers 
fan at the communal tables, and the friendly counter ladies in their 1950s 
uniforms and paper hats use plastic trays: it's cash only here, and lunch is 
the busiest time.

Last Bookstore
 The Last Bookstore, LA 
As other independent and secondhand bookshops bit the dust, the Last Bookstore 
moved into bigger premises (a former bank) and then decided to buy up the 
entire second floor to showcase their thousands of books – all of them costing 
just $1 each. Downstairs, there's a more organised and pricier selection plus a 
vinyl record store, a coffee bar, event space and puffy sofas to sit on, but 
upstairs is also home to a crochet store, art installations and endless winding 
corridors and corners that are filled with ceiling-high shelves of books. It's 
a no-lose pick 'n' mix, so go exploring and "fill a box".

Mo-Chica
 Mo-Chica Peruvian restaurant, LA 
Carry your haul to one of the newest restaurants, Mo-Chica, a cantina that 
specialises in traditional Peruvian comfort food and may be the only place in 
LA to serve paiche, a huge freshwater fish found almost exclusively in the 
Amazon. Chef Ricardo Zarate spent 12 years working in London before he came to 
LA, and hislomo saltado (sautéed beef fillet with Roma tomatoes, red onions, 
ginger, garlic, soy sauce, Banyuls vinegar and chunky Kennebec fries) is 
recommended, while the cocktails – plenty of pisco and rum – are lip-smackingly 
fresh (try Tha Doggfather, which is pisco, egg white, fresh lime juice, fresh 
lemon juice, cane syrup, angostura bitter and cinnamon tincture). The lunch 
specials are great too, and come with two sides, rice and a dessert.

St Vincent Court

A journey can also be taken in St Vincent Court, an unassuming alleyway off 
7th Street in the Jewelry District. The Court is the entrance to the former St 
Vincent College for boys – it was later a department store and then today's 
jewellery centre. Seconds after entering past the mini Statue of Liberty, you 
seem to be transported to a European cul-de-sac; it's crowded with cafes and 
groups of men smoking outside (since 2011, you have to be 10ft from dining 
areas to light up), while above you are balconies with flower pots. Then 
there's some Roman gladiator décor, statues of fishes, bakers, knights and 
drummers, and a French tricolor, huge coffee cup and 1960s American fin car – 
with Marilyn Monroe driving – above a cafe. Looking closer, you find that this 
is in fact a Greek/Mediterranean oasis where delis and restaurants like the
Sevan Garden <http://www.gardenkebab.com/> offer you coffee, pastries, gyros 
and kebabs – and there's even somewhere you can have a haircut or get your 
shoes shined.
• Sevan Garden, 621 St's Vincent Court, +1 213 489 5626, open Mon-Sat 
10am-4.30pm, kebabs $10.49-$12.49

Million Dollar Farmacia

More exotic still is the Million Dollar Farmacia. Named for the historic 
theatre next door <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Dollar_Theater>, this 
pharmacy will sell you the basics, but its main trade is candles, potions, 
powders and trinkets – the traditional Mexican business of sex, luck and 
curses. Electric blue shampoo,aquas espirituales (holy waters), oils, herbs, 
soaps, unidentifiable goo and even bats' hearts, swallows' eyes and mini red or 
black voodoo dolls are here too. There are also some phallic candles, and all 
are decorated with retro/porn-chic drawings so you know what hex you're 
browsing for. The best thing is the beautiful – and slightly scary – altar 
dedicated to Holy Death (La Santisima Muerte), to which you can pay homage 
behind the curtain.

Piñata District
 Photograph: Alamy 
To keep that Mexican vibe – and snag some great snacks and sweets – head for 
the Piñata District. It may seem like a drab street of warehouses, yet all of 
them have colourful delights inside, including endless styles of piñatas – 
everything from beer bottles and tractors to dragons and superheroes. There are 
also boxes of spicy Mexican candies, fragrant dried chillies and spices in big 
glass jars, nuts, fruit and, at the weekends, vendors sellingpupusas (stuffed 
tortillas from El Salvador) plantains, coconut milk, churros and crackly pork 
rind (dipped in oil as you wait). Music blasts everywhere and, for an unsung 
part of LA, it's really party central.

Where to stay: Bonaventure Hotel
 Bonaventure Hotel, LA 
With its five circular glass towers, the Bonaventure Hotel looks like a 
spaceship, and its external elevators inspired the futuristic look of Blade 
Runner. The TV series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century was also filmed here, as 
wasIn the Line of Fire

Lies 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2009/jul/15/lars-von-trier-antichrist-true-lies>
 and Strange Days – look for the plaques. Inside, the upscale decor is centred 
round a six-storey atrium that's also home to "pod" booths and a running track 
that's very 2001, while all the rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows offering 
amazing views of the city. Guest or not, at dusk take the red tower elevator up 
to the Bona Vista Lounge revolving restaurant. A revolution takes about 80 
minutes, and in that time the setting sun will make way for streetlights and 
stars – and maybe even the odd helicopter, blimp or studio searchlight.
