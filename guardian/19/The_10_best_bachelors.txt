Music and Arts/Alamy 
Norman king William Rufus, who succeeded his father William the Conqueror and 
ruled for 13 years, was known as William the Red for his florid complexion. A 
ruthless ruler, forever falling out with the church, he was described by 
medieval historian Frank Barlow thus: “A rumbustious, devil-may-care soldier, 
without natural dignity or social graces, with no cultivated tastes and little 
show of religious piety or morality. Indeed, according to his critics, addicted 
to every kind of vice, particularly lust and especially sodomy.” Apart from
Elizabeth I 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/03/the-10-best-spinsters>, the 
unpopular king is our only post-1066 adult monarch never to marry. He was 
fatally shot by an arrow while hunting in the New Forest. But not by Cupid.

It’s a running joke in the current BBC reboot 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0fGZKCeSz8> starring Benedict Cumberbatch’s 
cheekbones that everyone assumes the Baker Street detective is gay. The only 
female to take Holmes’s interest was Irene Adler, his adversary in A Scandal in 
Bohemia and referred to as “the woman”. The opposite sex remain a mystery to 
Holmes, who says: “Their motives are so inscrutable. How can you build on such 
quicksand? Their most trivial actions may mean volumes, their most 
extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin.” His creator, Conan Doyle, 
added: “Holmes is as inhuman as Babbage’s calculating machine and just as 
likely to fall in love.”

Artist, architect, musician, mathematician, inventor, vegetarian, a leading 
figure of the Italian Renaissance and owner of an admirable beard – but 
marriage is one of the few things that doesn’t appear on polymath Leonardo’s 
packed CV. Little is known about his private life except that he had 
friendships with Cecilia Gallerani (subject of the portrait Lady with an Ermine)
, and Milanese princesses Beatrice and Isabella d’Este. He is widely thought to 
have been gay, evidenced by his close bond with his male pupils and the 
homoeroticism of his work. Was he straight, gay or just too busy being the 
greatest genius the world has ever seen? He remains as enigmatic as the Mona 
Lisa’s smile.

 Desmond Barrit (Sir John Falstaff) and Wendy Morgan (Doll Tearsheet) in Henry 
IV Part 2 by William Shakespeare Photograph: Tristram Kenton 
“I am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other men.” 
Shakespeare’s much-loved creation is a proto-Men Behaving Badly breed of 
bachelor, a larger-than-life rogue, rogerer and riotously funny roister 
doister. Across three plays, the dissolute knight lands Prince Hal in colourful 
scrapes, engages in copious carousing at the Boar’s Head Inn, visits 
prostitutes and, suffers “consumption of the purse”, becoming the buffoonish 
suitor to two rich married women. When he sends them identical love letters, 
they wreak revenge. Falstaff was hugely popular with audiences –The Merry Wives 
of Windsor was hastily written to satisfy the Queen’s desire for more of the 
plump old cad – and rightly remains so today.

What is it about the name Leonardo? There are two of them on this list. Since 
George Clooney married last year, baby-faced five-time Oscar nominee DiCaprio 
has taken over as the A-list single leading man. In his hell-raising youth, he 
was leader of tastefully named 1990s LA wolfpack the Pussy Posse and is still 
something of a “modeliser”, having had relationships with high-profile clothes 
horses including Gisele Bündchen and Bar Refaeli, as well as actress Blake 
Lively and, rumour has it, Rihanna. No wonder laddish bantersauruses on social 
media have nicknamed him #LeoDiCHAPrio

As Bernard Levin wrote in this newspaper, it was “an ironical comment” on the 
permissive society that the UK had to wait until the 1970s for a virgin prime 
minister. The sole unmarried PM of the past century and only the fourth of all 
time, Sir Edward served at No 10 from 1970 to 1974. A classical organist and 
conductor of near-professional standard, he was expected to marry concert 
pianist Moura Lympany or childhood friend Kay Raven but never got round to 
either. Heath claimed he’d been too busy building a career postwar to pursue 
affairs of the heart and had “perhaps taken too much for granted”. He died 10 
years ago this month.

Despite encroaching deafness, obsessive devotion to music and an irascible 
nature (now often put down to bipolar disorder), the German composer had 
several romantic attachments during his 56 years but they were hampered by 
class issues. He fell for Austrian countess Julie Guicciardi but was too humble 
to consider marrying her. It was a similar story with aristocratic Hungarian 
widow Josephine Brunsvik, the most likely recipient of his mysterious “Immortal 
Beloved” letter. Beethoven longed for wedded bliss, writing: “Love, and love 
alone, is capable of giving thee a happier life. O God, let me at length find 
her - she, who may strengthen me in virtue – who may lawfully be mine.”

The bachelor president, who occupied the White House before Abraham Lincoln, 
remains the only US leader never to marry but his single status was tinged with 
tragedy. In his 20s, the Pennsylvanian Democrat fell in love with Ann Coleman, 
daughter of a wealthy iron mill owner. Her family didn’t view him as marriage 
material and soon after Buchanan’s proposal was denied, Ann died under 
mysterious circumstances, suspected to be suicide. Buchanan swore off marriage 
but kept her letters until his own death. In later life, eyebrows were raised 
at his close friendship with Alabama senator William R King. Ex-president 
Andrew Jackson nicknamed them “Miss Nancy” and “Aunt Fancy”.

by acting coach Jan Tarrant and IVF twins with actress Beverly D’Angelo. “I 
guess I feel as though I’ve been married many times,” muses Pacino. “I have 
children, I have relationships with their mothers and other women I’ve been 
with for a long time. Maybe it’s the kind of women I’ve been with who weren’t 
forcing the issue. But when I talk to my married friends, we understand each 
other, so I must be doing something right.” Hoo-hah.

PG Wodehouse’s comic hero Bertram Wilberforce Wooster wouldn’t have got into 
nearly as many scrapes had he been married. Besides, his valet Jeeves in many 
ways fulfils the role of long-suffering wife. Bertie does propose several times 
– to icy blonde Lady Florence Craye (who tells him “your Aunt Agatha… called 
you a spineless invertebrate and advised me strongly not to marry you”), 
American millionaire’s daughter Pauline Stoker, scarily sporty Honoria Glossop, 
soppy romantic Madeline Bassett and reckless redhead Bobbie Wickham – but once 
the charms of his intended’s “lovely profile” wear off, he tends to see 
engagement merely as a trap from which Jeeves must extricate him. What ho!
