Air pollution from heavy industry, power plants and oil refineries can prevent 
rainfall locally, according to researchers who have tracked plumes of smoke 
across the surrounding countryside.

The tiny aerosols of dust, soot and chemicals from factories can "stifle" 
rain-bearing clouds, reports Daniel Rosenfeld of the Hebrew university of 
Jerusalem in the US journal Science today, because the rain droplets become too 
small to fall.

Clouds are made up of microscopic drops of water, but these will not fall as 
rain until they have "seeded" around some thing, and coalesced. It takes about 
1m tiny droplets to merge to form one raindrop large enough to fall without 
evaporating on the way down.

In polluted clouds, Dr Rosenfeld found too many small droplets and too few big 
ones. Smaller droplets were slower to freeze and form ice crystals, so 
pollution also reduced snowfall.

Using satellite data Dr Rosenfeld tracked plumes of pollution over Turkey, 
Canada and Australia, and used other satellite instruments to map what happened 
in rainclouds. The data showed that raindrops and ice crystals formed in 
unpolluted clouds - but the process was turned off in those parts crossed by 
the long, narrow plumes.
