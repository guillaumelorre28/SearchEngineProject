There has been little festive cheer for Stoke after the fixture computer 
handed them trips to Anfield and Stamford Bridge in between Christmas and new 
year and despite flattering to deceive before losing both games, the visit of
Watford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> gives them a chance to 
end on a high. Sunday’s home humbling by Spurs was a fifth defeat in seven for 
Walter Mazzarri’s inconsistent side.Paul Chronnell
