Cerys Matthews, singer of Catatonia and BBC 6 Music DJ: Nashville 
 Here's how to do Nashville, where I used to live. Stay in the Hermitage 
Nashville (231 6th Avenue North, +1 615 244 3121, thehermitagehotel.com 
<http://www.thehermitagehotel.com/homepage.aspx>), where Neil Young celebrated 
his Prairie Wind launch – I was there and came face to face with Meryl Streep, 
a Neil Young fan. Opened in 1910, it is an old-school class hotel. Or theBest 
Western (1407 Division Street, +1 615 242 1631, book.bestwestern.com 
<http://book.bestwestern.com/bestwestern/US/TN/Nashville-hotels/BEST-WESTERN-PLUS-Music-Row/Hotel-Overview.do?propertyCode=43150&cm_mmc=GooglePlaces-_-BW-_-TN-_-43150>
), is a stone's throw from a statue of legendary producer Owen Bradley and all 
of the record company offices. The hotel bar hosts open-mic nights where you'll 
hear some crazy songs. Classic Nashville nights.

In the morning head to the Ryman Auditorium (116 5th Ave North, +1 615 889 
3060,ryman.com <http://www.ryman.com/>) downtown. Go on a guided tour – you get 
to stand on the stage and sing through the mic as part of the experience. Learn 
about the Grand Ole Opry, which on a Saturday night recorded artists like Dolly 
Parton and Minnie Pearl performing live to be transmitted to homes around the 
country.

The alley between the auditorium and the Broadway bars is where Hank Williams 
would slip out of the Ryman where he was performing and into the back doors of 
places likeTootsie's Orchid Lounge (422 Broadway, +1 615 726 0463, tootsies.net 
<http://tootsies.net/>). Enter a bar of your choice for live music till the 
early hours. No corny tourist fodder – these are the rehearsing rooms of the 
session musicians who play at the big recording studios – the later the hour, 
the better the talent. If you're a musician, you can often get up and play with 
the bands. They play for tips, which you put in a pot on leaving.

For an idea of the current crop of local musical talent, Grimey's (1604 8th 
Ave. South, +1 615 254 4801,grimeys.com <http://www.grimeys.com/>) has savvy 
staff and new releases on CD. Mark Never's studio,Beech House (
myspace.com/beechhouserecording <http://www.myspace.com/beechhouserecording>), 
is close to Grimey's – recent recordings include Caitlin Rose, Candi Staton, 
Lamb Chop and … well, umm, me.

After three days in Nashville it's time to head for Memphis. It's a three-hour 
road trip and so worth it, but that's a whole different story …

Soul

Noah Ball, festival organiser: Philadelphia 
The musical pilgrimage I'd been planning for a couple of years with a friend 
from Manchester involved three US cities: Philadelphia, Detroit and LA. 
Philadelphia was renowned for its Philly soul sound, which brought the Soul 
Survivors and Teddy Pendergrass into the world; prior to that its jazz scene 
boasted John Coltrane and Dizzy Gillespie. This legacy of soul and jazz has 
been kept burning bright in the Philly hip-hop and electronic scene – the 
Roots, Vikter Duplaix and Bahamadia.

The Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts (736-38 S Broad Street, 
clefclubofjazz.org <http://www.clefclubofjazz.org/>) is a venue that we found 
highly recommendable, and thePhiladelphia Record Exchange (618 South 5th 
Street, +1 215 925 7892,philarecx.com <http://www.philarecx.com/>) is perhaps 
one of the greatest vinyl shops I've ever been to.

Blues

Jon Stewart, Sleeper guitarist and music lecturer: Clarksdale, Mississippi 
Every Blues fan should visit Clarksdale, down Highway 61 from Memphis. 
Clarksdale was a cultural and economic focus for the cotton plantations, and 
for many of the legendary musicians who defined the blues.

Muddy Waters and Son House lived locally and played juke joints in the area – 
some of which, likeRed's (395 Sunflower Ave, Clarksdale), you can still visit. 
Robert Johnson "sold his soul to the devil" at a crossroads on the edge of 
town, and Bessie Smith died in the colourfulRiverside Hotel (615 Sunflower 
Avenue, +1 662 624 9163) – home at one time or other to almost every name in 
the blues pantheon, and where Ike Turner also wrote what is generally accepted 
as the first rock'n'roll song, Rocket 88.

Stay in a refurbished sharecropper cabin at the Shack Up Inn (1 Commissary 
Circle, +1 662 624 8329,shackupinn.com <http://www.shackupinn.com/>) to immerse 
yourself in the vibe of the Mississippi Delta.

Garth Cartwright, music writer: Chicago 
The blues never die – as proven recently by Hugh Laurie – and Chicago remains 
America's foremost blues city. It hosts its annualChicago Blues Festival from 
10-12 June (explorechicago.org <http://www.explorechicago.org/city/en.html>). 
And it's free! The festival's over by 9pm – the perfect time to head out to one 
of Chicago's blues bars.Buddy Guy's Legends (700 S Wabash, +1 312 427 1190, 
buddyguys.com <http://www.buddyguys.com/>) is a great venue that books top 
artists.Blue Chicago (536 N Clark, +1 312 661 0100, bluechicago.com 
<http://www.bluechicago.com/>) in downtown tends towards pleasing tourists with 
bands playing standards. On the north side of town you haveKingston Mines (2548 
North Halsted, +1 773 477 4646,kingstonmines.com <http://www.kingstonmines.com/>
) andB.L.U.E.S (2519 N Halsted, +1 773 528 1012, chicagobluesbar.com 
<http://www.chicagobluesbar.com/>) – both stay open late and feature local and 
touring acts. For the adventurous,Lee's Unleaded (7401 S. South Chicago Ave, +1 
773 493 3477,leesunleadedblues.com <http://www.leesunleadedblues.com/>) in the 
South Side is where black Chicago parties to soul-blues.

Sixties

Greg Wilson, DJ and producer: San Francisco 
I'm a bit of a 60s obsessive, so San Francisco holds special relevance, the 
city having spawned the hippie movement, not to mention the beatniks before 
them. On my first trip there, I found myself enthusing like a child on seeing a 
sign for theCow Palace (where Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters headed in 1964 
to watch the Beatles perform; 2600 Geneva Avenue,cowpalace.com 
<http://www.cowpalace.com/>), and my excitement reached boiling point when this 
was immediately followed by a sign forCandlestick Park (venue of the last 
Beatles gig, on 29 August 1966; +1 415 656 4900,49ers.com 
<http://www.49ers.com/stadium/index.html>).

The Haight-Ashbury district was, of course, my first port of call. I was so 
excited to be at the heartland of hippie that I initially looked at things 
through rose-coloured specs, almost imagining myself back in the era of the the 
Free Store (run by counter-culture heroes the Diggers) and the infamous Drog 
Store Cafe. However, during subsequent visits I've been much more aware of the 
downside, illustrated by the stream of drug casualties who are still magnetised 
by its legend well over 40 years after the dream went sour.

Robin Bennett, festival organiser: Woodstock, New York State 
For most of today's indie kids the Big Pink is a band singing about Dominos. 
For me it means a hallowed place in Woodstock where Bob Dylan and the Band 
holed up in a basement crafting dark folk tales of Long Black Veils. I first 
went to Woodstock a few years back with my brother Joe and our then band 
Goldrush, for a recording session. Calling on a local for directions, we asked, 
"Where's Big Pink?"

Turns out it was just a pink house (where some of the greatest songs I've ever 
heard were penned), but Woodstock – now home to stores owned by ageing hipsters 
selling faded tie-dye – and upstate New York are well worth the visit 
nonetheless for all fans of the Band, Dylan and Americana; every log cabin 
seems steeped in musical history and natural beauty.

Traditional British music

Julie Fowlis, folk singer: Ullapool 
The best place to hear Gaelic singing and traditional music is the Ceilidh 
Place(14 West Argyle Street, 01854 612103, theceilidhplace.com 
<http://www.theceilidhplace.com/>), Ullapool on the west coast of Scotland. 
It's one of the longest-running establishments in this vibrant village for 
music, with organised gigs and spontaneous sing-songs. I've played there myself 
– officially and unofficially. It attracts real music lovers, has great food 
and local beers, rooms to stay in, and is a real rootsy kind of place.

Jackie Oates, folk-pop act: Okehampton 
The Devonshire Inn (Sticklepath, Okehampton, Devon, 01837 840626), hosts a 
sing-around and traditional music session on the first Sunday of the month. 
It's a tiny, traditional pub, with a stone floor, large open fire and intimate 
atmosphere. It is a warm and nurturing environment. I first starting going 
there as a student: it is where I learnt and honed my craft, through listening 
to older singers, and trying out new songs that I am hooked on.

Irish
 Fleadh Cheoil festival, Ireland Photograph: Corbis 
Colin Irwin, music journalist: Dublin and the west coast of Ireland 
Despite an overload of Glee singers belting out Fields Of Athenry in Dublin, 
fine musicians can still be found, notably at theCobblestone (77 North King St, 
+353 1872 1799,cobblestonepub.ie <http://www.cobblestonepub.ie/>) in 
Smithfield, whileO'Donoghue's (15 Merrion Row, +353 1660 7194, odonoghues.ie) 
<http://www.odonoghues.ie/music.htm> – indelibly associated with the Dubliners 
– is also obligatory.

The best Irish music, though, is found on the west coast. Lively music bars 
populate Cork, Kerry, Galway and Mayo (whereMatt Molloy of the Chieftains has an
eponymous pub <http://www.mattmolloy.com/pub_about.html> heaving with live 
music every night in Westport (+353 098 26655,mattmolloy.com 
<http://www.mattmolloy.com/index.html>). The heartland of Irish music is County 
Clare. Great sessions abound in Ennis and Miltown Malbay, especially in early 
July when Miltown hosts a festival in honour of the great piperWillie Clancy (
willieclancyfestival.com <http://www.willieclancyfestival.com/>). And if you go 
between 13-22 August, head for Cavan – north-west of Dublin – this year's host 
ofFleadh Cheoil (fleadh2011cavan.ie 
<http://www.fleadh2011cavan.ie/Default.aspx?StructureID_str=1>), a huge annual 
gathering of musicians. Wild but wonderful.

<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/flamenco> in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain
As the modern crucible of the art of flamenco, Jerez's flamenco festival in 
March draws thousands to masterclasses with top names and locals like the 
charismatic Manuela Carpio, with whom I did fastbulerías dances this year. Gigs 
start at 7pm in thePalacio de Villavicencio (Paseo Alameda Vieja, +34 956 
326923), part of the Moorish Alcázar fortress. Then go for tapas at the bar 
abutting theVillamarta theatre (Plaza Romero Martínez) before evening 
performances there by top choreographers like Eva Yerbabuena or singers like 
Miguel Poveda.

In the daytime, hang out in Bar Gitanería (Calle Ancha 18), frequented by 
guitarist Moraíto. Then drop in at theCafé Arriate (Calle Francos 41) before 
the midnight show atSala Compañía (Plaza Compañía). After that, it's standing 
room only at local late peña clubs.

Kapka Kassabova, travel writer: Tango in Buenos Aires 
It takes two to tango: you and Buenos Aires. You won't understand tango music 
until you visit – because it's not a music genre, it's a way of life. Walk 
along Avenida Corrientes, where old tangos play in every bookshop, and stop at 
music storeZivals (V Callao 395, +54 115 128 7500, tangostore.com 
<http://www.tangostore.com/home.php?lang=e>). Drop in at the Museum of Tango 
above Cafe Tortoni (Avenida de Mayo, +54 114 342 4328,cafetortoni.com 
<http://www.cafetortoni.com.ar/html/tortoni.html>), and you might catch young 
tango musicians rehearsing. Avoid over-priced restaurant tango shows and hit 
the milonga circuit, to see glammed-up locals and visitors dance in a sweaty 
trance atSalon Canning (Scalabrini Ortiz 1331, +54 114 832 6753). Catch tango 
sensationFernández Fierro – the heavy metal of tango music – who regularly play 
at their eponymous club (Sánchez de Bustamante 764,fernandezfierro.com 
<http://www.fernandezfierro.com/home.php>). Go soon, although "tango knows how 
to wait".

Rose Skelton, journalist and specialist in west African music: Mbalax in Dakar 
The music pioneered by Senegalese superstar Youssou N'Dour is known as mbalax 
– a blend of traditional sabar, Cuban salsa and the soaring vocals of west 
African praise singers – and this high-energy, frenetic dance music is the beat 
of the street in Dakar today. For a relaxed intro, head toJust4u (Avenue Chiekh 
Anta Diop, +221 33 824 3250,myspace.com/just4udakar 
<http://www.myspace.com/just4udakar>) for an early (midnight!) session. Madison 
(K1 Avenue Cheikh Anta Diop, +221 77 535 9997,madison-dakar.com 
<http://madison-dakar.com/>) has wild mbalax performances that get going late 
(2am). But an evening in Dakar isn't complete without a trip to Youssou's own 
club, where he performs at weekends when he's in town.Le Thiossane (Sicap Rue 
10 Point E, +221 33 824 6046) is iconic Dakar: glittery-dressed women, new 
dance moves created on the spot, and the eye-popping energy of Youssou and his 
band, doing what they've been famously doing for 40 years.
