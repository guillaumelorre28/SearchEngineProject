Opponents of capital punishment had good cause to be pleased with Parliament’s 
decision last week finally to end hanging; it was particularly gratifying that 
the leaders of all three parties went into the abolitionist lobby. But merely 
ending the death penalty is not enough.

The public must now be reassured that the alternative of life imprisonment is 
adequate for their protection. Since some murderers may have to be detained for 
much longer than the so-called “average” of nine years, conditions in our 
prisons must be made tolerable. But people must be satisfied that security will 
not be jeopardised by such conditions – or by the system of release on parole. 
The public will come to terms with abolition only when they can be certain that 
public safety is a prime concern of penal administrators. The second task of 
abolitionists is to broaden the discussion of homicide and to see it as the 
extreme consequence of violent crime. The Home Secretary’s announcement of a 
research programme does not reflect sufficient urgency.

We need something comparable to the United States commission on violence, 
which was called on to report within a year of being set up. Violent crime is 
too important a topic to be studied at leisure.

America is reaching the end of its long romance with the automobile. The 
latest anti-automobile proposals were made by New York’s mayor, John Lindsay, 
when he called for a tax on all motorists who drive their cars into Manhattan.
