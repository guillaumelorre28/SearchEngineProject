Rambling is a wonderful leisure pursuit that can be undertaken alone or as 
part of a group, making a significant contribution to participants’ health and 
wellbeing, while combating the epidemic of loneliness that is also currently 
attracting attention (Editorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/14/the-guardian-view-on-public-health-walking-to-happiness>
, 15 November). But, in common with other preventive services, it is not easy 
to demonstrate cause and effect, so footpath maintenance is unlikely to figure 
highly on a council’s list of priorities.

Outsourcing has reached this area too. When I contacted a county council in 
the heart of England, providing photographs of more than 20 broken or 
inaccessible stiles on an 11-mile route, I was told that this was no longer 
their responsibility but they would pass on my concerns to the contractor.

• Keeping footpaths accessible for ramblers is something the government is 
unlikely to help with and the local authorities cannot afford to.  In 
Hertfordshire shortly after the second world war local enthusiasts went out 
every weekend, our leader with wire cutters, and walked all the ancient 
footpaths so they remained officially public rights of way. Now may be the time 
for rambling clubs to do the same.
