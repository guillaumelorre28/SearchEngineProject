Chocolate peanut butter slabs and silky chocolate mousse have been appearing 
and re-appearing in my kitchen lately. I have been feeling the weight of the 
festive season’s perpetual cheese and mince pies, so I am experimenting with 
lighter sweets – removing refined sugars and dairy for a change. This is 
something I do periodically, but I was re-inspired in California last summer; 
translating the treats popular in Los Angeles and San Francisco to suit my 
London bakery – and British tastes – brings some welcome change for the new 
year.

These two recipes, which are free from refined sugars, dairy and gluten, sit 
in their own category of desserts, because their ingredients are used for what 
they can uniquely bring to the recipe, not just as a replacement for something 
you want to avoid. Good in their own right, unusual ... but so delicious.

First, the slab, which is made by combining cocoa powder, melted coconut oil 
and maple syrup. Together, they create a pouring texture that hardens perfectly 
into a candy-like wedge. In the middle is natural peanut butter sweetened with 
pureed dates. With their caramel tones and toothsome texture, dates are one of 
my favourite sweeteners. When blitzed and blended with water they become thick 
and rich, combining well with a chunky natural peanut butter (you could 
substitute almond butter, if you preferred). A bit of hot water and some 
coconut oil bring it together into a chewy, gooey filling – a grown-up peanut 
butter cup, if you like.

While on that trip to California last year, I spent a few days in the kitchen 
at my favourite bakery, Gjusta in Venice Beach, and I was oddly drawn to a 
chocolate mousse that they made every day. I say “oddly” because I don’t really 
like chocolate mousse. Not the eggy kind, anyway. But this was different. It 
was made with avocados and coconut oil – two ingredients I love – so I made up 
my own version with the addition of cocoa powder and, once again, dates. It is 
very rich so you just want a little – a beautiful thing in its own right.
