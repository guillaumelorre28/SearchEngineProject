In a statement the Spanish 14-times grand slam champion said he would play no 
more tournaments and would instead begin “preparing intensively” for the 2017 
season.

Nadal, 30, was forced to pull out of the French Open before his third-round 
match and also missed Wimbledon because of the injury although the left-hander 
returned to compete atthe Rio Olympics where he won a doubles gold medal with 
Marc López

.

“It is no secret that I arrived to the Olympic Games short of preparation and 
not fully recovered, but the goal was to compete and win a medal for Spain,” 
Nadal said.

“This forced recovery has caused me pain since then and now I am forced to 
stop and start preparing the 2017 season.”

Nadal, who is ranked sixth in the world, was expected to qualify for the 
season-ending ATP World Tour Finals.
