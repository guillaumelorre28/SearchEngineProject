Bernard Tomic’s problematic right wrist has contributed to a third round exit 
from the Indian Wells Masters.


The Australian No 1 struggled throughout his clash with big-serving Canadian 
Milos Raonic, before retiring injured while trailing 6-2 3-0 on Monday.

Tomic has battled the injury since the Australian Open in January, and lasted 
just 36 minutes against world No 14 Raonic, winning just 18 points.


The 23-year-old was already in doubt for next week’s Miami Open, and was 
reportedly already set to have scans on the wrist after the match against 
Raonic.


The injury was the central source of his frustration during Australia’s recent 
Davis Cup loss to the United States, where he suggested Nick Kyrgios was faking 
illness to avoid playing the tie.


Tomic’s withdrawal left Samantha Stosur as the only remaining Australian in 
the singles draws at Indian Wells.


Meanwhile second seed and world No 2 Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> squandered a 4-1 lead in the 
third set before suffering a shock 6-4 4-6 7-6 loss to Argentina’s Federico 
Delbonis.


The second-seeded Scotsman let his commanding lead evaporate on a warm, windy 
day and needed to break the 53rd-ranked Delbonis in the 12th game just to force 
the tiebreaker, which the Argentine won 7-3.


Delbonis took advantage of a series of Murray errors to run off the last five 
points of the decider to end the two-hour, 46-minute struggle in Stadium 1.

“Thanks to everybody here for such an amazing match. It was a very intense 
match , very passionate, I think,” the Argentine said.


Delbonis, who reached quarter-finals this year in Rio and Sao Paulo, varied 
his strategy against Murray and took advantage of some weakness in the Scot’s 
serve.


Murray failed to register a single ace and won less than 50% of his second 
serves.


“I know it was a challenge,” said Delbonis. “I have to mix [my shots] all the 
time.


“In the end, I can do my job and this is what I get.”


It was a short appearance in only the second tournament of the year for 
Murray, who lost in the final of the Australian Open to world No 1 Novak 
Djokovic.
