Pep Guardiola’s last visit to Merseyside ended in defeat and recrimination at 
Anfield on New Year’s Eve, although that was the only game in the last six that
Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> have 
failed to win. Guardiola’s side were on top form at West Ham United and Ronald 
Koeman said City could repeat that 5-0 FA Cup win should Everton reproduce the 
feeble defensive display that led to them being knocked out of the competition 
by Leicester City last weekend. New signings Morgan Schneiderlin and Ademola 
Lookman could feature for the hosts.Andy Hunter
