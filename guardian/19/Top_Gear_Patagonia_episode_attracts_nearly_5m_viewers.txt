, attracted nearly 5 million viewers on Sunday night.

19.4% audience share from 8pm – more popular than any show on ITV or Channel 4 
on Sunday. Only BBC1’s evening lineup had bigger audiences.

, southern Argentina, in early October after locals became incensed that one of 
their vehicles had a number plate that appeared to refer to the Falklands 
conflict.

May and Hammond were driving an old Lotus Esprit and a Mustang, but it was the 
A Porsche 928, with the number plate H982 FKL, driven by Clarkson, that caused 
controversy, after it was suggested that the plate referred to the war with 
Britain in 1982.

The BBC <https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> has denied any intended 
reference, saying the car was bought by a member of the production team and its 
plate was entirely coincidental.

Top Gear concluded with an homage to the famous final scene of Butch Cassidy 
and the Sundance Kid, in which Paul Newman and Robert Redford charge out into a 
hail of bullets.
