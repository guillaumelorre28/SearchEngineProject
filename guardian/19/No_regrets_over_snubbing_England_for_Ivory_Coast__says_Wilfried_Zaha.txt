“I left for England and I did not return to the country [Ivory Coast]. So I 
did all my schooling in my adopted country and it was most normal that I played 
for the England youth teams,” Zaha said in an interview, published in French on 
the Ivorian Football Federation’s website.

“For the past four years, I have had ample time to analyse my situation and to 
take into account the solicitations of the Ivorian Football Association.

“Now I have made my choice. Now I want to play with the Ivory Coast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ivorycoast>. It has been rewarding, 
firstly because I am proud to play for my country, then because the Ivorian 
selection has quality players and has always been a reservoir of talent. So I 
made the right choice and I do not regret it.”

The winger made his debut in a friendly on Sunday, coming on in the second 
half to set up the winner as the Ivorians beat Sweden 2-1 in Abu Dhabi.

He will likely win a second cap on Wednesday when they complete their 
preparations with another friendly in Abu Dhabi, against fellow finalists 
Uganda.

“I want to be able to give the best of myself to the team and contribute with 
my team-mates to winning more titles. I want to be able to offer the country a 
third Nations Cup, make Ivorians happy. That is my ambition in the short term. 
Then we need to qualify for the 2018 World Cup,” Zaha said.

Zaha successfully applied to Fifa to change his international status despite 
playing for England in friendlies against Sweden in November 2012 and against 
Scotland in August 2013.

The Ivorians play in Group C and begin their campaign on Monday in Oyem 
against Togo. They will also meet the Democratic Republic of Congo and Morocco 
in the group stage.
