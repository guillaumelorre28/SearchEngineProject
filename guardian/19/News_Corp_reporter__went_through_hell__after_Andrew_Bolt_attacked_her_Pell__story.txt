Bolt this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/22/andrew-bolt-lashes-out-at-herald-sun-reporter-over-george-pell-story>
.

News Corp has refused to comment on Morris-Marr’s allegations, while Bolt has 
denied all of her claims, describing them as “complete nonsense”.

Morris-Marr revealed in February that Victoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria> police, through Taskforce 
Sano, were investigating Pell over allegations of child abuse. Pell has 
strenuously denied those allegations.

The story was publicly trashed by Bolt, her colleague, who labelled it a 
vicious smear that formed part of a “sinister” campaign 
<http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/andrew-bolt/cardinal-george-pell-is-the-victim-of-a-vicious-witch-hunt/news-story/29e8036f329dfee742adf48949ed8743>
 against Australia’s most senior Catholic cleric.

Morris-Marr lodged an internal complaint regarding Bolt’s column, saying it 
threatened to expose her and her sources by implying she had received leaks 
from within Victoria police. Victoria police later referred the “leak” to 
Victoria’s anti-corruption commission 
<http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-police-refer-leak-of-investigation-into-cardinal-george-pell-to-ibac-20160222-gn0gd5.html>
 in an attempt to find Morris-Marr’s source.

Morris-Marr’s complaint also alleged Bolt’s column breached News Corp’s 
editorial guidelines because he had allowed his friendship with Pell to 
influence his editorial position.


Bolt exclusively interviewed Pell for Sky News about a week later 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfTfhjSrNwo>, in which he declared the pair 
were not friends, while Morris-Marr took time off to deal with the stress of 
the anti-corruption commission investigation and the dispute with her colleague.

She soon began to question her decision. “I thought, ‘Oh god, I’ve risked my 
job,’ I actually apologised to them when I went back to work … I said, ‘I was 
angry,’” she told Guardian Australia.

She told her bosses she wanted “to move forward” and thought they wanted to do 
the same thing. “I had six weeks left on my contract. Then literally the day 
before my contract expired, they met with me and said there’s no money.”

Morris-Marr was told her contract would not be renewed. She was instead 
offered a freelance contract, which she rejected, fearing it would silence her. 
She was later offered intermittent shifts as a casual, which she said were 
impossible to accept because of her need to book childcare far in advance.

“I thought, ‘I’ve just broken a world-important story and I’m crying in the 
toilets of the Herald Sun. This is wrong.’”

Morris-Marr believes News Corp pushed her out after the Pell story and the 
complaint about Bolt’s column. “This has nearly destroyed me … it’s been hell, 
absolute hell.”

Bolt has denied any knowledge that he was the subject of a complaint from 
Morris-Marr. He described any assertion that he had anything to do with her 
departure as nonsense.

“I did not know Lucie had left the paper until months later,” he said. “I did 
not know she was on a one-year contract or was in any negotiations to renew it.

“I did not know she had left on bad terms. I did not know she had made any HR 
complaint. This is the first I have heard from anyone of any unhappiness on her 
part.”

Bolt said he remained unconvinced about the allegations against Pell, which he 
described as flimsy. He said the leaking of the allegations was “deeply unfair” 
and said the cardinal should have been afforded procedural fairness.
