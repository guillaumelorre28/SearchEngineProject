Warwick Hotel

Designed as an apartment complex in the 1960s, this was one of the US's 
original Playboy Clubs in the 1970s. Today, the Warwick, in Denver's hip Uptown 
neighbourhood, is still bucking the trend as one of the few hotels in the city 
to allow smoking of any kind on its ample off-room balconies – be it cigarettes 
or possibly (as of January 2014)legalised recreational marijuana 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/may/17/cannabis-colorados-budding-industry>
. The hotel, which had a multi-million-dollar renovation a few years ago, has 
private east- or west-facing patios in all rooms (except on the 14th floor), 
Egyptian cotton sheets and pillow-top mattresses. The Warwick is one of the few 
downtown hotels with a heated rooftop pool, open all year round.

epicentre and within walking distance of many of its best attractions.
