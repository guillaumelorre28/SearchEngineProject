Among my childhood memories of summer holidays in France – seemingly endless 
car journeys, fighting with my older sister on the back seat, Dire Straits on 
the cassette player – one stands out: repeated stops at localbrocantes (junk 
shops).

My parents seemed to suffer from some kind of affliction – they were 
physically unable to drive past a brocante sign. My mother even had a knack of 
waking from a doze just as a sign appeared: “Look, a brocante!” And we would 
abruptly pull over.

My sister and I would complain bitterly and be bribed with the promise of 
ice-cream, and for the next few hours my parents would disappear among piles of 
stuff all reeking of stale cigarettes,pastis and age.

They would reappear clutching cracked plates, bedposts, stuffed animals and 
broken clocks, and these supposed treasures would take up what was left of any 
fought-over space on the back seat before our journey south continued.

But apparently, this affliction is hereditary. As I grew older, instead of 
whining about another brocante stop, I’d eagerly follow my parents around these 
dusty Aladdin’s caves, handing over my hard-saved pocket money in exchange for 
old fireman’s helmets, bicycles, fossils and enamel signs. Learning from the 
best, I honed my haggling skills, developed a good eye and, now that I live in 
France, am also incapable of driving past a brocante.

My mother had a knack of waking from a doze as a sign appeared. ‘Look, a 
brocante!’

The chance that you might find something special at a bargain price is the 
real lure, but there is also great pleasure in simply rummaging in a shop full 
of interesting and beautiful things. A good brocante is a private collection, 
whose curator buys whatever takes their eye, in the hope that someone else 
might like it enough to part with money.

Generally, brocante dealers are kind, full of stories, and more than willing 
to drop a few euros when asked forle dernier prix. A brocante visit also 
provides a welcome distraction from soulless miles of autoroute, and a fine 
pitstop in otherwise undiscovered towns and villages. Dig around in a brocante, 
eat lunch in a local restaurant, then continue your journey. What could be 
better?

I now have a house full of finds from all over France: a 1868 sketch, picked 
up in Honfleur, of men on bicycles chasing rabbits; two pairs of 19th-century 
cinema seats from Lyon; a leather gym horse from a shop in Champagne; a 
fossilised dinosaur egg from under a table in Bordeaux; and a huge 1950s enamel 
sign from one of Beaune’s great wine estates.

For anyone contemplating a long summer holiday drive through France, here are 
five brocante stops that make a fine break to any journey, with a good place to 
eat nearby.

Just outside the city walls of Beaune in Burgundy, and just five minutes from 
the autoroute exit, Jean-Luc Girard’s brocante makes a good break on a journey 
south. Walls and corridors are filled to the rafters with anything from 
armoires to winemaking equipment, and the garden at the back is full of 
architectural pieces. The Café de France, opposite at number 13, is where local 
winegrowers descend for cheap and hearty lunches. At noon you’ll find Jean-Luc 
at the bar.
My best buy: a huge 19th-century vineyard workers’ parasol in blue linen, €60.

Every Thursday and Sunday, an industrial wasteland next to the Jonage canal in 
Villeurbanne, on the outskirts of Lyon, is transformed into brocante heaven. 
Dealers arrive in the early hours to unload and display their stock - a couple 
of permanent hangars brim over with finer pieces of furniture, while shipping 
containers display old bicycles, light fittings and vintage posters. At midday, 
it all packs up and a few bars and restaurants get going with live music,
steak-frites, plenty of Rhone wine and generous menus du jour. The Broc’cafe 
<https://www.facebook.com/broccafe.villeurbanne> is the pick of the bunch and 
if I die there, I’ll die happy.
My best buy: industrial madeleine baking trays, €6.

Just outside the fortified medieval town of Aubenas, Richard Barbey has a 
hangar filled with gems. He specialises in 18th-century furniture, and buys 
stock all over France. His keen eye means his shop is always full of 
interesting pieces and turnover is quick. Make a day of it with a picnic and 
wild swim in the stunning Besorgues river (take the D243 north of 
Vals-les-Bains), then enjoy a homemade ice-cream, sorbet ormacaron on the shady 
terrace ofMaison Beatrix <http://glacierbeatrix.fr/> (3 avenue Paul Ribeyre). 
My best buy: art deco poster advertising electric water pumps, €20.

Every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, Place Meynard, in the shadow of the 
14th-century Saint-Michel basilica, is transformed into a huge open-air flea 
market. This once-rundown corner of Bordeaux now buzzes with dealers, 
collectors and enthusiasts. In the 18th-century townhouses and warehouses 
surrounding the square, a few dealers have set up permanent shops, and visits 
to Hangars du Passage (12 rue des Allamandiers) and the charmingJamal Bennaji 
<http://www.bordeauxquinconces.com/benaji/> will not disappoint. Have a 
laid-back lunch at Le Passage Saint Michel (14 Place Canteloup, 
lepassagesaintmichel.com <http://lepassagesaintmichel.com/>): it’s a beautiful 
galleried bistro serving south-western classics such assalade de gésiers de 
canard confits and magret de canard grillé. 
My best buy: a very early cycling poster for Hutchinson tyres, €200.

In the town of Bondues, on the outskirts of Lille, 17 dealers share the huge 
hangars of Espace Nord Ouest. It’s an impressive space – open Weds-Sat, 
afternoons only – and their finds are laid out like an elaborate film set. Its 
collections of industrial fittings, architectural objects, 1950s furniture and 
18th-century mirrors are well worth the trip out of Lille. Back in town, 
celebrate with an atmospheric dinner of local specialities, such asgoyère au 
carré du vinage ( a local cheese tart) washed down with a Les Sept Péchés 
(seven deadly sins) beer atEstaminet Chez la Vieille 
<http://estaminetlille.fr/chezlavieille/cartes/> (6o rue de Gand). 
My best buy: a 1920s child’s clothing mannequin, €45.
