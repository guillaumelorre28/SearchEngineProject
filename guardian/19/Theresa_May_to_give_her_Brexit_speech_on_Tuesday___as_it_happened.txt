Afternoon summary

 * Number 10 sources have confirmed that Theresa May is planning to make her 
much-anticipated speech on Brexit on Tuesday next week. 
 * EU law will apply in Britain after Brexit as an essential part of any 
transition deal, Malta’s prime minister has said. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/12/eu-law-will-continue-to-apply-in-uk-during-transition-deal>
 AsJennifer Rankin reports, Joseph Muscat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/joseph-muscat>, whose country has just 
taken over the EU’s rotating presidency, also said it was “quite obvious” the 
City of London could be in line for a transition deal. But he made clear the 
writ of the EU court was an essential part of any deal to smooth the path to 
Brexit. “It is not a transition period where British institutions take over, 
but it is a transition period where the European court of justice is still in 
charge of dishing out judgments and points of view.” 
 * NHS England has published figures showing waiting time performance getting 
worse.(See 10.46am.)

 * Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has accused Gerard Coyne, who 
is challenging him for the Unite leadership, of proposing to act like a 
“dictator”. (See 12.28pm.)

That’s all from me for today.

There will be a readers’ edition blog tomorrow. But I will be back on Saturday 
to write a blog from the Fabian Society conference in London where Jeremy 
Corbyn is giving the keynote speech.

Thanks for the comments.

Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire has warned that a new election to 
the Stormont Assembly will be divisive and in danger of driving people further 
apart.

He is co-chairing talks in Belfast today with Irish foreign minister Charles 
Flanagan in a bid to defuse the crisis caused by Martin McGuinness’ resignation 
as deputy first minister and first minister Arlene Foster’s refusal to stand 
aside temporarily from her office.

Brokenshire admitted that elections are still “highly likely” despite last 
ditch efforts to try and bring the two ruling parties in the power sharing 
coalition, Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists, back together in government.

Speaking at Stormont House, the Northern Ireland Secretary said:

It is important for the parties to talk together and anything that indicates a 
move to encourage that type of discussion I take as helpful, albeit that 
position does remain serious and stark.

We are still looking at an election but we are doing everything we can as the 
two governments to work with the political parties to see if there is a way 
forward that can be found.

The 11th hour intervention of the British and Irish cabinet ministers into 
this crisis is an indication that both governments fear that the chances of 
piecing together a new power-sharing executive after the second set of 
elections in under a year may be remote given the bad blood that currently 
exists between Sinn Fein and the DUP.

Henry McDonald

It seems it is a case of too-little-too-late by the Democratic Unionist party 
in their moves to avoid another election to a new Northern Ireland assembly.

The DUP suddenly found the money today - £50,000 to be precise - for an Irish 
language bursary the party’s culture minister Paul Givan cut from his budget 
just before Christmas. (See 9.44am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/12/gerard-coyne-launches-manifesto-in-unite-leadership-contest-politics-live?page=with:block-58774f64e4b0f10ba20b7558#block-58774f64e4b0f10ba20b7558>

Refunding the scheme which enables children from poorer backgrounds to attend 
summer courses in Gaeltacht (Irish speaking) regions of Ireland won’t persuade 
Sinn Fein to return to government and avoid what first minister Arlene Foster 
has predicted is going to be a “brutal” election.

Minister Givan tweeted this morning that he had “identified the necessary 
funding to advance” the scheme repeating his earlier insistence that he was not 
hostile to the Irish language.

But Sinn Fein insist elections are going ahead after its deputy first minister 
of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness resigned from his post earlier this week. 
Although the party cited the withdrawal of the Liofa scheme as one example of 
DUP bad faith in the power-sharing government, the principal reason for the 
pull out has been first minister Foster’s refusal to step aside temporarily 
while a public inquiry takes place into the botched green energy heating 
programme whose costs have spiralled out of control.

Doubts continue over McGuinness’ health with reports that he is suffering form 
a rare condition of amyloidosis, a rare disease that affects the central 
nervous system, the heart and other vital organs.

However, McGuinness penned a column in today’s Belfast Telegraph in which he 
emphasised that his resignation and the entire crisis was “not an Orange and 
Green issue, despite attempts to paint it as such.”

The outgoing deputy first minister said the controversy over the Renewable 
Heat Incentive was rather was about allegations of “corruption” and the need 
for “the highest standards of governance.”

On these questions McGuinness said the people must have their say and election 
has to be called.

In today’s article he makes no reference though to his illness or indicate if 
he will stand for election in the Derry constituency of Foyle in that 
forthcoming contest.

As my colleague Alan Travis reports, police have confirmed that the speech 
given by Amber Rudd, the home secretary, at the Tory party conference in 
October has been officially recorded as a hate incident.Joshua Silver, an 
Oxford physics professor, complained because he thought the speech was 
anti-foreigner.

Amber Rudd speech on foreign workers recorded as hate incident

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/12/amber-rudd-speech-on-foreign-workers-recorded-as-hate-incident>
Prof Silver told the Daily Politics that he did not actually watch Rudd 
deliver the speech.

I didn’t actually see the speech but I’ve read the draft. And I’ve looked at 
all the feedback that there was to the speech. I’ve read the speech carefully 
and I’ve looked at all the feedback.

It’s discriminating against foreigners, you pick on them and say we want to 
give jobs to British people and not to foreigners. It was interpreted that way.

Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader and former home secretary, was 
also on the programme. He said Silver should he ashamed of himself.

Of course it wasn’t a hate incident. What Amber Rudd said was no different 
from Gordon Brown when he said there should be British jobs for British workers.

I think Mr Silver should be thoroughly ashamed of himself because what he’s 
doing is to bring a well-intentioned piece of legislation into disrepute. The 
meaning behind the legislation is very important, it’s meant to deal with hate 
crimes, and Mr Silver has been totally unable to justify what he’s done in the 
face of your questioning and is bringing that legislation into disrepute.

You can read all today’s Guardian political stories here. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/all>

As for the rest of the papers, here is the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must 
reads <https://www.politicshome.com/must-reads> and here is the 
ConservativeHome round-up of today’s political stories. 
<http://www.conservativehome.com/frontpage/2017/01/newslinks-for-thursday-12th-january-2017.html>

And here are two stories I found interesting.

 * Christopher Hope in the Telegraph (paywall) says Philip Hammond, the 
chancellor, took a personal stake in a food technology company just months 
before it won a share of a £560,000 government grant. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/11/exclusive-chancellor-philip-hammond-took-personal-stake-food/>
Mr Hammond, when he was Foreign Secretary, took the 15 per cent stake in 
Cambridgeshire-based Hydramach in October 2015, according to records at 
Companies House.

Months later – in April 2016 – Hydramach was one of eight companies which won 
the grant to develop low fat and low sugar soups, ready meals and sauces from 
Innovate UK, a tech start up quango run by the Department for Business.

Last night a former standards watchdog said Mr Hammond’s failure to make 
public his shareholding was “a serious failure” because “there is clearly a 
potential conflict of interest” ...

Last night Mr Hammond’s friends said Hydramach had pulled out of the 
consortium after winning the contract.

A source said Mr Hammond “didn’t know that the company had entered the 
assessment stage as part of this consortium, until after the assessment phase 
was complete.

“Mr Hammond has no involvement in his capacity as Chancellor in the process of 
awarding Innovate UK grants.”

 * Michael Savage in the Times (paywall) says the Tories are exploiting Jeremy 
Corybn’s opposition to new nuclear power in the Copeland byelection. 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tories-launch-nuclear-attack-on-corbyn-before-by-election-fcq5ttgm0>
Jeremy Corbyn’s opposition to nuclear power is being exploited by the 
Conservatives as they fight to win a crucial seat for the first time in 80 
years.

The Tories are taking advantage of the fact that election spending limits do 
not yet apply in the marginal seat of Copeland in Cumbria, which is home to the 
Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant. It will also be the site of a new 
nuclear power station that could be in place by 2024.

Parties can spend no more than £100,000 in any by-election, but the rules only 
kick in when the sitting MP resigns. While Copeland’s Labour MP James Reed has 
already announced that he is standing down, he will not officially do so until 
the end of the month, leaving parties free to spend as much as they wish until 
then.

The Tories have been campaigning hard since Christmas with dozens of MPs 
visiting the constituency. About 100 activists and ten MPs recently gathered to 
deliver leaflets there.

The Times story highlights these leaflets.

McCluskey says Coyne talking 'nonsense' about need to clean up Unite

Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has dismissed Gerard Coyne’s 
claims about the need to “clean up” the union (see 11.40am) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/12/gerard-coyne-launches-manifesto-in-unite-leadership-contest-politics-live?page=with:block-587767d3e4b0f10ba20b75ee#block-587767d3e4b0f10ba20b75ee>
 as “nonsense”. He also accused Coyne of devaluing the union’s achievements and 
of proposing to act as a “dictator” if he wins.

Here is the statement McCluskey issued about Coyne’s manifesto.

Yet again Gerard Coyne appears unaware of Unite’s rules and procedures. The 
matter of subscription rates is for the elected executive council who will make 
any decision one way or another. Members are electing a general secretary, not 
a dictator.

I also regret that Gerard continues to talk down Unite and its achievements. 
He is denying all that has been accomplished sinceUnite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite> came together, doing a disservice 
to our lay membership and rank and file activists.

Given the challenges we have met, and are to meet, this is unworthy, 
especially as he knows his claims are nonsense. Unite is an open, democratic 
and financially well-managed union.

I am proud of the many victories that have been secured in industrial disputes 
during my time in office and proud of the many landmark legal wins we have 
achieved against bad bosses, including those who have blacklisted our members 
or refused them holiday pay.

I am clear that my vision is the right one for the future of our union and for 
our members’ jobs.

I again urge Gerard Coyne to raise the tone of his campaign and focus on the 
workplace issues which Unite members care about and that he ditch his party 
political campaign managers who clearly understand little of Unite’s rules, 
role and record.

Labour urges government to build tidal lagoon power plant in Swansea Bay

Labour is urging the government to build a tidal lagoon power plant in Swansea 
Bay.

Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, backed the idea following the 
publication ofa government review,  
<https://hendryreview.wordpress.com/#content>headed by the former energy 
minister Charles Hendry, saying the government should press ahead with a tidal 
energy scheme.

Here is the Guardian’s story about the Hendry report.

Tidal lagoons 'could ensure UK power supplies'

<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/12/tidal-lagoons-could-ensure-uk-power-supplies>
Referring to the proposed project in Swansea Bay, Lewis said:

We have high hopes that tidal energy will get cheaper fast, as we’ve seen in 
other renewable technologies. The government has repeatedly delayed this 
project, despite Labour backing it months ago. It’s time to stop dithering and 
get it built.

Gerard Coyne launches his Unite leadership manifesto

Gerard Coyne does not seem to have generate huge media interest in his 
manifesto launch.
Michael Crick (@MichaelLCrick)

I'm almost only reporter herepic.twitter.com/cID0Q02S5c

 <https://twitter.com/MichaelLCrick/status/819490850879242240> 
But here goes anyway. Coyne’s manifesto is here (pdf). 
<https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/73689/pages/46/attachments/original/1484217313/manifestoDOWNLOADlowRes.pdf?1484217313>
 And it contains five main proposals.

1 - Focusing on strengthening the union, not “playing Westminster politics”.

Our current leader spends too much of his time – and your money – playing at 
Westminster politics. I will never try to be the puppet master of the Labour 
Party. The most important job is standing up for you the members, wherever you 
live and work in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Republic of 
Ireland or Gibraltar.

He says he would try to recruit more women, younger members and BME members 
and improve support for union reps.

2 - Freezing membership subscriptions

He says he would freeze membership subscriptions for two years , introduce a 
family membership and reintroduce honorary membership for long-serving retired 
members.

3 - Making skills, training and apprenticeships a priority.

He says he would invite companies Unite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite> works with to a Backing Britain 
Skills and Investment Summit, and introducing Unite-endorsed apprenticeships.

4 - Cleaning up Unite

He says he would “clean up Unite and put power back in your hands”.

Your union takes more than £150m of subscription money from members every 
year. I do not believe there is enough openness about how your money is spent, 
so I will introduce proper transparency to Unite’s finances. At the moment 
members of the union cannot see what their money is being spent on. If elected 
as general secretary I will set up a new value for money and audit committee, 
directly elected from the lay membership, to ensure you get the best value for 
your subscriptions.

5 - Promoting equality and openness

He says he would ensure the union has a zero-tolerance approach to bullying 
and discrimination.

Scottish government urges Theresa May not to implement section 40 media law

The Scottish government has urged the UK government not to implement section 
40 of the Crime and Courts Act,the provision that would mean newspapers who do 
not sign up to a government-approved regulator having to pay the costs of 
people who sue them for libel even if the newspapers win. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/10/guardian-and-ft-join-call-for-repeal-of-section-40-media-law>
 In a statement <http://news.gov.scot/news/press-regulation> Fiona Hyslop, the 
Scottish culture secretary, said:

We are committed to ensuring the practices which led to the Leveson Inquiry in 
the first place do not happen again and we believe that all individuals should 
have the ability to seek redress when they feel they have been the victim of 
press malpractice.

However, the context of press regulation in Scotland is quite distinct from 
that in England and Wales and section 40 of the crime and courts act does not 
apply under Scots law. We have not introduced statutory measures to incentivise 
participation in the regulatory system, as has happened in Westminster, and I 
can confirm we have no plans to do so.

Despite press regulation being devolved, Scottish local and national media 
could be impacted by any decision to enact section 40 in England and Wales, and 
it is my view that the measures consulted on by the UK government would put at 
risk the viability of much of our independent media, particularly local 
newspapers, and pose a potential threat to freedom of the press.

A&E waiting time performance gets worse

Here is the NHS England bulletin out today (pdf) 
<https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/Monthly-performance-statistics-summary-2016-Nov-16-FINAL.pdf>
 with the performance statistics for November 2016.

And here are some of the key points.

 * Only 88.4% of patients were dealt with at A&E within four hours, below the 
95% target. The 95% target was last hit in July 2015. 
There is a table here 
<https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/Monthly-AE-Timeseries-November-16-gfyhr.xlsx>
 that shows the figures for previous months. Here they are.

Jul 15 - 95%

Aug 15 - 94.3%

Sep 15 - 93.4%

Oct 15 - 92.3%

Nov 15 - 91.3%

Dec 15 - 91%

Jan 16 - 88.7%

Feb 16 - 87.8%

Mar 16 - 87.3%

Apr 16 - 90%

May 16 - 90.3%

Jun 16 - 90.6%

Jul 16 - 90.3%

Aug 16 - 91%

Sept 16 - 90.6%

Oct 16 - 89%

Nov - 88.4%

 * Some 1.1% of patients had to wait more than six weeks for one of 15 key 
diagnostic tests. The target, 1%, was last met in November 2013. 
 * 90.5% of patients were waiting less than 18 weeks for an operation, below 
the 92% target. 
 * Seven out of eight cancer standards were met, but only 82.3% of patients 
started treatment within 62 days of a referral from a GP - less than the 85% 
target. 
The NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> England bulletin also points 
out that hospitals are dealing with an increasing number of patients.

The long-term trend is one of greater volumes of both urgent and emergency 
care and elective activity, with A&E attendances up 4.5% [the 12 months to 
November compared with the previous 12-month period], emergency admissions up 
3.5%, diagnostic tests up 4.8% and consultant-led treatment up 4.4%.

A Democratic Unionist minister has reversed his controversial decision to cut 
an Irish language initiative in the midst of Stormont’s eco-boiler scandal, the 
Press Association reports.

Communities minister Paul Givan’s decision to cut a £50,000 bursary to pay for 
children to visit gaelic speaking communities - the Gaeltacht - infuriated Sinn 
Fein and has been seen as a key factor in the republican party’s decision to 
pull the plug on the power-sharing institutions.

In a tweet on Thursday morning, Givan said: “My decision on the Liofa Bursary 
Scheme was not a political decision. I have now identified the necessary 
funding to advance this scheme.”
Paul Givan (@paulgivan) 
My decision on the Líofa Bursary Scheme was not a political decision. I have 
now identified the necessary funding to advance this scheme.

<https://twitter.com/paulgivan/status/819466654082101248> 
The Press Association report goes on.

The shock development has been interpreted by some as a DUP olive branch to 
Sinn Fein as devolution teeters on the brink.

While the looming collapse of the ruling executive was triggered by the 
renewable heat incentive (RHI) affair - a green heating scandal that has left 
Stormont with a £490m bill - other disputes between the two main parties have 
been reignited by the furore.

One was the Irish language. 

Sinn Fein cited DUP “disrespect” toward the language as one of the main 
reasons they had walked away.

Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams branded Givan an “ignoramus” for his original 
decision to cut the bursary.

Prof Anthony King has died

Martin Kettle

Professor Anthony King, one of the undisputed giants of postwar British 
political science and a familiar face in the BBC’s live coverage of general 
election night results, has died aged 82.

Born in Canada, and arriving in Britain as a Rhodes scholar in the 1950s, King 
taught at the school of government at the University of Essex for half a 
century and never officially retired. After early collaborations on studies of 
the 1964 and 1966 general elections with David Butler, King replaced Butler as 
a fixture in BBC television’s coverage of UK general elections from 1983 to 
2005.

A born populariser and teacher, King reported and analysed Gallup opinion 
polls for the Daily Telegraph for many years, though his private political 
sympathies, though catholic and always carefully hidden, were never those of 
his employers.

King’s many books included the semi-official history of the Social Democratic 
Party, which split from Labour in 1981, in which he collaborated with his close 
friend and later Essex vice-chancellor Ivor Crewe. The two joined forces more 
recently in the best-selling 2013 study The Blunders of Our Governments.

King was a member of several significant public bodies, including the Nolan 
committee on standards in public life in 1994 and the Wakeham commission on the 
future of the House of Lords in 1999. In 2005 he chaired an inquiry on drugs 
policy for the Royal Society of Arts.

Union leadership elections tend to receive little or no attention in the 
mainstream press but this year’s Unite contest is different. Len McCluskey, the 
leftwing former docker, was first elected Unite general secretary in 2010 and 
he was re-elected comfortably in 2013. He is up for re-election again butthis 
time he is facing a more serious challenge, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/13/len-mccluskey-too-busy-running-labour-says-unite-leadership-rival>
fromGerard Coyne, Unite’s West Midlands regional secretary, who is launching 
his campaign manifesto this morning.

Unite is one of Britain two 1m-plus member super unions (the other is Unison) 
and it plays an important role in the British workplace. ButUnite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite> is also a very powerful player in 
Labour party politics, bankrolling the party, filling key seats on the national 
executive committee and exerting influence over candidate selection, and this 
leadership contest has become, at least in party, a proxy battle about Jeremy 
Corbyn. McCluskey is one of Corbyn’s strongest supporters. Coyne is arguing 
that McCluskey has been wrong to spend so much time dabbling in Labour’s 
internal politics, but he himself is seen as the candidate of the 
anti-Corbynites and a Coyne victory would be a significant defeat for the 
Corbyn project.

We will get Coyne’s manifesto later, when he launches it with a speech in 
Birmingham at 10.30am, but he set out his approach yesterdayin an article in 
the Times (paywall). 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/trade-unions-must-never-forget-who-they-work-for-jpr2rpv7z>

One of my main criticisms of Unite’s leadership is that with these huge 
challenges in front of him,Len McCluskey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/len-mccluskey> prefers to spend his time 
in office using the union’s money and resources to intervene in the running of 
the Labour Party.

I have no doubt that Unite members, and the workers Unite ought to be 
representing, would be better off under a Labour government, but it is not up 
to the General Secretary of Unite to act as Labour’s puppet master.

Tomorrow I will be launching the manifesto on which I am running to be Unite’s 
next General Secretary.

It will promise a sharper focus on the issues that matter to the membership, 
including a strong emphasis on the skills that the workforce will need to fill 
the gaps when Brexit limits the supply of skilled labour imported from the EU.

It will also promise more transparency in how Unite, the UK’s biggest union, 
uses the £150 million a year that its members contribute through their 
subscriptions, an end to the misuse of funds, and zero tolerance of bullying.

I will cover this in more detail when the launch happens.

Otherwise, it seems a relatively quiet day. But I will be covering breaking 
political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, 
comment and analysis from the web.

Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire has warned that a new election to 
the Stormont Assembly will be divisive and in danger of driving people further 
apart.

He is co-chairing talks in Belfast today with Irish foreign minister Charles 
Flanagan in a bid to defuse the crisis caused by Martin McGuinness’ resignation 
as deputy first minister and first minister Arlene Foster’s refusal to stand 
aside temporarily from her office.

Brokenshire admitted that elections are still “highly likely” despite last 
ditch efforts to try and bring the two ruling parties in the power sharing 
coalition, Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists, back together in government.

Speaking at Stormont House, the Northern Ireland Secretary said:

It is important for the parties to talk together and anything that indicates a 
move to encourage that type of discussion I take as helpful, albeit that 
position does remain serious and stark.

We are still looking at an election but we are doing everything we can as the 
two governments to work with the political parties to see if there is a way 
forward that can be found.

The 11th hour intervention of the British and Irish cabinet ministers into 
this crisis is an indication that both governments fear that the chances of 
piecing together a new power-sharing executive after the second set of 
elections in under a year may be remote given the bad blood that currently 
exists between Sinn Fein and the DUP.

It seems it is a case of too-little-too-late by the Democratic Unionist party 
in their moves to avoid another election to a new Northern Ireland assembly.

The DUP suddenly found the money today - £50,000 to be precise - for an Irish 
language bursary the party’s culture minister Paul Givan cut from his budget 
just before Christmas. (See 9.44am.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/12/gerard-coyne-launches-manifesto-in-unite-leadership-contest-politics-live?page=with:block-58774f64e4b0f10ba20b7558#block-58774f64e4b0f10ba20b7558>

Refunding the scheme which enables children from poorer backgrounds to attend 
summer courses in Gaeltacht (Irish speaking) regions of Ireland won’t persuade 
Sinn Fein to return to government and avoid what first minister Arlene Foster 
has predicted is going to be a “brutal” election.

Minister Givan tweeted this morning that he had “identified the necessary 
funding to advance” the scheme repeating his earlier insistence that he was not 
hostile to the Irish language.

But Sinn Fein insist elections are going ahead after its deputy first minister 
of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness resigned from his post earlier this week. 
Although the party cited the withdrawal of the Liofa scheme as one example of 
DUP bad faith in the power-sharing government, the principal reason for the 
pull out has been first minister Foster’s refusal to step aside temporarily 
while a public inquiry takes place into the botched green energy heating 
programme whose costs have spiralled out of control.

Doubts continue over McGuinness’ health with reports that he is suffering form 
a rare condition of amyloidosis, a rare disease that affects the central 
nervous system, the heart and other vital organs.

However, McGuinness penned a column in today’s Belfast Telegraph in which he 
emphasised that his resignation and the entire crisis was “not an Orange and 
Green issue, despite attempts to paint it as such.”

The outgoing deputy first minister said the controversy over the Renewable 
Heat Incentive was rather was about allegations of “corruption” and the need 
for “the highest standards of governance.”

On these questions McGuinness said the people must have their say and election 
has to be called.

In today’s article he makes no reference though to his illness or indicate if 
he will stand for election in the Derry constituency of Foyle in that 
forthcoming contest.
 
As my colleague Alan Travis reports, police have confirmed that the speech 
given by Amber Rudd, the home secretary, at the Tory party conference in 
October has been officially recorded as a hate incident.Joshua Silver, an 
Oxford physics professor, complained because he thought the speech was 
anti-foreigner.

Amber Rudd speech on foreign workers recorded as hate incident
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/12/amber-rudd-speech-on-foreign-workers-recorded-as-hate-incident>
Prof Silver told the Daily Politics that he did not actually watch Rudd 
deliver the speech.

I didn’t actually see the speech but I’ve read the draft. And I’ve looked at 
all the feedback that there was to the speech. I’ve read the speech carefully 
and I’ve looked at all the feedback.

It’s discriminating against foreigners, you pick on them and say we want to 
give jobs to British people and not to foreigners. It was interpreted that way.

Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader and former home secretary, was 
also on the programme. He said Silver should he ashamed of himself.

Of course it wasn’t a hate incident. What Amber Rudd said was no different 
from Gordon Brown when he said there should be British jobs for British workers.

I think Mr Silver should be thoroughly ashamed of himself because what he’s 
doing is to bring a well-intentioned piece of legislation into disrepute. The 
meaning behind the legislation is very important, it’s meant to deal with hate 
crimes, and Mr Silver has been totally unable to justify what he’s done in the 
face of your questioning and is bringing that legislation into disrepute.

And here are two stories I found interesting.

 * Christopher Hope in the Telegraph (paywall) says Philip Hammond, the 
chancellor, took a personal stake in a food technology company just months 
before it won a share of a £560,000 government grant. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/11/exclusive-chancellor-philip-hammond-took-personal-stake-food/>
Mr Hammond, when he was Foreign Secretary, took the 15 per cent stake in 
Cambridgeshire-based Hydramach in October 2015, according to records at 
Companies House.

Months later – in April 2016 – Hydramach was one of eight companies which won 
the grant to develop low fat and low sugar soups, ready meals and sauces from 
Innovate UK, a tech start up quango run by the Department for Business.

Last night a former standards watchdog said Mr Hammond’s failure to make 
public his shareholding was “a serious failure” because “there is clearly a 
potential conflict of interest” ...

Last night Mr Hammond’s friends said Hydramach had pulled out of the 
consortium after winning the contract.

A source said Mr Hammond “didn’t know that the company had entered the 
assessment stage as part of this consortium, until after the assessment phase 
was complete.

“Mr Hammond has no involvement in his capacity as Chancellor in the process of 
awarding Innovate UK grants.”

 * Michael Savage in the Times (paywall) says the Tories are exploiting Jeremy 
Corybn’s opposition to new nuclear power in the Copeland byelection. 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tories-launch-nuclear-attack-on-corbyn-before-by-election-fcq5ttgm0>
Jeremy Corbyn’s opposition to nuclear power is being exploited by the 
Conservatives as they fight to win a crucial seat for the first time in 80 
years.

The Tories are taking advantage of the fact that election spending limits do 
not yet apply in the marginal seat of Copeland in Cumbria, which is home to the 
Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant. It will also be the site of a new 
nuclear power station that could be in place by 2024.

Parties can spend no more than £100,000 in any by-election, but the rules only 
kick in when the sitting MP resigns. While Copeland’s Labour MP James Reed has 
already announced that he is standing down, he will not officially do so until 
the end of the month, leaving parties free to spend as much as they wish until 
then.

The Tories have been campaigning hard since Christmas with dozens of MPs 
visiting the constituency. About 100 activists and ten MPs recently gathered to 
deliver leaflets there.

The Times story highlights these leaflets.

Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has dismissed Gerard Coyne’s 
claims about the need to “clean up” the union (see 11.40am) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/12/gerard-coyne-launches-manifesto-in-unite-leadership-contest-politics-live?page=with:block-587767d3e4b0f10ba20b75ee#block-587767d3e4b0f10ba20b75ee>
 as “nonsense”. He also accused Coyne of devaluing the union’s achievements and 
of proposing to act as a “dictator” if he wins.

Here is the statement McCluskey issued about Coyne’s manifesto.

Yet again Gerard Coyne appears unaware of Unite’s rules and procedures. The 
matter of subscription rates is for the elected executive council who will make 
any decision one way or another. Members are electing a general secretary, not 
a dictator.

I also regret that Gerard continues to talk down Unite and its achievements. 
He is denying all that has been accomplished sinceUnite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite> came together, doing a disservice 
to our lay membership and rank and file activists.

Given the challenges we have met, and are to meet, this is unworthy, 
especially as he knows his claims are nonsense. Unite is an open, democratic 
and financially well-managed union.

I am proud of the many victories that have been secured in industrial disputes 
during my time in office and proud of the many landmark legal wins we have 
achieved against bad bosses, including those who have blacklisted our members 
or refused them holiday pay.

I am clear that my vision is the right one for the future of our union and for 
our members’ jobs.

I again urge Gerard Coyne to raise the tone of his campaign and focus on the 
workplace issues which Unite members care about and that he ditch his party 
political campaign managers who clearly understand little of Unite’s rules, 
role and record.

Labour is urging the government to build a tidal lagoon power plant in Swansea

Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, backed the idea following the

minister Charles Hendry, saying the government should press ahead with a tidal 
energy scheme.

Referring to the proposed project in Swansea Bay, Lewis said:

We have high hopes that tidal energy will get cheaper fast, as we’ve seen in 
other renewable technologies. The government has repeatedly delayed this 
project, despite Labour backing it months ago. It’s time to stop dithering and 
get it built.
 
Gerard Coyne does not seem to have generate huge media interest in his

 And it contains five main proposals.

1 - Focusing on strengthening the union, not “playing Westminster politics”.

Our current leader spends too much of his time – and your money – playing at 
Westminster politics. I will never try to be the puppet master of the Labour 
Party. The most important job is standing up for you the members, wherever you 
live and work in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Republic of 
Ireland or Gibraltar.

He says he would try to recruit more women, younger members and BME members 
and improve support for union reps.

2 - Freezing membership subscriptions

He says he would freeze membership subscriptions for two years , introduce a 
family membership and reintroduce honorary membership for long-serving retired 
members.

3 - Making skills, training and apprenticeships a priority.

He says he would invite companies Unite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite> works with to a Backing Britain 
Skills and Investment Summit, and introducing Unite-endorsed apprenticeships.

4 - Cleaning up Unite

He says he would “clean up Unite and put power back in your hands”.

Your union takes more than £150m of subscription money from members every 
year. I do not believe there is enough openness about how your money is spent, 
so I will introduce proper transparency to Unite’s finances. At the moment 
members of the union cannot see what their money is being spent on. If elected 
as general secretary I will set up a new value for money and audit committee, 
directly elected from the lay membership, to ensure you get the best value for 
your subscriptions.

5 - Promoting equality and openness

He says he would ensure the union has a zero-tolerance approach to bullying 
and discrimination.
 
The Scottish government has urged the UK government not to implement section 
40 of the Crime and Courts Act,the provision that would mean newspapers who do 
not sign up to a government-approved regulator having to pay the costs of 
people who sue them for libel even if the newspapers win. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/10/guardian-and-ft-join-call-for-repeal-of-section-40-media-law>
 In a statement <http://news.gov.scot/news/press-regulation> Fiona Hyslop, the 
Scottish culture secretary, said:

We are committed to ensuring the practices which led to the Leveson Inquiry in 
the first place do not happen again and we believe that all individuals should 
have the ability to seek redress when they feel they have been the victim of 
press malpractice.

However, the context of press regulation in Scotland is quite distinct from 
that in England and Wales and section 40 of the crime and courts act does not 
apply under Scots law. We have not introduced statutory measures to incentivise 
participation in the regulatory system, as has happened in Westminster, and I 
can confirm we have no plans to do so.

Despite press regulation being devolved, Scottish local and national media 
could be impacted by any decision to enact section 40 in England and Wales, and 
it is my view that the measures consulted on by the UK government would put at 
risk the viability of much of our independent media, particularly local 
newspapers, and pose a potential threat to freedom of the press.

Here is the NHS England bulletin out today (pdf) 
<https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/Monthly-performance-statistics-summary-2016-Nov-16-FINAL.pdf>
 with the performance statistics for November 2016.

And here are some of the key points.

 * Only 88.4% of patients were dealt with at A&E within four hours, below the 
95% target. The 95% target was last hit in July 2015. 
There is a table here 
<https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/Monthly-AE-Timeseries-November-16-gfyhr.xlsx>
 that shows the figures for previous months. Here they are.

Jul 15 - 95%

Aug 15 - 94.3%

Sep 15 - 93.4%

Oct 15 - 92.3%

Nov 15 - 91.3%

Dec 15 - 91%

Jan 16 - 88.7%

Feb 16 - 87.8%

Mar 16 - 87.3%

Apr 16 - 90%

May 16 - 90.3%

Jun 16 - 90.6%

Jul 16 - 90.3%

Aug 16 - 91%

Sept 16 - 90.6%

Oct 16 - 89%

Nov - 88.4%

 * Some 1.1% of patients had to wait more than six weeks for one of 15 key 
diagnostic tests. The target, 1%, was last met in November 2013. 
 * 90.5% of patients were waiting less than 18 weeks for an operation, below 
the 92% target. 
 * Seven out of eight cancer standards were met, but only 82.3% of patients 
started treatment within 62 days of a referral from a GP - less than the 85% 
target. 
The NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> England bulletin also points 
out that hospitals are dealing with an increasing number of patients.

The long-term trend is one of greater volumes of both urgent and emergency 
care and elective activity, with A&E attendances up 4.5% [the 12 months to 
November compared with the previous 12-month period], emergency admissions up 
3.5%, diagnostic tests up 4.8% and consultant-led treatment up 4.4%.
 
The latest figures from NHS England show that only 88.4% of A&E patients in 
November were dealt with within four hours,Sky News reports. 
<http://news.sky.com/story/ae-departments-failing-to-hit-waiting-times-nhs-england-figures-show-10725757>
 The target is 95%.

I will post more on this when I have looked in detail at the figures.

A Democratic Unionist minister has reversed his controversial decision to cut 
an Irish language initiative in the midst of Stormont’s eco-boiler scandal, the 
Press Association reports.

Communities minister Paul Givan’s decision to cut a £50,000 bursary to pay for 
children to visit gaelic speaking communities - the Gaeltacht - infuriated Sinn 
Fein and has been seen as a key factor in the republican party’s decision to 
pull the plug on the power-sharing institutions.

In a tweet on Thursday morning, Givan said: “My decision on the Liofa Bursary 
Scheme was not a political decision. I have now identified the necessary 
funding to advance this scheme.”

The Press Association report goes on.

The shock development has been interpreted by some as a DUP olive branch to 
Sinn Fein as devolution teeters on the brink.

While the looming collapse of the ruling executive was triggered by the 
renewable heat incentive (RHI) affair - a green heating scandal that has left 
Stormont with a £490m bill - other disputes between the two main parties have 
been reignited by the furore.

One was the Irish language. 

Sinn Fein cited DUP “disrespect” toward the language as one of the main 
reasons they had walked away.

Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams branded Givan an “ignoramus” for his original 
decision to cut the bursary.
 
Professor Anthony King, one of the undisputed giants of postwar British 
political science and a familiar face in the BBC’s live coverage of general 
election night results, has died aged 82.

Born in Canada, and arriving in Britain as a Rhodes scholar in the 1950s, King 
taught at the school of government at the University of Essex for half a 
century and never officially retired. After early collaborations on studies of 
the 1964 and 1966 general elections with David Butler, King replaced Butler as 
a fixture in BBC television’s coverage of UK general elections from 1983 to 
2005.

A born populariser and teacher, King reported and analysed Gallup opinion 
polls for the Daily Telegraph for many years, though his private political 
sympathies, though catholic and always carefully hidden, were never those of 
his employers.

King’s many books included the semi-official history of the Social Democratic 
Party, which split from Labour in 1981, in which he collaborated with his close 
friend and later Essex vice-chancellor Ivor Crewe. The two joined forces more 
recently in the best-selling 2013 study The Blunders of Our Governments.

King was a member of several significant public bodies, including the Nolan 
committee on standards in public life in 1994 and the Wakeham commission on the 
future of the House of Lords in 1999. In 2005 he chaired an inquiry on drugs 
policy for the Royal Society of Arts.

Union leadership elections tend to receive little or no attention in the 
mainstream press but this year’s Unite contest is different. Len McCluskey, the 
leftwing former docker, was first elected Unite general secretary in 2010 and 
he was re-elected comfortably in 2013. He is up for re-election again butthis 
time he is facing a more serious challenge, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/13/len-mccluskey-too-busy-running-labour-says-unite-leadership-rival>
fromGerard Coyne, Unite’s West Midlands regional secretary, who is launching 
his campaign manifesto this morning.

Unite is one of Britain two 1m-plus member super unions (the other is Unison) 
and it plays an important role in the British workplace. ButUnite 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite> is also a very powerful player in 
Labour party politics, bankrolling the party, filling key seats on the national 
executive committee and exerting influence over candidate selection, and this 
leadership contest has become, at least in party, a proxy battle about Jeremy 
Corbyn. McCluskey is one of Corbyn’s strongest supporters. Coyne is arguing 
that McCluskey has been wrong to spend so much time dabbling in Labour’s 
internal politics, but he himself is seen as the candidate of the 
anti-Corbynites and a Coyne victory would be a significant defeat for the 
Corbyn project.

We will get Coyne’s manifesto later, when he launches it with a speech in 
Birmingham at 10.30am, but he set out his approach yesterdayin an article in 
the Times (paywall). 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/trade-unions-must-never-forget-who-they-work-for-jpr2rpv7z>

One of my main criticisms of Unite’s leadership is that with these huge 
challenges in front of him,Len McCluskey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/len-mccluskey> prefers to spend his time 
in office using the union’s money and resources to intervene in the running of 
the Labour Party.

I have no doubt that Unite members, and the workers Unite ought to be 
representing, would be better off under a Labour government, but it is not up 
to the General Secretary of Unite to act as Labour’s puppet master.

Tomorrow I will be launching the manifesto on which I am running to be Unite’s 
next General Secretary.

It will promise a sharper focus on the issues that matter to the membership, 
including a strong emphasis on the skills that the workforce will need to fill 
the gaps when Brexit limits the supply of skilled labour imported from the EU.

It will also promise more transparency in how Unite, the UK’s biggest union, 
uses the £150 million a year that its members contribute through their 
subscriptions, an end to the misuse of funds, and zero tolerance of bullying.

I will cover this in more detail when the launch happens.

Otherwise, it seems a relatively quiet day. But I will be covering breaking 
political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, 
comment and analysis from the web.
