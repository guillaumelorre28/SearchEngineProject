St Thomas à Becket, Fairfield, Kent


In a flat, lonely corner of Romney Marsh, this church is blessed with an 
atmospheric beauty that is only enhanced by its desolate surroundings. The 
steeply pitched red-tiled roof of the nave, topped by a bell-cote that 
resembles a castle turret, marks the building out from the common stock. If it 
looks familiar it may be because it featured in the recent television and 
cinema adaptations of Dickens’ Great Expectations. The church today is the 
result of many piecemeal building efforts but, overall, it is how it would have 
looked in the 18th century. By rights, it shouldn’t be here at all. Fairfield 
has always had an atomised population and so its church was built with the idea 
that it might not be needed for very long. Thus a small lath-and-plaster 
structure was first thrown up on this spot at some time around 1200.

In January 1942, the small, northerly isle of Lamb Holm became home to some of 
the 1,200 Italian soldiers brought to Orkney. Although the prisoners built 
themselves a theatre and a recreation hut, they lacked a chapel. After some 
gentle cajoling, the camp padre with the artist,Domenico Chiocchetti 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/18/in-praise-of-domenico-chiocchetti-orkney>
, got the prisoners permission to erect a chapel from two Nissen huts, joined 
end to end. Visit the chapel today and you’ll see what an extraordinary job the 
Italian soldiers did – they plasterboarded the huts, fashioned an altar out of 
concrete and installed windows filled with painted glass. Chioccetti himself 
painted the sanctuary and his Madonna and Child altarpiece is the chapel’s 
crowning glory. In 1960, the BBC paid for him to freshen up his masterpiece. He 
returned four years later, this time bearing a gift of 14 stations of the 
cross, which can still be seen in the chapel.

Tucked away in a side street, this one-roomed Medieval gate church is often 
overlooked by visitors. It’s place of surprising quietude in the heart of 
throbbing Winchester and has provided a place of sanctuary for over 750 years. 
The first record of it is in a 1264 report detailing its burning down by angry 
citizens during a dispute with the local priory. It was rebuilt as a parish 
church in 1539, when the monastery at Winchester was dissolved by Henry VIII. 
Before climbing the covered staircase up to the church, have a look at the 
battlements on the walls – though a holy building, this was still part of a 
defensive structure. Being on top of a city gate is quite special but being one 
of the very rare surviving medieval city gate churches adds lustre to the 
experience.

The smallest working church in England, and arguably the strangest, St 
Fursey’s is a modern-day labour of love. It’s built in the garden belonging to 
its priest, Father Stephen Weston. The story began in 1998 when Father Stephen, 
disillusioned with the Anglican Church in which he had served as a vicar for 20 
years, left to join the Antiochan Orthodox church. There being no 
English-speaking Orthodox church in the district, he immediately set about 
constructing one out of plywood, measuring just 18ft x 13ft. Basing the design 
on an almost equally small 4th-century church at Silchester in Hampshire, with 
the help of volunteers he completed the building within six months at a cost of 
around £5,000.

Odda’s Chapel would never have been identified as a Saxon place of worship had 
it not been for two things: the discovery of the ancient Odda Stone in 1675 
near the parish church and local vicar the Rev George Butterworth’s resolve to 
turn detective. A Latin inscription on the stone said the chapel was built and 
dedicated by Earl Odda for his brother, Aelfric, in 1056 but it couldn’t be 
referring to the existing parish church, which is a much earlier building. In 
1885, when repairs were done to a local house, the vicar discovered an altar 
stone which confirmed he’d found the site of the chapel. As far as is known, it 
has only ever been part of a home and now consists of a nave and chancel 
divided by an arch, with a doorway in the north wall and minimal furnishings.

This little chapel stands on Inner Farne, the biggest island of the group, and 
is one of the few remaining physical links to the area’s monastic past. Former 
shepherdboy and prior Cuthbert arrived in 676, spent a short spell as bishop of 
Holy Island, and returned to Inner Farne to die in 687. The 14th-century 
chapel, much restored in the 1800s, is dedicated to him. But this is a visit 
for twitchers – the island is teeming with birdlife, including puffins, 
guillemots, shags, cormorants, razorbills, eiders and Arctic terns, among 
numerous others. It’s fitting, given all this avian activity, that when St 
Cuthbert lived here he laid down decrees protecting the island’s birds. To this 
day, eiders are known in Northumberland as “cuddy ducks” (from “Cuthbert’s 
ducks”).

Poor old St Mary’s cuts a rather lonely figure, sitting in a boggy Yorkshire 
field. It wasn’t ever thus. Built in the 14th century, this private chapel to a 
manor house was an opulent place twice its current size, with a gilded ceiling 
and a large chancel at the east end. Now it is is a plain rectangle with an 
empty stone bell-cote and no church yard but it’s the floor that holds the 
church’s greatest treasures. Some of the huge grave slabs, bearing heraldic 
symbols, are actually older than the building itself, going back to a time of 
knights and chivalrous deeds. But the church will always be associated with the 
Battle of Towton, the bloodiest battle of the War of the Roses, which took 
place on Palm Sunday 1461 and it is the only building on or around the 
battlefield that remains standing.

The “tin tabernacles” were arbingers of the mass-produced, flat-packed world 
we inhabit today, and were once viewed as a godsend by Victorian vicars in 
rapidly expanding industrial areas whose churches were full to bursting. Only 
around 60 of the myriad erected in Scotland have made still stand – this one 
was built in 1876 by the 7th Earl of Breadalbane as a chapel of ease for his 
shooting parties (its nickname is the “Grouse Chapel”), and it is the oldest 
and most beautifully preserved survivor. The metallic exterior of the church 
belies what is inside. Pine-clad walls give the place a Scandinavian air, and 
its numerous short wooden pews make it seem larger than it is. The altar is 
made of carved and painted wood and the ornate altar rail is from the 
demolished chapel at Taymouth Castle in Kenmore. The scene is completed by a 
circular stained-glass window above the altar.

This little chapel is perched halfway down a Pembrokeshire cliff beside a holy 
well – and its extraordinary location, plus its very early and uncertain 
genesis, has made it a thing of folklore. There is a simple nave measuring 
about 17ft x 12ft, with an opening to a rough cell beyond. General consensus 
dates it to between the 11th and 13th centuries, with a 6th-century original 
chapel a possibility. Inside, it appears to be an empty shell of rough stones, 
green with mould. However, features emerge, including an opening for the spring 
on the floor, with a long bench, a piscina and a plain stone altar. Pass 
through the doorway in the west wall to explore the remainder of the elderly St 
Govan’s domain. The well has run dry and so any curative qualities of its 
waters have been lost but, happily, the tranquillity found in this place is 
still balm for the soul.

Tucked back from the promenade, this chapel measures just 8ft by 11ft inside 
and looks more like a stone shed. The first building to have stood on this spot 
was a cell constructed by the saint himself in the 6th century. He established 
his little enclosure around a well, which attracted the sick and the lame 
hoping for a miraculous cure. The stone-and-mortar chapel is mostly of 16th or 
17th century origin but, by the 1890s, it was in a bit of state and was 
comprehensively restored. Inside, the low, whitewashed barrel-vaulted ceiling 
and rough stone floor lend the place the quality of a grotto, enhanced by 
little ceramic items and other offerings left by visitors. Other than that, 
there are about half a dozen chairs, a shelf/altar and there’s sometimes a 
candle burning in front of the small wooden cross.
