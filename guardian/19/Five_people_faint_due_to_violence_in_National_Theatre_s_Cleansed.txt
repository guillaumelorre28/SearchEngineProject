Five people have fainted watching the graphic scenes of torture, rape and 
violence in the National Theatre’s latest production while 40 walked out in the 
show’s first week.

Cleansed, written by Sarah Kane and directed by Katie Mitchell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/24/cleansed-review-katie-mitchell-sarah-kane-dorfman-national-theatre-london>
, is a punishing story of a university that is turned into a sadistic 
totalitarian institution.

The revival of the production features characters being electrocuted, 
force-fed and tortured – including the removal of one character’s tongue 20 
minutes into the play – which has proved too much for dozens of audience 
members during the first six performances.

Five others were so overwhelmed they fainted and required medical attention. 
During one preview, the lights in the auditorium went up and ushers came into 
the audience to help a man who had collapsed.

Cleansed was first staged at the Royal Court in 1998, the year before Kane 
killed herself aged 28

Despite her radical influence, this is the first time one of her plays has been 
staged at the National theatre- a debut the National Theatre artistic director 
Rufus Norris has said is “long overdue”.


Mitchell 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/14/british-theatre-queen-exile-katie-mitchell>
 admitted the production had taken its toll on the cast, who all had “very 
strange nightmares where very extreme events take place”. She told Radio 4: “We 
have to laugh a lot in order to balance the despair and the darkness of the 
material.”

But she argued people’s shock at the violent production was also related to 
the fact it was written by a young woman. “There isn’t a big tradition of 
putting the violence of atrocity on stage in Britain,” she said. “We’re afraid 
of that dark female voice that insists we examine pornography and violence. We 
just don’t feel comfortable being asked to do those things, particularly by a 
woman.”

The production’s unpalatable nature has not been a hit with critics. The Daily 
Mail gave it just one star, accusing it of gratuitous violence, while the 
Guardian’s theatre critic, Michael Billington, said: “For all the play’s 
visceral power, it left me feeling drained rather than shocked into new 
awareness.”

Kane was propelled to notoriety in 1995 after her first production, Blasted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jan/12/kate-ashfield-sarah-kane-blasted>
, at the Royal Court, prompted newspapers and critics todenounce the 
“atrocities” and “feats of filth” on display 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/jan/12/sarah-kane-blasted-was-dismissed-by-critics>
. She went on to write just four more plays- Phaedra’s Love (1996), Cleansed 
(1998),Crave 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/may/18/crave-illusions-review> (1998) 
and4.48 Psychosis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/15/448-psychosis-sheffield-crucible-review>
 (1999)- before she killed herself. Kane’s struggles with severe depression 
often fed into her work.

On its first staging in 1998, Cleansed was the most expensive production in 
the Royal Court’s history. Kanesaid it had been inspired 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/oct/28/theatre.stage> by Roland 
Barthes’ writing which compared being in love to being in Auschwitz.

Similar to Mitchell’s revival of the play, the first outing of Cleansed in 
1998 divided critics. John Gross, writing for the Daily Telegraph, said: “The 
play is miserable stuff - which is not to say, current fashions being what they 
are, that I can’t foreseeSarah Kane <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kane> 
enjoying a successful career.”
