Oakland is changing fast. Once known merely as San Francisco’s rough-and-tough 
neighbour – the birthplace of the Black Panther movement and home of the Hell’s 
Angels – it is rapidly becoming the most fashionable place in northern 
California. Those who can’t afford the tech-boom prices across the Bay are 
making their home in the city and, greeted by an array of new restaurants and 
bars, a thriving arts scene, and a strong sense of energy and community. 
Gertrude Stein might have said about her childhood hometown that “There is no 
there there”, but, these days, Oakland’s residents and visitors are more likely 
to shout “Come here here!”

Unlike 21st-century San Francisco, Oakland hasn’t been emptied of its soul by 
money and gentrification. It’s valued for its cultural and class diversity – 
150 languages are spoken within its borders – and the locals’ pride in their 
town is infectious. There’s lots to brag about: as well as offering the 
glimmering ocean and wonderful Redwood forest hikes, and the sun is often 
shining here even as the chill fog rolls in over San Francisco.

Starting 12 May, there are direct, cheap flights to Oakland from London 
Gatwick withNorwegian 
<http://www.norwegian.com/uk/?gclid=CIvEs6rB1MwCFdgaGwoduJkIWw> that make a 
trip to the “Brooklyn by the Bay” easier. And, should you have more time, 
there’s always that other pretty good city to visit 30 minutes away, across the 
bridge.

Oakland has more than its fair share of cinemas in the lovely “moderne” style, 
with bright, curved neon signs. At theGrand Lake Theater 
<http://www.renaissancerialto.com/> (3200 Grand Ave) on Friday and Saturday 
evenings, an old Wurlitzer rises to usher in the films. Almost anything can be 
seen at the magnificent early-30s 3,000-seaterParamount 
<http://www.paramounttheatre.com/> (2025 Broadway) – from classical music, jazz 
and stand-up comedy, to golden-age movie faves like The Wizard of Oz. Downtown, 
the ornate, historicFox Theater <http://www.thefoxoakland.com/> (1807 Telegraph 
Ave) has come out of its 40-year hibernation to become a much-loved music venue.

 Shops in Oakland’s Temescal neighbourhood. Photograph: Alamy 
In the hip (and still a bit gritty) Temescal neighbourhood are two pedestrian 
streets that will satisfy most cravings for things handmade or vintage. 
Standouts areEsqueleto <http://shopesqueleto.com/> for jewellery, Book/Shop 
<http://www.shopbookshop.com/> for trinket treasures and Ali Golden 
<http://www.aligolden.com/>, a studio-store, with a sewing machine at its 
centre, selling bespoke designs. Those in need of a hipster beard trim will 
find thecelebrated barber shop 
<http://www.temescalalleybarbershop.com/home.html> there right up their alley 
(off 49th Street).

Piedmont Avenue and the main thoroughfare of Rockridge are crammed with good 
shops, while just down the road into Berkeley, Oakland’s other famous 
neighbouring city,Berkeley Bowl <http://berkeleybowl.com/deli> (2020 Oregon St) 
is – thanks to its range, quality and character – one of the best food shops 
anywhere. Special mention should be made ofOaklandish (1444 Broadway) 
<http://oaklandish.com/>, a store that promotes civic pride in its specially 
made clothes and accessories.

Fairyland <http://fairyland.org/> ($10), which takes up 10 acres on the shores 
of Lake Merritt, is the oldest themed amusement park in the US and was the 
inspiration for Disneyland. Aimed at young children, its play-sets and gentle 
rides are based on Alice in Wonderland, Peter Rabbit and so on; there’s a 
puppet show, too. While hardly state-of-the-art, it’s a charming space. My kids 
also liked grabbing a piece of cardboard and shimmying down the grass slopes at 
its centre.

The Oakland museum <http://museumca.org/> (pictured) exhibiting all things 
Californian, is a low-rise, modernist delight with a laid-back vibe: when I was 
last there, we didn’t get past the panning for gold, dressing up and scuttling 
turtles in the garden.

The city also has its own excellent zoo <http://www.oaklandzoo.org/> (adults 
$17.75, children over two $13.75), which sits up in the hills and has a 
sky-ride that offers memorable views over the Bay towards the Golden Gate 
Bridge and the San Francisco skyline, and down at the giraffes and lions below.

Go Warriors!

 Fans celebrate as the Warriors win at Oracle Arena. Photograph: Alamy 
Oakland is home of the current NBA champions, the Golden State Warriors 
<http://www.nba.com/warriors/tickets>. And this season, as they go into the 
play-offs, they are playing even better, having just broken the record (held by 
Michael Jordan’s mighty Chicago Bulls) for most wins in a regular basketball 
season. The local excitement surrounding what’s going on is immense. Play-off 
tickets will be almost impossible to come by, but if you’re here next season 
(from October-April 2017) beg, buy or steal a ticket for a game at the 
20,000-seatOracle Arena <http://www.nba.com/warriors/tickets> (from $70), 
nicknamed the “Roaracle” because of the fan noise: it will be unforgettable.

Celebration of the arts

For 10 years, on the first Friday of each month, Oakland’s galleries have 
organised an art walk to showcase the creativity of the city. Now called theArt 
Murmur <http://oaklandartmurmur.org/> , it takes in over 40 locations, and 
alongside it has evolved a popular street festival –First Fridays 
<http://www.oaklandfirstfridays.org/> (oaklandfirstfridays.org) – that features 
performances, food trucks and pop-up installations. Essentially, it’s a monthly 
party with a diverse crowd filling a five-block stretch of Telegraph Avenue, 
listening to hip-hop (which has deep roots in Oakland), a brass band, drums or 
whatever is going down.

Its rather bleak industrial West Oakland location seems highly unlikely, but 
then you see the long queue. This soul-food restaurant has become a city 
landmark; at weekends, there’s a piano player outside to entertain the hungry 
customers waiting for its breakfasts and lunches (no evening meals are served). 
Its classic dish is buttermilk fried chicken and cornmeal waffles with 
apple-cider syrup – cider meaning juice – but it’s also renowned for down-home 
barbecue shrimp and poached eggs with grits.

Camino 

All the food in this “Cali-Med-Asian” (read anything goes) establishment is 
cooked by wood fire in the open kitchen. It has few frills and is relaxed, with 
communal tables and no tips, but the dishes (conceived by a chef who worked for 
20 years at Berkeley’s world-famousChez Panisse 
<http://www.chezpanisse.com/reservations/>) now have a national reputation. I 
chose smoked black cod, oyster and green-garlic stew with creme fraiche; 
wood-oven roasted whole rockfish with kale; and fig-leaf ice-cream – but the 
menu changes constantly.

four blocks away from the Oakland border). Fenton’s has been a fixture since 
1894 and is famous for its sundaes. It has a sit-down restaurant, but I’ve 
always stuck to the alarmingly sized ice-cream creations (“HUGE scoops,” the 
menu boasts, “and we mean HUGE”): perhaps try a Berry Go Round or a Saddleback 
Brownie, or maybe a coffee cookie dream milkshake.

for its many Ethiopian restaurants, notablyEnsarro <http://www.enssaro.com/>

This shack-like place near the waterfront opened on 1883, and was a regular 
hangout of writer Jack London. Its name comes from being the first-and-last 
chance for ferry passengers to grab a drink. The floor is tilted at a steepish 
angle, thanks to the 1906 earthquake, so don’t immediately assume you’ve had 
one too many. It’s on Jack London Square, one of the most spruced-up districts 
of the city, with bars and eateries, as well as a farmer’s market, outdoor 
movies and kayaking in the Bay.

Not for nothing were the cocktails at this uptown establishment voted the best 
in the East Bay (last year, in the East Bay Express). An example of their fare: 
the John Chapman, made with bourbon, apple juice, ginger and pear eau de vie. 
The bar food is highly praised, too. For cocktails,Make Westing bar 
<http://makewesting.com/> also deserves a mention (1741 Telegraph Ave), as does 
Mua <http://www.muaoakland.com/> (2442a Webster St), which is good for dancing.

This eccentric establishment was around long before the renaissance of 
Oakland’s uptown, and remains a favourite, with an atmosphere described as a 
“carnivalesque utopia”. The decor features swords, brass sculptures, art deco 
artefacts, the bell from a boxing ring and a polar bear’s head – but the drinks 
make more sense, and there’s late-night music, too.

Oakland’s hotels (aside from the Marriott and its ilk) are thin on the ground, 
perhaps becauseairbnb dominates the accommodation scene 
<https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/Oakland--CA?s_tag=6P5VaQi7>. The city’s renewal has 
coincided with rise of Airbnb, which was founded across the water less than a 
decade ago. But the three-star Waterfront, near Jack London Square, is 
dolled-up with some nautical charm, and has an outdoor pool for those sunny 
Oakland days. It’s part of a “boutique” hotel chain.

 A Bed and Breakfast on Fairmount, Oakland, California. from 
http://www.abedandbreakfastonfairmount.com 
This three-bedroom bolthole in an arts and crafts-style house comes with 
hill-top views. It’s hard to argue with a friendly welcome, fresh eggs for 
breakfast from the hens in the garden, a nice garden and a porch.
