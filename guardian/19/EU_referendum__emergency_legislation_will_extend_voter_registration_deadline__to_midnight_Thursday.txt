Afternoon summary

 * The deadline for registering to vote in the EU referendum is to be extended 
to midnight on Thursday as Whitehall scrambles to recover from the collapse of 
a government website. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/08/jeremy-corbyn-calls-eu-referendum-voter-deadline-extension>
 * Rob Wainwright, director of Europol, has rejected claims from Vote Leave 
that staying in the EU would endanger the UK.(See 4.26pm.)

He said: 
It is dangerous to assume that, by putting at risk UK’s access to unique 
information sharing and other operational arrangements in the EU, the country 
would become safer from terrorism. I share the opinion of recent heads of MI5, 
MI6 and GCHQ that the reverse is true.

In my job I see how the European arrest warrant, the Schengen information 
system and Europol, for example, have become increasingly important to the UK 
in protecting its people from terrorism. Alongside our work with US partners 
and the intelligence community the EU has become vital for Britain’s security 
interests.

 * William Hague, the former foreign secretary, has said leaving the European 
Union risks the “fragmentation of the western world”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/08/william-hague-leaving-eu-risks-fragmenting-western-world>
 * Tony Blair has launched his strongest attack yet on Jeremy Corbyn, for 
condemning the war in Iraq but standing by while the Syrian people were 
barrel-bombed. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/08/tony-blair-accuses-jeremy-corbyn-of-standing-by-as-syria-is-bombed>
 * Jeremy Corbyn sought to exploit Tory divisions over the effect of leaving 
the EU on workers’ rights during prime minister’s questions, highlighting 
pro-Brexit ministers’ statements on “reducing the burden” on employers of EU 
protection for workers.

And, while we’re on the subject of Michael Gove, Tristram Hunt, the Labour MP 
and former shadow education secretary, launched a strong attack on himin a 
speech this morning to the European Council of Foreign Relations. 
<http://www.tristramhunt.com/europeanpivot> Hunt said:

Michael Gove <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> seems to 
believe that applying the “creative destruction” logic of his school reforms to 
an entire continent is somehow an act of great liberal statesmanship. I could 
not disagree more. In fact, I think it indicates a chilling lack of judgement.

Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> is facing Russian 
militarism for the first time since the Cold War. Fascism, red in tooth and 
claw, for the first time since the fall of Franco.

Brexit as Gove and his ilk see it is not a “liberation movement” for the 
people of Europe - it is the act of a deranged relative pouring petrol over an 
already smouldering fire.

To walk away from Europe now, in its latest hour of need, would be an entirely 
self-defeating dereliction of our duty and history.

Hunt, a historian, also accused the Leave camp of misunderstanding British 
history. He said:

Whether it is our military, our diplomatic corps, our language, or our BBC, 
Britain’s history and traditions all point towards a country that takes an 
active role in the world. An outward looking nation at ease with its status as 
a bastion of western, liberal, democratic ideals.

This is what many voices in the Vote Leave campaign completely fail to 
understand. They say, ‘Let the world take care of itself’. But the modern world 
simply doesn’t allow for such detachment.

Even at the supposed high points of our glorious past, Britain was deeply 
enmeshed in Continental alliances. Victory at the Battle of Waterloo was the 
product of a British-Prussian-Dutch-Swedish-Russian alliance.

When Salisbury was accused of pursuing a policy of ‘splendid isolation’ in the 
late 19th century, the British government was, in fact, firmly committed to 
various European partnerships.

The argument coming from the heart of Vote Leave is the politics of defeat and 
the philosophy of decline.

Britain shouldn’t be leaving Europe. Britain should be leading Europe. 
Reshaping our continent’s destiny towards a more open, liberal, democratic, 
freer, fairer, stronger and more socially just future.

Gove says EU should protest about Turkey, not appease it

At the same Vote Leave event Michael Gove, the justice secretary, said in a 
speech 
<http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/gove_and_raab_eu_membership_makes_us_less_safe?utm_content=buffer6bf90&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer>
 that, instead of allowing Turkey to enjoy visa-free travel in the Schengen 
area, the EU should be protesting about the suppression of freedom of speech in 
Turkey.

There are particular times when the assertion of our liberalism needs to be 
especially muscular.

Nowhere more so than when the essential freedom - freedom of speech - is 
threatened.

Which brings me to the case of Turkey.

That country’s democratic development has been put into reverse under 
President Erdogan.

The country which achieved so much under the secular nationalism of Ataturk 
and his successors is now moving backwards under Erdogan and his Islamist rule.

The NGO Freedom House has found that freedom of expression is being 
‘undermined by provisions in the penal code, the criminal procedure code, and 
the harsh, broadly worded anti-terrorism law’.

Journalists who seek to expose corruption have been arrested and efforts to 
investigate Turkish relationships with fighters in Syria have been thwarted.

Erdogan’s assault on free speech doesn’t stop at his own borders.

Erdogan demanded - and won - Angela Merkel’s agreement to the prosecution of 
the German comedian Jan Böhmermann for producing a lewd poem about him.

We and the European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> should be 
protesting in the clearest and loudest possible manner at this erosion of 
fundamental democratic freedoms ...

With the terrorism threat we face only growing, it is hard to see how it could 
possibly be in our security interests to open visa free travel to 77 million 
Turkish citizens and create a border-free zone from Iraq, Iran and Syria to the 
English Channel.

It is even harder to see how such a course is wise when extremists everywhere 
will see that the West is opening its borders to appease an Islamist government.

Raab says EU and ECJ are 'clear and present danger to our security'

Dominic Raab, the justice minister, gave a Vote Leave speech this morning 
<http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/gove_and_raab_eu_membership_makes_us_less_safe?utm_content=buffer6bf90&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer>
 in which he described the EU and the European court of justice as as “clear 
and present danger to our security”.

He explained:

At the moment, we can’t bar anyone in possession of an EU passport or identity 
card unless they represent a “genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat” 
to our security.

There’s two points here.


First we are forced to rely on other EU government’s putting in place proper 
controls.

And yet we already have a very serious problem with other EU states 
undermining proper border controls and effective passport checks.

We have to admit EU citizens with residence cards, even though Frontex, the 
EU’s own external border agency, says these documents are forged on a 
systematic basis.

The European Court has prevented us requiring persons from the EU to have 
documents issued by our government to come to the UK.

EU law even forbids us from automatically refusing entry to people without any 
travel documents at all.

But this is only the start of the problem.


On your chair is a photocopy of a Cyprus estate agent journal, advertised 
particularly to Russians as the Russian text shows.

This shows open, flagrant selling of EU passports.


Once people buy these EU passports and with it citizenship of an EU member 
state, they have the automatic right to come to the UK because of ‘free 
movement’.

Given this is already happening at scale, imagine how much worse this problem 
will be after the next wave of EU accessions.

The second point concerns the substantive EU test for denial of entry and 
deportation.


Even if that high threshold – a genuine, serious, present threat to our 
security - is met, we have to disclose the reasons to the individual barred,

Even if that itself could endanger national security.

We can’t just deny entry to someone, because they made an unexplained trip to 
Syria,


Or because sketchy intelligence suggests a link to terrorist activity.

We can’t even bar people from coming in, solely because they have a criminal 
record, even for murder.

Yes, in the past ten years since the free movement directive entered into 
force, we have refused entry to around 11,000 people coming from the EU.


But that compares with more than 200,000 barred from outside Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>,

Who can be excluded simply because their presence is deemed not conducive to 
the public good ...

It is now the EU and the Luxembourg court that present the clear and present 
danger to our security.

They put their ivory tower dogma of EU free movement ahead of the safety of 
our citizens.

This is from the Spectator’s James Forsyth. 
James Forsyth (@JGForsyth) 
Senior figures on Leave side think someone deliberately crashed electoral 
registration site. Say traffic level at 10.15pm implausibly high
 <https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/status/740551586339000322> June 8, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/status/740551586339000322> 
I have not heard this, but I have heard figures on the Leave said say they 
think the government is trying to use the voter registration mess to “extend 
the franchise”. Leave figures think that at most 50,000 people were unable to 
register to vote last night and that the government is dragging out the 
registration process for another 48 hours, and giving it maximum publicity 
today, to get more young people to register. Young people are more likely than 
old people to be unregistered, and more likely than old people to vote Remain 
if they do register.

Peter Walker

The Green MP Caroline Lucas has responded to Owen Paterson’s speech. She said:

I’m as likely to ask Donald Trump for advice on race relations as I am to trust
Owen Paterson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-paterson> on 
protecting our environment.

The simple fact is that the EU has been essential for environmental protection 
and that Owen Paterson is wrong to say that ‘environmentalism works best at 
local level’ – in fact it only works if problems are tackled at every level.

Challenges like air pollution, sewage in the seas and threats to migrating 
species don’t queue up politely at national borders, waiting for their 
passports to be checked. Indeed if we didn’t have the EU to bring together 
countries to work on these issues, then we’d have to invent it all over again.

EU is bad for the environment, Paterson says

Peter Walker

I’ve just watched the former environment secretary, Owen Paterson, make a 
speech which, according to the advance billing, would “tear apart the EU’s 
record on the environment”. That was a tough brief, but he did his best, 
arguing that the EU imposed too many “one size fits all” green remedies on 
countries. He was scathing about the idea that a vote for Remain was a vote for 
nature.

“It is nothing of the sort,” Paterson said.

A vote for the EU is a vote for the continuation of the remote, insensitive 
bureaucracy that insists on deciding everything on a continental level, 
ignoring local environmental conditions and imposing clumsy regulations on 
matters which should be decided at the level of the nation state or below.

It was certainly a wide-ranging speech, taking in the great crested newt 
(Paterson says these are not threatened in the UK and so don’t need protection 
here), South Georgia (he sees the island’s environmental policies as a future 
model for Britain) and the Pitcairn Islands (the UK has recently created the 
world’s largest marine reserve around them).

It also contained what is certainly the best quote of the campaign so far 
about the EU’s fisheries policy: “The sheer insanity of this is 
incomprehensible unless you see it yourself, with a haddock in your hand.”

I seemed to be the only member of the media there, so it fell to me to ask 
Paterson whether he could be trusted as a self-styled champion of the 
environment given the chilly reaction from environmental groups to his time as 
environment minister. He insisted this was unfair, arguing that some of the 
bigger green organisations get EU funding and so are hardly neutral.

The Electoral Commission has welcomed Matthew Hancock’s announcement about 
extending the voter registration deadline. (See3.23pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/08/eu-referendum-live-voter-registration-site-crashes-cameron-farage-debate?page=with:block-57582a53e4b08e8268cbf558#block-57582a53e4b08e8268cbf558>
 Alex Robertson, its director of communications, said:

No one should miss out on voting in this historic referendum because of the 
problem with the government’s registration website last night. We said this 
morning that legislation should be introduced to extend the registration 
deadline and we’re pleased the government will now be making this change.

We are urging everyone who is not already registered to vote to take this last

Hague says Vote Leave economic claims are 'total fantasy'

William Hague, the Conservative former foreign secretary and former party 
leader, gave a speech on the EU referendum earlier this afternoon. Here are the 
key points.

 * Hague said it was “total fantasy” to think Britain could leave the EU, 
avoid economic damage and have more money for government spending.Vote Leave 
has claimed this would happen. But Hague said: 
The idea that we can leave the EU without any serious economic consequences 
for jobs and businesses in Britain, and somehow have more money to spend on the 
NHS and other services at the same time, is a total fantasy, and people need to 
know that before they vote.

I’m the first to say Europe isn’t perfect. I’ve spent my political life 
standing up to it. But for all its imperfections, it protects jobs and boosts 
our standing and power in the world. Let me tell you straight, as someone who’s 
an outright eurosceptic, leaving theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> would be downright irresponsible.

 * He said leaving the EU would be bad for investment. 
There are two things that such investors hate most: a prolonged period of 
uncertainty and definitely losing an advantage they have long enjoyed. Leaving 
the European single market would produce exactly those two things. With fifteen 
days to go to the referendum, there is no sign of any agreement, consensus, 
worked-up proposal, clear scenario or even coherent idea about what we would 
try to negotiate if we left the EU, let alone how we would succeed in it.

 * He dismissed claims that negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be easy.
Leave campaigners have tried to reassure people that all of this would end in 
a satisfactory negotiation: Germans, they say, would have no interest in 
imposing vengeful tariffs on the UK when they sell even more to us than we do 
to them. However, this bland assurance overlooks three crucial points.

The first is that the main problem for many businesses once we were outside 
the single market would not just be tariffs but all the bureaucracy of customs 
and the uncertainty of future tariffs.

The second is that Germany and the rest of the EU would have no incentive to 
strike an easy trade deal with any nation leaving the union because of the 
attraction it might hold for others. And some countries would have every 
interest in using the opportunity to persuade international businesses located 
in Britain, such as in financial services, to move their operations or 
headquarters.

The third point is that once the UK has served notice under article 50 of our 
intention to leave the union, the treaties provide for two years to negotiate 
the arrangements for withdrawal, extendable only by unanimous agreement. There 
would be far greater pressure on the UK, because of all the uncertainties 
surrounding investment decisions, to conclude the negotiations within the two 
years than there would be on the rest of the EU. As everybody knows, even from 
buying a house or a car, the side under the greatest time pressure is in the 
weakest negotiating position.

Matthew Hancock has also issued this statement.

Following discussions with the Electoral Commission and strong cross party 
support expressed in theHouse of Commons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons>, we will introduce 
secondary legislation to extend the deadline for voter registration until 
midnight tomorrow. Having taken the decision today, we think it is right to 
extend to midnight tomorrow (9 June) to allow people who have not yet 
registered time to get the message that registration is still open and get 
themselves registered.

He said: 
It is dangerous to assume that, by putting at risk UK’s access to unique 
information sharing and other operational arrangements in the EU, the country 
would become safer from terrorism. I share the opinion of recent heads of MI5, 
MI6 and GCHQ that the reverse is true.

In my job I see how the European arrest warrant, the Schengen information 
system and Europol, for example, have become increasingly important to the UK 
in protecting its people from terrorism. Alongside our work with US partners 
and the intelligence community the EU has become vital for Britain’s security 
interests.

Thanks for the comments.
 
And, while we’re on the subject of Michael Gove, Tristram Hunt, the Labour MP 
and former shadow education secretary, launched a strong attack on himin a 
speech this morning to the European Council of Foreign Relations. 
<http://www.tristramhunt.com/europeanpivot> Hunt said:

Michael Gove <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> seems to 
believe that applying the “creative destruction” logic of his school reforms to 
an entire continent is somehow an act of great liberal statesmanship. I could 
not disagree more. In fact, I think it indicates a chilling lack of judgement.

Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> is facing Russian 
militarism for the first time since the Cold War. Fascism, red in tooth and 
claw, for the first time since the fall of Franco.

Brexit as Gove and his ilk see it is not a “liberation movement” for the 
people of Europe - it is the act of a deranged relative pouring petrol over an 
already smouldering fire.

To walk away from Europe now, in its latest hour of need, would be an entirely 
self-defeating dereliction of our duty and history.

Hunt, a historian, also accused the Leave camp of misunderstanding British 
history. He said:

Whether it is our military, our diplomatic corps, our language, or our BBC, 
Britain’s history and traditions all point towards a country that takes an 
active role in the world. An outward looking nation at ease with its status as 
a bastion of western, liberal, democratic ideals.

This is what many voices in the Vote Leave campaign completely fail to 
understand. They say, ‘Let the world take care of itself’. But the modern world 
simply doesn’t allow for such detachment.

Even at the supposed high points of our glorious past, Britain was deeply 
enmeshed in Continental alliances. Victory at the Battle of Waterloo was the 
product of a British-Prussian-Dutch-Swedish-Russian alliance.

When Salisbury was accused of pursuing a policy of ‘splendid isolation’ in the 
late 19th century, the British government was, in fact, firmly committed to 
various European partnerships.

The argument coming from the heart of Vote Leave is the politics of defeat and 
the philosophy of decline.

Britain shouldn’t be leaving Europe. Britain should be leading Europe. 
Reshaping our continent’s destiny towards a more open, liberal, democratic, 
freer, fairer, stronger and more socially just future.

At the same Vote Leave event Michael Gove, the justice secretary, said in a 
speech 
<http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/gove_and_raab_eu_membership_makes_us_less_safe?utm_content=buffer6bf90&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer>
 that, instead of allowing Turkey to enjoy visa-free travel in the Schengen 
area, the EU should be protesting about the suppression of freedom of speech in 
Turkey.

There are particular times when the assertion of our liberalism needs to be 
especially muscular.

Nowhere more so than when the essential freedom - freedom of speech - is 
threatened.

Which brings me to the case of Turkey.

That country’s democratic development has been put into reverse under 
President Erdogan.

The country which achieved so much under the secular nationalism of Ataturk 
and his successors is now moving backwards under Erdogan and his Islamist rule.

The NGO Freedom House has found that freedom of expression is being 
‘undermined by provisions in the penal code, the criminal procedure code, and 
the harsh, broadly worded anti-terrorism law’.

Journalists who seek to expose corruption have been arrested and efforts to 
investigate Turkish relationships with fighters in Syria have been thwarted.

Erdogan’s assault on free speech doesn’t stop at his own borders.

Erdogan demanded - and won - Angela Merkel’s agreement to the prosecution of 
the German comedian Jan Böhmermann for producing a lewd poem about him.

We and the European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> should be 
protesting in the clearest and loudest possible manner at this erosion of 
fundamental democratic freedoms ...

With the terrorism threat we face only growing, it is hard to see how it could 
possibly be in our security interests to open visa free travel to 77 million 
Turkish citizens and create a border-free zone from Iraq, Iran and Syria to the 
English Channel.

It is even harder to see how such a course is wise when extremists everywhere 
will see that the West is opening its borders to appease an Islamist government.

Dominic Raab, the justice minister, gave a Vote Leave speech this morning 
<http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/gove_and_raab_eu_membership_makes_us_less_safe?utm_content=buffer6bf90&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer>
 in which he described the EU and the European court of justice as as “clear 
and present danger to our security”.

He explained:

At the moment, we can’t bar anyone in possession of an EU passport or identity 
card unless they represent a “genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat” 
to our security.

There’s two points here.


First we are forced to rely on other EU government’s putting in place proper 
controls.

And yet we already have a very serious problem with other EU states 
undermining proper border controls and effective passport checks.

We have to admit EU citizens with residence cards, even though Frontex, the 
EU’s own external border agency, says these documents are forged on a 
systematic basis.

The European Court has prevented us requiring persons from the EU to have 
documents issued by our government to come to the UK.

EU law even forbids us from automatically refusing entry to people without any 
travel documents at all.

But this is only the start of the problem.


On your chair is a photocopy of a Cyprus estate agent journal, advertised 
particularly to Russians as the Russian text shows.

This shows open, flagrant selling of EU passports.


Once people buy these EU passports and with it citizenship of an EU member 
state, they have the automatic right to come to the UK because of ‘free 
movement’.

Given this is already happening at scale, imagine how much worse this problem 
will be after the next wave of EU accessions.

The second point concerns the substantive EU test for denial of entry and 
deportation.


Even if that high threshold – a genuine, serious, present threat to our 
security - is met, we have to disclose the reasons to the individual barred,

Even if that itself could endanger national security.

We can’t just deny entry to someone, because they made an unexplained trip to 
Syria,


Or because sketchy intelligence suggests a link to terrorist activity.

We can’t even bar people from coming in, solely because they have a criminal 
record, even for murder.

Yes, in the past ten years since the free movement directive entered into 
force, we have refused entry to around 11,000 people coming from the EU.


But that compares with more than 200,000 barred from outside Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>,

Who can be excluded simply because their presence is deemed not conducive to 
the public good ...

It is now the EU and the Luxembourg court that present the clear and present 
danger to our security.

They put their ivory tower dogma of EU free movement ahead of the safety of 
our citizens.

I have not heard this, but I have heard figures on the Leave said say they 
think the government is trying to use the voter registration mess to “extend 
the franchise”. Leave figures think that at most 50,000 people were unable to 
register to vote last night and that the government is dragging out the 
registration process for another 48 hours, and giving it maximum publicity 
today, to get more young people to register. Young people are more likely than 
old people to be unregistered, and more likely than old people to vote Remain 
if they do register.

The Green MP Caroline Lucas has responded to Owen Paterson’s speech. She said:

I’m as likely to ask Donald Trump for advice on race relations as I am to trust
Owen Paterson <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-paterson> on 
protecting our environment.

The simple fact is that the EU has been essential for environmental protection 
and that Owen Paterson is wrong to say that ‘environmentalism works best at 
local level’ – in fact it only works if problems are tackled at every level.

Challenges like air pollution, sewage in the seas and threats to migrating 
species don’t queue up politely at national borders, waiting for their 
passports to be checked. Indeed if we didn’t have the EU to bring together 
countries to work on these issues, then we’d have to invent it all over again.

I’ve just watched the former environment secretary, Owen Paterson, make a 
speech which, according to the advance billing, would “tear apart the EU’s 
record on the environment”. That was a tough brief, but he did his best, 
arguing that the EU imposed too many “one size fits all” green remedies on 
countries. He was scathing about the idea that a vote for Remain was a vote for 
nature.

“It is nothing of the sort,” Paterson said.

A vote for the EU is a vote for the continuation of the remote, insensitive 
bureaucracy that insists on deciding everything on a continental level, 
ignoring local environmental conditions and imposing clumsy regulations on 
matters which should be decided at the level of the nation state or below.

It was certainly a wide-ranging speech, taking in the great crested newt 
(Paterson says these are not threatened in the UK and so don’t need protection 
here), South Georgia (he sees the island’s environmental policies as a future 
model for Britain) and the Pitcairn Islands (the UK has recently created the 
world’s largest marine reserve around them).

It also contained what is certainly the best quote of the campaign so far 
about the EU’s fisheries policy: “The sheer insanity of this is 
incomprehensible unless you see it yourself, with a haddock in your hand.”

I seemed to be the only member of the media there, so it fell to me to ask 
Paterson whether he could be trusted as a self-styled champion of the 
environment given the chilly reaction from environmental groups to his time as 
environment minister. He insisted this was unfair, arguing that some of the 
bigger green organisations get EU funding and so are hardly neutral.

The Electoral Commission has welcomed Matthew Hancock’s announcement about 
extending the voter registration deadline. (See3.23pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/08/eu-referendum-live-voter-registration-site-crashes-cameron-farage-debate?page=with:block-57582a53e4b08e8268cbf558#block-57582a53e4b08e8268cbf558>
 Alex Robertson, its director of communications, said:

No one should miss out on voting in this historic referendum because of the 
problem with the government’s registration website last night. We said this 
morning that legislation should be introduced to extend the registration 
deadline and we’re pleased the government will now be making this change.

We are urging everyone who is not already registered to vote to take this last 
chance to do so before the end of Thursday.
 
William Hague, the Conservative former foreign secretary and former party 
leader, gave a speech on the EU referendum earlier this afternoon. Here are the 
key points.

 * Hague said it was “total fantasy” to think Britain could leave the EU, 
avoid economic damage and have more money for government spending.Vote Leave 
has claimed this would happen. But Hague said: 
The idea that we can leave the EU without any serious economic consequences 
for jobs and businesses in Britain, and somehow have more money to spend on the 
NHS and other services at the same time, is a total fantasy, and people need to 
know that before they vote.

I’m the first to say Europe isn’t perfect. I’ve spent my political life 
standing up to it. But for all its imperfections, it protects jobs and boosts 
our standing and power in the world. Let me tell you straight, as someone who’s 
an outright eurosceptic, leaving theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> would be downright irresponsible.

 * He said leaving the EU would be bad for investment. 
There are two things that such investors hate most: a prolonged period of 
uncertainty and definitely losing an advantage they have long enjoyed. Leaving 
the European single market would produce exactly those two things. With fifteen 
days to go to the referendum, there is no sign of any agreement, consensus, 
worked-up proposal, clear scenario or even coherent idea about what we would 
try to negotiate if we left the EU, let alone how we would succeed in it.

 * He dismissed claims that negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be easy.
Leave campaigners have tried to reassure people that all of this would end in 
a satisfactory negotiation: Germans, they say, would have no interest in 
imposing vengeful tariffs on the UK when they sell even more to us than we do 
to them. However, this bland assurance overlooks three crucial points.

The first is that the main problem for many businesses once we were outside 
the single market would not just be tariffs but all the bureaucracy of customs 
and the uncertainty of future tariffs.

The second is that Germany and the rest of the EU would have no incentive to 
strike an easy trade deal with any nation leaving the union because of the 
attraction it might hold for others. And some countries would have every 
interest in using the opportunity to persuade international businesses located 
in Britain, such as in financial services, to move their operations or 
headquarters.

The third point is that once the UK has served notice under article 50 of our 
intention to leave the union, the treaties provide for two years to negotiate 
the arrangements for withdrawal, extendable only by unanimous agreement. There 
would be far greater pressure on the UK, because of all the uncertainties 
surrounding investment decisions, to conclude the negotiations within the two 
years than there would be on the rest of the EU. As everybody knows, even from 
buying a house or a car, the side under the greatest time pressure is in the 
weakest negotiating position.

Matthew Hancock has also issued this statement.

Following discussions with the Electoral Commission and strong cross party 
support expressed in theHouse of Commons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons>, we will introduce 
secondary legislation to extend the deadline for voter registration until 
midnight tomorrow. Having taken the decision today, we think it is right to 
extend to midnight tomorrow (9 June) to allow people who have not yet 
registered time to get the message that registration is still open and get 
themselves registered.
 
Matthew Hancock, the Cabinet Office, has announced that the voter registration 
deadline will be extended until midnight tomorrow.
