Customers of three of Australia’s four big banks will not have access to 
Apple’s electronic payment system, after the competition watchdog refused their 
application to bargain collectively.

Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide 
Bank applied in July to negotiate as a collective over the use ofApple 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple> Pay, which allows touch-and-go 
payments on iPhones.

The banks had argued that Apple Pay prevented them from developing their own 
integrated digital wallets for iPhones, which they said would increase 
competition and consumer choice in Australia.

Restrictions on passing fees associated with Apple Pay onto customers were 
also a sticking point.

But the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has rejected the 
application

, meaning each bank will have to reach an individual agreement with Apple 
before its customers can use Apple Pay.

The ACCC said it accepted that allowing the banks to negotiate collectively 
and potentially boycott Apple Pay would place them in a better bargaining 
position with Apple, but that the benefits for customers were “currently 
uncertain and may be limited”.

Rod Sims, the ACCC chairman, said digital wallets and mobile payments were in 
their infancy and subject to rapid change.

“It is therefore uncertain how competition may develop with the availability 
of mobile payments and possible future innovations.

“Apple Wallet and other non-bank digital wallets could represent a disruptive 
technology that may increase competition between the banks by making it easier 
for consumers to switch between card providers and limiting any ‘lock in’ 
effect bank digital wallets may cause.”


In an emailed statement provided by Apple to the ABC 
<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-29/apple-pay-accc-denies-big-banks-collective-bargaining/8074038>
, it said the ACCC’s decision was “great for Australians”.


The ACCC’s ruling is a draft decision with a final outcome expected in March 
2017.

The banks seemed to take heart from Sims’ description of the ruling as “finely 
balanced”, vowing to continue to work with the ACCC ina statement published on 
the

 Bendigo and Adelaide Bank’s website.

Lance Blockley, the spokesperson for the applicants, said a ruling against 
them would mean “effectively … no competition against Apple for mobile payments 
on the iPhone”.

“The application has never been about preventing Apple Pay from coming to 
Australia or reducing competition between wallets. It has always been about 
providing consumer choice and innovation.”

ANZ, American Express and Cuscal, which represents 13 issuers, have reached 
agreements with Apple over Apple Pay in Australia.
