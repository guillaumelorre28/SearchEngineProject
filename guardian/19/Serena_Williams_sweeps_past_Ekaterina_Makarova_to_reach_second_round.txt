Williams, whose status as world number one is under attack from several 
fronts, delivered a message that she will not be surrendering the top spot 
without a fight, needing just 63 minutes to dispatch the 29th-ranked Russian.

Germany’s Angelique Kerber and Spain’s Garbine Muguruza, who have both beaten 
Williams in slam finals this season, along with Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska, 
will all be eyeing the number one ranking should the American’s bid for a 23rd 
grand slam title stall.

Williams has held the No1 spot since 18 February 2013 and will extend her 
streak to 186 consecutive weeks by the end of the US Open fortnight, tying the 
WTA record currently held by Steffi Graf.

Back on Arthur Ashe Stadium court for the first time since a shock loss to 
Italy’s Roberta Vinci in last year’s US Open semi-finals, Williams made quick 
work of Makarova to follow the lead of her sister Venus.

Sixth-seeded Venus had provided the opening act for sister Serena when she 
outlasted Ukraine’s Kateryna Kozlova 6-2 5-7 6-4 before turning over the Arthur 
Ashe Stadium court to her top-seeded sibling.
