I grew up in Shimoda, in Japan’s Shizuoka prefecture, in a typically Japanese 
house.

We didn’t have chairs, so when I was younger I dreamed of being able to live 
in a western house, to sit on a chair and drink coffee or to eat a baguette off 
a white plate. We always sat in atatami-mat room right next to the kitchen.

My husband’s parents had an ultra‑ modern home – his father was an English 
teacher and his mother liked candles and wore perfume. It was a great contrast 
to the understated environment I grew up in. They also ate western-style food.

In our home, we usually ate traditional Japanese meals of rice, vegetables and 
fish, and only a little meat. We lived near the sea, so we also ate a lot of 
horse mackerel andkinmedai (golden-eye sea bream), usually raw as sashimi.

We often ate a seaweed dish called hijiki, plus lots of simmered dishes using 
kiriboshi daikon (dried daikon radish, which is rehydrated when used in 
cooking) and other dried goods. My mother was adept at using those in her 
cooking. She put sesame seeds into miso soup, spinach, cabbage, hijiki … just 
about everything. I remember her sitting on the kitchen floor with a pestle and 
mortar, grinding the seeds into a paste. She did it so often that, over time, 
the mortar made a dent in the doorframe.

Those days were the origins of the cookery I do now – a mixture of Japanese 
influences from home and western touches I learned after I met my husband.

I started cooking for my mother and father when I was at senior high school. I 
cooked for them a lot until I got married when I was 26. My father loved to 
drink sake, so we always made him small dishes that pair well with it, like 
mackerel in miso or chopped raw horse mackerel.

The dish that reminds me of him most, however, is fried chicken with leek 
sauce. I came up with it to make him happy, but it has become a favourite dish 
among my readers, too. It’s not quite a Chinese dish, but it’s not really 
Japanese either.

My father was so amazed by the taste and used to say: “This is the best 
chicken I have ever had.” In fact, he wasn’t that keen on chicken – so it’s a 
testament to how much he liked this recipe. Anyone can make it: all you need is 
a few easy-to-come-by seasonings, some chicken – frozen will do – and a single 
leek.

When I became known for my cooking, I travelled a lot. I was always busy, so 
my parents couldn’t see me whenever they wanted. In that respect, I think they 
were a little sad about my success.

For the leek sauce
100ml soy sauce
2 tbsp vinegar
1 tbsp sake
1 ½ tbsp sugar 
1 leek, chopped
½ tbsp vegetable oil
1 red chilli, chopped

1 Pierce the chicken all over with a fork so it will better absorb the 
seasoning. Mix the soy sauce with the sake, then pour this over the chicken, 
making sure it seeps well into the meat. Set aside while you prepare the leek 
sauce.

2 To make the leek sauce, combine the soy, vinegar, sake and sugar in a bowl. 
In a pan, lightly fry the chopped leek in some heated oil, then pour in the soy 
sauce mixture and chopped red chilli and stir together until the sugar has 
dissolved. Remove from the heat and set aside.

3 Coat the chicken with the potato starch, then deep-fry in oil at 180C/350F. 
For crispier chicken, raise it out of the oil from time to time. When fried to 
a golden brown, cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Serve dressed with the 
leek sauce. I sometimes accompany this with some lettuce.
