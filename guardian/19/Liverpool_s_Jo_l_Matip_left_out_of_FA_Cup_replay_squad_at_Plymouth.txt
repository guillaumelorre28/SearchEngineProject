Jürgen Klopp was due consult Liverpool’s lawyers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/17/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-joel-matip-fifa-saga>
 over whether to select Matip amid concern the defender’s inclusion could 
result in the club’s expulsion from the competition.

Matip was not selected in Cameroon’s squad for the Africa Cup of Nations and, 
as far as Liverpool are concerned, retired from international football in 2015. 
The club have not received confirmation the defender can play for Liverpool 
during the tournament without threat of sanction, prompting his withdrawal from 
the squad who drew1-1 at Manchester United

 last Sunday.

Fifa will decide on Friday whether Matip has a case to answer and, if so, 
Klopp admitted it could be “another seven or 10 days before we get a decision”.

Klopp will once again turn to the younger members of his squad for the 
third-round replay, with only Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho, Divock 
Origi, Lucas, Albert Moreno and Ragnar Klavan among the first-team regulars 
making the trip.
