This richly rewarding collection <http://www.deccaclassics.com/gb/cat/4788104> 
brings together music across the centuries, from plainsong and the Carmina 
Burana to the late Renaissance, touching the early baroque of Monteverdi. It is 
also a celebration of a period of wonderful creativity in the British early 
music scene around the 1980s. Almost all the artists were from this country, 
nurtured and supported by the record industry: the piercing, simple eloquence 
of Anthony Rooleyâ€™s Consort of Musicke in madrigals and motets, more extrovert 
performances of Susato and Praetorius dances, and the superb Medieval Ensemble 
of London bringing to life little-known Isaac, Ockeghem, Dufay and Perugia. 
Both a treasure trove and a great historical document.
