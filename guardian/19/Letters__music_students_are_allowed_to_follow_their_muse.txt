Nigel Kennedy asserts that lazy teachers at music colleges stifle 
individuality in violinists and focus solely on perfecting technique(“Classical 
‘factory line’ takes the joy out of Beethoven and Brahms, says Nigel Kennedy” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/20/nigel-kennedy-slams-colleges-for-stifling-musical-talent>
, (News).

At the Royal Academy of Music <https://www.theguardian.com/education/music>, 
there are 24 violin professors, whose ages range from 30 to 92 and whose 
approach is enormously varied. What they have in common is a tireless 
dedication to nurturing young musicians and preserving at all costs their 
students’ evolving artistic personalities as communicators through music. We 
encourage students to take risks in live performance and follow their muse.

There are 103 violin students under my care, who are destined for multiple 
careers in music. I don’t recognise the perfectionist clones described by Nigel 
Kennedy, because they don’t survive as musicians. Our students do. I look 
forward to welcoming Nigel to the Academy to persuade him that he has got this 
wrong.

Silence on climate change


The key element missing from Hillary Clinton’s campaign was the emotional 
force of Trump’s campaign, plus any hope for the future of the planet (“The 
shock lessons for liberals from Brexit and the Trumpquake” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/20/lessons-liberals-brexit-trumpquake-demagogues-rules-electoral-politics>
, Comment). Thanks to TV programmes about the natural world, of whichPlanet 
Earth II is a shining example, the public is well aware of the dangers of 
global warming, even if David Attenborough is prohibited by the BBC from 
uttering the words “climate change”.

In the same vein, global warming did not feature in the Brexit debate or the 
US presidential election, even though Trump’s position – that climate change is 
a hoax invented by the Chinese – is absurd. Although Trump is a major climate 
change denier, most politicians, like much of the media, are in the minor 
denial camp. They take the view that it is happening, but now is not the time 
to deal with it as it is going to upset voters or persuade viewers to switch 
off.

Middlesbrough? Where’s that?


When your columns are rightfully full of analysis about how the actions of a 
London elite have left the blue-collar towns of the north feeling overlooked 
and how this has led us into perilous waters, I note Paul Doyle’s supposed
preview of the Middlesbrough v Chelsea game 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/19/cesar-azpilicueta-chelsea-flexible-three-man-defence-antonio-conte>
 (Sport, last week). In its 900 words, Middlesbrough is mentioned only once, as 
the location of the game. The other 899 are devoted to the tribulations of one 
Chelsea player and his manager. What is right and proper for the news section 
of the Observer needs reflection elsewhere.

Brexit no longer feasible


Leave campaigners absurdly assumed that the EU they painted as so malign would 
turn benign on negotiating exit (“Europe’s leaders to force Britain into hard 
Brexit” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/19/europes-leaders-force-uk-hard-brexit-farage-le-pen>
, News). Meanwhile, the Remain campaign did not point out that this would 
happen, assuming, I suppose, that admitting that the EU could be vindictive 
wouldn’t help their case.

The election of a US president on a protectionist manifesto changes 
everything. Now we know that Trump will close down international trade, groups 
such as the EU will resort to protectionism. It will be impossible for the UK 
to survive economically outside the EU. We need our leaders to call off Brexit 
and tell people that what they voted for is no longer feasible.

UK changed rules, not EU


Your headline, “Consumers caught out as EU furnishes the UK with crippling 
copyright laws” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/21/consumers-eu-copyright-laws-replica-designer-furniture>
 (News) is contradicted by the article itself: “Professor Lionel Bentley, 
director of the Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Law, says it 
was not required by EU law.” Thus, it is the government (allegedly under 
pressure from Vitra) that furnished the crippling laws, not the EU.

Elderly care crisis looms


It was disappointing for the elderly who need care to hear Philip Hammond 
dismiss talk of a “crisis” or “looming chaos” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/labour-pours-scorn-over-autumn-statement-for-ignoring-sick-and-old>
 in health and social care.

The call for action from councils, the NHS, charities, parliamentarians, the 
Care Quality Commission and care providers for the autumn statement to tackle 
the social care funding crisis was deafening and services face a funding gap of 
at least £2.6bn by 2019/20.

Without urgent action, the quality and safety of care of our elderly is at 
risk. Proper funding is the only way they will be able to enjoy dignified, 
healthy and independent lives. The social care crisis is happening now. The 
government cannot ignore it any longer if we are to have a society that works 
for everyone.
