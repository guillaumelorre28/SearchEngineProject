In September a judge ruled Oshin should move to palliative care and not be 
forced to undergo radiotherapy, after a court order in March had forced him to 
receive chemotherapy. Oshin died on Wednesday morning.

His mother released a statement to 7 News in Perth saying: “My love Oshin took 
his last breaths peacefully as I lay cuddling him at 2am this morning.

“Oshin’s journey has been extraordinarily traumatising for him and I am 
grateful he no long needs to suffer through this nightmare.”
