One of my best friends has a penchant for canned sweetcorn: when no one is 
looking, she sneaks to the fridge, spoon in hand, to gobble up the odd 
mouthful. As guilty pleasures go, that’s a fairly innocent one (mine are far 
worse), but I still cannot fathom it: the very smell of canned sweetcorn makes 
me shudder, and is to blame for putting me off corn for several decades. That 
all changed when I began to travel, especially in Mexico, where savoury, 
multi-coloured corn is the stuff of legend – packed with essential vitamins and 
minerals, it’s practically a superfood – and I found that I loved the stuff (so 
long as it had never come into contact with a tin).

Corn is grown worldwide, and its sweet flavour is just made for spices and 
heat, ideal for me. And while cooking so much of it in Mexico, I discovered 
that frozen sweetcorn is almost (but not quite) as good as fresh. As with broad 
beans and peas, freezing arrests the aging process and stops the sugars turning 
into starch. This leaves lovely sweet kernels with none of the flavour that the 
canning process produces – unless, of course, that is your guilty pleasure, too.

Indian spiced sweetcorn fritters with ginger yoghurt

Use plain flour if you can’t get gram (chickpea). Incidentally, you can also 
deep-fry small spoonfuls of this batter, which is perhaps a little less healthy 
although absurdly good. Serves four to six, as a first course.

3 corn cobs (or 500g frozen kernels)
150g gram (or plain) flour 
½ tsp baking powder 
1 tsp garam masala 
½ tsp mixed spice 
1 tsp turmeric 
½ tsp paprika 
3 free-range eggs, separated
140ml milk
2 spring onions, chopped 
½-1 red chilli, finely chopped, according to taste
2 limes, zested and juiced
1 big handful chopped coriander leaves
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
15g butter 
1-2 tbsp olive oil

For the yoghurt
100g greek yoghurt 
1 tsp nigella seeds 
1 lime, zested and juiced
1 tsp grated ginger 

Heat the oven to 140C/285F/gas mark 1. Hold the corn upright and, using a 
sharp knife, carefully shave off the kernels (do this inside a large, wide 
bowl, so it catches all the flying kernels). Sift the flour and baking powder 
into a bowl, add the spices and make a well in the centre. Put the egg yolks 
and half the milk in the well, beat the mixture until smooth, then slowly whisk 
in the rest of the milk. Fold in the corn, onions, chilli, lime juice and zest, 
and coriander. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, gently fold them into the 
batter and season.

Heat a heavy-based frying pan on a medium high heat and add a small knob of 
butter and a dribble of oil. Drop two heaped tablespoons of batter into the pan 
and fry on medium heat for three minutes a side, until golden brown and cooked 
through. Transfer to the oven while you repeat with the rest of the batter.

Mix all the yoghurt ingredients, then season. Serve the fritters with the 
yoghurt on the side; a simple salad of coriander leaves, baby gem and finely 
chopped spring onions wouldn’t go amiss, either.

The sweet, comforting salad is a lovely partner for the gently spiced quail; 
it would also work well with chicken thighs or wings. Serves four.

1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted and ground
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 clove garlic, peeled 
2 tbsp honey 
25g brown sugar
2 tbsp olive oil 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 quail

For the salad 
4 corn cobs (or 670g frozen kernels)
2 large vine tomatoes
3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 
4 spring onions, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped
A few pinches of ground allspice (optional)
2 limes, zested and juiced 
1 handful coriander leaves, roughly chopped 
1 handful mint leaves, roughly chopped
1-2 jalapeño chillies, finely chopped 

Warm the cumin in a dry frying pan, then grind in a mortar with the garlic. 
Add the lemon, honey, sugar and oil, grind again, season well and rub all over 
the quail. Cover and refrigerate for anything up to a day.

When you are ready to cook, heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Pop the 
quail in a small roasting tin, pour over any excess marinade and roast for 20 
minutes, basting halfway through, until golden brown, sticky and cooked. Cover 
the birds with tin foil and leave them somewhere warm to rest while you make 
the salad.

Shave the corn from the cobs (see first recipe). Put the tomatoes in a bowl, 
cover with boiling water, leave for 30 seconds, then drain. Peel, quarter and 
deseed the tomatoes, then cut the flesh into small dice.

Heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan on a medium heat and add half the oil. Saute 
the corn, spring onions and garlic for five to 10 minutes, and season well with 
salt, pepper and allspice, if using. Once the corn is tender and has taken on 
some colour, take the pan off the heat and stir in the lime zest and juice. 
Toss with all the other salad ingredients, including the tomatoes and remaining 
oil, and serve alongside the quail.

And for the rest of the week…

Corn is really inexpensive at this time of year, so it’s only common sense to 
make the most of it. One of my favourite way of cooking whole cobs is to 
barbecue them and then douse them in a mix of butter, chipotle mayonnaise, feta 
and fresh lime; harissa butter, feta and chopped coriander is another good 
combo. The corn salad makes a delicious lunch – I like it sprinkled with feta, 
lancashire or pecorino cheese and stuffed into a warm pitta bread.
