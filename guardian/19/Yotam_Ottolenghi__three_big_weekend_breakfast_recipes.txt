There’s nothing less relaxing than being told to relax. The same is true of 
certain meals: being asked to bring “a dish” to an informal party can be more 
stressful than being told exactly what to make.

It’s the same with weekend breakfasts. However elaborate and involved the 
recipe, it’s often pitched as perfect for a lazy, Sunday morning or relaxed, 
weekend brunch. I have no doubt I’ve been guilty of this in the past, so, to 
redress the balance, I’m dedicating this and next week’s recipes to those among 
us who are unashamedly serious about their breakfast. These recipes make no 
bones about the fact that they require more planning and cooking than your 
basic boiled egg.

Even so, the brisket can be cooked a day or two ahead, so you’ve got just a 
sandwich to fry on the day, while the pancake batter can be part-mixed the 
night before. Mind you, all that prep perpetuates the delightful illusion of 
the casual weekend breakfast.

Sweet potato pancakes with maple-glazed bacon

The batter can be made a day ahead, up to the stage before the egg whites are 
added. Serves four.


450g sweet potatoes 
85g plain flour
¾ tsp baking powder
¾ tsp ground cumin
Salt 
2 eggs, separated
70ml whole milk
20g unsalted butter, melted, plus 50g diced, for frying
2 tsp maple syrup
4 spring onions, thinly sliced
1 green chilli, finely chopped
25g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
5g tarragon leaves, finely chopped

For the salad
250g long radishes, quartered lengthways
15g coriander leaves
15g rocket
2 tsp olive oil
1 tbsp lemon juice

For the topping
8 slices smoked streaky bacon
2 tbsp maple syrup

Heat the oven to 220°C/425F/gas mark 7. Put the whole, unpeeled sweet potatoes 
on an oven tray and roast for an hour, until soft and browned, then remove and 
leave to cool. Peel and discard the skin, then put the flesh in a clean J-cloth 
or piece of muslin. Draw up the sides, roll into a ball and squeeze out any 
liquid: you should be left with about 180g of flesh.

Turn down the oven to 160C/320F/gas mark 2½. In a bowl, mix the flour, baking 
powder, cumin and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Put the egg yolks, 
milk, melted butter and maple syrup in a second bowl, whisk to combine, then 
stir into the dry ingredients. Add the sweet potato, spring onion, chilli and 
herbs, and stir until smooth. Whisk the egg whites in a separate bowl until 
stiff, then gently fold in.

Melt half the diced butter in a large frying pan on a medium heat. When it 
starts to foam, spoon in three heaped tablespoons of the batter and gently 
spread out into a pancake 7-8cm wide and 1.5cm thick. Repeat until you have 
three or four pancakes in the pan, then fry for three to four minutes, turning 
halfway, when bubbles appear in the middle. Transfer to an oven tray lined with 
baking paper, and repeat with the rest of the batter, wiping clean the pan and 
adding butter as needed. You’ll end up with eight pancakes.

Mix all the salad ingredients with an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.

Heat the grill. Place the bacon on a wire rack on top of a foil-lined tray and 
brush with half the maple syrup. Grill for two minutes, until the bacon starts 
to turn crisp, then turn, brush with the remaining syrup and grill for a minute 
or two, until crisp.

Just before serving, warm the pancakes in the oven, then put two on each 
plate, topping each portion with two slices of bacon. Spoon the salad alongside 
and serve.

Grilled cheese sandwich with 10-hour brisket

There’s 10 hours’ cooking here, so get this in the oven early (or late, if 
cooking it overnight). This makes four sandwiches, but there’s enough meat to 
make eight, so freeze the leftovers for another time.

720g rolled piece of brisket
1 tbsp olive oil
Salt and black pepper
2 tsp cumin seeds, toasted and lightly crushed
¾ tsp sweet smoked paprika
¼ tsp cayenne
100ml red wine
50g dark muscovado sugar
60g tomato ketchup
8 1.5cm-thick slices sourdough
80g unsalted butter, softened
200g mature cheddar, cut into 2mm-thick slices
4 pickled whole green chillies


Heat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Remove the string and unroll the 
brisket, and put it in a bowl with the oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and 
plenty of pepper. Heat a griddle on a high flame, then grill the brisket for 
four to five minutes, turning it often, so it gets blackened and smoky all 
over. Transfer to a high-sided, 20cm x 25cm ceramic baking tray.

Put the cumin, paprika, cayenne, wine, sugar and ketchup in a small saucepan, 
add 100ml water and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, and bring to a boil. Leave 
to bubble for two minutes, until starting to thicken, then pour all over the 
meat, so its surface is covered in sauce; the sauce should come a quarter of 
the way up the sides of the dish. Cover the meat with a sheet of baking paper, 
then seal the whole dish with two layers of aluminium foil.

Bake for 15 minutes, then turn the heat to 110C/230F, and cook for 10 hours, 
until the meat is very soft and falling apart and the sauce has slightly 
reduced. Pour the marinade into a small saucepan (you should have about 350ml), 
bring to a boil, and cook for four to five minutes, until thick, sticky and 
reduced to about 90ml. Shred the meat (you’ll have about 440g) and put in a 
bowl. Pour on the marinade and mix well.

To assemble the sandwiches, butter each slice of bread on one side. Heat a 
large frying-pan on a medium-high flame, then lay in four slices buttered-side 
down. Put two slices of cheese on top of each, followed by 50g of the beef. 
Spread out the beef mix, then top with two more slices of cheese. Put a whole 
chilli on top and finish with a second slice of bread, buttered side up.

Press down the sandwich with a spatula for a minute, so the bread toasts to 
golden-brown, then turn over and press down again for a minute, to toast the 
other side and melt the cheese. Serve warm.

These are somewhere between a porridge and a fluffy soufflé. If you don’t want 
them to deflate, serve them fresh from the oven, either for a leisurely 
breakfast or even as a light dessert. I like to bake them in rustic dishes, but 
ramekins work just fine, too. Serves six, generously.

30g unsalted butter, plus 15g extra for greasing
60g caster sugar, plus 30g extra for coating
1 vanilla pod, split open and seeds scraped out
700ml whole milk
200g fine semolina
80g honey
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
Salt
2 egg yolks and 3 egg whites
200g blueberries
300g Greek yoghurt, to serve

For the blueberry syrup
40g caster sugar
¾ tbsp lemon juice
150g blueberries

Heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Grease six shallow ramekins (about 10cm 
in diameter and 5cm deep) with 15g butter, then sprinkle in 30g sugar and turn 
the dishes round to spread the sugar evenly.

Put the vanilla pod and seeds in a medium saucepan, add the milk and warm 
through on a medium flame, for five minutes, until it starts to steam. Turn off 
the heat and leave to infuse for 10 minutes, whisking a few times to separate 
the seeds, then take out the vanilla pod (rinse and keep it: you’ll use it in 
the syrup later) and return the pan to a medium heat. Add the semolina, butter, 
sugar, honey, lemon zest and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and cook for four 
minutes, whisking, until the mixture is the consistency of a smooth, pourable 
cake batter. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes, then lightly whisk the egg yolks 
and fold into the batter, followed by the blueberries.

In a bowl, whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks, then gently fold into the 
batter, taking care not to knock out the air. Spoon into the ramekins, gently 
shaking them to smooth it out, then put on an oven tray and bake for 20-22 
minutes, until golden-brown and risen by about 2cm.

Meanwhile, make the syrup. Put the sugar in a small saucepan with the lemon 
juice, a tablespoon of water and the vanilla pod. Cook for a minute on a 
medium-high heat, shaking the pan until the sugar has dissolved, then add the 
blueberries and stir for two or three minutes, so they soften and release their 
juices. Discard the vanilla pod, and leave the syrup to thicken and cool a 
little.

Serve the puddings the moment they come out of the oven, with some yoghurt and 
syrupy blueberries spooned on top, and the rest in separate bowls on the side.
