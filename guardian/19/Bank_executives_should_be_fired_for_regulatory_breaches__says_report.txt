Executives in Australia’s major banks ought to be sacked and publicly named for
significant regulatory breaches 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/apr/29/timeline-banking-scandals-in-australia-since-2009>
, according to new parliamentary report.

Australia should also establish a “one-stop” tribunal to make it easier for 
consumers and small businesses to complain about poor treatment by banks and 
financial advisers, it says.

But it has stopped short of recommending a royal commission into the banking 
industry.

Those are some of the recommendations from a parliamentary inquiry into 
Australia’s major banks, whose first report waspublished on Thursday

The Turnbull government set up the inquiry in response to mounting pressure 
for a royal commission into the banking industry.

Chief executives from Westpac, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, and NAB, were forced to 
appear before a parliamentary committee in Canberra last month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/03/labor-plans-to-use-fresh-whistleblower-testimonies-to-pressure-bank-bosses>
 as part of the inquiry.

The report’s recommendations include:

 * Banks must publicly report significant regulatory breaches within five days 
of reporting the incident to regulators. Such public reports should include a 
description of the breach and how it occurred, the names of senior executives 
responsible for the teams where the breach occurred and the consequences they 
faced, and an explanation of the reasons an executive is not dismissed (if in 
fact they are not). 
 * The launch of a ‘one-stop’ banking and financial services tribunal to 
replace the existing external dispute resolution schemes by 1 July 2017. 
 * Continual monitoring of competition in the banking sector by the 
competition regulator, and recommendations made every six months to the 
treasurer to improve competition in the sector.

 * The creation of a data sharing framework for consumer and small business 
data by July 2018.

 * A review of the regulatory barriers to starting a bank. 
The committee chair, Liberal MP David Coleman, said if the recommendations 
were implemented they would substantially improve the banking sector.

Coleman said this first report would be added to in the future. “Banks must be 
much more accountable to consumers than they are today, and these 
recommendations will achieve that goal,” he said on Thursday.

But Labor and the Greens have issued dissenting reports. “This inquiry was 
established by the government to avoid a royal commission into Australia’s 
banking industry,”Labor’s report says

“It has been a stage-managed circus from its beginnings … the only way to 
achieve any form of justice for the victims of the banks, and the only way to 
truly shine a light on the practices that drive unethical behaviour in the 
banking industry, is to hold a royal commission.”

The Greens said the inquiry confirmed the big four banks “enjoy a cosy and 
privileged position in Australian society”.

“This inquiry has also confirmed the big four banks think there is nothing 
wrong with the core of their vertically integrated business model, a model that 
creates a potential for conflict of interest between the customers’ best 
interest and subsidiaries encouraging people to buy financial products,” the
Greens’ report says 
<http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/02%20Parliamentary%20Business/24%20Committees/243%20Reps%20Committees/Economics/45p/Four%20Major%20Banks%202016%20-%20First%20Report/Appendix%20C%20Dissenting%20Report%20Greens%20member%20of%20the%20committee.pdf?la=en>
.

“[It] has generated more questions than answers, reinforcing the need for a 
wide-ranging royal commission into the big four banks and the broader financial 
sector.”

Coleman said chief executives of the major banks would be asked to attend 
another round of public hearings in February 2017.
