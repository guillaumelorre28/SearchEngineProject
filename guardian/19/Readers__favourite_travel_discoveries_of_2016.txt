Winning tip: Old camel trail, Cyprus


Deep in the cool Paphos forest <http://www.visitpafos.org.cy/Pafos_Forest.aspx>
, we found the 17kmVenetian Bridges nature trail 
<http://www.visitpafos.org.cy/enetika_gefyria_trail.aspx>. Built in the 16th 
and 17th centuries, the three bridges were part of the old camel trail along 
which copper was transported to the ports. The whole route takes six to eight 
hours to walk, but we did one section, from the deserted village of Vretsia to 
Roudia bridge. Under towering sweet-smelling pine trees we accidently disturbed 
mouflon, the shy wild sheep of Cyprus. Watching as they nimbly danced up the 
hillside we knew we had been lucky to see these rare protected animals.

 St Briavels. Photograph: Alamy 
We joined the YHA this year and, while walking Offa’s Dyke footpath, discovered
St Briavels. Hidden away in the Forest of Dean, this 800-year-old Norman castle 
has a triple portcullis gatehouse and is surrounded by a filled-in moat. Used 
by Edward I as a crossbow bolt factory, it was a debtors’ prison before being 
turned into a hostel in 1948 and beautifully refurbished in 2015. We got a 
last-minute cancellation in the Prison room, complete with 16th-century 
graffiti. Our friends were in the Oubliette, with its dungeon hidden below. 
There’s also a wonderful banqueting hall.

Deep in the jungle of Sabah on the rim of Kinabalu national park in Malaysian 
Borneo, a small team of volunteers maintain an eco-friendly camp of basic open 
wooden huts and tents by a river. As its name,Lupa Masa (forget time), 
suggests, life at the camp does not adhere to the hectic schedules of the 
outside world. Waking at dawn to a hearty breakfast you can make your way to 
the river for a fresh natural shower then hike around trails, keeping an eye 
out for exotic flora and fauna (snakes, insects and flowers dominate, though 
tales of running into elusive cloud leopards add to the mystique of the camp). 
All meals are included, so lunch could be a quick plate of noodles or a big 
family gathering on the open deck admiring the sounds of the jungle. Nearby 
attractions include some waterfalls (including the tallest in Malaysia, which 
is a gruelling leech-filled two-hour trek away) a treetop trail and a hot 
spring. Evenings usually involve a campfire, beautiful vegetarian food and 
fascinating night hikes. Accommodation ranges from tents in a covered long 
house, small bamboo huts, a raised platform named “the honeymoon suite” and the 
relative luxury of riverside chalets.

 Museum of Design. 
We discovered the Museum of Design in Midtown. Entry is cheap, staff are 
friendly and knowledgeable and the exhibitions fascinating. It’s a small museum 
but there is so much to see you can easily while away a long afternoon here, 
and it opens late on Thursdays (8pm). My highlight was a dress bejewelled with 
computerised LEDs. You can get a demo on the 3D printers in the foyer (and a 
great souvenir!) if you ask nicely. The museum shops sells quirky cards, 
3D-printed jewellery and books.

Montpellier’s high proportion of university students give it a lively cafe 
society atmosphere, and colourful modern trams can get you to the beach in 20 
minutes. We went in September and found an annual three-week-longinternational 
guitar festival 
<http://en.destinationsuddefrance.com/Going-out/Events-in-South-of-France/International-Guitar-Festival>
 under way. All the open-air squares were full of strumming musicians 
performing flamenco, folk, rock and country. The big “24 hours of Madness” is a 
fantastic fun-filled climax.

Slightly shabby and overgrown, the house and gardens (in the Coyoacán district 
of Mexico City) do not seem to have many visitors. The sense of history is so 
strong, you can almost see “the old man” feeding his rabbits in the dilapidated 
hutches. The windows are half bricked in, to stave off the inevitable attack; 
the rooms small and gloomy. Bullet holes from the machine gun attack by 
assassins disguised as police – two months before the final attack that killed 
Trotsky in 1940 – still mark the walls of his bedroom. Stalin had a fifth 
columnist in Ramón Mercader, who had ingratiated himself with one of Trotsky’s 
secretaries for years, becoming her boyfriend. Finally he was invited into 
Trotsky’s study for tea. There he stuck the icepick into the back of his head 
and shoulder. Trotsky survived for a day; Mercader was imprisoned until 1960, 
dying in Havana in 1978.

 Jawsspot 
We stumbled across Jawsspot <https://www.facebook.com/jawsspotspb/> – actually 
stumbled – as I walked into one of its barmen on his way out for a smoke. I was 
on the way back from a disappointing travel guide-recommended bar up the 
street. This place has more than 20 beers on tap that span the globe, on top of 
the Jaws brewery’s Russian-made beers – plus a bottle shop – in a shorn-back 
interior with more wood than Wickes. It’s well off the main tourist drag of 
Nevsky Prospect, and it may take a couple of visits for the regulars to stop 
eyeing you with suspicion, but you won’t get a better stout in the city.

We started the year celebrating Orthodox Christmas with friends in Belgrade 
but then took the bus to the spa town of Vrnjačka Banja (three hours’ drive 
south), which is the perfect base for visiting the monasteries of Žiča, 
Studenica and Sopoćani by taxi or shared minibus. The latter two are Unesco 
world heritage sites but all hold incredible medieval frescoes. It was truly 
magical to be the only visitors to these monasteries surrounded by a landscape 
of snow and mountains.
