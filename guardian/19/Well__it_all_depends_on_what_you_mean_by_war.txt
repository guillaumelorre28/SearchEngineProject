 'The first casualty when war comes is truth,' said Hiram Warren Johnson in a 
speech to the US Senate in 1917. He might have added that the second is 
language.
Military-speak is full of jargon and euphemisms, and with this in mind we ran 
a glossary of terms recently in the current conflict - 'asymmetrical warfare', 
'Ground Zero', that old favourite 'collateral damage', and the Arabic word 
'jihad'.

We said of 'jihad': 'Technically, this means the struggle to do good, 
referring to a battle with the conscience over the right course of action at 
any point in life, menial or significant. It only came to be associated with 
the idea of a "holy war" after the Crusades.'

A reader tells us we were 'wholly wrong' and explains: 'The verbal root, 
jahada , means to strive, struggle etc in the literal sense. The word jihad 
itself means "war, battle, holy war". The earliest sources, including the 
Koran, use it in that sense, and the Prophet conducted more than one holy war, 
as did his immediate successors.

'The Crusades were, in part, a European response to the Muslim jihad which had 
resulted in the conquest of the Holy Land. The "struggle with the self" meaning 
is secondary and metaphorical, originating with Islamic mysticism.'

Another reader asks: 'Why do you insist on calling this a war?' We have not 
officially been at war since 1945, but Tony Blair swept objections aside when 
he said: 'Whatever the technical and legal issues about a declaration of war 
the fact is we are at war with terrorism.'

 Collins Dictionary defines war as 'any conflict or contest: a war of wits; 
the war against crime' , so to describe this as a war against terrorism seems 
reasonable.

And finally, one lonely voice calls out with a plea that, while technically 
correct, will I'm sure be lost in the clamour:

'In common with other media and the Prime Minister, you persistently use 
"America" and the "US" as if they are interchangeable. They are not. America is 
the continent; the US is but one country on it. It seems particularly important 
to observe the distinction in these dangerous times when sloppy usage is 
leading to sloppy thinking: it was not America that was attacked, it was the US.

'People in America, but outside the US, resent the invisibility that is 
imposed on them by using the name of the continent for the most powerful nation 
within it. You wouldn't refer to South Africa as Africa would you?'

Well, no, but surely context is all. We wouldn't, after all, refer to 'US the 
Beautiful' or 'God Bless US', 'the US dream' or 'the US way of life'. In an 
article that specifically referred to problems between the US, Canada and 
Mexico, America would not be acceptable as it could be confusing - but usually 
its meaning is perfectly clear.
