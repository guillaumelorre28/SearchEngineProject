Zoltán Kodály appears to have deliberately deprived himself of the pleasure of 
writing for the cello, his favourite instrument, when composing his string 
Serenade, Op 12 in 1920. Scored for two violins and viola, the texture is light 
and airy but the sonority rich and inventive, despite the lack of a 
conventional lower register. Like the Duo for Violin and Cello, Op 7, the 
Serenade abounds with acerbic Hungarian folk motifs and rhythms, energetically 
defined bythese seasoned players

Ernő Dohnányi’s Serenade for String Trio, Op 10 from 1902 is rooted more in the 
Brahmsian tradition, though Hungarian passion keeps bubbling to the surface.
