Pennsylvania <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania>.

The officers were responding to a domestic disturbance call in Canonsburg, 20 
miles south-west of Pittsburgh, at about 3.15am on Thursday.

State police trooper Melinda Bondarenka said the officers were “ambushed upon 
their arrival” at the scene and immediately shot. They were taken to hospital, 
where Canonsburg officer Scott Leslie Bashioum, age 52, died. The other 
officer, who has not been identified, is in fair condition, according to a 
hospital spokesman.

Authorities say the suspect, Michael Cwiklinski, is dead. Cwiklinski, 47, and 
an unidentified woman were found dead in a house down the street from where the 
ambush. Police have not released details about the initial domestic disturbance 
call but have said that there was an active protection from abuse order 
involved, according to thePittsburgh Tribune

“It is my sad duty to announce that one officer is deceased and the other 
officer has been flown to a Pittsburgh hospital,” Warco told reporters. 
“Obviously, it’s very sketchy at this point it’s still an active scene and 
search of the shooter.”

Local residents were advised to stay indoors while authorities searched for 
the gunman.

“When it first started, one was bleeding badly. The shooter had everyone 
pinned down when they were trying to get him. I don’t know where he was shot,” 
a firefighter said about the incident.
