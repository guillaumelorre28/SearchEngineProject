missed out on signing Holger Badstuber after Schalke concluded a loan deal for 
the Bayern Munich defender on Tuesday.

Kompany has featured only 29 times in the past two and a half seasons because 
of a series of problems and Guardiola may decide he cannot rely on the Belgian.

Schalke <https://www.theguardian.com/football/schalke>, however, were able to 
confirm that Badstuber has now joined them until the end of the season. The 
27-year-old defender has also extended his contract with Bayern until 2018.

Christian Heidel, Schalke’s sporting director, told Sky Sports Germany on 
Tuesday: “Badstuber is, when it comes to bringing the ball out of defence, one 
of the best, but he has been injured for a long time. He won’t have a 
guaranteed place even though he wants to get back to being the player he was 
two years ago.”

Badstuber has suffered a series of problems over the past four years and has 
featured only three times this season for Bayern.
