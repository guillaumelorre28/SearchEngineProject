Winning tip: Long slow journey in India


On my first ever visit to India I embarked on a 40-hour journey from Mumbai to 
Trivandrum. The sheer amount of time to be on a train was daunting, but it was 
the highlight of my trip. There may be journeys with more epic scenery, longer 
tunnels and higher bridges, but it’s the experiences inside the train that 
shine more than the sights outside. I shared the carriage with groups of 
singing/dancing schoolchildren, chatted to teachers, salesmen and chanting 
monks. The snacks offered change as you head south, along with the language and 
people. I only wish I’d chosen a longer journey.

The famous Glacier Express is fabulous, but expensive compared with an 
InterRail Pass. I took the Golden Pass Route across Switzerland between 
Montreux and Lucerne. Having never seen any Golden Pass marketing I figured 
that the journey couldn’t be that amazing if I wasn’t having to pay extra. 
Surprise number one was the train I boarded at Montreux: it resembled a 
miniature Orient Express, but almost unbelievably my InterRail pass was valid. 
The views over Lake Geneva from the left of the train were mind-blowing, the 
changes of train at Zweisimmen and Interlaken Ost couldn’t have been easier, 
and the best was yet to come. Sitting on the right on departure from Interlaken 
Ost, I had spectacular views over another three lakes, then at Meiringen the 
train reverses on to the steep rack section and it felt as if we were taking 
off. If you have an InterRail or Eurail Pass this journey is a must.

The Cuneo-Ventimiglia-Nice line, connecting Piedmont and the Italian Riviera 
with the South of France, is breathtakingly varied. Over a journey of 3½ hours 
one travels from the Alps to sea level and along the Côte d’Azur, across 
gorges, along viaducts and through tunnels, seeing Alpine villages and scenery, 
medieval Italian towns and the shimmering Provencal landscape. It’s a romantic 
and spectacular trip, surprisingly cheap (around €21 one way) and relatively 
unknown.

At 20km, it’s far from the longest rail journey in the world, but Norway’s 
Flamsbana is the most picturesque you could imagine. Built in the 1920s to 
improve rail access to Oslo and Bergen, the line is now almost exclusively used 
by tourists, who enjoy breathtaking views of the Norwegian mountains and fjords 
as the train winds round hairpin bends, through tunnels and behind waterfalls 
as it navigates the steep gradient. The 50-minute ride is a delight, and the 
best excuse to organise a longer visit to Norway!

In the Caucasus mountains of Georgia, the little-known Kukushka railway has 
connected the bustling tourist town of Borjomi and the mountain-top village of 
Bakuriani since 1902. This tourist train meanders through sleepy hamlets and 
thick pine forest twice a day in each direction, taking 2½ lazy hours and 
costing about 33p. The two carriages potter past secluded log cabins with 
smoking chimneys, neatly piled wood stacks and hanging vines. One 
ravine-spanning bridge was designed by none other than Gustave Eiffel and in 
winter snow hangs on branches while rail-workers snooze and play cards on board 
between tending the tracks.

By train is the best way to arrive in St Ives. Use the park and ride in St 
Erth, take your seat and glide past the Hayle estuary with the smell of the sea 
infusing the carriage. Around a corner past sand dunes, the views of Godrevy 
Lighthouse are mesmerising. This was the inspiration to Virginia Woolf’s novel. 
As the train arrives in Carbis Bay, the golden sand and palm trees resemble a 
tropical paradise. The final destination in St Ives is just a few steps from 
Porthminster beach and a short walk from the art galleries.

The Eastern (Doğu) Express makes its way from Ankara to Kars, in the far 
north-east, every night. For £25 each to share a surprisingly comfortable 
sleeper, the journey is a very affordable adventure (even cheaper for a 
four-berth cabin). The two-berth comes with a fridge stocked with complimentary 
snacks (we threw ours out of the window to some delighted children at a station 
in the middle of nowhere). The 24-hour journey has stunning views all along the 
Euphrates river, through valleys and tunnels, and time never dragged for us. 
Bring a picnic or ask a Turkish passenger to help you call ahead and order food 
from an upcoming station, as the restaurant car’s offerings are meagre.

Dramatic environmental changes are the highlight of this winter journey. A 
bullet train whips you from the sprawl of Tokyo to the northern tip of the main 
Japanese island, Honshu, in deep snow. The next train takes you through the 
Seikan tunnel, longest underwater tunnel in the world (with bad feng shui), to 
Hokkaido. Crab ramen and barbecued scallops from the seafood market at the next 
stop, Hakodate, are perfect to stamp out increasing cold. The final leg takes 
in lakes, bubbling sulphurous lunar landscapes and a still-growing mountain to 
come full urban circle in the lively young city of Sapporo.

We boarded the train from Chengdu for a three-day journey to Lhasa in Tibet. 
The railway is an engineering marvel, taking you across the permafrost and over 
the Tanggula pass at over 5,000m. This is surely the only train in the world 
where oxygen is pumped into the carriages. Sharing food, drink and an array of 
card games with our fellow passengers while watching the dramatic scenery 
unfold, and arriving at Tibet station in what seemed like an island city in the 
clouds, was unforgettable. We booked tickets locally but usedseat61.com

The BAM is hidden gem of Siberia, a long railway line through beautiful nature 
and true remoteness. It is significantly shorter than the Trans-Siberian and 
can be nicely combined with air travel to Irkutsk and boat trips on Baikal 
lake. A possible departing point is Severobaikalsk, a city on Baikal’s northern 
shore. Another is Taishet, where the BAM branches from the Trans-Siberian. From 
there it’s possible to travel by train (47 hours) to Tynda – with its 
impressive modern Soviet architecture, or further east to Komsomolsk-na-Amure 
(another 37 hours).

Train journeys don’t get much more adventurous than the Tazara railway, which 
makes its winding way from the Tanzanian capital, Dar-es-Salaam, to northern 
Zambia. There it turns into the Zambian national railway, which whisks you into 
Zambia’s wild heart towards the “smoke that thunders” (Victoria Falls) and the 
Zimbabwean border. TheTazara website <http://tazarasite.com/> advises booking 
at least a month in advance. Allow four-five days for the whole journey to 
Livingstone (about £40 one way) and take plenty of games and books. Once you’re 
on the train, make friends with travellers and locals over beers in the bar 
carriage and at night make sure you enjoy the magnificent display of the Milky 
Way over Zambia’s unspoilt bushland.

We took the Sunday steam trainfrom Bogotá to Zipiquaria’s Salt Cathedral along 
with a throng of noisy Colombians. The guard shouted instructions in Spanish, 
but after noting we looked bemused sidled up to us and said in perfect English: 
“Follow me.” The carriages, as old as the puffing engine, had grand leather 
seats. On the two-hour, 20km journey we were entertained by lively, loud jazz 
and soul bands strolling through the carriages and ate from vendors offering 
plantain-wrapped tamales, Colombiantinto (coffee), empanadas and huge, 
creamy-whitemerengon (meringues). And the highlight was meant to be the 
Cathedral.

Starting from San Luis Obispo, the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner runs on a 
breathtaking route along the rugged coastline south to San Diego. The train 
hugs the Pacific Coast Highway before making a stop at the beautiful 
architectural mishmash of Union Station, Los Angeles. It negotiates the sprawl 
of LA before again reaching the coast. The train runs parallel to the Old 
Pacific Highway, giving stunning views of the ocean and the surfers. The final 
stretch goes through the coastal cities of Oceanside, Solana Beach and Del Mar 
to historic San Diego.
