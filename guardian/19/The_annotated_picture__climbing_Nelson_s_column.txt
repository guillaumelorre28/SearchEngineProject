1 The climber

Luke Jones, a 30-year-old former rope-access technician who now works for 
Greenpeace full-time, has previously climbed on to the roofs of Parliament and 
the National Gallery. He is currently on bail after being arrested on suspicion 
of causing criminal damage, although he says he caused none.No previous climber 
of Nelson’s column has been prosecuted for it

Hidden behind this carving of a coil of rope is Ali Garrigan, Jones’s 
team-mate for this climb. She is holding the end of the yellow line that would 
have caught him if he had fallen. In 2013, she climbed the Shard.

Beginning at 4am, Jones and Garrigan used a 15-metre ladder to reach the base 
of the column itself, then “aid climbed” up its lightning conductor and free 
climbed over the floral capital. The most technically difficult part of the 
climb was the statue itself, however. Jones chose a route up Nelson’s right 
leg, then on to his right arm, from where he was able to fix a sling round his 
neck.

The air in London, and elsewhere, is what the climb was all about. Pollution 
levels inthe capital have been illegally high

 for many years, and will remain so until 2025, even under the government’s 
reduction plans.
