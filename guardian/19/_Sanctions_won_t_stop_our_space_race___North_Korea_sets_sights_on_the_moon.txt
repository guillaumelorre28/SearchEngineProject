North Korean space officials say they are hard at work on a five-year plan to 
launch more advanced satellites into orbit by 2020.

But they don’t intend to stop there: they’re also apparently aiming to plant a 
flag on the moon. A senior official at North Korea’s version of Nasa said that 
he hopes to see the DPRK’s flag in space “within 10 years”.

“Even though the US and its allies try to block our space development, our 
aerospace scientists will conquer space,” said Hyon Kwang-il, director of the 
scientific research department of North Korea’s National Aerospace Development 
Administration.

According to experts, an unmanned North Korean moon mission isn’t that 
far-fetched. While the US is the only country to have conducted manned lunar 
missions, other countries have sent up unmanned spacecraft, and have in that 
sense “planted” their flags.

Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and expert on international satellites 
and satellite launches, said “it would be a significant increase in technology, 
not one that is beyond them.”

Hyon said the current five-year plan, drawn up at the behest of the leader Kim 
Jong-un <https://www.theguardian.com/world/kim-jong-un>, focuses on launching 
more Earth observation satellites and its first geostationary communications 
satellite which, technologically, would be a major step forward. He said 
universities are also expanding programmes to train rocket scientists.

“All of this work will be the basis for the flight to the moon,” Hyon said, 
adding that he would like to see that happen “within 10 years”.

North Korea has marked a number of successes in its space programme and its 
development of incresingly sophisticated long-range missiles formilitary use 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missile-says-south>
.

On Wednesday, it test-fired what was believed to be a medium-range ballistic 
missileinto the seas off Japan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missile-says-south>
, the fourth reported weapons launch in two weeks.

It launched its latest satellite the Kwangmyongsong 4, or Brilliant Star 4 
into orbit in February, just one month after conducting what it claims was its 
firstsuccessful hydrogen bomb test 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/north-korean-nuclear-test-suspected-as-artificial-earthquake-detected>
.

The launches brought new international sanctions as nuclear tests and rocket 
launches, which can have military applications, are banned underUnited Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations> resolutions.

Hyon branded the sanctions as “ridiculous”, adding: “Our country has started 
to accomplish our plan and we have started to gain a lot of successes. No 
matter what anyone thinks, our country will launch more satellites.”

He claimed that North Korea’s long-term target is to use its satellites to 
provide data for crop and forestry assessments and improved communications.

Judging from what I have seen, it will take North Korea about a decade or more 
to get to lunar orbit
Markus Schiller 
The US made its first lunar flyby in 1959, only six months after its first 
satellite, Explorer 1, though it took eight more years and several failed 
attempts to succeed with a lunar orbiter. The USSR made its first moon shot 
after only three successful Sputnik satellites. Its probe just a year and a 
half after Sputnik 1 reached the moon, but missed its orbit.

“So it’s not ridiculous to attempt a moon mission early in your space 
programme,” McDowell said.

“Given their low flight rate of one mission every few years, I think it is 
hard to see them succeeding in this in the next five years, but possible to see 
them attempting it,” he added.

North Korea <https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea> currently has two 
satellites in orbit, KMS-3-2 and KMS-4. It put its first satellite in orbit in 
2012, a feat few other countries have achieved. Its sworn enemy, South Korea, 
has yet to do so.

Hyon said that as of 27 July , KMS-4 had completed 2,513 orbits, and that 
within one day after its launch it transmitted 700 photographic images back to 
Earth. He said it is still working properly and sending data whenever it passes 
over North Korea, which is four times a day.

Foreign experts have yet to confirm any communications from the satellite. 
“There’s been no independent evidence that KMS-4 sent data back, but no 
evidence that it didn’t, either,” McDowell said.

German analyst Markus Schiller, an expert on North Korea’s missiles and 
rockets, said a geostationary satellite might be a more ambitious goal for the 
country than a lunar flyby or crash-landing.

“Hitting the moon hard would require less performance power, rocket size than 
getting into GEO [geostationary equatorial orbit], but it will still be quite a 
challenge,” he said.

“Judging from what I have seen so far with their space programme, it will take 
North Korea about a decade or more to get to lunar orbit at best if they really 
pursue this mission,” he said. “My personal guess, however, is that they might 
try but they will fail, and we will not see a successful North Korea lunar 
orbiter for at least two decades, if ever.”

Hyon said claims that North Korea’s space plan is a military programme in 
disguise are hypocritical, considering the history of space exploration. The US 
Russia and China all built their space programs out of military technology. “It 
is the US that militarised space,” he said.
