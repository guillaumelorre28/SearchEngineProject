Whitewater kayaking, New Zealand


New Zealand is considered one of the world’s best locations for kayaking, 
dubbed by tour operator Water By Nature as “Paddlers Paradise”. This thrilling 
two-week trip – suitable for more experienced kayakers (class 3+/4-) – is led 
by experts JJ Shepherd, Mike Abbott and Koryn Gould, who have lived with some 
of the world’s finest rivers on their doorstep. The trip will include paddling 
the Hurunui and Buller rivers, as well as taking on the 11-metre Maruia Falls, 
with helicopter flights on three of the days, giving visitors plenty of 
opportunities to take in the spectacular views below. Granted, it’s a trip that 
will most likely appeal to the more committed kayakers out there. Those after a 
more accessible, cheaper, white-water adventure could try out a three-night
rafting trip in Switzerland

 (from £605 including accommodation and most meals), with a chance to try some 
paragliding or mountain biking.

An Olympics sport since 1996, mountain biking has long been a popular holiday 
activity. For those feeling inspired by the pros, who will be tackling steep 
drops and rough terrain on the Rio off-road course on 20-21 August, it’s easy 
to find affordable biking holidays. Experienced cycling-tour company Skedaddle 
runs plenty of mountain bike holidays, many in the UK. One of the stand-out 
trips, however, is a nine-day, vehicle-supported tour across the stunning Jebel 
Sirwa mountain range in Morocco, sleeping under the stars in the Sahara and 
camping with nomads in the mountains. The trip will take bikers past ancient 
kasbahs and traditional villages, with pit stops for mint teas and in the odd 
oasis to cool off in.
• £945 for nine days, including all accommodation and most meals,

Olympic equestrian events can be a little difficult to relate to at times. 
Watching an aristocrat make a horse dance during dressage isn’t quite the same 
as galloping down the beach with the wind in one’s hair, while the waves crash 
in. With that in mind, for those looking for an Olympic-inspired horsey 
holiday, we would suggest opting for the latter. Horse-riding travel specialist 
Zara’s Planet offers aneight-day tour of Sardinia 
<http://www.zarasplanet.com/travel/horse-riding-holidays-italy-sardinia-trails/>
 that combines country trails and beach rides, staying in an old country house, 
with swimming pool, jacuzzi and terrace, where fantastic Italian cooking can be 
sampled. But, for a horse-riding holiday that truly screams “epic”, a trip to
Bitterroot Ranch 
<http://www.zarasplanet.com/travel/horse-riding-holidays-usa-wyoming-bitterroot/>
 (from £1,600 including all meals and accommodation in log cabins), in the 
heart of America’s Marlboro country in Wyoming, could be the answer.

tranquil rocky beaches, warm water and small fishing communities. Swimtrek 
offers a seven-day guided tour based on the Šibenik archipelago, visiting 
islands such as car-free Zlarin, a beautiful, peaceful spot with an attractive 
village. There will also be a chance to visit inland sites, such as the Krka

For the more target-oriented among us, there are few places that offer such a 
perfect set-up as the Tiroler Adler hotel in Waidring, Austria. The traditional 
hotel, surrounded by mountains and at the head of the Pillersee Valley, is 
surrounded by an impressive set of archery courses, where packages offering 
plenty of time to learn – or perfect – bow-and-arrow skills can be booked. The 
archery centres are not just your typical bullseye-on-haystack fare – they have 
targets hidden among the forests and ferns in the form of artificial deer, 
stags, bears and various other majestic woodland creatures to challenge the aim 
and help visitors get lost in a timeless huntsman (or woman) fantasy.

Wild Atlantic Cycling is a new, small travel company running cycling holidays 
along theWild Atlantic Way <http://www.wildatlanticway.com>, the route from the 
southernmost to northernmost tip of Ireland (Mizen to Malin). The company 
states: “Think of it as the Irish equivalent of Britain’s Land’s End to John 
O’Groats, but with rugged coastline, Irish music, unique landscapes and lively 
pubs.” Pub stops aside, the 525-mile route is definitely a significant 
adventure, involving six days of cycling with around 85 miles tackled each day. 
Still, the trip is fully supported, meaning you can focus on the ride and the 
views, without the hassle of planning the trip independently.

If we start off by acknowledging that most of us stand no chance at all of 
launching off a diving board with the style and finesse of Tom Daley, then 
jumping off a cliff is probably as close as we’ll ever get to tasting what it’s 
like to be an Olympic diver. In Mallorca, this can be achieved safely while on 
holiday. Willing lemmings will be tutored in the best technique for launching 
themselves into the sea from a height, starting at three metres, before 
building up to an impressive 12 metres. For a more varied activity day, cliff 
jumping can be combined with coasteering, involving scrambling, swimming and 
abseiling along the coastline.
