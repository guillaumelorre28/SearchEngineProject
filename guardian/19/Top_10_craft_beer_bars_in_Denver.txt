Wynkoop Brewing Company

Denver’s original craft brewery, Wynkoop has been around since 1988, but age 
hasn’t stopped it experimenting: gummy bears, green chillies, and Rocky 
Mountain oysters (otherwise known as bull testicles) have all made it into 
Wynkoop’s brews. In a former Victorian warehouse, it has pressed-tin ceilings, 
arched windows, and hardwood floors, making Wynkoop an elegant place to enjoy a 
pint and maybe a dish from the beer-infused menu (soups and salads from $6, 
burgers and sandwiches from $9 ). Choose the Rail Yard amber ale ($5) and 
you’re in good company: it’s what President Obama and Colorado governor John 
Hickenlooper, one of Wynkoop’s original founders, enjoyed over a game of 
billiards here in 2014.

With 18 Great American Beer Festival 
<https://www.greatamericanbeerfestival.com/> medals to its name, Great Divide 
is often packed shoulder-to-shoulder at weekends. However, it’s worth squeezing 
into the red-brick taproom, in an old dairy processing plant, to sample some of 
its 16 award-winning beers. A popular brew is theEspresso Oak Aged Yeti 
<http://greatdivide.com/beers/espresso-oak-aged-yeti/> Imperial Stout, which is 
bold, malty – and infused with locally roasted coffee. Mind you, at 9.5% ABV, 
you might want to line your stomach with something from the nearby food trucks 
first. If things get too crowded, check out Great Divide’s barrel bar in the
RiNo Art District <http://www.rivernorthart.com/>, which has plans for a new 
brewery, restaurant, and taproom.

Ratio Beerworks

Punk rock meets craft beer at Ratio, where beers named after bands are 
displayed above the bar on an illuminated bulletin board with movable letters – 
the kind more commonly seen outside gig venues. One of Denver’s newest 
breweries (it opened in February 2015), Ratio has six flagship beers on tap, 
each with its own distinct flavour and finish. Most popular are Repeater, an 
extra pale ale ($5), and Dear You, a Frenchsaison ale ($6). Ratio’s taproom is 
a riot of colour, with geometric wallpaper, canary-yellow bar stools, and 
industrial red-trim benches, while the patio is the perfect spot for a game of 
corn hole or ladder golf.

Vine Street Pub

From the cosy living room atmosphere to the patio shaded by honey locust 
trees, laid-back Vine Street is the epitome of Colorado. Instead of the 
widescreen TVs found in bars across the US, the walls are adorned with 
psychedelic rock posters and striking chalkboard art, which is wiped away and 
replaced every few months. Award-winning brews include the hoppy Colorado Kind 
Ale and Illusion Dweller IPA (both $5). If that’s not enough to whet your 
appetite, Vine Street’s locally sourced food menu has 12 award-winning burger 
combinations, including local favourite Junk Burger: bacon, cheese, sautéed 
mushrooms and onions, and roasted garlic mayo ($9.45).

Black Shirt Brewing Co

Is there a better match than live music and craft beer? Black Shirt doesn’t 
think so. Guitars and concert posters line the walls of this small-batch 
brewery, and local bands are queuing up to perform on the makeshift stage built 
from wooden pallets in its backyard. Following the philosophy: “Do one thing 
and do it better than anyone else,” Black Shirt only brews red ales – and boy, 
does them well. The Colorado Red ($6) is strong and malty with a hint of hops 
and toffee, while the Celery Gose ($5), features yuzu (an Asian citrus fruit), 
lemongrass, and fresh celery. And while Black Shirt doesn’t do meals, it has 
perfected the art of bar snacks – serving popcorn, pretzels, beef jerky and 
pickles.

Baere Brewing Company

Baere may be next to a tax advice office in an old strip mall, but don’t let 
its neighbour fool you. Inside, this small brewhouse is furnished with 
reclaimed wooden pallets and has a bar made from old boxcar flooring. It also 
serves wonderful beers with a slight Belgian bent. Grab a game of Connect Four 
and enjoy a pint of C3(i)PA, a light and tangy pale ale with citrussy overtones 
($5), or perhaps a Big Hoppy Brown for something dark, roasty, and sweet ($5). 
Appearances can be deceptive.

noon-11pm, Sun noon-6pm

Trve Brewing Company

For those who want their suds with a side of heavy metal, Trve (pronounced 
“True”) takes regular brews and cranks them up to 11. But the sour and 
barrel-aged beers at this shotgun shack-esque taproom – all black walls, dark 
wood, and Tribulation (death metal, now that you ask) blasting from the 
speakers – attract more than just metalheads. From Wanderlust, a Belgo-American 
pale ale fusion ($5) to Possession, a hoppy saison ($6), there’s something for 
everybody.

Open Mon-Thurs 3pm-11pm, Fri-Sat noon-midnight, Sun noon-10pm

Spangalang Brewery

In homage to the Five Points neighbourhood it calls home – once a hotbed of 
the American jazz scene – Spangalang takes its name from a jazz term referring 
to a cymbal pattern. Take a seat at the bar, crafted from Douglas fir, and 
check out the vintage album cover wall art as you choose from a menu of IPAs, 
Belgians, sours and saisons – just what you’d expect from the three former 
Great Divide craft brewers who founded it. Sugarfoot ($4), a Belgian beer 
spiced with coriander, orange peel and lemon peel, won a gold medal at the 2015 
Great American Beer Festival, and a bronze at the 2016 World Beer Cup. While 
you’re at it, why not order some bacon jalapeño poppers ($6) from theZivix 
<http://www.zivixfivepoints.com/> kitchen next door?

Crooked Stave 

If you can’t get enough of Belgian sour beers, Crooked Stave has a cult-like 
following thanks to its barrel-aged experimental beers. In theSource 
<http://www.thesourcedenver.com/>, an artisan market in a former ironworks 
factory, the look is industrial chic: bare brick, exposed beams and stainless 
steel. Signature suds include Surette Provision Saison ($6), Nightmare on 
Brett, aged in red wine casks ($12), and lighter, fruitier sours flavoured with 
blackberry and passion fruit ($7). No food, but the tacos atComida 
<http://www.eatcomida.com/>, also in the Source, are highly recommended.

Renegade Brewing Company

With its exposed brick walls, a bar made from exotic woods, and coat racks 
made from railroad spikes, Renegade is right at home in the hipSanta Fe Art 
District <http://www.artdistrictonsantafe.com/>. A large window offers a view 
of the 15-barrel brewing system at the back, and outside food trucks serve 
anything from grilled cheese to Venezuelan empanadas. Always popular is 
Endpoint Triple IPA ($6.50) and Hiatus ($5.60), a delicious cold coffee-infused 
oatmeal ale. On a warm day when Renegade opens its garage doors to let in the 
sun, you’d be hard-pushed to beat it.
