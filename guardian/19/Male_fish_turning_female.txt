All male fish sampled in the River Aire in Yorkshire show signs of 
feminisation - and "gender-bending" chemicals in the water could be to blame, 
scientists said yesterday.

Alan Pickering, director of the centre for ecology and hydrology at Windermere 
in Cumbria, told the science festival that a survey of some other rivers in 
Britain could show similar results. In some cases the endocrine-disrupting 
chemicals which seemed to behave like female hormones came from industrial 
detergents.

Others were natural hormones, from human waste, "reactivated" by microbes in 
the sewage treatment system.

Fish had similar endocrine systems to humans and male fish were showing 
responses to the chemicals.

Fish were showing similar changes in France, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany and 
Finland.
