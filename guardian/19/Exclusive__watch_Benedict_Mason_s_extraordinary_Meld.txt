The event was filmed with multiple cameras positioned around the hall, but 
also by GoPro cameras attached to the performers. The end result places the 
audience at the heart of the experience, giving a vivid sense of the movements 
and interactions of the musicians and singers with the space. The film’s 
digital premiere is here, exclusively on the Guardian until 10am on Monday 4 
July.
