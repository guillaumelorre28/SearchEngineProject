Bouldin Creek Coffeehouse

Austin gained a reputation as a mecca for hippies during the "cosmic cowboy" 
days of the 1970s, and no neighbourhood keeps it weird like South Austin. 
Bouldin Creek Coffeehouse was a staple on South First Street well before it 
became a restaurant row for foodies. You won't find any meat on the menu, but 
the dishes are creative enough – zucchini migas, potato leek omelette, sweet 
potato pecan tamales – that you might not even notice. Though the restaurant 
recently moved from its much-beloved original location (now home to 
Vietnamese-French eateryElizabeth Street Cafe <http://elizabethstreetcafe.com/> 
that serves lovely croissants, homemade jam, Stumptown coffee and even a 
breakfast pho), the new space, just a few blocks away, feels much brighter, 
cleaner and easier to navigate. The large patio is perfect for people (and dog) 
watching, and if you leave room for dessert, try a macaron fromLa Patisserie 
<http://lpaustin.com/> or a cupcake from Sugar Mama's Bakeshop 
<http://www.sugarmamasbakeshop.com>, which are both nearby.

Kerbey Lane Cafe

This Austin institution has been serving seasonal spins on traditional 
favourites, like pumpkin pancakes over the autumn and tomato pie in the middle 
of summer, 24-hours-a-day for the past 30 years. With five locations around the 
city, everyone makes their way into Kerbey Lane – or its rival,Magnolia Cafe 
<http://themagnoliacafe.com/>, which claims to be open "24/8" – at some point 
during their time in the capital city. The tattooed servers are happy to give 
you tips on their favourite places to grab a drink or listen to live music and, 
if you like their pancakes, you can buy the mix at just about any local grocery 
store.

Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill

Moonshine's Sunday brunch, which runs from 9.30am to 2.30pm, is arguably the 
most popular in Austin, especially with its $16.95 price tag. Don't skip the 
green chilli cheese grits, made with the famous Hatch green chillies of New 
Mexico, or the cornflake-crusted fried chicken tenders (skinless, boneless 
breast). If a cucumber cosmo martini hasn't satisfied your sweet tooth, try the 
white chocolate bread pudding with bourbon sauce. The restaurant is housed in 
one of the oldest buildings downtown and, if you're lucky, you can grab a seat 
on the shaded patio that faces a quiet street and forget you're just a few 
blocks from the interstate.

The Omelettry

An old-school diner that has been packed with college students and families 
almost every weekend since it opened in 1978. The owner recently extended its 
hours to stay open until 10pm and will soon add a dinner menu, but almost 
everyone comes for breakfast favourites such as cheesy omelettes and 
chocolate-chip pancakes. It's a cash-only establishment but, like many 
restaurants in Austin without a beer or liquor licence, you can bring your own 
alcohol. As one of the cheapest breakfast spots in town, don't be surprised if 
you have to wait for a table on a Saturday or Sunday morning.
• 4811 Burnet Road, +1 512 453 5062, theomelettry.com 
<http://www.theomelettry.com>, omelettes from $6. Open every day, 7am-10pm

Biscuits and Groovy

You can't throw a drumstick without finding a food trailer in Austin, but 
Biscuits and Groovy, located in the heart of one of the city's most walkable 
and family-friendly neighbourhoods, is one of the few specialising in 
breakfast. Run by a vegan who originally didn't offer any meat products, the 
menu has expanded to include bacon, sausage and traditional white gravy. But if 
you're looking for a meat-free take on biscuits and gravy, this is the place – 
the vegan Bootlegger Brown Ale version is a little on the sweet side, though. 
Try the Donna Summer biscuits topped with eggs, sausage, cheese, gravy and 
chives, or the Philly Nelson, named for local celebrity Willie Nelson, which 
includes the sliced meat usually found on Philly cheesesteaks.
• 5015 Duval Street, +1 512 804 8285, iwantbiscuits.com <http://www. 
iwantbiscuits.com>, plates from $6. Open Mon-Fri 9am-2pm, Sat-Sun 8.30am-2pm

Tamale House East

You can't leave Austin without trying migas, another signature breakfast dish 
made from eggs and tortillas. Instead of wrapping the egg (and cheese, 
potatoes, beans, bacon and whatever other toppings you'd like) in the 
tortillas, migas are made by scrambling eggs, cheese, peppers and salsa 
together with strips of corn tortillas. No one does it better than Tamale House 
East, the newest restaurant from the family that has long operated other Tamale 
House restaurants in the city. Several of the siblings who run the place are 
artists and architects, so the inside seating area and large patios are filled 
with sculptures, mosaics, fountains and plants.

24 Diner

For an upscale diner experience, complete with cocktails and a nice beer list, 
in a space that feels more like a mid-century modern eatery than a typical 
pancake house, check out 24 Diner. Chef Andrew Curren, who briefly appeared on 
the most recent season of Top Chef on cable TV, serves hash, waffles and 
frittatas made with locally sourced vegetables and meats, as well as burgers, 
sandwiches and other lunch items. (Austinite Paul Qui, who ended up winning Top 
Chef, doesn't serve breakfast at his restaurant,Uchiko 
<http://uchiaustin.com/uchiko>, or his East Side King <http://eskaustin.com/> 
trailers, but you should try to check them out when you're in town anyway.) 
This popular eatery often has a queue, but you can take a stroll through
Waterloo Records <http://waterloorecords.com/Home> or Whole Foods Market 
<http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/lamar>'s flagship store nearby while 
you wait for a table. Gluten-free friendly.

Maria's Taco Xpress

Speaking of hippies, Maria Corbalan may be the queen of them all. Every 
Sunday, she hosts what has become known as "hippie church" at her quirky South 
Austin taco restaurant, Maria's Taco Xpress. Grab a bloody Mary or anagua fresca
 (a traditional Mexican fruit drink) and a few breakfast tacos and head out to 
the patio, where you'll find regulars dancing to live music until 2pm. The 
eccentric space is filled with Corbalan's funky, hand-drawn murals and mantras 
about being happy and finding peace through friends and food.

Contigo Austin

Still considered a new kid on the local restaurant scene but, in less than two 
years, the ranch-inspired, mostly outdoor eatery in East Austin has garnered a 
huge following, especially for its Sunday brunch. Only in a place like Austin, 
where winter lasts about six weeks, could you pull off a restaurant that is 
almost entirely outdoors. Homemade English muffins, challah and biscuits show 
up in a number of dishes, including the rabbit and dumplings and eggs Benedict, 
which is topped with ham that chef Andrew Wiseheart cures in house. Not in the 
mood for pork? Try the house-cured salmon instead. While the dinner menu 
features a number of pates and charcuterie, at brunch offal lovers will have to 
get by with the beef tongue hash and a bloody Mary that can be made with aqua 
vit, vodka, white whisky or Tequila.

The Sustainable Food Center Farmers' Market Downtown

The City of Austin recently allowed hot food to be prepared and served at 
local farmers' markets, which means that some of the best breakfasts being 
served in Austin on any given Saturday are at the downtown market in Republic 
Square Park. In addition to farmers, ranchers, bakers and cheesemakers, you'll 
find chefs preparing fresh breakfast at a number of booths. Among them is star 
locavore chefJesse Griffiths 
<http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/2012-09-14/locavore-chef/>, who serves a 
different menu every weekend, depending on what ingredients he can get from 
farmers and ranchers. Another favourite is mobile pizzeriaBola Pizza 
<http://www.bolapizza.com/>, which offers breakfast pizzas made with raw milk 
cheddar, shaved red onions and farm fresh eggs. You'll also find breakfast 
tacos fromTacodeli <http://tacodeli.com/> and freshly made sweet kolaches (a 
Czech pastry popular in Central Texas) fromThe Zubik House
