 in 2014 after spending six years over two spells with the Spanish club. “Diego 
Costa is our player.He’s a fantastic player with fundamental importance. He’s 
very happy and is working hard,” Conte said day.

The manager is also ready to give the winger Juan Cuadrado a chance to prove 
himself at Stamford Bridge. The Colombia international was sent on loan to 
Juventus last season and scored five goals in 40 appearances to help the 
Italian side to the league and cup double.

“Cuadrado is Chelsea’s player. I like him. He arrived today and this afternoon 
he starts to train with us,” said the 46-year-old during the club’s pre-season 
training camp in Austria.

Conte will begin his tenure in England with a London derby against West Ham 
United at Stamford Bridge on 15 August.
