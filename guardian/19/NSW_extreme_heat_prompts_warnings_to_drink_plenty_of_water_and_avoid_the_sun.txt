“The best way to reduce the risk of heat-related illness is to drink plenty of 
water and keep your body as cool as possible, and avoid prolonged sun exposure 
by staying indoors in cool or air-conditioned facilities,” the Bureau of 
Meteorology said.

Surf lifesavers are urging those who head to the beach to watch themselves and 
loved ones for signs of heat stress, such as dizziness, fatigue and headaches. 
They also want swimmers to stay between the flags.

“Lifeguards and lifesavers have been extremely busy over the last few weeks 
and we are urging the public to do what they can to help lessen the load by 
taking some responsibility for their own safety,” Surf Lifesaving NSW advised 
in a statement.

While a wind change is expected to bring relief to those in southern and 
central coastal parts of NSW on Thursday, the heat is tipped to build again on 
Friday.
