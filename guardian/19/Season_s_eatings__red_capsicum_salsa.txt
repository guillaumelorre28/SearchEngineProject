Capsicums can be eaten fresh, pickled, smoked, dried or roasted. From the 
nightshade family, native to the Americas, the large bell peppers or capsicums 
commonly come in traffic-light colours: red, orange/yellow and green.


The fruit of most species of capsicum contains capsaicin. This is a chemical 
that produces the hot pungency or spiciness – the burning sensation found in a 
chilli pepper. This is not a taste, rather it is a reaction. The capsaicin is 
not present in the seeds, as most people think, but in the membranes 
surrounding them; in the white bits and, to a lesser extent, in the flesh.

Most mammals can “taste” the capsaicin, finding it either unpleasant or 
delicious depending on perspective, whereas birds are unaffected. The bright 
colours of the fruit attract the birds, who then devour them and distribute the 
seeds. These fruits come in a huge number of varieties, including paprika, 
jalapeno, habanero and the many varieties of chilli. The capsicum itself does 
not contain capsaicin.

At the market, choose a squeaky skinned capsicum. The flesh should be firm and 
clear, without any soft spots.

Some kind of alchemy happens in the roasting of a ripe red capsicum. The smoky 
flavours infuse the sweet red flesh that softens into a delicious slippery 
mess. You might as well roast more capsicums than this recipe calls for as they 
make such a delicious addition to a pasta sauce or can be used in myriad other 
ways. They keep in the fridge, submerged in oil, for more than a week.

Start a salsa with fresh and in-season ingredients and you’ll be ahead. Once 
you have that, the work of a good salsa is only in the chopping, which can take 
a little time. Also, it’s always best to use whole spices and toast and grind 
them yourself – it makes a great deal of difference to their pungency. They 
will be fresh and beautifully fragrant. Use an electric spice grinder, or the 
rough grind of a mortar and pestle will be fine. After chopping the fresh 
ingredients, and toasting and grinding the spices, it’s simply a matter of 
assembling the salsa with a gentle stir and you’re ready.

This salsa should be a small but important part of a Mexican feast. Serve it 
alongside a salsa verde and guacamole with tortilla, as part of a taco. Or as 
we have, serve with corn chips or toasted tortilla strips as an 
assemble-yourself-tostada – with cold beers, on a summer evening.

Red capsicum salsa

2 red capsicum, roasted, deseeded, and the skin removed
3 large tomatoes, deseeded
1 red capsicum, deseeded
1 red onion, chopped finely
½ cup of fresh coriander, washed, picked and chopped roughly
1 tbsp fennel seeds, toasted and ground
1 tbsp coriander seeds, toasted and ground
Juice of 1 lemon, or juice of 2 limes
Sea salt, to taste
3 tbsp olive oil

To roast the capsicums, put capsicums on a roasting tray in a hot oven (200C) 
and roast until their skin is black and their form has collapsed. This should 
take about 40 minutes.


Once their skin is black, remove from the oven and place the roasted capsicums 
in a clean plastic bag to sweat. This sweating separates the skin from the 
flesh. Once the capsicums have cooled, remove from the bag and discard the skin 
and seeds. Chop them and the fresh ingredients, and assemble the salsa with the 
spices, lemon juice, salt and oil. The salsa gets better after sitting for a 
little while.

Serves 8 as a starter with corn chips or toasted tortilla strips.
