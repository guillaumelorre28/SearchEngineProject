“I knew I had always a chance to break her, so I just kept fighting,” says 
Stevastova. It’s a fair analysis. Konta landed just 56% of her first serves, a 
poor statistic by her standards, and won only 45% of those points. It meant she 
couldn’t dictate the rallies as she does when at her best. She also made 34 
unforced errors. Sevastova conceded that the light – bright at one end, dark at 
the other – made things difficult, but ultimately she coped with those 
conditions better than Konta. Whether she also handled her emotions as well as 
she might have, only she’ll know. But she often looked somewhere between 
distraught and despairing, and Konta was unable to take advantage of that. It 
was a strange match, partly because of that emotional dynamic, but the bottom 
line is that Konta is out, spelling the end of the British challenge in the 
women’s singles, while Sevastova is through to her first grand slam 
quarter-final. On this evidence, her tussle with the winner of Wozniacki and 
Keys will make for fascinating viewing. Thanks for reading and don’t forget to

Sevastova wins 6-4, 7-5!

Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 7-5 Konta* (*denotes server)

It’s all over! But boy, it can be a cruel game, tennis. At 15-15, the 
scrambling Konta clips the net tape with a forehand. The ball dies on her side 
of the court and so too do her hopes of a first US Open quarter-final. A 
brilliant, instinctive forehand winner from Sevastova brings up two match 
points, but she only needs the one. Sevastova becomes the first Latvian player 
to reach the last eight at a major since Larisa Neiland at Wimbledon in 1994 .

Two match points come and gone? Coruscating forehand winner from your opponent 
on the opening point? Tricky smash directly into the glaring New York sun? No 
problem, no problem and no problem. At least, not if your name is Anastasija 
Sevastova. She holds with something to spare. It makes no sense. This match 
doesn’t make sense. ButJohanna Konta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/johanna-konta> had better make sense of it 
all quickly, because she’ll have to serve to stay in the match. Again.

Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 5-5 Konta* (*denotes server)

Having retired from tennis three years ago, Sevastova was a point away from a 
US Open quarter-final in the previous game. The question in this game was 
always going to be how she responded. For three points, she looked distraught. 
But at 40-0, Konta became overcautious just as Sevastova started to loosen up 
again. It was the worst possible combination for Konta, who lost four points in 
succession to go match point down for a second time. However, a fine first 
serve from the seeded player – deep, high and accurate down the middle – 
produced a missed forehand return from Sevastova, and the chance was gone. From 
there, and with her opponent a picture of frustration, Konta held on with some 
courageous play. What a contest this has become.

Second set: Sevastova* 6-4, 5-4 Konta (*denotes server)

Remarkable stuff as Konta, peering over the abyss, somehow manages to survive. 
At 15-30, she bravely draws Sevastova in before winning the point with a 
crunching crosscourt backhand. Sevastova hits back to bring up a match point at 
40-30, only for another gutsy backhand to pull Konta back from the brink. A 
wayward Sevastova forehand at deuce produces a break point, which Konta 
converts with a flicked backhand that sails over the Latvian’s head at an 
awkward height. Sevastova didn’t know whether to hit it. Or even if she could 
hit it. But she won’t be happy.

Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 5-3 Konta* (*denotes server)

There’s a touch of the Andy Murrays about Konta at times – like the Scot, she 
left home as a teenager to hone her game at the Sánchez-Casal Academy in 
Barcelona – and, as she sends down a succession of lovely, crisp two-fisted 
backhands, the comparison comes to mind more than once in this game. Where they 
differ is that Murray is rarely guilty of letting his opponents off the hook 
with a succession of unforced errors. It’s a nervy affair, this game, with 
Sevastova wasting two game points before she finally puts away a drive volley 
that, in any sane world, would have been an overhead. Still, it’s a break for 
the Latvian and she will now serve for the match.

Second set: Sevastova* 6-4, 4-3 Konta (*denotes server)

Is Konta finally, belatedly, gathering momentum? Serving to move within a game 
of the match, Sevastova falls behind, recovers to 30-40 with some enterprising 
play that includes a majestic half-volleyed forehand winner, but is finally 
undone by some aggressive Konta counter-attacking. The plot thickens. Again.

Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 4-2 Konta* (*denotes server)

Better from Konta. Not only does she find some of her trademark poise behind 
her serve, she also caps a love game by racing forward to produce an 
unanswerable angle off the cutest of Sevastova drop shots. Food for thought for 
the Latvian.

Second set: Sevastova* 6-4, 4-1 Konta (*denotes server)

Long before this perplexing and at times bizarre contest started, Adrian 
Fowell emailed in to say: “For what it’s worth, I think Konta will blitz this. 
Straight sets, no bagels.” No one could have predicted this, Adrian, no one. 
But right now, Sevastova is looking the likelier to do any blitzing. She holds 
convincingly and is now just a couple of games from the last eight.

Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 3-1 Konta* (*denotes server)

A bad start for Konta – who takes a ball in her midriff after working her way 
forward in promising style on the opening point – quickly gets worse. It was a 
short volley that did the damage, and another brings up three break points for 
Sevastova, the Latvian races forward to whip a crosscourt forehand pass beyond 
her stranded opponent. A beauty of a drop shot wraps up a love break. Back to 
square one for Konta.

Second set: Sevastova* 6-4, 2-1 Konta (*denotes server)

After some patchy play from Sevastova, Konta gets a short ball on her forehand 
at 15-30 and leathers it for a winner. The shot sounded crisp, like it came 
right out of the middle of the racket, and it provided her with the platform to 
outrally Sevastova on the next point and claw back the break immediately. A 
turning point? If it means she’s found her range at last, maybe. But in this 
match, I wouldn’t bet on anything.

Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 2-0 Konta* (*denotes server)

She’s nowhere near her best, Konta, but she’s fighting, and that’s a good 
sign. Unfortunately for her, it’s the only good sign. At 15-40, Konta draws on 
all her athleticism to make a brilliant overhead. But she double-faults on the 
next point and, at a set and a break down, it’s looking like now or never for

Second set: Sevastova* 6-4, 1-0 Konta (*denotes server)

At 15-15, Sevastova sends down her first ace. Naturally enough, given the 
topsy-turvy nature of this match, she then double faults. Next up? A wonderful 
winning backhand volley from out of her right hip, followed by an attempt at 
putting away a short forehand that’s so bad one can only laugh in disbelief. No 
wonder Konta succumbs to an unforced error at deuce; she’s probably as 
bamboozled as the rest of us. The pattern continues. Brilliant play from the 
baseline carries Sevastova to game point, only for Konta to hit back with some 
excellent approach play. But the Briton is still giving too much away – she’s 
racked up 22 unforced errors now – and she sends a forehand wide a couple of 
points later to squander the chance of an early lead in this second set. Konta 
needs to step on the accelerator here, make no mistake, or this could quickly 
get away from her.

Sevastova wins the opening set 6-4!

First set: Sevastova 6-4 Konta* (*denotes server)

The light here is tricky and has been from the outset. One end is bathed in 
brilliant sunshine, the other shrouded in dark shadow. It’s never easy picking 
the ball up when it’s coming out of the sun, but I’m not sure that accounts for 
the odd pattern of this match so far. It’s not like either player has been 
winning every game at one end and losing every game at the other. A more 
persuasive explanation is the distinctive if so far up-and-down brilliance of 
Sevastova. Konta loves to develop a rhythm and, so far, the Latvian is giving 
her none. After a brilliant angled sliced forehand winner at 15-15 – a rolled 
forehand from Konta had her way out of court – Sevastova steers a wonderful 
forehand winner down the line to bring up set point. She takes it at the first 
time of asking and, with three-quarters of an hour gone, Konta has it all to do.

First set: Sevastova* 5-4 Konta (*denotes server)

The match takes another surreal turn when Sevastova, having won the opening 
point, challenges her own first serve – which was called in – following a 
winning forehand return from Konta, one so good that you can hardly believe it 
came from the same player who conceded her serve so tamely in the previous 
game. It’s to no avail, but that doesn’t stop Sevastova from battling her way 
to set point. At which point, of course, the errors return, the momentum swings 
back towards Konta, and the Latvian is broken. Predictable this is not.

First set: Sevastova 5-3 Konta* (*denotes server)

This really is the strangest of matches. Konta starts the game confidently 
with some deft play from the forecourt, then makes a lamentable sequence of 
unforced errors to concede her serve to 15. Sevastova to serve for the set, and 
she must be as surprised as anyone.

First set: Sevastova* 4-3 Konta (*denotes server)

She’s a curious player, is Sevastova. She looked unhappy when she was ahead. 
She looks unhappy when behind. One moment she seems to be nursing a thigh 
injury, the next she’s moving like the proverbial gazelle. As if to underline 
those qualities, she races to a 40-0 lead playing some immaculate baseline 
tennis, loses the next three points in dismal fashion, looks pained and 
tortured, and then wraps up the game courtesy of two Konta errors to edge ahead 
once more. What does it all mean? Right now, your guess is as good as mine.

First set: Sevastova 3-3 Konta* (*denotes server)

With Sevastova struggling to move to her right and casting ever more concerned 
looks towards her coach, Ronald Schmidt, Konta holds with something to spare. 
She’s moving better, hitting the ball more freely, and looks to be over that 
somewhat lacklustre start.

First set: Sevastova* 3-2 Konta (*denotes server)

Sevastova seems to be limping and Konta, quick to smell blood in the water, 
seizes the chance to break back. The breakthrough comes courtesy of a 
redoubling of physical effort, Konta running down everything her opponent can 
throw at her. At deuce, the Latvian shanks a backhand pass high and wide, 
looking thoroughly disconsolate in the process. Another Sevastova error on 
break point puts the match back on an even footing. Great opportunism from 
Konta.

First set: Sevastova 3-1 Konta* (*denotes server)

High bounce times three, low bounce times four, and serve: Konta is her usual 
methodical self, but she’s making too many errors and it’s giving her no chance 
to settle into the match. Still, she recovers from 0-40 – not least by dint of 
a lovely backhand drop shot at 30-40 – and belatedly secures a foothold in 
proceedings when the Latvian nets a forehand. Curiously, despite starting so 
well Sevastova got quite down on herself in that game – even when she was 
ahead. Something to watch out for, that, because Konta will be looking to seize 
on any sign of encouragement her opponent affords her.

First set: Sevastova* 3-0 Konta (*denotes server)

At 30-30, and after some sharp net play from Konta that suggests she’s 
starting to find her feet after conceding that early break, Sevastova fires a 
penetrating first serve down the centre. It proves too hot to handle for Konta, 
as does the brilliant off-forehand the Latvian slams for a winner on the next 
point to consolidate the break. Great movement there from Sevastova, whose 
relatively modest ranking belies her talent.

First set: Sevastova 2-0 Konta* (*denotes server)

Now it’s Sevastova’s turn to take a 0-30 lead, a position she reaches courtesy 
of a lovely backhand overhead, deftly angled away with her back to the court. 
She’s playing with variety and intelligence, moving Konta around from the back, 
and it reaps dividends as the Brit fires a forehand wide at 15-40. First blood 
to Sevastova, who has started with real confidence here.

First set: Sevastova 1-0 Konta* (*denotes server) 

Both women are quickly into their stride, trading some hefty and indeed 
elegant strokes off the ground. Sevastova falls 0-30 behind, but recovers with 
a brilliantly disguised drop shot at 30-30 to see out the game safely. She took 
time to settle against Bondarenko in the previous round, so the Latvian will be 
pleased with that.

What should we expect? Well, much as you might expect, both women are strong 
from the baseline. They’re both great ball strikers and, crucially, both move 
well. But Konta perhaps has the edge in terms of power, especially behind the 
serve. Predictions? It’s Sevastova to get us underway …

The players have just made their way on to a sparsely populated Ashe. 
Sevastova acknowledges the threadbare crowd with a smile and a wave. A few 
empty seats won’t bother her one bit. It’s not so long since she was playing in 
infinitely less glamorous venues. Konta, meanwhile, enters with head bowed, 
hiding beneath the peak of her trademark sun visor. Nervous or just focused? A 
little of both, I’d wager.

In case you’re wondering, either Caroline Wozniacki or Madison Keys will lie 
in wait for the winner between Konta and Sevastova.The pair are scheduled to 
play on Ashe directly after this match.

Before we get underway, let’s spare a thought for another Brit. Dan Evans may 
have squandered a match point against Stan Wawrinka on Saturday night, but he 
was nothing short of brilliant against the third-seeded Swiss, tormenting 
Wawrinka with his canny net play and venomous sliced backhands. Along with 
Konta, Andy Murray and Kyle Edmund – who, incidentally, plays top seed Novak 
Djokovic in Sunday’s final match on Ashe – Evans has helped to make it a 
tournament to remember for the British contingent.

Preamble

Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Sunday’s opening match at Arthur 
Ashe Stadium, in which Britain’s Johanna Konta 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/sport/johanna-konta> takes on the unseeded Latvian
Anastasija Sevastova for a place in the last eight. It is hard to believe that 
12 months have passed since Konta announced her talent to a previously 
unsuspecting world by reaching the fourth round at Flushing Meadows as a 
qualifier. That the British No1 has been inspired rather than inhibited by her 
return to the scene of last year’s heroics is a measure of the mental resolve 
that has underpinned her extraordinary rise since. Ranked just inside the top 
100 this time last year, when she accounted for Garbiñe Muguruza and Andrea 
Petkovic in successive rounds before falling to Petra Kvitova, she is now 
ranked 14th and bearing down on a place in the top 10. Victory here would make 
her the first British woman in the last eight since Jo Durie in 1983. In short, 
she is there to be shot at this time out. Yet Konta has not only defended the 
ranking points she earned in New York last year but literally pulled herself up 
off her knees to do so, overcoming humidity, hyperventilation and on-court 
collapse to squeak past Bulgaria’s Tsvetana Pironkova in round two. Whatever 
one made of that controversial episode – and Pironkova, for one, was not 
altogether happy about the extended delay it occasioned – Konta’s ability to 
come through it and win spoke of a hard-as-nails competitor, an impression 
confirmed by her 6-2, 6-1 dismissal of Belinda Bencic in the next round.

Then again, Sevastova – whose own backstory is barely less impressive than 
Konta’s – also knows a thing or two about overcoming physical adversity.In 2013 
the Latvian, beset by injuries and clearly out of love with the sport, retired 
aged just 23. “I had many injuries, and I wasn’t happy with my tennis or where 
I stood on the tennis court,” she reflected after emulating Konta by claiming 
the scalp of Muguruza in the second round on Thursday. “Something different was 
hurting all the time: back, arm, and legs. Then I decided to go out and retire. 
I did some studying. I coached some kids, but nothing serious. Just lessons, 
and lived a normal life.” After about 18 months, though, Sevastova – who 
reached a career-high of No36 in January 2011 – began to miss the big stage. 
She felt her way back into the sport gingerly at first, playing a few ITF 
Challenger events, but a sustained run of form and fitness has lifted her back 
up to No48. Crucially, Sevastova is also enjoying her tennis once again. Her 
time away from the game has given her a balanced and mature perspective – “I’ve 
seen that there’s life after tennis, that if you lose a match, it’s not the end 
of the world,” she says – and she backed up her win over Muguruza with a 
straight-sets dismissal of Kateryna Bondarenko, a former US Open 
quarter-finalist. So forget the rankings. If Sevastova brings her A-game, we 
can expect Konta – who won their only previous meeting, at the Australian Open 
three years ago, in three tight sets – to have her hands full.

“I knew I had always a chance to break her, so I just kept fighting,” says 
Stevastova. It’s a fair analysis. Konta landed just 56% of her first serves, a 
poor statistic by her standards, and won only 45% of those points. It meant she 
couldn’t dictate the rallies as she does when at her best. She also made 34 
unforced errors. Sevastova conceded that the light – bright at one end, dark at 
the other – made things difficult, but ultimately she coped with those 
conditions better than Konta. Whether she also handled her emotions as well as 
she might have, only she’ll know. But she often looked somewhere between 
distraught and despairing, and Konta was unable to take advantage of that. It 
was a strange match, partly because of that emotional dynamic, but the bottom 
line is that Konta is out, spelling the end of the British challenge in the 
women’s singles, while Sevastova is through to her first grand slam 
quarter-final. On this evidence, her tussle with the winner of Wozniacki and 
Keys will make for fascinating viewing. Thanks for reading and don’t forget to

Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 7-5 Konta* (*denotes server)

It’s all over! But boy, it can be a cruel game, tennis. At 15-15, the 
scrambling Konta clips the net tape with a forehand. The ball dies on her side 
of the court and so too do her hopes of a first US Open quarter-final. A 
brilliant, instinctive forehand winner from Sevastova brings up two match 
points, but she only needs the one. Sevastova becomes the first Latvian player 
to reach the last eight at a major since Larisa Neiland at Wimbledon in 1994 .

Second set: Sevastova* 6-4, 6-5 Konta (*denotes server)

Two match points come and gone? Coruscating forehand winner from your opponent 
on the opening point? Tricky smash directly into the glaring New York sun? No 
problem, no problem and no problem. At least, not if your name is Anastasija 
Sevastova. She holds with something to spare. It makes no sense. This match 
doesn’t make sense. ButJohanna Konta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/johanna-konta> had better make sense of it 
all quickly, because she’ll have to serve to stay in the match. Again.
 
Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 5-5 Konta* (*denotes server)

Having retired from tennis three years ago, Sevastova was a point away from a 
US Open quarter-final in the previous game. The question in this game was 
always going to be how she responded. For three points, she looked distraught. 
But at 40-0, Konta became overcautious just as Sevastova started to loosen up 
again. It was the worst possible combination for Konta, who lost four points in 
succession to go match point down for a second time. However, a fine first 
serve from the seeded player – deep, high and accurate down the middle – 
produced a missed forehand return from Sevastova, and the chance was gone. From 
there, and with her opponent a picture of frustration, Konta held on with some 
courageous play. What a contest this has become.
 
Second set: Sevastova* 6-4, 5-4 Konta (*denotes server)

Remarkable stuff as Konta, peering over the abyss, somehow manages to survive. 
At 15-30, she bravely draws Sevastova in before winning the point with a 
crunching crosscourt backhand. Sevastova hits back to bring up a match point at 
40-30, only for another gutsy backhand to pull Konta back from the brink. A 
wayward Sevastova forehand at deuce produces a break point, which Konta 
converts with a flicked backhand that sails over the Latvian’s head at an 
awkward height. Sevastova didn’t know whether to hit it. Or even if she could 
hit it. But she won’t be happy.
 
Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 5-3 Konta* (*denotes server)

There’s a touch of the Andy Murrays about Konta at times – like the Scot, she 
left home as a teenager to hone her game at the Sánchez-Casal Academy in 
Barcelona – and, as she sends down a succession of lovely, crisp two-fisted 
backhands, the comparison comes to mind more than once in this game. Where they 
differ is that Murray is rarely guilty of letting his opponents off the hook 
with a succession of unforced errors. It’s a nervy affair, this game, with 
Sevastova wasting two game points before she finally puts away a drive volley 
that, in any sane world, would have been an overhead. Still, it’s a break for 
the Latvian and she will now serve for the match.

Second set: Sevastova* 6-4, 4-3 Konta (*denotes server)

Is Konta finally, belatedly, gathering momentum? Serving to move within a game 
of the match, Sevastova falls behind, recovers to 30-40 with some enterprising 
play that includes a majestic half-volleyed forehand winner, but is finally 
undone by some aggressive Konta counter-attacking. The plot thickens. Again.
 
Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 4-2 Konta* (*denotes server)

Better from Konta. Not only does she find some of her trademark poise behind 
her serve, she also caps a love game by racing forward to produce an 
unanswerable angle off the cutest of Sevastova drop shots. Food for thought for 
the Latvian.
 
Second set: Sevastova* 6-4, 4-1 Konta (*denotes server)

Long before this perplexing and at times bizarre contest started, Adrian 
Fowell emailed in to say: “For what it’s worth, I think Konta will blitz this. 
Straight sets, no bagels.” No one could have predicted this, Adrian, no one. 
But right now, Sevastova is looking the likelier to do any blitzing. She holds 
convincingly and is now just a couple of games from the last eight.
 
Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 3-1 Konta* (*denotes server)

A bad start for Konta – who takes a ball in her midriff after working her way 
forward in promising style on the opening point – quickly gets worse. It was a 
short volley that did the damage, and another brings up three break points for 
Sevastova, the Latvian races forward to whip a crosscourt forehand pass beyond 
her stranded opponent. A beauty of a drop shot wraps up a love break. Back to 
square one for Konta.

Second set: Sevastova* 6-4, 2-1 Konta (*denotes server)

After some patchy play from Sevastova, Konta gets a short ball on her forehand 
at 15-30 and leathers it for a winner. The shot sounded crisp, like it came 
right out of the middle of the racket, and it provided her with the platform to 
outrally Sevastova on the next point and claw back the break immediately. A 
turning point? If it means she’s found her range at last, maybe. But in this 
match, I wouldn’t bet on anything.
 
Second set: Sevastova 6-4, 2-0 Konta* (*denotes server)

She’s nowhere near her best, Konta, but she’s fighting, and that’s a good 
sign. Unfortunately for her, it’s the only good sign. At 15-40, Konta draws on 
all her athleticism to make a brilliant overhead. But she double-faults on the 
next point and, at a set and a break down, it’s looking like now or never for 
the 13th seed.
 
Second set: Sevastova* 6-4, 1-0 Konta (*denotes server)

At 15-15, Sevastova sends down her first ace. Naturally enough, given the 
topsy-turvy nature of this match, she then double faults. Next up? A wonderful 
winning backhand volley from out of her right hip, followed by an attempt at 
putting away a short forehand that’s so bad one can only laugh in disbelief. No 
wonder Konta succumbs to an unforced error at deuce; she’s probably as 
bamboozled as the rest of us. The pattern continues. Brilliant play from the 
baseline carries Sevastova to game point, only for Konta to hit back with some 
excellent approach play. But the Briton is still giving too much away – she’s 
racked up 22 unforced errors now – and she sends a forehand wide a couple of 
points later to squander the chance of an early lead in this second set. Konta 
needs to step on the accelerator here, make no mistake, or this could quickly 
get away from her.
 
First set: Sevastova 6-4 Konta* (*denotes server)

The light here is tricky and has been from the outset. One end is bathed in 
brilliant sunshine, the other shrouded in dark shadow. It’s never easy picking 
the ball up when it’s coming out of the sun, but I’m not sure that accounts for 
the odd pattern of this match so far. It’s not like either player has been 
winning every game at one end and losing every game at the other. A more 
persuasive explanation is the distinctive if so far up-and-down brilliance of 
Sevastova. Konta loves to develop a rhythm and, so far, the Latvian is giving 
her none. After a brilliant angled sliced forehand winner at 15-15 – a rolled 
forehand from Konta had her way out of court – Sevastova steers a wonderful 
forehand winner down the line to bring up set point. She takes it at the first 
time of asking and, with three-quarters of an hour gone, Konta has it all to do.

First set: Sevastova* 5-4 Konta (*denotes server)

The match takes another surreal turn when Sevastova, having won the opening 
point, challenges her own first serve – which was called in – following a 
winning forehand return from Konta, one so good that you can hardly believe it 
came from the same player who conceded her serve so tamely in the previous 
game. It’s to no avail, but that doesn’t stop Sevastova from battling her way 
to set point. At which point, of course, the errors return, the momentum swings 
back towards Konta, and the Latvian is broken. Predictable this is not.
 
First set: Sevastova 5-3 Konta* (*denotes server)

This really is the strangest of matches. Konta starts the game confidently 
with some deft play from the forecourt, then makes a lamentable sequence of 
unforced errors to concede her serve to 15. Sevastova to serve for the set, and 
she must be as surprised as anyone.
 
First set: Sevastova* 4-3 Konta (*denotes server)

She’s a curious player, is Sevastova. She looked unhappy when she was ahead. 
She looks unhappy when behind. One moment she seems to be nursing a thigh 
injury, the next she’s moving like the proverbial gazelle. As if to underline 
those qualities, she races to a 40-0 lead playing some immaculate baseline 
tennis, loses the next three points in dismal fashion, looks pained and 
tortured, and then wraps up the game courtesy of two Konta errors to edge ahead 
once more. What does it all mean? Right now, your guess is as good as mine.
 
First set: Sevastova 3-3 Konta* (*denotes server)

With Sevastova struggling to move to her right and casting ever more concerned 
looks towards her coach, Ronald Schmidt, Konta holds with something to spare. 
She’s moving better, hitting the ball more freely, and looks to be over that 
somewhat lacklustre start.

First set: Sevastova* 3-2 Konta (*denotes server)

Sevastova seems to be limping and Konta, quick to smell blood in the water, 
seizes the chance to break back. The breakthrough comes courtesy of a 
redoubling of physical effort, Konta running down everything her opponent can 
throw at her. At deuce, the Latvian shanks a backhand pass high and wide, 
looking thoroughly disconsolate in the process. Another Sevastova error on 
break point puts the match back on an even footing. Great opportunism from 
Konta.
 
First set: Sevastova 3-1 Konta* (*denotes server)

High bounce times three, low bounce times four, and serve: Konta is her usual 
methodical self, but she’s making too many errors and it’s giving her no chance 
to settle into the match. Still, she recovers from 0-40 – not least by dint of 
a lovely backhand drop shot at 30-40 – and belatedly secures a foothold in 
proceedings when the Latvian nets a forehand. Curiously, despite starting so 
well Sevastova got quite down on herself in that game – even when she was 
ahead. Something to watch out for, that, because Konta will be looking to seize 
on any sign of encouragement her opponent affords her.
 
First set: Sevastova* 3-0 Konta (*denotes server)

At 30-30, and after some sharp net play from Konta that suggests she’s 
starting to find her feet after conceding that early break, Sevastova fires a 
penetrating first serve down the centre. It proves too hot to handle for Konta, 
as does the brilliant off-forehand the Latvian slams for a winner on the next 
point to consolidate the break. Great movement there from Sevastova, whose 
relatively modest ranking belies her talent.
 
First set: Sevastova 2-0 Konta* (*denotes server)

Now it’s Sevastova’s turn to take a 0-30 lead, a position she reaches courtesy 
of a lovely backhand overhead, deftly angled away with her back to the court. 
She’s playing with variety and intelligence, moving Konta around from the back, 
and it reaps dividends as the Brit fires a forehand wide at 15-40. First blood 
to Sevastova, who has started with real confidence here.

First set: Sevastova 1-0 Konta* (*denotes server) 

Both women are quickly into their stride, trading some hefty and indeed 
elegant strokes off the ground. Sevastova falls 0-30 behind, but recovers with 
a brilliantly disguised drop shot at 30-30 to see out the game safely. She took 
time to settle against Bondarenko in the previous round, so the Latvian will be 
pleased with that.
 
What should we expect? Well, much as you might expect, both women are strong 
from the baseline. They’re both great ball strikers and, crucially, both move 
well. But Konta perhaps has the edge in terms of power, especially behind the 
serve. Predictions? It’s Sevastova to get us underway …
 
The players have just made their way on to a sparsely populated Ashe. 
Sevastova acknowledges the threadbare crowd with a smile and a wave. A few 
empty seats won’t bother her one bit. It’s not so long since she was playing in 
infinitely less glamorous venues. Konta, meanwhile, enters with head bowed, 
hiding beneath the peak of her trademark sun visor. Nervous or just focused? A 
little of both, I’d wager.

 
In case you’re wondering, either Caroline Wozniacki or Madison Keys will lie 
in wait for the winner between Konta and Sevastova.The pair are scheduled to 
play on Ashe directly after this match.
 
Before we get underway, let’s spare a thought for another Brit. Dan Evans may 
have squandered a match point against Stan Wawrinka on Saturday night, but he 
was nothing short of brilliant against the third-seeded Swiss, tormenting 
Wawrinka with his canny net play and venomous sliced backhands. Along with 
Konta, Andy Murray and Kyle Edmund – who, incidentally, plays top seed Novak 
Djokovic in Sunday’s final match on Ashe – Evans has helped to make it a 
tournament to remember for the British contingent.
 
Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Sunday’s opening match at Arthur 
Ashe Stadium, in which Britain’s Johanna Konta 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/sport/johanna-konta> takes on the unseeded Latvian
Anastasija Sevastova for a place in the last eight. It is hard to believe that 
12 months have passed since Konta announced her talent to a previously 
unsuspecting world by reaching the fourth round at Flushing Meadows as a 
qualifier. That the British No1 has been inspired rather than inhibited by her 
return to the scene of last year’s heroics is a measure of the mental resolve 
that has underpinned her extraordinary rise since. Ranked just inside the top 
100 this time last year, when she accounted for Garbiñe Muguruza and Andrea 
Petkovic in successive rounds before falling to Petra Kvitova, she is now 
ranked 14th and bearing down on a place in the top 10. Victory here would make 
her the first British woman in the last eight since Jo Durie in 1983. In short, 
she is there to be shot at this time out. Yet Konta has not only defended the 
ranking points she earned in New York last year but literally pulled herself up 
off her knees to do so, overcoming humidity, hyperventilation and on-court 
collapse to squeak past Bulgaria’s Tsvetana Pironkova in round two. Whatever 
one made of that controversial episode – and Pironkova, for one, was not 
altogether happy about the extended delay it occasioned – Konta’s ability to 
come through it and win spoke of a hard-as-nails competitor, an impression 
confirmed by her 6-2, 6-1 dismissal of Belinda Bencic in the next round.

Then again, Sevastova – whose own backstory is barely less impressive than 
Konta’s – also knows a thing or two about overcoming physical adversity.In 2013 
the Latvian, beset by injuries and clearly out of love with the sport, retired 
aged just 23. “I had many injuries, and I wasn’t happy with my tennis or where 
I stood on the tennis court,” she reflected after emulating Konta by claiming 
the scalp of Muguruza in the second round on Thursday. “Something different was 
hurting all the time: back, arm, and legs. Then I decided to go out and retire. 
I did some studying. I coached some kids, but nothing serious. Just lessons, 
and lived a normal life.” After about 18 months, though, Sevastova – who 
reached a career-high of No36 in January 2011 – began to miss the big stage. 
She felt her way back into the sport gingerly at first, playing a few ITF 
Challenger events, but a sustained run of form and fitness has lifted her back 
up to No48. Crucially, Sevastova is also enjoying her tennis once again. Her 
time away from the game has given her a balanced and mature perspective – “I’ve 
seen that there’s life after tennis, that if you lose a match, it’s not the end 
of the world,” she says – and she backed up her win over Muguruza with a 
straight-sets dismissal of Kateryna Bondarenko, a former US Open 
quarter-finalist. So forget the rankings. If Sevastova brings her A-game, we 
can expect Konta – who won their only previous meeting, at the Australian Open 
three years ago, in three tight sets – to have her hands full.
