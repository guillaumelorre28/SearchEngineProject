FULL TIME: Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 CSKA Moscow

Wembley jinx? What Wembley jinx? Spurs ran out easy winners tonight: it should 
have been a few more. They’ll play Europa League football in the New Year. And 
they won’t be coming back here next season with a complex. A fine evening’s 
work!

85 min: Winks and Walker combine down the right to earn yet another corner for 
Spurs. Before it can be taken, Schennikov goes down with cramp, and no wonder: 
he’s been run ragged all evening. From the set piece, Alderweireld has another 
pop at goal, but his header flies over the bar.

the evening. He’s been hooked for Carlos Strandberg.

Alderweireld, who clangs a header wide right from the resulting corner.

GOAL! Tottenham Hostpur 3-1 CSKA Moscow (Akinfeev og 78)

Kane loops a lovely cross into the CSKA box from the right. Alli rises and 
heads straight at the keeper, who saves well, but in falling, kicks the ball 
he’d pushed forward back into the net! Highly unfortunate, but the scoreline 
reflects Tottenham’s superiority.

was easier to get a shot away. Then Spurs go up the other end, and...

75 min: Spurs are knocking at the door here. Eriksen, who is bang back in 
form, wedges a delightful ball down the inside-right channel which drops 
perfectly for Kane, rushing into the area clear of the last man. He leans back, 
and fires a volley goalwards. Akinfeev somehow tips the effort over the 
crossbar, a fine save that’s the match of a magnificent Spurs move.

74 min: Winks is tripped on the left-hand edge of the CSKA area by Vasili 
Berezutski. No penalty, no second booking. But a free kick in a dangerous 
position. Spurs load the box, but Eriksen looks to curl one directly into the

72 min: Alderweireld is understandably not quite up to speed yet. His 
hesitation allows Chalov to latch onto a ball bouncing on the right-hand edge 
of the Spurs box. Chalov shoots for the bottom right, and the effort’s 
deflected inches wide of the post. The corner results in nothing, but that was 
very close to an equaliser.

70 min: N’Koudou is looking lively. He slips a ball down the left for Rose, 
who cuts back for Alli. Another chance for the young star. He opens up his body 
and sidefoots high and wide right from 12 yards.

68 min: N’Koudou earns a corner on the left for Spurs, his low centre 
deflected out of play and away from danger. The set piece comes to nothing, but 
Spurs fans are in fine voice anyway, because just before it was taken Toby 
Alderweireld returns from injury, replacing Wanyama.

67 min: Eriksen and Walker have had the run of this right wing all evening. 
They combine, with Schennikov spinning around like a teenager after three cans 
of Special Brew, and nearly release Kane into the area. Not quite.

65 min: Kane one-twos with Alli to cut inside from the right, then rolls a 
gorgeous pass to the right for N’Koudou, who drops a shoulder to cut back in, 
then blooters a wild effort into the north London sky. He was going for a 
curler into the top right, for the record. But instead it’s somewhere near 
Hanger Lane tube. Nothing wrong with ambition, of course.
 Not very close so definitely no cigar for Georges-Kevin N’Koudou. Photograph:

64 min: Nope! Kane pulls rank and scuffs a dismal effort straight at the

63 min: Vasili Berezutski is booked for a blatant body-check on Alli as the 
Spurs man sashays down the middle of the park. A free kick in a dangerous 
position. A chance for Dier to beat Akinfeev again, just as he did for England 
against Russia at Euro 2016?

62 min: Son is replaced by Georges-Kevin N’Koudou. The new man is immediately 
involved, exchanging passes with Rose down the left. The ball’s shuttled wide 
right for Walker, who finds Kane with his cross, six yards out. Kane has to 
score, but sends his header over the bar.

60 min: Both sides have eased off a bit, almost as though they’d be happy to 
end the game right now. CSKA are carrying no threat at all. But then it was the 
same for long periods of the first half, and they went on to score one and 
nearly get another. So.

56 min:  Dave Bennett Eriksen crosses from the right. Kane launches himself at 
the ball, in an attempt to recreate the diving header scored against Spurs by 
Coventry City’s Keith Houchen in the 1987 FA Cup final. Same end, too. That 
would have been a perfect replica had Kane, er, connected. But you get the 
point.

55 min: Kane has an opportunity to play Son into space down the right, but 
knocks a loose pass out of play, behind his strike partner. That’s a rare 
misstep from Kane, who has looked really sharp and lively tonight.

53 min: Vertonghen launches long for Son. The striker can’t control, but the 
ball breaks back to Kane, who controls and loops a bouncing ball towards the 
CSKA goal. He gives it a proper belt, but it’s straight at Akinfeev.

52 min: OK, two minutes. Walker goes on a super-fast dribble down the right 
and wins a corner. Eriksen pulls it back for Son, who tries to Mark Hughes a 
volley from the edge of the box, level with the right-hand post, but doesn’t 
connect properly. The ball bounces harmlessly towards Akinfeev.

worries, there’ll be another one along in a minute.

49 min: Rose curls in a superlative ball from a deep position wide on the 
left. Akinfeev stays on the edge of his six-yard box to claim it, but is nearly 
embarrassed when Son races in from the right and sticks out a leg. He’s an 
uncut toenail away from steering Rose’s excellent cross into the bottom left.

very nearly slips Alli clear into the CSKA area. Akinfeev races off his line to

47 min: And then there’s an instant reminder that this isn’t over yet. Natcho, 
from the right, lumps a ball into the middle for Traore to chase. The gangling 
striker nearly powers his way past Vertonghen, but the Spurs defender stays 
strong. For a second, Spurs looked very light at the back there.

46 min: The half begins with a lot of Tottenham possession. Some crisp passing 
in the midfield, but it all goes nowhere.

And we’re off again! Spurs are 45 minutes away from the knockout stage of the 
Europa League. On the evidence of the first half, they should do it with ease, 
providing they tuck away their chances and concentrate under any high balls 
CSKA launch forward. All easier said than done, of course. CSKA unsurprisingly 
make a change, throwing on Fedor Chalov in place of Golovin. Then they get the 
party re-started.

GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 CSKA Moscow (Kane 45+1)

This was so simple! Eriksen, central in the pocket, pitching-wedges a diagonal 
ball to the left for Rose, who rolls a simple ball back across goal, allowing 
Kane to tap in! He couldn’t miss!

43 min: Spurs very nearly fall behind again. Tosic breaks down the middle, 
draws Vertonghen, and passes to Milanov on his left. Milanov drops a shoulder 
to cut back inside, swishing past Dier. He shoots for the bottom left, but 
doesn’t catch it, and Lloris can claim. But Spurs were split open there, and

42 min: Walker channels his inner Garrincha and very nearly bamboozles his way 
between Schennikov and Aleksei Berezutski, and into the box. But the dribble 
breaks down right at the end. CSKA are a complete shambles down this Spurs 
right. Though can you be a shambles if there’s nobody there in attendance?

GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 CSKA Moscow (Alli 38)

Yeah, it was only a matter of time before Alli found the net! Kane and Walker 
battle down the right to shuttle the ball on to Eriksen, who loops to the far 
post. Alli brings the ball down, taking Nababkin out of the game and unleashing 
a screamer into the top right from ten yards! What a lovely finish, and Spurs 
are back in the box seat. Europa League, here they come!

Wembley jinx? What Wembley jinx? Spurs ran out easy winners tonight: it should 
have been a few more. They’ll play Europa League football in the New Year. And 
they won’t be coming back here next season with a complex. A fine evening’s 
work!
 
90 min: Another rendition of When The Spurs Go Marching In. 
Dixieland-on-Thames. Spurs are two added minutes from a place in the knockout 
stage of the Europa League.
 
89 min: A long hoof upfield nearly releases Strandberg on goal, but Lloris 
races from his area to head clear.
 
88 min: Milanov very nearly hoofs the ball up into his own startled face. It’s 
been that sort of night for hapless CSKA.
 
87 min: Spurs knock it around while looking at their good old friend the clock.
 
85 min: Winks and Walker combine down the right to earn yet another corner for 
Spurs. Before it can be taken, Schennikov goes down with cramp, and no wonder: 
he’s been run ragged all evening. From the set piece, Alderweireld has another 
pop at goal, but his header flies over the bar.
 
83 min: Harry Kane has been very impressive this evening, and he deserves to 
put his feet up. He’s replaced by Joshua Onomah.
 
82 min: By the way, that terrible Traore miscontrol was his last poor touch of 
the evening. He’s been hooked for Carlos Strandberg.
 
81 min: Walker very nearly releases Kane into the box with a sliderule pass 
down the right. Spurs are playing some very attractive stuff, but CSKA have 
clocked off.
 
80 min: Spurs nearly make it four, first through Alli, who dribbles with 
purpose down the right channel and shoots from a tight angle, then from 
Alderweireld, who clangs a header wide right from the resulting corner.
 
Kane loops a lovely cross into the CSKA box from the right. Alli rises and 
heads straight at the keeper, who saves well, but in falling, kicks the ball 
he’d pushed forward back into the net! Highly unfortunate, but the scoreline 
reflects Tottenham’s superiority.

77 min: One CSKA goal, of course, would seriously change the atmosphere. A 
ball’s hooked into the Spurs area from the left. Vertonghen steps up, and 
allows Traore to take a touch on the penalty spot. But he miscontrols when it 
was easier to get a shot away. Then Spurs go up the other end, and...
 
75 min: Spurs are knocking at the door here. Eriksen, who is bang back in 
form, wedges a delightful ball down the inside-right channel which drops 
perfectly for Kane, rushing into the area clear of the last man. He leans back, 
and fires a volley goalwards. Akinfeev somehow tips the effort over the 
crossbar, a fine save that’s the match of a magnificent Spurs move.

via Getty Images  
74 min: Winks is tripped on the left-hand edge of the CSKA area by Vasili 
Berezutski. No penalty, no second booking. But a free kick in a dangerous 
position. Spurs load the box, but Eriksen looks to curl one directly into the 
bottom left. Akinfeev parries clear.
 
72 min: Alderweireld is understandably not quite up to speed yet. His 
hesitation allows Chalov to latch onto a ball bouncing on the right-hand edge 
of the Spurs box. Chalov shoots for the bottom right, and the effort’s 
deflected inches wide of the post. The corner results in nothing, but that was 
very close to an equaliser.
 
71 min: Tusic is replaced by Gordyusenko.
 
70 min: N’Koudou is looking lively. He slips a ball down the left for Rose, 
who cuts back for Alli. Another chance for the young star. He opens up his body 
and sidefoots high and wide right from 12 yards.
 
68 min: N’Koudou earns a corner on the left for Spurs, his low centre 
deflected out of play and away from danger. The set piece comes to nothing, but 
Spurs fans are in fine voice anyway, because just before it was taken Toby 
Alderweireld returns from injury, replacing Wanyama.

substitute. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters  
67 min: Eriksen and Walker have had the run of this right wing all evening. 
They combine, with Schennikov spinning around like a teenager after three cans 
of Special Brew, and nearly release Kane into the area. Not quite.
 
65 min: Kane one-twos with Alli to cut inside from the right, then rolls a 
gorgeous pass to the right for N’Koudou, who drops a shoulder to cut back in, 
then blooters a wild effort into the north London sky. He was going for a 
curler into the top right, for the record. But instead it’s somewhere near 
Hanger Lane tube. Nothing wrong with ambition, of course.
 Not very close so definitely no cigar for Georges-Kevin N’Koudou. Photograph: 
Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images  
64 min: Nope! Kane pulls rank and scuffs a dismal effort straight at the 
keeper.
 
63 min: Vasili Berezutski is booked for a blatant body-check on Alli as the 
Spurs man sashays down the middle of the park. A free kick in a dangerous 
position. A chance for Dier to beat Akinfeev again, just as he did for England 
against Russia at Euro 2016?
 
62 min: Son is replaced by Georges-Kevin N’Koudou. The new man is immediately 
involved, exchanging passes with Rose down the left. The ball’s shuttled wide 
right for Walker, who finds Kane with his cross, six yards out. Kane has to 
score, but sends his header over the bar.
 Harry Kane heads over. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images  
60 min: Both sides have eased off a bit, almost as though they’d be happy to 
end the game right now. CSKA are carrying no threat at all. But then it was the 
same for long periods of the first half, and they went on to score one and 
nearly get another. So.
 
59 min: Another corner for Spurs down the right. The Dave Bennett de nos jours 
to take. He finds Kilcline  Vertonghen, who guides a weak header straight at 
Akinfeev.
 
56 min:  Dave Bennett Eriksen crosses from the right. Kane launches himself at 
the ball, in an attempt to recreate the diving header scored against Spurs by 
Coventry City’s Keith Houchen in the 1987 FA Cup final. Same end, too. That 
would have been a perfect replica had Kane, er, connected. But you get the 
point.
 Harry Kane is no Keith Houchen. Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters  
55 min: Kane has an opportunity to play Son into space down the right, but 
knocks a loose pass out of play, behind his strike partner. That’s a rare 
misstep from Kane, who has looked really sharp and lively tonight.
 
53 min: Vertonghen launches long for Son. The striker can’t control, but the 
ball breaks back to Kane, who controls and loops a bouncing ball towards the 
CSKA goal. He gives it a proper belt, but it’s straight at Akinfeev.
 
52 min: OK, two minutes. Walker goes on a super-fast dribble down the right 
and wins a corner. Eriksen pulls it back for Son, who tries to Mark Hughes a 
volley from the edge of the box, level with the right-hand post, but doesn’t 
connect properly. The ball bounces harmlessly towards Akinfeev.
 
50 min: Eriksen earns a corner down the right for Spurs, then wastes it. No 
worries, there’ll be another one along in a minute.
 
49 min: Rose curls in a superlative ball from a deep position wide on the 
left. Akinfeev stays on the edge of his six-yard box to claim it, but is nearly 
embarrassed when Son races in from the right and sticks out a leg. He’s an 
uncut toenail away from steering Rose’s excellent cross into the bottom left.

48 min: Kane makes a nuisance of himself down the inside-right channel and 
very nearly slips Alli clear into the CSKA area. Akinfeev races off his line to 
deal with the danger.
 
47 min: And then there’s an instant reminder that this isn’t over yet. Natcho, 
from the right, lumps a ball into the middle for Traore to chase. The gangling 
striker nearly powers his way past Vertonghen, but the Spurs defender stays 
strong. For a second, Spurs looked very light at the back there.
 
46 min: The half begins with a lot of Tottenham possession. Some crisp passing 
in the midfield, but it all goes nowhere.
 
And we’re off again! Spurs are 45 minutes away from the knockout stage of the 
Europa League. On the evidence of the first half, they should do it with ease, 
providing they tuck away their chances and concentrate under any high balls 
CSKA launch forward. All easier said than done, of course. CSKA unsurprisingly 
make a change, throwing on Fedor Chalov in place of Golovin. Then they get the 
party re-started.

And there’s a scoreline that makes more sense. Wonderful entertainment. More, 
please!
 
This was so simple! Eriksen, central in the pocket, pitching-wedges a diagonal 
ball to the left for Rose, who rolls a simple ball back across goal, allowing 
Kane to tap in! He couldn’t miss!

celebrates. Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images  
45 min: Son has been pretty quiet. He jinks in from the right, and nearly 
breaks through. But not quite.
 
43 min: Spurs very nearly fall behind again. Tosic breaks down the middle, 
draws Vertonghen, and passes to Milanov on his left. Milanov drops a shoulder 
to cut back inside, swishing past Dier. He shoots for the bottom left, but 
doesn’t catch it, and Lloris can claim. But Spurs were split open there, and 
fairly easily too.
 
42 min: Walker channels his inner Garrincha and very nearly bamboozles his way 
between Schennikov and Aleksei Berezutski, and into the box. But the dribble 
breaks down right at the end. CSKA are a complete shambles down this Spurs 
right. Though can you be a shambles if there’s nobody there in attendance?
 
40 min: I mean, this scoreline is still a bit daft, considering Tottenham’s 
overall dominance. But at least we’re no longer in the realms of the utterly 
surreal.
