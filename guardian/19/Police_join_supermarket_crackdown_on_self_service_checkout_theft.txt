New South Wales police are helping supermarkets, such as the 
multimillion-dollar grocery store chain Coles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/31/coles-workplace-agreement-rejected-by-fair-work-commission>
, in a crackdown on self-service checkouts.

A NSW crackdown on petty theft at chains has been launched, with Coles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/coles> saying it is sick of customers who 
lie about what’s in their basket to get a discount or who try and avoid paying 
altogether.

“No matter how small you think it is, even if it’s the avocado and you’re 
saving $2, it’s still shoplifting,” detective superintendent Murray Chapman 
told reporters outside a supermarket in Zetland, in inner Sydney, on Thursday.

Coles says it has caught roughly 11,000 customers stealing goods at its 
self-serve checkouts across Australia over the past year.

“There has been a normalisation of theft at self-serve checkouts over the last 
few years,” a spokeswoman for Coles, Martine Alpins, said. “There’s also a 
feeling that [because they’re] not being served by a traditional checkout 
person, ‘perhaps I have the entitlement’.”

But Coles said the machines weren’t going anywhere because they were 
convenient and increased customer traffic.

Chapman said he couldn’t go into the specifics of the crackdown but warned 
potential thieves they wouldn’t go unnoticed.

“You won’t see the loss prevention officers visibly in a lot of centres and 
you won’t see police,” he said. “But when we run these operations we’re out 
there and we work collectively to identify and charge people.”
