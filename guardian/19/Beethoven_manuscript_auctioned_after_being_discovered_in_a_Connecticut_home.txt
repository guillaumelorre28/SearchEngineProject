A handwritten piece of sheet music by Beethoven has sold for $100,000 
(£67,000) at auction after being discovered in Connecticut home. It was bought 
in November by a German antiques dealer.

Professional appraiser Brendan Ryan had visited the home of a woman in the US 
town of Greenwich when he spotted the sheet, covered with notes in German, 
behind glass. Ryan, who had been a Beethoven obsessive, recognised the 
handwriting. “I called my wife when I got into my car; I think I was bouncing 
off the walls,”he told Greenwich Time

.

The piece’s authenticity was confirmed by Carmelo Comberiati, who had been 
Ryan’s professor at college, and has studied Beethoven manuscripts. He was able 
to deduce that the music was from King Stephen, incidental music for a theatre 
piece. Three holes in the side of the paper showed the sheet had come from the 
notebook in which Beethoven worked on King Stephen in 1811.

Comberiati said Beethoven, unlike most composers, kept his workings. 
“Beethoven would write out his ideas. With most composers, we just have the 
final product – they threw the rest out. Beethoven didn’t throw anything out,” 
he told Greenwich Time. “I found the sketchbook and referenced the exact piece; 
we put it all together.”

King Stephen is among Beethoven’s minor works, and only its overture is 
performed with any frequency today. It was composed for a play written by 
August von Kotzebue for the opening of the Hungarian theatre in Pest, and tells 
of the life of the founder of modern Hungary in the late 10th and early 11th 
centuries. Beethoven also wrote music for another Von Kotzebue play, The Ruin 
of Athens, written for the same theatre.

Although Beethoven manuscripts go to auction regularly, the page from King 
Stephen was unusual for being unknown.
