Melbourne <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> woman Akon 
Guode has admitted murdering three of her seven children and trying to kill a 
fourth by driving her car deep into a lake.


Guode, 37, showed little emotion on Monday as she pleaded guilty to the 
infanticide of her one-year-old son and the murders of her four-year-old twins, 
a boy and girl.

She also pleaded guilty to the attempted to murder of her six-year-old 
daughter on the same day, 8 April 2015.

Guode’s plea in the Victorian supreme court comes at a mention hearing before 
she was due to stand trial.

As the charges were read to her, through the help of an interpreter, the only 
words she said were “guilty” to each charge.

Passersby and emergency services frantically tried to help Guode and her 
children after her car plunged deep into a Wyndham Vale. Bol, one, and the 
twins Hanger and her brother Madit died. Six-year-old Alual survived after 
being pulled from the water and sent to hospital.
