Samantha Stosur’s Australian Open preparations received a huge boost after she 
beat the Czech Republic’s world No 16 Lucie Safarova in the first round of the 
Sydney International.

Australian No 1 Stosur prevailed 7-6 (7-3) 5-7 6-3 in a match that lasted just 
over three hours on Ken Rosewall Arena at Sydney Olympic Park and ended a run 
of six successive defeats against the 2014 Wimbledon semi-finalist.

The hard-fought win was a much-needed one for the Queenslander, who crashed 
out in the first round at Brisbane last week.

She will now face world No 4 Caroline Wozniacki or Barbora Zahlavova Strycova 
of the Czech Republic for a place in the quarter-finals.

The left-handed Safarova held a 9-2 advantage in matches between the pair and 
Stosur had to save three set points before taking the opening set on a tiebreak.

She then hit back from 4-1 down to level the score at 5-all in the second 
before Safarova broke her for a third time and made it 1-1.

The turning point came in the deciding set when Stosur saved three break 
points to go 3-2 ahead before breaking the Czech, who double faulted on 
back-to-back points - allowing the world No 20 to see out the victory

“It was relatively important win. I gave it everything and it was great to 
have the home support,” Stosur said.

“Conditions were windy and gusty and the first set seemed to drag on with the 
rain delays. It was good to step up and win the match after what happened last 
week, and I am very happy with it.”
