REMOTE AND GREAT FOR WALKS

Secluded barn, Peak District

Half a mile outside the pretty hamlet of Ford and surrounded by its own 
woodland gardens, complete with brooks and tiny free-roaming Shetland ponies,
Ford Wetley Cottage is a lovely, secluded three-bedroom barn conversion. Oak 
beams and exposed stone walls add to the character and there’s a woodburner and 
firepit outside. The Peak District national park, with its huge choice ofwalks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jan/25/great-country-walks-roaches-peak-district-staffordshire>
, is right on the doorstep, while owners Louise and Adrian live nearby and have 
plenty of tips for exploring the area (and might even let you borrow their 
Collie, Murphy).

Not many cottages come with connections as intriguing as Magherintemple Lodge, 
a solid little Victorian gatehouse outside Ballycastle. Magherintemple has 
links with Irish nationalist Roger Casement and was built as part of the 
Casement family’s estate. Many visitors, however, are content to ponder only 
the modern-day trappings of the two-bedroom property – its sympathetic 
renovation by the Irish Landmark Trust, its inviting open fire and its 
proximity to the tumultuous Causeway Coast (the closest beach is five minutes’ 
drive away). While the cottage isn’t suitable for wheelchair users it is a good 
option for others who want to avoid stairs, since all the main rooms are on the 
ground floor.

Step back in time with a stay at Penrhyn, a traditional stone cottage with no 
electricity. Oil lamps and candles make for wonderfully atmospheric evenings 
playing games or gathering round the piano, and there’s an open-fire and 
woodburner, plus woollen curtains and bedspreads to keep you cosy. On Strumble 
Head, north Pembrokeshire, the cottage is reached via a rugged track through 
National Trust land and feels wonderfully remote, with dramatic sea views. The 
garden gate leads directly onto the Pembrokeshire Coastal Path for fantastic 
walks. There are two bedrooms on the ground floor and a third loft room reached 
by ships ladder.

Anyone for Tennyson? Lincolnshire


A pretty Victorian brick lodge, The Old School is now a lesson in peaceful 
rural comfort. In Hatton, on the edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds, it’s decorated 
in restful natural tones, textiles the colour of fresh hay and uncluttered 
wooden furniture. High ceilings and big windows make a light, calm space and 
there’s a woodburner for cosying around after days out exploring the pretty 
countryside thatinspired Tennyson <http://www.lincolnshirewolds.info/tennyson/>

It would be hard to find a better antidote to the commercialism of Christmas 
than Lindisfarne. It was the peaceful isolation of this island – cut off from 
the mainland twice a day by the rising tide – which first attracted an order of 
monks to build a priory here 1,400 years ago. Guests atCoastguard’s Cottage, 
the latest addition to English Heritage’s portfolio of holiday houses, can 
explore the atmospheric priory ruins after the day-trippers have left and will 
have the wild coastal footpaths almost entirely to themselves. The attractive 
whitewashed house is decorated with calming neutral tones and contemporary 
furnishings and has views of Lindisfarne Castle. It may not be cheap, but it’s 
worth splashing out on.

At the end of a long, single track lane in the middle of Exmoor is Nethercote 
Byre – a stone barn conversion, with superb views and complete seclusion. Apart 
from the odd horse rider, rambler or farmer, you’ll have this place to 
yourself. There’s plenty of room for a festive family gathering with four 
bedrooms, a large kitchen/dining room, a huge living room with woodburner and 
TV, and a second sitting room with table football, a large table for board 
games and jigsaws and a second TV (perfect if your party can’t agree on the 
Queen’s Speech or the Strictly Christmas special). Or just open the front door 
and head out onto the moor. A climb up nearby Winsford Hill should blow away 
any cobwebs.

Kick off the New Year by reconnecting with nature at Birdsong Barn, a brand 
new barn conversion which sits on a 350-acre private nature reserve. Surrounded 
by woodlands, wetlands and wild meadows, it’s a haven for wildlife: wild boar, 
barn owls, Shetland cattle and Konik ponies are just a few of the species you 
might encounter on a walk around the reserve, not to mention the wildfowl and 
waders that winter here. Built by local craftsmen using natural materials, the 
barn is a light-filled living space with huge windows, beamed ceilings, a 
woodburner and, that other essential for winter evenings – a home cinema system.

A former dovecote on a model farm just outside Patrick Brompton, in 
Wensleydale,Darjeeling Cottage is one of two holiday cottages that flank a 
genteel 18th-century house. Kept cosy with the help of a biomass boiler, the 
pint-sized hideout really is tiny (there’s no lounge – just a kitchen with 
breakfast bar, a wet room and a bedroom). It’s best suited for walkers (plenty 
of fine pubs nearby for Christmas lunch), being surrounded by fields and woods 
and within easy reach of attractions such asAysgarth Falls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/23/british-walks-uk-family-long-distance-paths-trails>

The Nest is a cabin-like, single-storey den in the small Victorian resort of

in winter, it’s much more peaceful and there are magical walks to be had along

but comfortable with luxury details, like underfloor heating in the shower

Built on stilts on a hillside at the end of a long tree-lined track, the Cabin 
at Wrinklers Wood combines a treehouse feel with comfortable open-plan living. 
The wraparound deck overlooks a woodland glade and stream, floor-to-ceiling 
windows make the most of the views and the hand-built furniture makes the most 
of the space. Although it feels remote, it’s just a few miles from St Agnes and 
closer still to the hamlet of Mithian, with its ancient pub.
• Sleeps 2, plus cot (and dog), a week from 21 or 28 Dec costs £516 (£369 for 
three nights), 01326 555555,classic.co.uk

The shepherd’s hut bandwagon is well and truly rolling, but Lamb’s Tale in the 
lovelyQuantock Hills 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/08/lets-go-to-the-quantock-hills-somerset>
 is particularly inviting. In a private paddock on a working farm, it’s been 
kitted out for a romantic stay with woodburner, king-size bed, proper shower 
room and secluded wood-fired hot tub (wood provided). Thesurrounding countryside
 <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/somerset> is a mix of woodland, open 
moorland and ancient pathways to explore. There are sweeping views over the 
valley across the Bristol Channel and beyond – plus a purpose-built kennel for 
dogs.
• Sleeps 2 (plus cot), £409 for three-night stay from 24 Dec. Longer stays (up 
to 28 – it’s booked for New Year) available too. No children aged 1-3,

For a budget festive getaway, a timber pod on the Quiet Site campsite near 
Ullswater <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/lakedistrict> is an excellent 
choice. The heated and carpeted wooden cabins are super-cosy and the site’s 
pub, in a 17th-century barn, has a games room with pool and table tennis that 
will be open on Christmas Day. Things liven up from Boxing Day and there’re 
three days of live music from the 29th until late on the 31st – so you can 
party and then hole up in your pod. With lovely views and plenty to do on the 
doorstep, it’s a great base for exploring the Lakes – Ullswater Steamers run 
special festive cruises over Christmas, too.
• Sleeps 2 adults + 2 under-15s, from £35 a night, three-night minimum stay

simple food, such as Suffolk ham, egg and chips, and has a roaring fire.Hadleigh

years to become a hugely popular boutique hotel and spa, this ancient hostelry 
with a log fire in the cosy bar – which once counted Admiral Lord Nelson among 
its regulars – has hung onto its roots as the village watering hole. At the end 
of the evening, it’s just a short stroll home across the village green for

cast-iron cooking range, and two pretty bedrooms.

something of an institution, with a beautiful riverfront setting and excellent 
food attracting visitors from far and wide. Guests staying atErwarton, a

woodburners to keep off the chill.

The Old Methodist Chapel in Heacham, a coastal village near Hunstanton, is a 
fabulous place for a party. The huge living room has double-height beamed 
ceilings, a logburner and a galleried landing. The kitchen-diner is also huge, 
and has an open fire (for cosiness, not for cooking). The house sleeps eight; 
two of the four rooms can be made up as twins or doubles, and there are three 
bathrooms – so plenty of space for groups of friends. Features from the 
building’s former life include the wooden floors, arched doors, stained glass 
windows and wrought-iron spiral staircase. Dogs are welcome (no more than two 
though) – there is an enclosed garden, plus two sandy beaches nearby for walks.

A recently renovated former farmhouse in Snowdonia, Rowen YHA’s bedrooms range 
from doubles and quads to six- or eight-bunk dorms. One of the smallest hostels 
available on an exclusive-use basis, it has an extra cosiness in winter thanks 
to two open fires. The building is well placed for working off any excess, with 
hikes up Snowdonia’s peaks or along the Conwy estuary, but beware that in snowy 
weather you may need to park at the bottom of the hill and lace up those boots 
just to reach it.

For luxury on a budget, The Barn at Ballaloaghtan ticks plenty of boxes. A 
newly renovated conversion on the slopes of South Barrule, this four-bedroom 
former barn looks out across the south of the island. Guests can cook in the 
hi-tech kitchen or warm their feet on a sheepskin rug as they get out of bed. 
The barn is part of a farm business that works with theRare Breeds Survival 
Trust <http://www.rbst.org.uk/> to preserve Britain’s livestock heritage. If 
you fancy a change from turkey, pre-order its pork, beef, mutton or lamb 
(including that from Manx Loaghtan sheep). Or, if you’d rather admire them than 
eat them, sign up for a rare breeds safari.

For groups of friends, the hippy-chic Quadrangle, near Shoreham village, makes 
an atmospheric festive hideaway. There are two accommodation options here: the 
Shepherd’s Barn sleeps up to 17 in a dormitory plus two in a double bedroom, 
while The Granary has two bathrooms and two bedrooms. Best rented together in 
winter (to share The Granary’s larger living room), both properties come with 
access to another large barn, which has no accommodation (or heating) but is a 
godsend for games, table tennis, screenings and impromptu shows in wet weather.

It’s not cheap but for a group of friends willing and able to splash out on a 
lush pad for Christmas or New Year, theHouse in Hastings, opening in November, 
is a real find. The five-storey, five-bedroom, four-bathroom Regency House has 
gorgeous sea views and inside it’s a mix of cool vintage touches (think 1940s 
chandeliers and original fireplaces) and modern artwork. The vibrant blue and 
green colour palette adds to the playful vibe and you’ll find everything you 
need to celebrate on hand, from a 12-seater dining table to cool cocktail 
cabinet. It’s from the owners of party palacesCarrington House 
<http://www.carringtonhouse.net/> and Cliff Barns <http://www.cliffbarns.com/>, 
and though a more sophisticated offering, it’s bound to have tons of style and 
fun features.

Lord it up over New Year in the imposing Chimney Corner, a modern, 
seven-bedroom pile in Satwell, a pretty hamlet just outside Henley-on-Thames 
(25 minutes from London by train). The sprawling, bright kitchen opens into a 
large dining area with a table seating 16, and there’s loads of space to spread 
out (one of the bedrooms is in a studio annexe, which also has its own 
kitchen). A games room comes complete with pool table, there’s an indoor sauna 
and, in the large garden, a trampoline and swing set will keep the kids happy, 
while grown-ups can relax in a six-seater hot tub. A state-of-the-art sound 
system plays music throughout the house and a TV room makes for cosy movie 
nights. Antony Worrall Thompson’sGreyhound pub <http://awtgreyhound.com/> is 
less than two miles away and there are lots of lovely river walks close by.

Promising a really special Christmas, Willow House, a glamorous six-bedroom, 
five-bathroom Georgian property near Richmond is somewhere Santa wouldn’t want 
to leave. With three storeys, the family can spread out or cosy up around the 
roaring fire in the large sitting room. The open plan kitchen/dining room area, 
with Yorkshire flagstone floors and upcycled church pews, is perfect for 
feasting, while the orangery offers an alternative dining space with stars 
twinkling above. A wood-fired hot-tub in the garden and ground floor bedroom 
with wet room that’s suitable for anyone with reduced mobility are other 
pluses. Such luxury comes with a hefty price tag at Christmas – but it’s a good 
choice year-round when prices drop, with gastropubs aplenty nearby, from theOak 
Tree Inn <https://sites.google.com/site/theoaktreewebsite/> in Hutton Magna to

Lavethan Mill is a deceptively large converted 16th-century mill and Cornish 
cottage, complete with a working water wheel. The sweet stone building has a 
higgledy-piggledy layout, with low beamed ceilings, secret staircases and 
timber-clad walls. The kitchen/diner has an Aga, there is an open fire in the 
sitting room and a woodburner and grand piano in the lounge, and a gorgeous 
master bedroom (plus four perfectly nice ones). Outside, there are landscaped 
gardens and the mill’s leat (water channel) and stream, which forms a pond deep 
enough for hardy souls to take a Christmas dip.The Camel Trail

It may be pricey, but Marsden Manor sleeps 20, so a big party can share the 
load. And guests get a lot for their money at this arts and crafts manor house: 
a drawing room with a log fire; a morning room; a media room for film nights; a 
games room; a play room; a big kitchen with an Aga … The library is 
particularly palatial. There are 10 bedrooms and seven bathrooms, plus a 
downstairs loo. It’s worth knowing, if you want to book it at another time of 
the year, that the large gardens contain a swimming pool (heated and open over 
the New Year), tennis courts, croquet, cricket and tennis facilities, and a 
wendy house. Original features include stone-mullioned casement windows, 
archways, beams, slate flag floors, an inglenook fireplace, handmade tiles and 
wood panelling.

If your Christmas tends to revolve around food, then you could do a lot worse 
than spend it in Richmond. The Georgian market town on the edge of theDales 
national park <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/yorkshire>has built up a 
reputation as a gastronomic hotspot on the back of its fine-dining pubs, food 
markets and restaurants.Evergreen is a gorgeous two-bedroom cottage on the 
outskirts of town with views of Richmond Castle. Decor is reminiscent of a 
boutique hotel (purple velvet, bold stripes, rich fabrics) and there’s no 
skimping on the home entertainment front either, with a Blu-ray player and a 
Blue-tooth MP3 player among the gizmos. A logburner completes the picture. The 
nearest station is at Darlington, 12 miles away, served by trains from all over 
the UK.

Wake up to magical views of Jedburgh Abbey 
<https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/jedburgh-abbey-p247621> at Boundary 
Bank, a 19th-century coaching house which has been reinvented as a warm holiday 
home with bags of character. The historic border town of Jedburgh’s independent 
shops, cafes and restaurants are just a short stroll away but, if you’re 
looking for something a little more challenging, the long-distance footpaths of 
theBorders Abbey Way 
<http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/borders/borders-abbeys-way.shtml> and the 
Southern Upland Way <http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/southern-upland-way.shtml> 
are within easy reach. Alternatively, you can get those New Year’s resolutions 
off to a good start with a visit to the nearby pool and leisure centre. The 
house has been stylishly renovated and the light-filled open-plan living area 
has reclaimed wooden doors, beams and flooring, leather armchairs and a 
woodburner. The nearest station is Tweedbank (15 miles away), on the recently 
openedBorders Railway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/sep/04/scotland-new-borders-railway-edinburgh-waverley>
, which links the region with Edinburgh.
