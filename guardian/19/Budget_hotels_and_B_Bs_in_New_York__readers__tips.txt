Winning tip: The Jane Hotel, West Village

The Jane is probably the best hotel experience I have ever had. In the heart 
of the most wonderful NYC neighbourhood – Greenwich Village – it has rooms 
inspired by vintage train cabins and a history of sheltering Titanic survivors. 
Its prices are affordable and it definitely offers far more than you would 
expect from a three-star hotel. If you like retro and are up for an adventure, 
this is the place for you.

St Mark's Hotel
This basic yet comfortable hotel is in the middle of all the action; near 
tattoo parlours, quirky eats and alternative stores such asTrash & Vaudeville 
<http://www.trashandvaudeville.com/>. Greenwich Village, Noho, Soho and Union 
Square are in walking distance. It has charm, and a seedy glamour.

Carlton Arms Hotel
In 1983, owner Ed Ryan brought in masses of art, with each bedroom designed by 
a different artist. You can stay even more cheaply by opting for a shared 
bathroom; Wi-Fi is free and the hotel prides itself on its "hand-woven Costa 
Rican toilet tissue".

The Pod Hotel
The Pod's perfectly practical and tech-tastic rooms are small but the hotel 
more than makes up for this in other ways: free Wi-Fi, concierge service, 
cocktail cart in the lobby and a roof terrace to enjoy them on, iPod docks and 
movies on demand. It's a savvy, sassy, stylish choice that won't leave you 
wondering what you've paid for.

At the beautiful and central Edison, even the cheapest rooms are warm, 
well-proportioned and comfy. The location makes most things a breeze. The diner 
downstairs serves uncomplicated and hearty breakfasts and is the setting for 
Neil Simon's play Forty-Five Seconds from Broadway.

The Gershwin
The location is perfect: we could easily walk anywhere and there were subway 
stations very close by. The Gershwin is part hotel, part hostel so there is the 
option of cheap or very cheap but, obviously, this is still in the context of 
Manhattan. The beds were very comfortable and clean and we saw inside a suite – 
it was huge!

The Chambers hotel
This place provides all you need in a small but perfectly formed package, 
close to 5th Avenue Subway and convenient for the train to Boston and the 
north. The cosmopolitan ambience is exactly what you want in a visit to the Big 
Apple, and the service is genuinely friendly and faultless. Ultimate accolade: 
I met a native New Yorker in Sri Lanka and mentioned that I'd used a great 
hotel. The immediate response was: "That must be the Chambers."

Harlem

San Fermín apartments
Cosy and clean rooms at an affordable price. Don't be put off by staying in 
Harlem: it's a fascinating neighbourhood. We arrived to the sound of jazz being 
played in the street, everyone we met was really helpful and you can be in 
Times Square in about 15 minutes. Bernardo, the owner, is great for 
recommendations, and helpful if you're looking to see a less touristy side to 
the Big Apple.
