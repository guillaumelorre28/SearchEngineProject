China remained by far the biggest destination for Australian cash this year, 
while the amount of funds transferred to Estonia experienced a huge, 
unexplained spike.

New data published on Austrac’s freedom of information disclosure log 
<http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/foi-total-yearly-ifti-report-value.pdf>
 reveals the annual totals of international funds transfers from Australian 
accounts since 2010.

The movement of funds itself is not suspicious, but can provide intelligence 
for anti-money laundering organisations like Austrac.

This year, $1.26bn was moved from Australian bank accounts to China, compared 
to $591m in 2010.


The Philippines received $652m, making it the next biggest destination for 
funds transfers, jumping from $347m six years ago.

Britain, India, and the United States were also among the top destinations for 
Australian money last year, although the amount of funds being transferred to 
the US dropped significantly since 2010.

The amount of funds that moved to the small European nation of Estonia jumped 
dramatically.

In 2010, just $77,500 moved from Australian accounts to the small European 
nation. That had increased dramatically to $4.3m by 2015, and again to $8.9m in 
2016.

Anti-money laundering expert, John Walker, said most of the changes could be 
easily explained by trade.


Estonia joined the European Union in 2004, and Walker said this may explain 
the spike in funds transfer since 2010.


He said it could simply be due to an increase in trade between Australia and 
Estonia, due to their EU membership, or because money launderers took advantage 
of a “new” opportunity in that country.

The Austrac data appeared to also show a huge increase in funds transfers to 
Monaco, from $3,347 in 2010 to $1.6m in 2016.

Walker said he doubted the increase suggested greater use of Monaco for money 
laundering.


“The increases can reflect an increase in trade between Monaco and Australia – 
it’s virtually impossible to tell – remember that these are not necessarily 
‘suspicious’ transactions,” Walker said.

“Monaco has never figured very highly, and that’s because casinos are very 
good at laundering money without raising suspicions.”

 that the spike in funds to Estonia warranted a close examination by 
authorities.
