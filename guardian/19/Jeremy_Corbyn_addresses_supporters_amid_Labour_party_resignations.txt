Thousands of supporters of Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> piled into Parliament 
Square in London to express support for him in the face of the leadership 
challenge.

They shouted, cheered, booed and beat drums to make themselves heard at a 
fractious parliamentaryLabour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
party (PLP) meeting taking place across the road at Westminster.

After the PLP meeting, Corbyn crossed the road to address the rally. He did 
not directly speak about the challenge being mounted against him, other than to 
call vaguely for respect for one another and stress the need for unity.

He said the Labour members learned from one another through shared values and 
tolerance. “That is where unity comes from and that is what makes us strong,” 
he said.

The rally was organised by the grassroots organisation Momentum set up last 
year to back Corbyn.

The organisers initially put the turnout at 4,000 but later claimed that 
police had put the crowd at 10,000. The rally offered a taste of what Labour 
MPs hostile towards him can expect when they return to their constituency 
parties.

Chanting “Corbyn In, Tories Out”, they booed those MPs who had resigned from 
the shadow cabinet or publicly expressed criticism of him, singling out Hilary 
Benn,Margaret Hodge <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaret-hodge> and 
Tristram Hunt.

Speakers came from the unions and the small band of MPs backing him, including 
Dennis Skinner <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dennis-skinner>, Diane 
Abbot and Richard Burgon. Skinner said it was one of the biggest rallies he had 
seen for years.

Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, one of the founders of Momentum, said: “Let 
me make it clear Jeremy Corbyn is not resigning … If there is another 
leadership election,Jeremy Corbyn will stand again

”

The rally was held at 24 hours’ notice. Among those attending, Labour and 
Momentum member Neil McKeown, 35, a sound designer originally from Glasgow and 
now living in London, said he was convinced Corbyn would win another leadership 
contest.

“I think he has the support of the vast majority of the membership. I think 
the behaviour of the parliamentary Labour party has been disgraceful,”McKeown 
said.

“It is not just stabbing him in the back. It is stabbing everyone in the back.”
