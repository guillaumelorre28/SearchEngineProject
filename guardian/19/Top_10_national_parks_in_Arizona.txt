Grand Canyon national park

Other canyons on earth are longer and wider (Australia's Capertee Valley is 
both) and deeper (Kali Gandaki Gorge in Nepal), but none is as famous as the 
Grand Canyon, with its intricate layering, maze-like side canyons, vivid 
colours and epic visual scale. It's 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide and 
over a mile deep, cutting down through more than two billion years of geologic 
time, exposing some of the oldest rocks on earth.

To visit the Grand Canyon, in north-west Arizona, choose between the more 
developed South Rim, which is open year-round, and has drive-up overlooks, 
museums and mule rides, or the more secluded North Rim, which is higher in 
elevation and closed to vehicles from mid-October until mid-May because of the 
snow (skiers and snowshoers are welcome). The average distance across the 
canyon is only 10 miles, but there are no bridges for cars and the 215-mile 
drive from one rim to the other takes five hours. Both rims offer lodging and 
camping options, as well as a selection of trails descending into the canyon. 
Or you see it from a rafting expedition down the Colorado river.

Top tips Standing on the edge of either rim is awe-inspiring, but nothing 
beats actually getting down in the canyon. Do not attempt to hike from the rim 
to the Colorado river and back in one day! To spend the night in the canyon, 
you need backcountry hiking and camping permits. Or book a mule ride toPhantom 
Ranch <http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/phantom-ranch-704.html>, one of the 
most remote lodges in the national park system. Summer temperatures can be 
sweltering in the canyon. Winter is often the best season for hiking, though 
backpackers should be prepared for snow and ice.

Vermilion Cliffs national monument
 The Wave at Vermilion Cliffs, Arizona. Photograph: Alamy 
If you're visiting the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, make time for a detour 
to these little-known but spectacular cliffs on the Utah border, near the town 
of Page The 1,000m cliffs plunge down from the Paria plateau, one of the 
grandest wildernesses in the country.

There are few trails and no roads in this remote, rugged landscape, but it's 
not inaccessible: the area has been inhabited for more than 12,000 years, as 
evidenced by the ruins and petroglyphs found throughout the plateau. To 
experience this incredible area on foot, you'll need some luck in the 
backcountry permit lottery and some serious wilderness knowhow.

Less wilderness-savvy visitors can settle for crossing the stunning Navajo 
Bridge, which links the North and South Rims of the Grand Canyon, east of Grand 
Canyon national park. The drive along Alt 89, a paved scenic road, from Navajo 
Bridge to the North Rim Village, skirts the base of the Vermilion Cliffs.

Top tip The Wave, in the Coyote Buttes North region of the Paria 
Canyon-Vermillion Wilderness, could be the single most psychedelically 
spectacular rock formation in the country. Only 20 permits a day are given out 
for access to The Wave. Half are available through an online lottery and half 
from the visitor centre at Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument in 
Kanab, Utah, just over the state line from Fredonia.

Wupatki and Sunset Crater national monuments

Southern Arizona is the more populous part of the state today, but 
historically more people lived in the north-central plateau. Home to the 
ancient Pueblo people (formerly known as the Anasazi) Wupatki national 
monument, north of Flagstaff, has the ruins of five pueblos, built from slabs 
of the region's brick-red Moenkopi sandstone.

Most of the large pueblos at Wupatki were constructed after the violent 
eruption of the nearby Sunset Crater volcano, in around 1085. Ash was spread 
over 800 square miles of land, forcing the temporary evacuation of the region. 
But the ash also improved the soil for farming and Wupatki's pueblos flourished 
by 1100. Today, Sunset Crater national monument protects the massive cinder 
cone volcano and the surrounding lavascapes.

The five largest pueblos at Wupatki can be visited in a day and make for a 
nice trip from Flagstaff or a scenic detour on the way to the Grand Canyon. 
Camping is available at Sunset Crater national monument. The Wupatki visitor 
centre provides trail guides.

Top tip The Wukoki pueblo is a little further off the main road than the other 
pueblos, but its castle-like stance atop a large rock outcrop makes it the most 
dramatic.

Montezuma's Castle national monument
 Montezuma's Castle, Arizona. Photograph: Alamy 
Montezuma's Castle has nothing to do with Montezuma, the Aztec emperor who 
reigned in Mexico long after these cliffside ruins were abandoned. The misnomer 
was coined by white explorers who rediscovered the ruins in 1860 and reasoned 
that the spectacular place must have been built for a king.

This cliffside complex, one of the largest and best-preserved cliff dwellings 
in North America, was actually built around AD700 by the Sinagua people and 
abandoned in 1485, probably after a long period of drought. The 20-room 
dwelling, which was more of an apartment complex reached by ladders than a 
fortress, probably housed about 50 people.

An easy paved trail leads out to the ruins. Accessing the ruins via ladders 
has been banned since 1951, and there are no camping or lodging facilities 
within the park, but accommodation ranging from primitive campsites to upscale 
luxury hotels can be found in the surrounding Coconino national forest and 
nearby Sedona and Flagstaff.

Top tip Skip Interstate 17 in favour of the scenic route Alt-89 to Montezuma's 
Castle through Sedona's spectacular red-rock country.

Walnut Canyon national monument

 Cliff dwellings at Walnut Canyon, Arizona. Photograph: Alamy 
With its deep, sinuous curves through striking white Kaibab limestone, Walnut 
Canyon would be an attraction in itself, even without its numerous cliff 
dwellings. More than 80 single-family homes are found tucked into natural 
limestone overhangs in this canyon, just 10 miles east of Flagstaff.

The small rooms, just big enough to cook and sleep in, were built between 1125 
and 1250 by the Sinagua people, who also constructed the distinctly different 
Montezuma's Castle, about 30 miles south. The site was abandoned possibly due 
to drought or tribal warfare.

Many of the structures in Walnut Canyon can be visited along a paved one-mile 
loop trail that descends 55m from the visitor centre on the rim.

There are no camping or lodging facilities within the park, but camping is 
available in the surrounding Kaibab and Coconino national forests and hotels 
abound in nearby Flagstaff.

Top tip The Grand Canyon International Hostel 
<http://www.grandcanyonhostel.com/GCindex.htm> in Flagstaff provides cheap 
bunks and private rooms to travellers of all ages, as well as shuttle services 
to the Grand Canyon, Walnut Canyon and other nearby attractions.

Meteor Crater national natural landmark 
 Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona. Photograph: Alamy 
Around 50,000 years ago, when woolly mammoths and giant ground sloths roamed 
eastern Arizona, an iron-nickel meteor the size of three school buses streaked 
across the sky and slammed into the earth with a force greater than 10 
megatonnes of TNT. The impact left a massive circular hole in the earth's 
crust, just off the interstate near Winslow. It's a mile across, 2.4 miles in 
circumference and about 170m deep – and now known as one of the world's 
best-preserved examples of a meteor crater.

Meteor Crater is actually privately owned, but it's open to the public and 
recognised as a national natural landmark. A well-appointed visitor centre 
displays copious information about how the crater was formed and its long road 
to recognition as a meteor crater, as opposed to a volcanic feature. RV and 
tent camping is also available on site, or down the road at Homolovi state park 
<http://azstateparks.com/Parks/HORU/>.

Top tip Visitors are no longer allowed to hike down into the crater, but you 
can join one of the guided tours that explores its rim.

Canyon De Chelly national monument
 Canyon de Chelly Arizona, the Spider Rock overlook. Photograph: Alamy 
Canyon De Chelly is a sacred place. Carved into the sandstone bedrock of 
north-eastern Arizona, near Chinle, the three spectacular canyons, De Chelly, 
Del Muerto, and Monument, lie at the centre of the Navajo Nation and at the 
heart of many native legends.

These canyons have been occupied for thousands of years, more continuously 
than anywhere else in North America; the Ancestral Puebloans, Anasazi, Hopi and 
Navajo have all called this place home. Today, Canyon De Chelly is operated as 
a national monument on Navajo Tribal Trust Land, the only national monument not 
owned by the federal government.

Because the Navajo people still call Canyon De Chelly (pronounced de-shay) 
home, visitors are restricted from exploring without a native guide. 
Unaccompanied visitors can follow the scenic North and South Rim drives, with 
overlooks along the lengths of the canyons, including at Spider Rock, an iconic 
sandstone spire that towers 230m above the canyon floor.

To see more, you'll need to hire a native guide to escort you on either foot, 
4x4 or horseback. Book your tour ahead of time or stop by the visitor centre 
for recommendations. Tent and RV camping is available at the Cottonwood 
campsite.

Top tip You don't need a guide to hike down to the White House Ruins, a 
three-mile circular trek that drops 150m down into the canyon. The trail begins 
six miles east of the visitor centre along the South Rim drive. Remember, as 
with all canyons, hiking down is optional; getting back up is mandatory!

Monument Valley Navajo tribal park 
 Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, Arizona/Utah. Photograph: Alamy 
Monument Valley has long been used as a dramatic backdrop for Hollywood 
westerns, but the even biggest movie screens don't do justice to this 
incredible landscape in north-east Arizona. Monument Valley is named for the 
dozens of free-standing sandstone buttes and monoliths that tower above the 
sweeping sagebrush landscape. Bridging the state line between Arizona and Utah, 
the formations serve as a fitting gateway to south-east Utah's famous red-rock 
country.

The land is held by the Navajo people, and visitors must pay an access fee to 
drive through the tribal park on a 17-mile dirt loop, which is suitable for all 
cars when dry but impassable after a storm ( usually in late summer). Tours to 
other areas, such as Mystery Valley and Hunts Mesa, can be arranged at the 
visitor centre, off Highway 163. There is no camping within the park itself, 
but many opportunities can be found to the north and south.
Top tip Be sure to get out of the car and experience some this wide-open 
landscape on foot via the 3.2-mile Wildcat trail, around the West Mitten butte. 
It's self-guided and open to the public. Other access to tribal land requires 
permits and/or guides.

Petrified Forest national park
 Petrified Forest National Park, Badlands, Arizona. Photograph: Alamy 
Back when dinosaurs ruled the earth, what is now eastern Arizona was a humid, 
subtropical rainforest. Evidence of the arid desert's greener past is preserved 
in an astonishing collection of petrified trees within this national park.

During the Late Triassic period, fallen trees were buried by sediment with a 
high content of volcanic ash. Over the years, quartz crystals gradually 
replaced the organic wood matter, petrifying the trees. The high quartz content 
makes the petrified wood very hard: it can only be cut by a diamond-tipped saw.

The national park is also known for its fossils (plants dating back 225m 
years, reptiles and dinosaurs) and a colourful landscape known as the Painted 
Desert. The park is bisected by interstate 40, making for a convenient rest 
stop 50 miles west of the New Mexican border. There are no developed camping or 
lodging facilities within the park.

Top tip Visit the Rainbow Forest Museum and pick up a trail guide for the 
½-mile Giant Logs trail, which features some of the largest and best-preserved 
petrified trees in the park. Remember: removal of petrified wood or other 
material is strictly prohibited by federal law!

Saguaro national park
 Saguaro National Park, Arizona. Photograph: Alamy 
Few symbols of the south-west are as distinctive as the towering silhouette of 
a saguaro cactus. But despite their ubiquity on license plates and T-shirts, 
saguaros are only found within a small slice of southern Arizona. Hundreds of 
these sentinels, up to 15m tall, are protected within the bounds of Saguaro 
national park, on the outskirts of Tucson.

Saguaros need all the protection they can get. The giant cactuses can live 
over 250 years and weigh several tonnes, but their single trunk and relatively 
soft flesh make them vulnerable to vandalism. In Arizona, harming a saguaro in 
any way is illegal, with serious consequences such as hefty fines and even jail.

Saguaro national park is split into two districts, west and east of Tucson. 
More than 150 miles of well-maintained and marked trails wind through the park. 
Summer temperatures can be deadly, so aim for mornings and evenings in autumn, 
winter and spring. There are no developed campsites in the park, but walk-in 
backcountry camping is allowed and a wide range of accommodation can be found 
in Tucson and surrounding areas.

Top tip Plan to visit in late May or early June, when the Saguaros are 
blooming with huge white waxy flowers. The nectar attracts all manner of 
wildlife, including many species of bat and bird.
