Faced with a complex question – Britain’s future not only in the EU but in a 
globalising world – both remain and leave insult voters’ intelligence with 
simple answers: leave promises control of decision-making and borders while 
remain argues the economic case when much else besides Brexit could inflict 
severe damage on the UK economy (Osborne and Darling slam ‘uncosted and 
unworkable’ EU exit plan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/george-osborne-alistair-darling-unite-against-vote-leave>
s, 2 June).

The referendum exposes deep divisions. Outers mostly represent voters who feel 
marginalised and left behind by forces that are battering not just their 
personal security, but nation states and entire regions. For these voters, the 
EU is a passing dog which, like David Cameron andGeorge Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne>, deserves a good kicking. 
Remain is backed by mostly better-educated, more confident and financially 
secure voters who enjoy many benefits from globalisation.

A potential split in the Conservative party is a self-inflicted problem that I 
barely care about, but I care deeply about a country so divided between two 
camps with such a different sense of wellbeing.

• The “realignment of British politics”, with the Tories “dividing three 
ways”, as Tim Montgomerie forecasts, and as Owen Jones reports, ignores the 
lessons from history (Why Labour may have to divide before they conquer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/02/labour-party-may-divide-before-conquer>
, 2 June). The in-fighting in the Tory ranks, with its increasingly unsavoury 
attacks on the leadership, is very reminiscent of 1846, and the split over the 
repeal of the Corn Laws. The then-leader, Robert Peel, was savaged by a group 
led by the unprincipled and exceedingly ambitious Benjamin Disraeli, who 
aspired to reach the top of the “greasy pole” by whatever means possible. The 
consequent split in the party led in the long term to an alliance of Peelites 
with some Whigs to form a less conservative Tory party, calling themselves 
Liberals.

The likely result today is that the Disraeli-equivalent, Boris Johnson, will 
go on to lead the rightwing of the party, while the centre group could well see 
the electoral benefits of joining with the right of the Labour party. Clearly 
the likes ofPeter Mandelson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/peter-mandelson>, Tristram Hunt and Liz 
Kendall have as much in common with Cameron as they do with Corbyn. Owen 
Jones’s hopes for proportional representation are slim, requiring, as it would, 
Tories’ support, so, while his prediction of Labour splitting into “a 
centre-left and a left party” is probable, the end result could well be a new 
middle-ground party.

Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs would be better 
advised to unite around Jeremy Corbyn; it was 28 years before Disraeli could 
manage a majority government.

• David Cameron has a strong personal interest in trying to decouple the 
debate about Britain’s continued membership of the EU from discussion of his 
leadership of the Tory party, but many non-Tories will see this as a missed 
opportunity. In the 35 years since the “Gang of Four” departed from Labour, the 
Tory party has stayed together against the weight of even more widespread and 
fundamental disagreements on relationships with Europe. A split on the right, 
and consequent realignments – taking in the remnants of New Labour and some
Liberal Democrats <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats> – is 
long overdue, and could refresh the stale state of parliamentary politics, 
while helping Labour to become a more united party.

• I really liked Jane Braithwaite’s theory about the Tories and the EU 
referendum (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/29/election-must-be-the-price-of-a-remain-vote>
, 30 May). Here’s mine: the Tories split after the referendum, with a 
Ukip/Brexit faction versus remain Tories. Next election, nobody wins, Tories 
refuse a remain Tories/David Miliband Labour coalition. Remain Tories and 
Ukip/Brexit Tories form coalition. In effect, the Tories become first party to 
win another election by forming a coalition with themselves.

• Has anyone else noted that the majority of Tory Brexiter MPs and 
ex-ministers are those who have previously been disciplined or reshuffled 
because of poor judgment, ill-considered statements or a cavalier approach to 
statistical information (Tories’ Brexit rift widens as rebels call for Cameron 
exit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/29/andrew-brigden-conservatives-david-cameron-fractured-eu-debate-election>
, 30 May)? Think of Owen Paterson, Nadine Dorries, Michael Gove, Liam Fox, Iain 
Duncan Smith et al. This perhaps helps explain their inability to absorb 
information, evaluate it, make rational assessments or speak truthfully in 
relation to the leave campaign.

• With both major parties seriously fractured and tearing themselves apart, 
where are the Liberal Democrats to capitalise on the situation and offer an 
alternative, as the SDP did 35 years ago? What’s their leader’s name again?
