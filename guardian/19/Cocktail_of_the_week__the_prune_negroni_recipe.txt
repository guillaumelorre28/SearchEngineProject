A seasonal take on the classic. You need to make the infusion three weeks 
ahead (so this could be ready for New Year’s Eve), but there’s little else to 
it. Serves one.

For the prune infusion
2-3 handfuls dried prunes
Equal measures gin and Campari

To serve
50ml prune infusion
25ml red vermouth
1 large strip orange peel

Half-fill a big sterilised jar with prunes, top with the booze, seal and store.

To serve, fill a whisky glass with ice, add the infusion and vermouth, and 
stir for a minute. Gently squeeze the orange over the top, then drop in and 
stir for a minute, to release the oils. Garnish with an infused prune.
