.

Bilic once again sang the praises of the 11-goal striker who started his 
career at West Ham, though the manager refused to comment on reports the club 
will be making another bid for the 34-year-old. Bilic also confirmed that he 
has scoutedBrentford’s striker Scott Hogan

, but said that the Italian forward Simone Zaza’s “story at the club is over”.

“It was on television,” Bilic said of West Ham’s £6m bid for Defoe. “But we’re 
not going to discuss players that are not ours. The whole club is trying really 
hard to get some players in positions that we need. But I’m not going to talk 
here in public.

“He has the things that are most important in a football game and that’s 
goals. Last season he was probably the main reason Sunderland stayed up and he 
has continued to play the same way this season. Each game he is not only 
scoring goals but creating chances and most of the chances he’s converting into 
goals.”

It is understood that West Ham are preparing a bid of an initial £9m for 
Hogan, who has scored 14 goals in the Championship so far this season in a 
struggling Brentford side, but Bilic said: “He’s a good player. I’ve watched 
him a few times. Again he is scoring goals, he’s very sharp, very quick and a 
very good finisher. He does it in the championship. But once again, Hogan is 
not on our roster.”

As for Zaza, the Italian international has been a conspicuous failure since 
arriving in the summer. But a clause in his contract means that West Ham would 
be obliged to buy him permanently if he played more than 10 league games for 
the club and Bilic confirmed he would not be used by the club again.

“We wanted him at West Ham and he wanted to come, but because of his contract 
I can say his story with us is finished”, Bilic said. “He is still our player 
until the moment he goes somewhere but mainly it’s the circumstance with his 
contract. He’s definitely a good player and we had big expectations but it just 
wasn’t to be.”
