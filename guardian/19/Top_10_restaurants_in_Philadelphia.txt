Geno's


No one was going to get out of this list alive without talking about 
cheesesteaks, that most Philadelphian of sandwich 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/sep/21/best-philly-cheesesteak-philadelphia>
. Wars have been started over less than what the local fave of meat/cheese/roll 
is, and the recent history of venerable cheesesteak outpost Geno's has been 
particularlycontroversial <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeNHJCQDyIA>. 
However, for the overall "cheesesteak experience", no one has ever been better 
than Geno's.

Jerry's Bar


Jerry's Bar is essentially the perfect neighbourhood eatery. The beautifully 
renovated space (run by father and daughter William and Christie Proud) has a 
timeless feel, and everything is done the way it should be. The local, seasonal 
dishes are always fresh and flavourful, and the brunch menu is arguably the 
best in town. There are cocktails to match the food – classics and new 
creations, but never too fussy.

Vernick Food & Drink

 Vernick Food & Drink, philly 
There are few dining experiences in Philadelphia to top that of the 
husband-and-wife-owned Vernick Food & Drink. Chef Greg Vernick excels at 
creating consistently simple, fresh and refined fare that changes frequently, 
and includes an assortment of toasts, a raw bar, small and large plates and 
food roasted in the wood-fired oven. And the service is top-notch.

Vietnam

We've been eating at Vietnam since long before all but one of the spots 
mentioned on this list (Geno's) were some young chef's dream. And as Benny 
Lai's flagship Vietnamese eatery in Chinatown has grown since the 1990s, so 
have we; by about 20 pounds. Now, we can't attribute all of that to Vietnam's 
venerable BBQ platter – which includes pork meatballs, char-grilled chicken, 
and beef wrapped in grape leaves – but between that and their 
iconic-in-these-parts vermicelli noodle bowls, there's some serious 
representation. In this way, over the years, Vietnam has become a staple of 
Philly comfort food. AWest Philly location, convenient to UPenn and Drexel, is 
now open <http://www.eatatvietnam.com/vietnam_cafe.php>, boasting all of that 
same goodness.

Noord Eetcafe


Chef-owner Joncarl Lachman has drawn on his Dutch lineage to create a 
first-of-its-kind northern European bistro in Philadelphia. The menu features 
smoked fish, deliciousbitterballen (braised and fried pork meatballs with 
nutmeg and mustard) and Amsterdam-style mussels (to name a few). Lachman's warm 
personality rounds out a notable dining experience.

Serpico 

 Serpico Philly 
You may have heard of Stephen Starr <http://www.starr-restaurant.com/> fellow. 
He's the restaurant-auteur who's built a small empire of restaurants around 
Philly and then America, each jumping on some particular foodie bandwagon of 
the moment. Recently, it's his new collaboration with Peter Serpico that stands 
out. Served in a sleek, dark and distinctly modern venue, Serpico's menu is 
rounded out with elegant, ambitious "global fare". His chilled dashi soup is a 
revelation; likewise his deep-fried duck leg served on a potato roll, and 
Cope's corn ravioli.

Zahav
 Fried Cauliflower, Zahav Restaurant Philly 
The "core curriculum" at chef Michael Solomonov's Zahav has changed very 
little since its opening, and that's not out of laziness: eight years on, his 
take on modern Israeli cuisine is still essential – there's still nothing else 
quite like it around. With a menu built fromsalatim (cold vegetable dishes, 
mostly) and hummus, mezze plates and kebabs, Zahav is deceptively simple in 
some ways; but the menu also contains dishes like grilled duck hearts and 
crispy haloumi with golden raisins and carrots. We strongly recommend the Tayim 
tasting menu at $39 per person: get more than two people on this train and 
you're on your way to being able to taste the entire menu.

Cheu Noodle Bar


The wildly successful Cheu Noodle Bar offers a range of traditional Asian 
dishes with the chef's own spin. The menu of small plates includes dumplings 
that change daily, veggies such as Szechuan long beans, and barbecued pig 
tails. The "noodles", all handmade, include a pork shoulder ramen, a brisket in 
chilli broth, cold jade noodles with crab, and more. The intimate space even 
features a wall made from the contents of instant ramen noodle packets.

Fette Sau
 Fetta Sau, Philadelphia 
Fette Sau, another Starr outing (see Serpico), is a barbecue restaurant 
specialising in dry-rubbed meats sourced from small, local farms and smoked 
in-house. The menu changes daily, with meats (mainly cuts of pork and beef) 
available by the pound. The sides are kept simple and include burnt-end baked 
beans, broccoli salad, pickles and potato chips. The drinks list offers 
numerous beers on tap and an extensive list of North American bourbons and 
whiskies. Ordering is done cafeteria-style, with tray in hand, and picnic 
tables give the former industrial space a communal atmosphere.

Federal Donuts
 Federal Donuts, PHiladelphia 
Chef Michael Solomonov (see Zahav) and business partner Steve Cook's goofy but 
delicious Federal Donuts is maybe the most successfully quirky foodery ever to 
hit Philly. The menu features a variety of inventive flavours of doughnuts and 
fried chicken, done with creativity and flair. Doughnut flavours include 
cookies and cream, banana cream pie and strawberry-ginger, while chicken 
seasonings include coconut curry, za'atar and buttermilk ranch.
