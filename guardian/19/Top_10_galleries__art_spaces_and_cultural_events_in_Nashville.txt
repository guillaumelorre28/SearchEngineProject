First Saturday Art Crawl

The first Saturday evening of each month is a smorgasbord for art lovers: 
dozens of galleries open their doors to the public free of charge. Most also 
offer complimentary cocktails. Participating galleries along 5th Avenue, known 
as the Avenue of the Arts, and upstairs in the Historic Arcade, run the gamut 
from photography to contemporary to fine art. The Nashville Downtown 
Partnership offers a free shuttle service from 6pm.

Saturday, 6pm to 9pm, free

Oz

One of the newest galleries in town, Oz is the first of its kind locally: an 
innovative contemporary art experience in a renovated cigar warehouse. Started 
by father-and-son team Cano and Tim Ozgener – former cigar moguls who sold 
their company in 2010 and were left with a vacant 10,000sq ft space on their 
hands – Oz is in the far reaches of West Nashville, near a small public 
airport. It's not the easiest place to find and thus is a destination in 
itself. Focusing on visual and performing arts, the venue lends itself to 
artists who have a concept to explore, be it dance, music, theatre or design. 
It also has a swanky lounge, roomy outdoor patio and peaceful Zen garden.

served as a post office – the Frist highlights local and regional artists 
alongside some of the nation's biggest travelling exhibitions. There are also 
30 interactive multimedia stations in the Martin ArtQuest gallery, where 
visitors can create their own art. Every Thursday and Friday night sees Music

Opened in 1879 on Nashville's main drag, Broadway, Hatch Show Print is one of 
the world's oldest letterpress print shops still in existence and is often 
considered symbolic of the city's legacy. Hatch is responsible for printing 
many a well-known musician's and band's posters, from concerts to tours to 
album releases, as well as much of the event signage around town. Now owned by 
theCountry Music Hall of Fame <http://countrymusichalloffame.org/> and housed 
in the adjoiningOmni Nashville Hotel 
<http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/Nashville.aspx> (opened in 2013), the 
shop has tall windows that allow passersby to peek at the antique equipment and 
watch the printing in progress. Hatch also offers occasional letterpress art 
workshops and sells a wide range of new and vintage prints.

TPAC puts on regular theatrical productions, from touring shows to local 
companies. The Nashville Ballet, which stages a variety of shows including a 
contemporary dance set to Johnny Cash tunes, calls TPAC home, as does the 
Nashville Opera and the Tennessee Repertory Theatre. Andrew Jackson Hall is the 
biggest TPAC venue, with 2,472 seats, but the James K Polk Theater, Andrew 
Johnson Theater and War Memorial Auditorium also see frequent performances.

Coffee shops

If you don't make it to any of the museums or galleries, you can still sneak a 
taste of the local art scene while getting your caffeine fix: a handful of the 
city's independent coffee shops do an impressive job of not just caffeinating 
the city but also curating great work. Sip on a "Local Latte" (honey, cinnamon, 
espresso, milk) atFido <http://www.bongojava.com/fido-cafe/> while you peruse 
the original art on its concrete walls (most are available to buy). Sandwiched 
between Belmont and Vanderbilt universities,Bongo Java 
<http://www.bongojava.com/bongo-java/about/> (part of the same group as Fido) 
capitalises on the abundance of young creative talent and features a rotating 
list of local artists.Frothy Monkey <http://frothymonkey.com/> in the hip 12th 
South district hosts art receptions and talks, and will soon open a new outpost 
– its fourth – on the Avenue of the Arts at 235 5th Avenue North.

Celebrate Nashville
 Celebrate Nashville 
Nashville's population may not be the most ethnically diverse – only one in 
six is foreign-born – but that doesn't stop residents from honouring cultures 
around the world. This festival, on the first Saturday of October, offers 
traditional dances and musical performances – from Aztec to blues – on six 
stages, plus food booths selling curried goat from Africa,paletas (ice-lollies) 
from Mexico and Nashville's signature hot chicken. Entrance is free, but there 
are plenty of vendors in the World Market area, so bring cash if you're 
interested in taking home a piece of the event.

This artists' neighbourhood seemed to pop up overnight when beloved galleries 
such asZeitgeist <http://zeitgeist-art.com/> relocated to this Midtown 
corridor. Other buildings of note are Fort Houston (500 Houston Street) and 
Chestnut Square, a 100-year-old brick warehouse that was formerly a hosiery 
mill and now is home to many smaller galleries and studios, includingGround 
Floor Gallery <http://groundflrgallery.wordpress.com/>. The neighbourhood even 
hosts a more contemporary version of the 5th Avenue art crawl – Arts & Music at 
Wedgewood-Houston – from 5.30pm-11pm on the first Saturday of each month.

Tomato Art Fest
 Tomato Art Festival, Nashville 
How can you not love a festival that encourages you to come dressed as your 
favourite produce? One of city's quirkier, but most beloved, annual events pays 
homage to the tomato and takes place in bohemian east Nashville at the end of 
each summer, attracting more than 35,000 people, who come for the art 
installations, food trucks, interactive booths and live music (this is 
Nashville after all). Often celebrities are in attendance, and entertainment 
also includes a 5km running race, a parade, a wading pool for your canine 
friends and the Tomato King and Queen Contest. The festival officially takes 
place Friday-Saturday, but you'll find a bevy of related events in the days 
leading up to it.
