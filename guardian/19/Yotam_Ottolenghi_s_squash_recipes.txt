 are the defining smell of autumn, orange is surely the season’s colour, both 
outside and inside the kitchen. We have orange leaves on the trees (and 
ground), fires both inside and out, and fruit bowls filled with seasonal 
clementines and persimmons, not to mention all the pumpkins.

There are plenty of varieties of fruit squished under the term squash, and 
pumpkins are just one of them. The range is vast, from all the Asian and 
African varieties of squash (cucumbers, gherkins, melons, watermelons and 
gourds) to the North and South American varieties, which are in turn divided 
into winter and summer squash.

Winter squash have firm, sweet flesh, and feature in their number the 
parchment-coloured butternut, the deeper orange coquina and the small, round 
queen squash, which looks rather like a pumpkin. Summer squash – such as 
courgette and pumpkin – have spongier, more fibrous flesh, so soften a lot when 
cooked.

I often use pumpkin and squash interchangeably in my cooking, but there are 
noticeable differences in texture and sweetness that affect the way they need 
to be handled. The firmness of butternut, coquina and queen squash, for 
example, means they hold their shape more reliably, and I often cook them with 
their skin on, because it’s thin enough to eat. Even peeled they still have a 
relative firmness that prevents the flesh from collapsing altogether when 
cooked.

I’ve chosen butternut for today’s recipes, because it’s by far the most widely 
available, but use whatever you can get hold of.

Braised squash with chickpeas and harissa

This is a little meal in itself that packs a bit of a punch and a lot of 
comfort. If you want to bulk it out, serve with rice. Harissa can be quite 
fiery, so you may prefer to use a bit less than suggested. Serves four.

60ml olive oil
2-3 banana shallots, peeled and chopped
1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced
1 tsp ground cumin
4 whole cardamom pods, crushed to release the seeds, pods discarded
Salt and black pepper
2½ tbsp harissa paste 
½ tsp rose water
500ml vegetable stock
1 large butternut squash, peeled and cut into 4cm dice (800g)
400g tinned cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed
7 dried apricots, thinly sliced
20g preserved lemon skin, roughly chopped
10g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
150g Greek yoghurt

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. In a large saute pan for which you have 
a lid, heat two tablespoons of oil on a medium-high flame. Add the shallots and 
fry for seven to eight minutes, stirring every so often, until soft and 
caramelised, then stir in the garlic, spices, half a teaspoon of salt and 
plenty of pepper, and fry for two minutes longer. Add the harissa, rose water, 
stock and 200ml water, bring to a boil, then lay in the squash pieces in a 
single flat layer. Turn down the heat to medium, cover and leave to simmer for 
10 minutes, until almost cooked through.

Take the pan off the heat and transfer the squash to a medium bowl, using a 
slotted spoon. Add two tablespoons of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and some 
pepper to the bowl, mix to coat, then spread out the squash on an oven tray 
lined with baking paper. Roast for 20 minutes, until golden-brown and cooked 
through, then leave to cool.

While the squash is roasting, tip the chickpeas, apricots and preserved lemon 
into the stock left in the pan, bring to a boil on a medium-high heat and cook 
for about 12 minutes, until the sauce reduces a little and becomes thick and 
rich. While they’re cooking, crush a few chickpeas with the back of a spoon, to 
thicken the mix further.

To serve, divide three-quarters of the squash between individual bowls and 
spoon over the chickpea sauce. Top with the rest of the squash, sprinkle with 
the chopped coriander and serve at once with some yoghurt alongside.

Squash gnocchi with caraway and black garlic

I’m not being pedantic in listing the cooked weight for the potato and 
butternut for this recipe: it’s important to get the proportions right, so the 
gnocchi are light enough but still hold their shape. The dough is very soft and 
sticky, which is what makes the texture so soft once cooked. These are lovely 
just as they are, but serve them with a spoonful of soured cream if you want to 
make the dish a little richer. With its clash of orange and black, this is 
about as autumnal a plateful as they come. Serves four.

1 large baking potato (450g) 
½ small butternut squash, peeled, trimmed and cut into 2-3cm pieces (340g)
1½ tbsp olive oil
Salt and black pepper
160g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
1½ tsp caraway seeds, toasted and lightly crushed
20g peeled black garlic, roughly chopped
1½ tbsp picked thyme leaves
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon, plus 1½ tsp lemon juice, to serve
30g unsalted butter
20g pumpkin seeds, toasted

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Bake the potato for an hour, until the 
flesh is soft, then leave to cool a little before peeling; you should end up 
with 350g potato flesh. Put this in a large bowl and roughly mash.

Toss the squash with a teaspoon and a half of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt 
and plenty of pepper. Spread out on an oven tray lined with baking paper and 
roast for 30 minutes, until soft and caramelised. Remove, leave to cool a 
little, then roughly mash with a fork: you should have 250g mashed squash.

Add the mashed squash to the potato, then mix in the flour, caraway seeds and 
three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt until it all comes together into a sticky 
dough. Tip it out on to a lightly floured worktop and roll into a sausage. Cut 
into three equal pieces and use your hands to push and stretch each piece into 
a 35cm long x 3cm wide sausage. Cut each sausage into 20 or so 1.5cm-wide 
slices, dusting with more flour as you go, so they don’t stick to the worktop. 
Gently press one side of each slice with the back of a floured fork, to leave 
an indentation, and place on a floured baking tray.

Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil, then drop in half the 
gnocchi and boil for one to two minutes, until they float to the surface. As 
the gnocchi cook and rise, lift them out with a slotted spoon and put on a 
large oven tray. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi, then leave to cool for 10 
minutes.

Mash the black garlic to a paste with the thyme, lemon zest, a tablespoon of 
oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, ideally using a pestle and mortar.

Heat the butter in a large saute pan on a medium flame, and cook for two to 
three minutes, until it starts to burn and smell nutty. Stir in the pumpkin 
seeds for a minute, until they start to pop, then add the gnocchi and black 
garlic paste, and stir gently, until the gnocchi are coated all over. Take off 
the heat, stir in the lemon juice and serve at once.

The cinnamon makes this a great side dish for all sorts of festive fare. 
Serves four.

1 butternut squash, peeled and cut into 3-4cm chunks (900g)
3 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp dark brown sugar
2 tbsp white miso
2 green jalapeño chillies, cut in half lengthways
2 large cinnamon sticks, broken in two
⅛ tsp ground cinnamon 
4 bay leaves
4 large garlic cloves
Salt

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Put all the ingredients in a large bowl 
with a teaspoon of salt and three tablespoons of water. Mix well (use your 
hands), then tip into a high-sided 20cm x 30cm roasting tray into which 
everything fits snugly. Roast for 35 minutes, until soft and caramelised, then 
remove and leave to cool for five minutes.

Tip the contents of the tray into a large bowl, and lift out the cinnamon 
sticks and bay. Squeeze out the flesh from the garlic cloves and discard the 
skins, then roughly mash everything together with the back of a fork. Serve 
warm, with the aromatics spooned on top, if you like, by way of garnish.
