Snapshot: Aunt Gloria, from Suez to Centre Court


I wish I could remember what had made us smile. This photograph, which sums up 
my relationship with my aunt Gloria, is a window on to family Christmases past 
– to which she always brought generosity and energy, and a festive jumper.

I do know that it was taken more than a quarter of a century ago, on Christmas 
Day 1990. My shirt gives it away: silk, designer, my pride and joy, snapped up 
inBloomingdale’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/dec/19/new-york-department-stores-fight-back-against-e-commerce>
 when I was breathless with excitement on my first visit to New York earlier in 
the year.

Gloria loved to travel and always encouraged me, my brother and sister to ask 
questions, explore new places and seize the chance of different experiences. 
With her, we went camping in France and the Scottish Highlands, sought out 
castles, windmills and stately homes, and trekked to the sights of London. It 
was Gloria who took me to my first Wimbledon, in 1975, where we cheeredVirginia 
Wade

 into the quarter-finals from standing room on Centre Court, having risen in 
the small hours to queue.

When we were children, she drove us into the West End to see the Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> lights on Regent Street – 
a moment of heart-stopping excitement. I doubt even the congestion charge would 
have deterred her.

As a young teacher, for a while she lived a charmed life in Egypt, full of 
sightseeing and dancing (including one memorable evening with President Tito of 
Yugoslavia, in town with his entourage). The joy of that time, which came to an 
abrupt end – via an alarming period of house arrest – with the Suez crisis, 
never left her. Three subsequent decades in the rough and tumble of education 
in the London borough of Hackney failed to drum it out of her.

When she died in 2008, we discovered a decade of letters between her and my 
mother, Laura, contrasting her adventures abroad with the concerns of 1950s 
domestic life back home: a suitcase of social history, which we later turned 
into a book. The aunt-shaped gap she left in all our Christmases and family 
events seems to grow, rather than diminish, with the years. As the photograph 
suggests, Gloria’s glass was always half full – and that, at least, I can 
remember.

 Listen to Merry Christmas You Suckers by Paddy Roberts 
Merry Christmas You Suckers by Paddy Roberts 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZWQcl1C-c8>

“Merry Christmas you suckers / You miserable men / That old festive season is 
with you again / You’ll be spending your money on cartloads of junk / And from 
here to New Year you’ll be drunk as a skunk”

When we were growing up, we (me and my three older sisters) were spoilt each 
Christmas. My mum and dad’s parents were both alive so, on Christmas Day we had 
dinner with my mum’s parents and that was followed by Christmas tea with our 
other granny and grandad.

This meant that, as is the tradition in Germany, we had our own Christmas tree 
on Christmas Eve. This included putting up and decorating the tree (no long 
lead-in for us) adorned with lighted candles clipped to the branches. It was a 
real tree, so the fire hazard was equally real but, hey, it was the early 60s 
and a Christmas tradition.

Another Christmas tradition was playing a 45rpm vinyl record while we 
decorated the tree. Playing it once was never enough.Merry Christmas, You 
Suckers by Paddy Roberts <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZWQcl1C-c8> was 
released in 1962 but much of the content (apart from the reference to waiting 
for the nuclear blast, perhaps) is as relevant today as it was more than five 
decades ago. It summed up our family attitude to Christmas (or did the record 
come first?) but, above all, I have fond memories of my dad laughing heartily 
each time he heard it (then whistling the tune until Boxing Day). I think this 
is the reason I liked it so much.

 A picture of Joy Gladstone’s mother, Hilda, her Christmas pudding, craftwork … 
and lashings of Cumberland rum butter 
Ingredients

85g (3oz) cooking fat 
3 tbsp self-raising flour
1.5 cups breadcrumbs
85g (3oz) sugar
225g (8oz) mixed fruit 
1 tsp mixed spice 
½ tsp ground nutmeg 
1 apple (finely grated)
1 carrot (finely grated)
1 potato (finely grated) 
1 tbsp lemon juice 
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 
3 tbsp warmed milk

Rub the cooking fat into the flour until it is like breadcrumbs. Mix in the 
breadcrumbs, sugar, mixed fruit, mixed spice, ground nutmeg, apple, carrot and 
potato. Stir in the lemon juice. Dissolve the bicarbonate of soda into the 
warmed milk and stir this into the main mixture. Stir well and put in a basin, 
cover with greaseproof paper and steam for two and a half hours.

“This is a wartime recipe, but one my family prefers to the rich traditional 
kind,” stated my mother, Hilda Gladstone, in her contribution to the 
Cumbria-Westmorland WI cookbook published in 1978.

My sisters, cousins and nieces make this recipe every Christmas to keep the 
family tradition alive.

Sadly, Hilda died in her 80th year in 1996. However, many of her descendants, 
family and friends gathered in Cumbria in September 2016 for a weekend to 
celebrate what would have been her 100th birthday. In pride of place on the 
first evening was a Christmas pudding that I made to Hilda’s recipe, 
accompanied by lashings of Cumberland rum butter (in a Gladstone pottery sugar 
bowl, of course), cream and custard.

For the Cumberland rum butter, melt 225g (8oz) butter with 340g (12oz) soft 
brown sugar and add a teaspoon of ground nutmeg. Pour in half a wine glass of 
rum and mix well until it starts to thicken. Pour into an attractive old china 
bowl.

On the Sunday afternoon, a garden party saw 45 people tucking into my elder 
sister’s scones with homemade raspberry and blackcurrant jams, my younger 
sister’s thumb-hole tarts and Hilda’s “chocolate stuff” (tiffin), my Bakewell 
tarts and Victoria sponges, my cousin’s “nutty slack” (origin unsure, but 
contains cornflakes and nuts!) and other such specialities from Hilda’s farm 
table, WI cookbooks and the Be-Ro home-baking book.

Also on show during the weekend were many of Hilda’s exquisite examples of 
canvas work and rugs (all her own designs) plus string (baler twine) mats and 
craftwork. Each of these had been given as heirlooms, but only after they had 
been exhibited in WI competitions at various local shows.
