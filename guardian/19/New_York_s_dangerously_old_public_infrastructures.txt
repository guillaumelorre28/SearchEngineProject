The explosion that killed at least seven people in the East Harlem 
neighbourhood of New York this week has been attributed to a gas leak. While 
investigators have yet to confirm that conclusion, it has brought new focus to 
New York’s crumbling infrastructure: a gas main in the street outside is 127 
years old.

The day before the tragedy, the Center for an Urban Future issued its latest 
report, setting out in great detail the scale of the infrastructure problem in 
America’s biggest city. The report,Caution Ahead 
<http://nycfuture.org/research/publications/caution-ahead>, points out that 
many waters mains are over 100 years old, average gas mains are over 56 years 
old and subways are pushing 100.

Bridges

According to the report, 11% of the 162 bridges in New York City are more than 
100 years old.
 The Manhattan Bridge was built between 1901 and 1912. While the bridge was 
being builtfootpaths were used by workers

 to reach certain areas and heights. Photograph: Library of Congress 
Each day, about 2.7m cars drive over the 47 bridges rated “fracture critical” 
(a designation engineers use for bridges that have little structural 
redundancy, making them prone to failure and collapse) and “structurally 
deficient”.

Fracture critical bridges not only suffer from significant distress, but 
according to engineers, if a single span, beam or joint of such a bridge fails, 
the whole thing could come tumbling down.

Subway

The subway system stretches along 659 track miles. The first underground line 
of the subway opened on 27 October 1904, almost 35 years after the opening of 
the first elevated line in New York City.

While the system has cleaned up its act considerably since the 1980s, when 
graffiti and breakdowns were the norm, the ageing signalling system is in dire 
need of attention. Of the system’s 728 miles of mainline signals, 37% have 
exceeded their 50-year useful life, meaning trains move slower and maintenance 
workers are forced to build their own replacement parts because manufacturers 
no longer make them.

Water mains
15% of the city’s 6,800 miles of water mains are over 100 years old. There 
have been more than 400 water main breaks in New York City in all but one year 
since 1998. In 2013, there were 403.
Customers are losing about a quarter of water to leaks between the reservoir 
and the faucet – double that of the industry standard. To stave off water main 
breaks, experts have suggested the city follow a 100-year replacement cycle – 
meaning replacing roughly 68 miles of water mains every year. The city has 
failed to reach this target a single time over the last decade.  <> Facebook

2014 has already seen a major water main break on 13th Street in Manhattan, 
which flooded the streets and nearby subways. In 2013, a similar incident 
paralyzed subways at 23rd street, as shown in the MTA’s video below.

Gas mains

Cat on a Hot Tin Roof came out in 1958, making it 56 years old – the same age 
as the average New York gas main.


60% of Con Edison gas mains are made of unprotected steel or cast iron, an 
outmoded and leak-prone material. More than 2% of the gas Con Edison sends to 
customers every year never makes it to its final destination – largely because 
of leaks.

On Wednesday, an explosion caused the swift and entire collapse of two 
buildings in East Harlem, leaving at least seven people dead and more than 60 
injured. Mayor Bill de Blasio later said the explosion was caused by a gas leak 
and that utility company Con Edison was in the process of shutting off all gas 
lines into the building.

Roads


There are 19,000 lane miles of roads and highways in New York. The department 
of transportation has deemed 30.4% of city roads in “fair” or “poor” condition 
– up from 15.7% in 2000. Roughly 43% of all roads in Manhattan are considered 
substandard, followed by Staten Island (40%), the Bronx (34 %), Queens (31 %) 
and Brooklyn (28 %)

The report warns that if infrastructural vulnerabilities are left unchecked, 
“they could wreak havoc on the city’s economy and quality of life.” Bringing 
physical assets up to scratch will require a nearly unprecedented investment, 
coming to a total cost of $47.3bn over the next four to five years – a 
challenge harder to meet in these times of federal budget cutbacks.

While tragedies are rare, countless disruptions and malfunctions are directly 
caused by the aging systems. Modernizing the aging assets won’t be cheap, but 
inaction is no longer an option.
