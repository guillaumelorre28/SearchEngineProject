Delaware Water Gap national recreation area, Pennsylvania


The Delaware river forms part of the border between Pennsylvania and New 
Jersey. In the 1960s the Army Corps of Engineers proposed building a dam along 
the flood-prone section of river between the New York state line and the coal 
mining town of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. This would have created a 
37-mile lake between Pennsylvania and New Jersey to be called Tocks Island 
national recreation area. In preparation for flooding the valley, more than 
15,000 people were displaced from their homes. Then a geologic study revealed 
that the proposed dam was on top of several active fault lines and the project 
was scrapped. In 1978, the property was transferred to the National Park 
Service and renamed the Delaware Water Gap national recreation area. Today, the 
park protects 70,000 acres of forest and farmland, 40 miles of the Delaware 
river and 28 miles of the Appalachian Trail.
Top tip Many picturesque hamlets and villages that stood along the Delaware 
river were lost to the dam project but some historic buildings remain. The 
quaint village of Bevans now stands as thePeters Valley School of Craft 
<http://www.petersvalley.org/index.cfm>, where blacksmithing, woodworking and 
weaving are taught and practised. Take a tour of the historic grounds on summer 
weekends or sign up for a two- to five-day workshop between May and September.

Ricketts Glen state park, Pennsylvania
 Photograph: Mary Caperton Morton 
Ricketts Glen is famous for its 24 named waterfalls along Kitchen Creek, 
ranging in height from three feet to to 94ft. Nearly all of them can be seen 
along the Falls Trail, a 7.1-mile loop that follows Kitchen Creek as it flows 
through the park’s three main river valleys: Ricketts Glen, Glen Leigh and 
Ganoga Glen. As Kitchen Creek drops over the steep cliffs of the Allegheny 
Front and over the edge of the Allegheny plateau, it loses nearly 1,000 feet of 
elevation in 2.25 miles, creating the series of picturesque waterfalls. 
Geologists sort the waterfalls into two types: wedding-cake falls, which 
descend in multiple tiers, and bridal-veil falls, that plunge over a ledge into 
a pool. Each of the named falls, along with 10 more unnamed falls, has its own 
personality, and visitors delight in picking their favourites along the trail. 
In addition to hiking trails, the park has 10 cabins, a campsite and horse 
riding, and Jean Lake is open for swimming, fishing, canoeing and kayaking. In 
the winter, snowsports enthusiasts enjoy skiing cross-country on the Falls 
Trail, and ice-climbers ascend the frozen falls.
Top tip Ricketts Glen, near Scranton, is beautiful (and open year-round) but 
the autumn foliage colours add a spectacular dimension to the old-growth woods 
and moss-covered rocks that line Kitchen Creek.

Pennsylvania has no coast except for a 50-mile stretch that borders Lake Erie, 
the smallest of the five Great Lakes. One of the best places to experience 
Pennsylvania’s only shoreline is at Presque Isle state park, a sandy peninsula 
that juts out into the lake and provides a haven for migrating birds. It sits 
on the remains of a glacial moraine: a pile of rocks and debris left behind by 
a retreating glacier at the end of the last ice age. The arc is constantly 
reshaped by wind and waves but generally occupies around 3,000 acres of land, 
surrounded on three sides by the waters of Lake Erie. The park reports the 
greatest numbers of endangered, threatened and rare species in Pennsylvania, 
with Gull Point natural area usually the best place to birdwatch. The park also 
offers swimming, boating, fishing, scuba diving, hiking, biking and 
rollerskating along its 14 miles of paved waterside trails. No camping is 
offered in the park.
Top tip The best way to experience Lake Erie is on the Lady Kate, a 65-foot 
vessel that leaves from Presque Isle and takes visitors on a tour of three 
lighthouses. The90-minute tours <http://piboattours.com/piboattours/> depart 
several times a day from mid-May to the end of September. Reservations 
recommended.

Posnov/Alamy 
The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long, 6,000ft deep and more than 17 miles wide. 
The Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania is 47 miles long, 1,450ft deep and one mile 
wide. It’s ridiculous to compare one place with the other but the Pennsylvania 
Grand Canyon, also known as the Pine Creek Gorge, is definitely worth a look – 
and a hike, horseback or bike ride. The Pine Creek Gorge is accessed from 
Colton Point state park on the west side of the canyon and Leonard Harrison 
state park on the east side. Both parks offer hiking, camping and other 
activities. Trails drop into the gorge from the rim on either side, descending 
for a little over a mile to the river. You can also enjoy the gorge from the
Pine Creek Rail Trail <http://visittiogapa.com/railtrail.html>: a 62-mile 
biking and horseback riding path that runs from the town of Jersey Shore in the 
south to Stokesdale in the north, passing through the heart of the gorge in the 
middle. The trail follows the river on mostly level ground throughout its 
length, making for a pleasant trip for all.
Top tip Ride a bike through the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania by leaving from 
the Darling Run access area near Ansonia and cycle 16 miles south on a gentle 
downhill gradient to the Blackwell access area, near the town of Blackwell.

Bombay Hook national wildlife refuge, Delaware

The Atlantic Flyway is the main migratory route for hundreds of species of 
birds as they trek between summer breeding grounds in the Arctic and winter 
homes along the Gulf of Mexico. In the middle of the 5,000-mile route is Bombay 
Hook national wildlife refuge, an important stopover for migrating birds on the 
coast of northern Delaware. There are no sandy beaches here; instead the refuge 
is made up of mostly tidal marshes, mud flats, tidal pools, brushy fields and 
swamps. While that combination of habitats isn’t desirable for beachgoers, it’s 
a nutrient buffet for birds and a refuge from most predators. Five walking 
trails, a 12-mile wildlife-viewing drive and three observation towers make this 
one of the best places to observe migrating birds throughout the spring, summer 
and autumn.
Top tip The second Saturday in May is International Migratory Bird Day 
<http://www.birdday.org/>, intended to bring awareness to long-distance bird 
migration. This year, Bombay Hook will hosta migratory bird count 
<http://www.fws.gov/nwrs/threecolumn.aspx?id=2147517716> on 14 May from 
7am-noon, with teams surveying sections of the refuge in an effort to count as 
many species of bird as possible. The park also offers regular guided bird 
walks for beginner birders of all ages.

This beachfront park on the Delaware Bay became the US’s first designated 
public land space in 1692. The 5,000-acre beach is open year-round, with a 
campsite and a fishing pier that’s open 24/7. Surfing is popular off Herring 
Point, and the park also has a disc-golf course (frisbee golf), hiking trails 
and bike paths, with free bike hire at the Nature Center. Herring Point is one 
of the most popular spots for surf fishing – where fishermen stand on the beach 
and cast into the waves just offshore. Stripers and blue fish migrate past the 
cape in early summer, and flounder and dogfish are plentiful along this section 
of coast through the summer. In the late summer into autumn, mackerel and 
croakers pass through, and stripers and blue fish reappear as they migrate 
south again for the winter. Cape Henlopen is the starting point for theAmerican 
Discovery Trail <http://www.discoverytrail.org/>, a 5,000-mile path that leads 
from Delaware to Point Reyes, California. The park also has 20 miles of hiking 
trails, ranging from seaside walks to forest treks.
Top tip The park’s Nature Center 
<http://www.destateparks.com/park/cape-henlopen/nature-center.asp> is open 
daily year-round and its museum has five 1,000-gallon fish tanks of local 
species, and a marine invertebrate touch tank.

New Jersey Pinelands national reserve

New Jersey, the Garden State, is often better known for its turnpikes and 
suburban sprawl than its green spaces. But Jersey does have the Pine Barrens, a 
million-acre forest that is the largest surviving open space on the eastern 
seaboard between the forests of northern Maine and the Florida Everglades. The 
Pine Barrens covers more than 20% of New Jersey, and is vast enough to 
supposedly hide the elusive Jersey Devil, a mythical creature with the hooves 
of a horse, the wings of a bat and the head of a goat. The Pine Barrens gets 
its name from its dense forests and sandy soil that’s too nutrient-poor for 
growing crops. The most distinctive tree is the pygmy pine, which tops out 
around 4ft tall, with taller cedars and oaks thriving as well. Historically, 
the Pine Barrens were home to many rural, independent families, who scratched a 
living off the land, mainly by hunting and fishing. The ruins of some of these 
isolated homesteads can still be seen throughout the reserve.
Top tip One of the best ways to see the Barrens is by canoe or kayak 
<http://www.nj.gov/pinelands/home/visit/canoe/>. Several privately owned canoe 
and kayak rental agencies offerguided and independent trips down the Mullica, 
Batsto, Oswego and Wading rivers.

Gateway national recreation area, New Jersey

Till/Alamy 
North-eastern New Jersey is very urbanised, with New York City just across the 
water, but there are a few open spaces. One of the most historic and 
picturesque is Gateway national recreation area at Sandy Hook, a spit of land 
jutting into the Atlantic Ocean, directly opposite Coney Island. This barrier 
peninsula forms the gateway to New York Harbor and was home to Fort Hancock, 
part of the coastal defence system, until 1974. Today,Sandy Hook has seven 
beaches <http://seastreak.com/daytrips-and-getaways/sandy-hook-beach/>, which 
make up the very northern end of the Jersey Shore. The most infamous of these 
is Gunnison Beach, one of the few legal nudist beaches on the eastern seaboard. 
The scenery across the water is the real draw, of course: Brooklyn and the 
Verrazano-Narrows bridge are across the bay.
Top tip Skip the often bumper-to-bumper drive to Sandy Hook and take a ferry 
from Manhattan <http://www.sandy-hook.com/seastreak-ferry.shtml> instead. 
Between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend a ride ferry makes the 
40-minute trip from the pier at East 35th Street to Sandy Hook several times a 
day.

The Big Gunpowder and Little Gunpowder rivers run for 56 miles and 25 miles, 
respectively, though the state of Maryland, past Baltimore, before joining and 
emptying into Chesapeake Bay. A series of public green spaces along the 
waterways add up to Maryland’s largest state park: Gunpowder Falls. Throughout 
their lengths, the rivers run through forested river valleys and rolling 
agricultural land. Trout fishing is excellent in both, and after they fall over 
the edge of the Piedmont Plateau to the Atlantic Coastal Plain, the lower 
stretches of both waterways boil into class-2 and -3 whitewater for kayakers 
and canoeists. The park system also offers over 100 miles of trails in terrain 
ranging from deep woods to tidal marshes.
Top tip The Dundee Creek Marina offers motorboat and rowing boat for hire on 
an hourly basis ($15 an hour or $60 for four hours). TheUltimate Watersports 
<http://www.ultimatewatersports.com/> shop also rents kayaks, windsurfing 
boards and stand-up paddleboards.

For the horse-crazy, Assateague Island is a place of legend, where wild ponies 
roam the beaches. The inspiration for the popular children’s book Misty of 
Chincoteague, this 37-mile long barrier island off the coasts of Maryland and 
Virginia has had a population of feral horses since colonial times. Camping is 
allowed at Assateague state park, at the northern tip of the island, but 
Assateague national seashore in Maryland and Chincoteague national wildlife 
refuge, in Virginia, are designated as day-use only. Sightseeing boat cruises, 
kayak touring, crabbing and fishing are also popular.
Top tip Once a year, on Pony Penning Day 
<http://www.chincoteague.com/pony_swim_guide.html>, the wild ponies are rounded 
up by the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department and swum across the channel 
from Assateague Island to Chincoteague Island, where the foals are auctioned 
off to the public to raise money for managing the herd and keeping the pony 
population at sustainable numbers. This year, the 91st annual swim will take 
place on 27 July and the auction on 28 July.
