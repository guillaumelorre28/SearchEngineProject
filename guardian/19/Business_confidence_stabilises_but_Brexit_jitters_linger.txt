, but firms still regard economic uncertainty as the biggest threat after the 
Brexit vote.

The latest Business in Britain report from Lloyds Banking Group, which is 
published twice a year, shows thebusiness confidence index 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/uk-sees-biggest-fall-in-consumer-confidence-for-26-years-after-brexit-vote>
 rose to 14% from 12% in September.

It is an average of firms’ expected sales, orders and profits over the next 
six months. They are net balances of those reporting an increase minus those 
reporting a decline.

The biggest threat cited by companies in the next six months was economic 
uncertainty (26%), followed by weaker UK demand (17%).

On a more positive note, there has been a jump in businesses expecting to 
export to Asia, bolstered by the weaker pound.

The net balance of firms anticipating stronger export sales in the next six 
months rose for all regions, from the US/Canada, the Middle East, Latin 
America, Africa and Asia Pacific to Europe. Overall, export expectations 
improved by six points to 26% from September.

This was driven by a big increase in the net balance of companies expecting 
stronger exports to Asia Pacific and the Middle East, which went up by 11 and 7 
points respectively.

Businesses said the exchange rate was the most favourable for exports since 
the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2009.The pound hit 31-year lows

 in October and is down 17% against the dollar and 10% against the euro since 
the EU referendum.

Manufacturing and the hospitality and leisure industries in particular have 
benefitted from the slide in sterling. Confidence among manufacturers doubled 
to 28%, and jumped to 28% from 16% among hotels, restaurants and other leisure 
businesses, asthe weaker pound has led to a mini tourism boom

. In all other sectors, confidence has fallen.

Overall business confidence is well below the long-term average, but remains 
well above the lows seen during the last financial crisis, supported by demand 
from the UK and abroad.

Tim Hinton, managing director of mid-markets and SME banking at Lloyds, said: 
“The banking sector also has a much stronger capital position to withstand any 
shocks than in 2008-09 which should give businesses more confidence that their 
growth ambitions can be supported in the year ahead.

“We should expect more twists and turns in 2017 but in the meantime business 
owners are resilient and continuing to do what they do best – getting on with 
growing their businesses while keeping an eye on the external risks.”

The weaker pound is also pushing up firms’ prices. The net balance of 
businesses expecting to raise their prices in the next six months climbed to 
20% from 13%. Among importing firms, the measure rose to 28% from 20%, hitting 
the highest level since 2013.

Companies remain cautious about hiring and investing. The net balances of 
firms expecting to raise their investment and staffing levels in the next six 
months remained low at 1% and 2% respectively.

Business confidence was highest in the north-east (up 1 point to 22%), 
followed by Scotland (up 15 points to 21%), the east of England (up 1 point to 
20%) and the south west (up 13 points to 17%).

Confidence fell sharply in Wales (down 10 points to 15%) and Yorkshire and the 
Humber (down 15 points to 17%), but remained above the national average. The 
weakest confidence levels were recorded in the West Midlands (down 16 points to 
1%), London (up 5 points to 9%) and the East Midlands (down 2 points to 12%).

The report collects the views of more than 1,500 UK companies, mostly small to 
medium-sized businesses.
