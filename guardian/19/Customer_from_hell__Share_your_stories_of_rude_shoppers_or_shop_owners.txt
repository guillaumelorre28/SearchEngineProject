A Yorkshire bookshop owner has made national headlines 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/04/yorkshires-bookseller-from-hell-regrets-calling-customer-a-pain-in-the-arse>
 for calling a customer a “pain in the arse” after they failed to pay the 50p 
fee he charges anyone who enters his shop.

Steve Bloom, owner of the secondhand bookshop Bloomindales in the Yorkshire 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/yorkshire> Dales, (who says he regrets the 
comment) has received 20 complaints about his rudeness and has been called “the 
bookseller from hell” by the chairman of Hawes parish council.

But retail involves a two-way relationship and as any shop owner knows, the 
customer is not always right

. Some store owners have to put up with rudeness from members of the public on 
a regular basis. But who calls out the customers from hell? If you run a small 
shop, or a business that’s open to the public, we want to hear your worst 
experiences of difficult patrons.

Maybe you offer unfalteringly sunny service but receive only rudeness in 
return? Perhaps, like Bloom, you’re fed up with idle browsers and have imposed 
rules to keep time wasters away? Or maybe you feel frustrated when customers 
accidentally spill coffee on your products or argue over the price of goods.

Or are you a shopper who’s had an awful experience in a shop or local business 
with no apology?
