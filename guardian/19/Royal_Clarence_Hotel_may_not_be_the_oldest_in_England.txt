The destruction of the Royal Clarence Hotel by fire is a sad loss for Exeter (

, 29 October). However, the oft-repeated suggestion that this was the first 
hotel in England when built around 1769 is incorrect. A more promising 
contender is the Gentlemen’s Hotel in St James’s Square, which was advertised 
in the London Evening Post in 1764 in the following terms: “Mrs Martin at the 
Gentlemen’s Hotel in King Street, Saint James’s Square, takes this opportunity 
of acquainting all Noblemen, Gentlemen, Foreigners and others, that they may be 
accommodated with genteel Lodgings for one Night, or as long as they think 
proper … Gentlemen who will please to honour her with their Commands, may 
depend on being attended in the best and politest Manner, by their humble 
Servant, M. Martin. NB It is the only Hotel in London.”
