The change in the Oregon landscape was profound: US route 26 had taken me from 
the rain-soaked, lush greenof the Pacific Northwest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/may/25/pacific-northwest-seattle-oregon-coffee>
 over Mount Hood and into the central part of the state. As I headed down that 
beautiful mountain on the three-hour drive from Portland to Bend, forests and 
foliage gave way to the dry, dramatic and craggy. The car now coasted past 
creeks and swooped up along ridges, before I swung into Bend: population around 
80,000, with 18 breweries, four wineries, three cideries – and almost unlimited 
year-round access to adventures in the great outdoors.

I had heard of Bend – and done the obligatory chuckling at its name, which was 
originally Farewell Bend – from a friend in Portland who had suggested there 
was more toOregon <https://www.theguardian.com/travel/oregon> than the artisan 
hubbub of her city and the foodie haven that is Eugene, further west. If you’re 
looking for a perfect small city – compact in scale, big on adventure, but with 
enough culture and coffee shops to ensure things don’t feel too much like a 
Thoreau wilderness – Bend, she said, deserved a visit. Her tip was a great one.

Bend is on the eastern edge of the Cascades mountain range, under the volcanic 
peaks of the Three Sisters and Mount Bachelor, with the Deschutes river running 
through it. It enjoys an oft-quoted 300 days of sunshine a year, and offers 
access to more than 300 miles of mountain-biking trails, 71 parks, a thousand 
climbing routes and 3,600 acres of skiing and snowboarding terrain on Mount 
Bachelor. Other activities include kayaking, rock climbing, hiking, whitewater 
rafting, wild swimming, fishing and horse riding.

A drive along the 66 miles of the nearby Cascade Lakes national scenic byway 
<http://traveloregon.com/trip-ideas/scenic-byways/cascades-lakes-scenic-byway/> 
may sound more relaxing than all of that adrenaline-fuelled action, but the 
views from it are so frequently breathtaking that they quicken the pulse anyway.

for the Guardian 
Bend’s proximity to greenery means it’s only a few miles and minutes between 
hiring your bike and hitting the trails. Those trails can be as easy or as 
challenging as your skills allow. Phil’s Trailhead represents the starting 
point of a six-mile loop that includes a section of the KGB Trail, known for 
tight switchbacks and great views. Those views include Mount Bachelor, 20 miles 
in the distance, which can be cycled to for a close-up view. Pine Mountain 
Sports has a mammoth array of rentals starting from $20 for a four-hour hire 
and will set the bike up for you. It also organises group rides.

A 15-minute drive south of Bend, the Lava Lands Visitor Center 
<http://www.oregon.com/attractions/lava-land-visitor-center> is a great base 
for hikes with mountain views. Trek the Trail of the Whispering Pines, or the 
more challenging Trail of the Molten Land or marvel at the cinder cone of Lava 
Butte (where Nasa carried out astronaut training prior to the moon landing). 
Further west on theCascade Lakes national scenic byway

is Sparks Lake, with exquisite water, views of Mount Bachelor and walks ranging 
from theRay Atkeson Memorial Trail’s

Prior to the financial crisis, Bend blossomed; hard times followed, but the 
past three years have seen a rejuvenated downtown – not that improvement has 
come without concern over the pace of change, and that civic debate continues. 
Gems includeDudley’s Bookshop Cafe <http://www.dudleysbookshopcafe.com/>, Ranch 
Records <https://www.facebook.com/RanchRecordsBend/>, amusement arcade 
nostalgia atVector Volcano <http://vectorvolcanoarcade.com/> and local arts and 
crafts atJust a Little Charm <http://www.justalittlecharm.com/>. And on the 
fringe of downtown is lovely Drake Park and Mirror Pond.

Music and movies, indoors and out

From the 1950s styling of the Tower theatre <http://www.towertheatre.org/>, 
with its concerts and movies, to outdoor gigs and events atDrake Park 
<http://www.bendparksandrec.org/parks/drake-park-and-mirror-pond/> and the Les 
Schwab Amphitheater <http://www.bendconcerts.com/>, there is plenty to do in 
Bend apart from adventuring.The Capitol <http://www.thecapitolbend.com/> is a

<http://volcanictheatrepub.com/>, McMenamins Old St Francis School

Pizza Mondo, now in its 20th year, has been voted Bend’s Best Pizza 17 times. 
A downtown spot, it’s open daily from 11am (11.30am on Sundays) until late. The 
light, crisp pizzas come in two sizes: 18in (from $18) and 15in (from $13), 
with plenty of combinations, including a build-your-own. The lunch deal of a 
slice, a salad and a drink from $5.75 is great value.

Bend’s breweries serve good, solid food, but with burgers, fries and pasta to 
the fore, subtlety isn’t always in abundance. That’s not the case at Wild Rose, 
a restaurant serving finely nuanced northern Thai cuisine. Among the house 
specialities,khao soi curry with crispy noodles ($11) is a finely balanced 
dish, and thetom saap ($6 as a starter) is a zesty soup to savour.

Café Sintra

This breakfast-and-lunch joint is named after the Portuguese town, though 
culinary influences are hard to detect among (fantastic) breakfast dishes such 
as pancakes, omelettes and waffles – the granola trio ($9.50) and French toast 
($8) are recommended. But the lunch menu includes seafood gazpacho (from 
$6.50), Portuguese chicken stew (from $6), marinated steak andlinguiça sausage 
skewers ($9.50) and an array of sandwich combos. The vibe is friendly, the 
coffee is great and there’s interesting artwork to gaze at between forkfuls.

Open daily 7am-2pm, this slightly out-of-town spot is a hot ticket. It gets 
busy, but there’s complimentary coffee on the porch for those waiting. Once 
inside, the berry ola oatmeal ($9.25) and the country biscuits and gravy 
($8.95) are outstanding. The menu also offers eggs, crepes, pancakes and 
sandwiches, plus specialities including white bean chicken chilli and savoury 
scone ($10.25).

Brews from beans

Bend is still close enough to Portland for the flame of artisan coffee 
roasting to burn brightly. It’s easy to find a great caffeine hit, but you may 
have to queue atThump Coffee Roasters <https://thumpcoffee.com/>, despite its 
two city outposts. A lovely buzz is also provided atLooney Bean 
<https://www.facebook.com/Looney-Bean-Bend-163552820334643/> and Bellatazza 
<http://www.bellatazza.com/home>, both near the river, and at Bluebird Coffee 
Company <https://www.facebook.com/BluebirdCoffeeCompanyBendOregon>, with cool 
art and a serene setting.

 Deschutes’ pub on NW Bond Street. Photograph: Chris Mather 
Opened in 1988, this family- and employee-owned business was the first of 
Bend’s new wave of craft breweries. Deschutes has two city locations: its 
brewery at SW Simpson Avenue and the downtown pub and restaurant at NW Bond 
Street. Book a free, 45-minute brewery tour, including four complimentary 
drinks, at the former, and enjoy its award-winning IPAs and porters, along with 
robust sandwiches and pizza at the latter.

Sit at the bar, in the dining area or on the patio (with fire pit, should the 
air be even more chilled than the beer) at 10 Barrel. To get a real flavour of 
the quality and variety of its output, try the “10 Sampler”, a selection of 10 
3oz drinks taking in its session, seasonal, sours and dark ales for $10.

Bend Brewing Co

It only produces 1,000 barrels a year, so any visit to Bend Brewing Co has the 
potential to be special. Try signature ales such as the High Desert Hefeweizen 
– a blend of pale, crystal and Munich malts – or the Metolius, a refreshing, 
fruity, golden ale. The brewery, now in its 21st year, has a riverside location 
with an outdoor patio overlooking Mirror Pond. The weekday lunch special (from 
11.30am-2pm) of burger and pint is $10.

There is an experimental air to Crux. Former Deschutes brewmaster Larry Sidor 
uses wild yeast strains, experimental hops and open fermentation to craft its 
pilsners, stouts and IPAs. Crux opened in 2012 and gets rave reviews from 
locals: its Freakcake is, according tothepourfool.com <https://thepourfool.com/>
, one of “the best Belgian-style American ales ever made”.

Sip

Alternatives to all that ale can be found at Atlas Cider 
<http://www.atlascider.com/> (sweet) and Far Afield Cider 
<http://www.farafieldcider.com/> (dry), but for a convivial wine bar 
experience, visit Sip. There’s a selection of white, red and sparkling wines – 
also available in three-wine flights (from $9) – plus tasty small plates, 
salads and sandwiches. Regular live music (indoors and on the patio) adds to 
the ambience.

The 59-room, seven-storey boutique hotel became the tallest building in 
downtown Bend when it opened in 2010. It has smart, spacious rooms in natural 
tones, fine dining at its 10below restaurant, regular jazz concerts, and a 
commitment to using natural products where possible and running on 100% 
renewable energy. It’s possible to hire a bicycle for a jaunt around the city, 
and the staff are a great source of honest recommendations about the local area.

McMenamims hotels are famed for their conversions, so it’s no surprise to find 
this former Catholic schoolhouse, dating from 1936, is now an affordable hotel, 
restaurant, brewery, music venue and cinema. It’s a bit like a school you’d be 
happy not to leave. The classrooms are now 19 guest rooms, each named after 
former teachers, while the design palette mixes dark wood, vibrant artwork and 
municipal-style fixtures and fittings.

Mill Inn Bed and Breakfast

Bend has several chain hotels, motels and self-catering suites, in town and 
near to route US-97, but it doesn’t have many B&Bs, which makes Mill Inn a 
delightful discovery. The 10-room, wooden property is a 10-minute walk from 
downtown, has an outdoor hot tub, and serves healthy and hearty breakfasts of 
freshly made frittatas, granola, fruit, yoghurt, and fry-ups of local bacon and 
sausages.
