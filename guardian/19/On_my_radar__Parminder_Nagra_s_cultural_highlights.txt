I love going to the library here in LA. People think it’s really funny that I 
go to the library for some reason, but it’s a really lovely place and I was 
looking up at the shelves with the newest reads and I saw this book. I thought, 
Oh, I’ll give that a go. I like reading something new that has nothing to do 
with work. I picked it up and finished it in a day and a half. It was so 
beautifully written. One of the things that really struck me was this quote: 
“People are at their least aware of others when demonstrating their own power 
over them.” It’s a really great observation – I see it playing out in all walks 
of life.

Normally, the way I can tell if a film is good or not is whether I fall asleep 
during the screening. This one was pretty long but it definitely passed the 
sleep test. It’s about a handyman in Massachusetts who has to look after his 
teenage nephew after the boy’s father dies. Casey Affleck’s performance was 
really quiet and powerful, one of the best of the year I think. Beforehand, 
people were telling me it was depressing, but it’s also painfully funny and 
resonates on so many different levels. It’s very rare that a movie sits with me 
so much. I saw it at a matinee and got so wrapped up in that world that when I 
came out, I was surprised to find myself in LA. Another heart-wrenching film I 
saw recently wasLion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/lion-review-dev-patel-and-nicole-kidman-hunt-oscars-in-moving-adoption-drama>
, with Dev Patel. The first 50 minutes are really quite difficult to watch, but 
it’s such a beautiful story.

Like everyone else, I got very caught up in the politics of 2016, and one of 
the people I got really interested in isRuth Bader Ginsburg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/10/ruth-bader-ginsburg-supreme-court-justice-new-book-my-own-words>
, who is an associate justice in the US supreme court. I saw an interview with 
her on TV and thought she was really funny, so I got her book and now I’m about 
halfway through it. I’m just fascinated by her. It’s interesting to see how 
this woman, growing up in a family of Russian-Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn, 
got to where she did. She’s just lovely and I can relate to a woman trying to 
make it in a man’s world. The book really delves into her likes and dislikes, 
the things she agrees with and disagrees with, but does so with respect, which 
I find fascinating. You can disagree with someone, but with respect.

We saw Culture Club at the Hollywood Bowl in August and it was so much fun – 
it really took me back to my teenage years. When all the famous songs came on 
like Karma Chameleon, we could not help but stand up and get involved.Boy George
 <https://www.theguardian.com/music/boy-george> was just fantastic; he got the 
whole crowd going and let everybody on stage shine and have their moment. They 
had the LA Philharmonic Orchestra playing in the background, which I 
appreciated because I used to be in an orchestra – I played the viola. Music’s 
just a huge part of my life and I love a bit of classical music in the car. You 
spend a lot of time driving in LA and classical music is especially good 
because it keeps you calm.

Disgraced. Photograph: Craig Schwartz 
It’s quite hard to find good theatre in LA, so it was really nice to see this 
play by Ayad Akhtar over the summer. It centres on a dinner party thrown by a 
Muslim lawyer and his wife in New York and it deals with Islamophobia and what 
it’s like to be a Muslim in America. It was brilliantly done, with a really 
powerful performance from Hari Dhillon, who came over from the London 
production. We went to see it with a group [of mixed religion] and we had a 
good debrief about it afterwards, discussing our experiences of living in this 
political climate and how it affects some people more than others. I think it’s 
a very of-the-moment play.

 Egilsstadir, Iceland, which served as a base for the crew of Fortitude. 
Photograph: Alamy 
I was in Iceland for a couple of weeks last April filming the second series of 
Fortitude. We were staying in a town called Egilsstaðir, which is in a pretty 
remote part of the country. You wouldn’t ever go there unless you were doing a 
road trip throughIceland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/iceland>, but if 
you do, make sure you stop at the Lake Hotel restaurant. The food is so good 
and everything tastes really clean and fresh. We had this amazing lamb that 
wasn’t gamey like lamb can sometimes be and the trout dish was one of the best 
I’ve ever eaten. And this lemon butter they had – it was like dessert! We went 
there a few nights in a row, walking from our hotel through heavy snow, and 
everything we had was really delicious.
