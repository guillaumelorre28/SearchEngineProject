Well, Djokovic did it in the end, and he probably deserved it. The Serb had 
three match points in the second set but couldn’t take them, and it looked like 
Murray had the edge, but Djokovic found an extra gear late in the third. 
Congratulations to him – it really was an excellent final.

Djokovic: “Definitely one of the best ways to start a year. I had three or 
four match points in the second set, he turned it around and I thought: wow. I 
hope this isn’t payback time!

He was close … all the way to the last shot you never know with Andy. It’s no 
strange occurence for both of us to play three sets for three hours. It’s a 
physical battle and we’ll need a bit of time to get ready for Melbourne.”

Novak Djokovic wins 6-3 5-7 6-4!

Djokovic falls behind 0-30, and this is just like before! But this time Murray 
makes a couple of bad errors, and we’re level again at 30-30. There’s just 
nothing between these two players. Murray hits the net again, and Djokovic has 
a 40-30 lead, and a fourth match point! And this time Djokovic takes it! What a 
match! Game, set and match Djokovic!

Third set: Murray 3-6 7-5 4-5 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Murray surges ahead to 40-0, and though Djokovic just caresses a backhand 
winner down the lift, Murray clinches the game to 15. As in the second set, 
Djokovic has to serve for the match. He didn’t control his nerves too well in 
that instance – will he fare better here?

Third set: *Murray 3-6 7-5 3-5 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Djokovic looks to have the momentum, but he throws in a double fault and 
allows Murray to reduce the deficit to 30-15. No matter: his next first serve 
is big, and he wraps up the game rapidly. Five-three Djokovic in the decider, 
and Murray is serving to stay in the match.

Djokovic breaks in the seventh game of the third set!

Third set: Murray 3-6 7-5 3-4 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Now Djokovic looks like he’s wrested the initiative, and Murray is in a jam at 
0-30. Now it’s 0-40, and Djokovic has three break points! And he takes the 
first of them when Murray can only find the net! Djokovic goes ahead, and this 
topsy-turvy match has moved again.

Third set: *Murray 3-6 7-5 3-3 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Djokovic starts off with a double fault, and then dumps a forehand into the 
net. 0-30, and this could be trouble for the Serb. Djokovic wins three points 
on the spin, but then he’s long from the baseline, and we’re at deuce.


Murray forces break point – but Djokovic saves it with his 13th overhead 
winner! And then Djokovic holds his nerve to hold serve! Hugely important hold 
for Djokovic, but as Boris points out:
Boris Becker (@TheBorisBecker) 
Whoever wins his service games easier ,saves energy for return games ! That 
will be deciding factor#Doha <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Doha?src=hash>

Third set: Murray 3-6 7-5 3-2 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Very good from Murray, and he moves to 30-0 with no fuss. Now it’s 40-0, and 
Murray finishes a very strong service game with a rocket of an ace. All the 
pressure is back on Djokovic.

Third set: *Murray 3-6 7-5 2-2 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

A couple of excellent points in that game from Djokovic, including a fine drop 
shot that had Murray beaten, and it looks as though Djokovic has stopped the 
Murray train – or at least slowed it down.

Murray chugs ahead to 40-0, but Djokovic unfurls a terrific return to leave 
Murray scrambling. 40-15, and a chance to make it 40-30, but Djokovic 
completely muffs a forehand smash, and it’s game Murray.

This game should be over, but Murray has shown incredible grit to save three 
match points and force a third set. He’s world No1 for a reason.

Murray wins the second set 7-5!

Second set: *Murray 3-6 7-5 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Djokovic is all over the place here. He looked so settled, but he played a 
poor service game when the match was in his grasp, and he’s begun to unravel. 
Murray moves to 15-40 and two set points, and he takes the second of them! This 
match will go the distance!

More absurdly excellent play, and we’re at 30-30. It’s the first week of the 
season! The level is so high. Djokovic has an opening, but Murray moves to 
40-30, and then Djokovic is so pissed off that he smashes his racquet and 
receives a one-point penalty! Game Murray, and now Djokovic has to serve to 
stay in the set!

Murray breaks in the 10th game of the second set!

Second set: *Murray 3-6 5-5 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Can Djokovic hold his nerve? An excellent overhead smash from the back of the 
court takes him to 15-0, and then 30-0 after an excellent first serve. He’s two 
points away from victory. Djokovic, incidentally, has hit 26 winners to 
Murray’s 16. But then he throws in a double fault! Nerves. 30-15. Can Murray 
exploit this?

A piercing backhand and Murray is level at 30-30. Eesh, this is tense. And 
Murray fires a backhand winner past Djokovic for 40-30! Break point, and Murray 
can even the set here. But Djokovic plays a perfect point and finishes it with 
a wonderful inside-out forehand! Courageous. Deuce.

Advantage Djokovic gives him match point, but he’s wide on his backhand 
passing attempt, and we’re back to deuce. This is tense! An excellent second 
serve gives him match point No2, but Murray saves it! Third deuce. Wow.


That’s a brilliant point from Djokovic, though, and this is championship point 
No3. Oh no! Djokovic floats one long and we’re back to deuce.

Now Murray has the break point! This is some game. Some match! And Murray gets 
it! What an effort from Murray. Five all in second.

Second set: Murray 3-6 4-5 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Murray goes to 40-15 with a big, booming serve down the middle. He wants to 
make Djokovic serve for the match, and the Serb will have to – Djokovic is wide 
with a low skidding volley.

Second set: *Murray 3-6 3-5 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

A poor start from Djokovic, and it’s 0-30. But Murray nets an easy backhand, 
and then Djokovic finds the white line with an overhead smash. 30-30. Murray 
misses another regulation forehand, and then Djokovic wraps the game up. He’s 
now one game away from victory.
Stuart Fraser (@stu_fraser) 
Murray a set and a break down. A streak of 111 consecutive matches in which he 
has broken serve could be coming to an end...

Djokovic breaks in the seventh game of the second set!

Second set: Murray 3-6 3-4 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic is down momentarily after a tumble, and Murray crosses the net to 
check if he’s OK, which prompts generous applause from the crowd. Murray throws 
in a double fault at 15-15, and this is chance for Djokovic. Now Murray is long 
from the baseline! 15-40, and two break points for the Serb. Big, big chance 
here.

Murray saves one, but then throws in another double fault! What a time to do 
so. Djokovic, who’s given very little away, takes the break of serve, and now 
he’s two games away from victory.

Second set: *Murray 3-6 3-3 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Murray looks to have put that first-set brain freeze behind him, and he’s 
playing well in the second. Mind you, so is Djokovic. Ooh, that’s a chance for 
Murray at 15-30 – a down-the-line pass is just wide, and Djokovic breathes a 
sigh of relief. 30-30, but it could so easily have been two break points.

But this time Murray does earn a break point! 30-40. Can Murray take it? No! 
Djokovic gets out of a hole, but that was a big chance for Murray. Deuce 
becomes advantage for Djokovic, and then Murray gets a lucky net cord! We’re 
back to deuce.

This time Djokovic does pass the test, and that’s a really important hold. 
Murray may live to regret those missed chances.

Second set: Murray 3-6 3-2 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic just misses with a two-handed backhand pass, and Murray goes up 15-0. 
Then Djokovic does put away a smash – he watched it all the way on to his 
racquet. 15-15, but Murray shows soft hands at the net to go up 30-15, and 
again for 40-15! Lovely, delicate play from Murray, and he finishes the game 
and celebrates with a fist pump.

Second set: *Murray 3-6 1-1 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Murray challenges a call at 30-15, but the line judge was correct, and 
Djokovic moves to 40-15. Murray looks like he’s simmering, but then Djokovic 
drills a backhand into the net, surprisingly, and it’s 40-30. No matter: 
Djokovic wins the next point, and it’s 1-1 in the second set.

Second set: Murray 3-6 1-0 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Better from Murray, and he takes the first game of the second set with a 
confident hold to 15. But what happened at the end of the first set? Murray’s 
game imploded, Djokovic won eight straight points, and it’s a really tough ask 
for the Scot now.

Djokovic wins the first set 6-3!

*Murray 3-6 0-0 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Murray has never beaten Djokovic when he’s lost the first set. And two more 
crass errors from Murray give Djokovic a 30-0 advantage. Now it’s 40-0, and 
Djokovic has three set points. And he takes the first one with a sumptuous 
down-the-line forehand. First set Djokovic, and Murray has serious work to do 
now.

Djokovic breaks in the eighth game of the first set!

First set: Murray 3-5 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Murray bares his teeth after missing a routine backhand to give Djokovic a 
sniff at 40-30. Then he’s long from the back of the court, and what should have 
been a hold to 15 is now deuce.

Long again from Murray! Three unforced errors in a row, and Djokovic has a 
break point. This is a huge opportunity for the Serb. Which he takes! Murray 
balloons one into the crowd, and Djokovic breaks!

First set: Murray 3-3 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

That’s a lovely backhand lob from Djokovic – his 10th winner – and he moves 
ahead 15-30. But then Murray fires down a big booming ace for 30-30. There’s 
nothing between these two. Djokovic dumps an easy backhand into the net, but 
recovers to force deuce. Murray is cranky.

And what a point! Another brutal cross-court drop shot from the Scot to give 
him the advantage. And Djokovic is warned by the umpire for smacking a ball 
that came perilously close to hitting someone. Murray wraps up the game and 
Djokovic just stands there, hands on hips.

First set: Murray 2-2 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

A slight delay for a belligerent fan to be removed from the stands. We’re only 
three games in but already we’ve played 22 minutes. It’s just so competitive. 
But then Murray rattles through to hold to 15, a game marred only by his first 
double fault.

First set: *Murray 1-2 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

This is good stuff. Murray unfurls a two-handed backhand to peg Djokovic back 
at 15-15, and then 30-30. Hm. Now Djokovic is calling for the trainer – it 
looks as though he’s got a cut on his finger than needs to be taped. A slight 
pause, but Djokovic is back, and play can continue at 30-30.

Another big forehand from Djokovic has Murray chasing around the court, and 
it’s 40-30. That’s four or five big groundstrokes from Nole already, but Murray 
is a grinder, and he outlasts Djokovic to draw even at deuce.

What a shot! A lovely drop-volley gives Murray break point, but Djokovic gets 
out of trouble with a big first serve. Djokovic is having to work hard here, 
but he gains the advantage with a disguised drop-shot that was almost as good 
as Murray’s earlier, and then holds on after Murray is wide from the back 
court. Game Djokovic.
 Djokovic is playing plenty of big groundstrokes early on. Photograph: Karim

First set: Murray 1-1 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Murray goes ahead 15-0, but then Djokovic unleashes that lavish forehand of 
his, and it’s 15-15. Another big forehand is backed up by a smash at the net 
for 15-30, but then he’s long on the return. 30-30. Djokovic completely mishits 
a regulation backhand return, and then Murray clinches the game with a super 
two-handed backhand lob that Djokovic can’t return. Game Murray.

It’s not excessively hot in Doha – about 19C – but it is humid. Incidentally, 
this is the 36th meeting between this top-class pair. Djokovic has won 24 of 
those encounters; Murray has 11.

Just taking a look at the 2016 end-of-year ATP rankings: Murray ended the 
season top with 12,410 points, and Djokovic was just behind with 11,780. The 
third-ranked player was Milos Raonic, with 5,459. Which is to say, in men’s 
tennis at the moment, there’s Murray and Djokovic, and then daylight.

Here’s Simon McMahon: “Afternoon Tim, and Happy New Year. Can we agree that 
Andy will remain plain old Andy, on the game-by-game at least? Well deserved 
and all that, but he’ll always be Andy to me. As for the tennis, it’ll be 
interesting to see how he copes with the pressure of maintaining the No1 
ranking after his remarkable end to 2016, with Novak surely desperate to get 
back on top. No prizes for predicting that these two will probably meet again 
in the final in Melbourne, with a timely psychological boost for the winner 
today.”

Oh, definitely. Good on him and everything, but Sir Andy just doesn’t sound 
right, doesn’t it? I wonder who’s ripped the piss the most on tour. Kyrgios?

Hello and welcome

A tasty match-up in prospect in Qatar, and an alluring warm-up for the 
Australian Open, which begins later this month: Andy Murray takes on Novak 
Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> in the first ATP 
final of the year. Murray ended the year as the world No1, won his third BBC 
sports personality of the year, and to top it off, received a bloody 
knighthood! “Arise, Sir Andy,” etc, etc. His tennis is in supremely good order, 
and don’t bet against him winning his first Australian Open title in Melbourne 
at the end of the month.

Djokovic, who survived five match points before seeing off Fernando Verdasco 
in his semi-final here in Doha, is out to avenge his ATP World Tour finals 
defeat by Murray in November. He wants that No1 ranking back.

We’ll be getting under way in about half an hour or so. Join us then.

Tim will be here shortly. In the meantime, read how Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> set up his final against Novak 
Djokovic:

Murray went on court in the knowledge defending champion Djokovic was awaiting 
the winner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/06/novak-djokovic-beats-fernando-verdasco-qatar-open-final>
 and showed no signs of repeating the stuttering start he made to his 
quarter-final win over Nicolás Almagro the previous day.

After the first three games went with serve, the Scot broke to make it 3-1 and 
from there he never looked back as he produced one of 10 aces to clinch the 
opening set with just 48 minutes on the clock.

Berdych, coached by the former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, showed 
some resistance early in the second set but could not capitalise on a couple of 
break points in the second game before immediately failing to hold his own 
service.

The pair then exchanged breaks before Murray saw the set out to set up a 
tantalising final with Djokovic, who saved five match points on his way to 
defeating Fernando Verdasco earlier in the day.

Murray, who won the tournament in 2008 and 2009, has now recorded 28 
consecutive victories. “I want to try and keep it going, I feel a little bit 
like this year’s a fresh start,” he told Eurosport.

“The end to last year was a great way to finish the year but it’s great to be 
through to the final here and a great match against Novak tomorrow to look 
forward to.

“It’s been the perfect week to get ready for the Australian Open.”

OK, we’re going to wrap this blog up now. Congratulations to Djokovic – this

Thanks for reading. Bye.

Novak Djokovic edges out Andy Murray in three sets to win Qatar Open
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/07/andy-murray-novak-djokovic-qatar-open-match-report> 
Well, Djokovic did it in the end, and he probably deserved it. The Serb had 
three match points in the second set but couldn’t take them, and it looked like 
Murray had the edge, but Djokovic found an extra gear late in the third. 
Congratulations to him – it really was an excellent final.

Djokovic: “Definitely one of the best ways to start a year. I had three or 
four match points in the second set, he turned it around and I thought: wow. I 
hope this isn’t payback time!

He was close … all the way to the last shot you never know with Andy. It’s no 
strange occurence for both of us to play three sets for three hours. It’s a 
physical battle and we’ll need a bit of time to get ready for Melbourne.”
 
Well, that was quite a match. The intensity was unbelievable. I need a lie 
down.
 
Djokovic falls behind 0-30, and this is just like before! But this time Murray 
makes a couple of bad errors, and we’re level again at 30-30. There’s just 
nothing between these two players. Murray hits the net again, and Djokovic has 
a 40-30 lead, and a fourth match point! And this time Djokovic takes it! What a 
match! Game, set and match Djokovic!
 
Third set: Murray 3-6 7-5 4-5 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Murray surges ahead to 40-0, and though Djokovic just caresses a backhand 
winner down the lift, Murray clinches the game to 15. As in the second set, 
Djokovic has to serve for the match. He didn’t control his nerves too well in 
that instance – will he fare better here?
 
Third set: *Murray 3-6 7-5 3-5 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Djokovic looks to have the momentum, but he throws in a double fault and 
allows Murray to reduce the deficit to 30-15. No matter: his next first serve 
is big, and he wraps up the game rapidly. Five-three Djokovic in the decider, 
and Murray is serving to stay in the match.
 
Third set: Murray 3-6 7-5 3-4 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Now Djokovic looks like he’s wrested the initiative, and Murray is in a jam at 
0-30. Now it’s 0-40, and Djokovic has three break points! And he takes the 
first of them when Murray can only find the net! Djokovic goes ahead, and this 
topsy-turvy match has moved again.
 
Third set: *Murray 3-6 7-5 3-3 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Djokovic starts off with a double fault, and then dumps a forehand into the 
net. 0-30, and this could be trouble for the Serb. Djokovic wins three points 
on the spin, but then he’s long from the baseline, and we’re at deuce.


Murray forces break point – but Djokovic saves it with his 13th overhead 
winner! And then Djokovic holds his nerve to hold serve! Hugely important hold 
for Djokovic, but as Boris points out:
Boris Becker (@TheBorisBecker) 
Whoever wins his service games easier ,saves energy for return games ! That 
will be deciding factor#Doha <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Doha?src=hash>
 <https://twitter.com/TheBorisBecker/status/817789149843509249> January 7, 2017
 <https://twitter.com/TheBorisBecker/status/817789149843509249>  
Third set: Murray 3-6 7-5 3-2 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Very good from Murray, and he moves to 30-0 with no fuss. Now it’s 40-0, and 
Murray finishes a very strong service game with a rocket of an ace. All the 
pressure is back on Djokovic.
 
Third set: *Murray 3-6 7-5 2-2 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

A couple of excellent points in that game from Djokovic, including a fine drop 
shot that had Murray beaten, and it looks as though Djokovic has stopped the 
Murray train – or at least slowed it down.
 
Third set: Murray 3-6 7-5 2-1 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Murray chugs ahead to 40-0, but Djokovic unfurls a terrific return to leave 
Murray scrambling. 40-15, and a chance to make it 40-30, but Djokovic 
completely muffs a forehand smash, and it’s game Murray.
 
Third set: *Murray 3-6 7-5 1-1 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

About 7,000 fans are in the stadium in Doha, and they’ve been treated. This 
game has been quite something – and it’s not over yet. Djokovic draws level 
with an easy hold to love, and he needed that: Murray had grasped the momentum.
 
Third set: Murray 3-6 7-5 1-0 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Novak has changed shirts, from blue polo neck to grey round-neck. And he takes 
Murray to deuce in the opening game of the third set.

Murray’s seventh ace gives him advantage, and he finishes the game to go ahead 
1-0 in the third.
 
This game should be over, but Murray has shown incredible grit to save three 
match points and force a third set. He’s world No1 for a reason.
 
Second set: *Murray 3-6 7-5 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Djokovic is all over the place here. He looked so settled, but he played a 
poor service game when the match was in his grasp, and he’s begun to unravel. 
Murray moves to 15-40 and two set points, and he takes the second of them! This 
match will go the distance!
 
Second set: *Murray 3-6 6-5 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

More absurdly excellent play, and we’re at 30-30. It’s the first week of the 
season! The level is so high. Djokovic has an opening, but Murray moves to 
40-30, and then Djokovic is so pissed off that he smashes his racquet and 
receives a one-point penalty! Game Murray, and now Djokovic has to serve to 
stay in the set!
 
Second set: *Murray 3-6 5-5 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Can Djokovic hold his nerve? An excellent overhead smash from the back of the 
court takes him to 15-0, and then 30-0 after an excellent first serve. He’s two 
points away from victory. Djokovic, incidentally, has hit 26 winners to 
Murray’s 16. But then he throws in a double fault! Nerves. 30-15. Can Murray 
exploit this?

A piercing backhand and Murray is level at 30-30. Eesh, this is tense. And 
Murray fires a backhand winner past Djokovic for 40-30! Break point, and Murray 
can even the set here. But Djokovic plays a perfect point and finishes it with 
a wonderful inside-out forehand! Courageous. Deuce.

Advantage Djokovic gives him match point, but he’s wide on his backhand 
passing attempt, and we’re back to deuce. This is tense! An excellent second 
serve gives him match point No2, but Murray saves it! Third deuce. Wow.


That’s a brilliant point from Djokovic, though, and this is championship point 
No3. Oh no! Djokovic floats one long and we’re back to deuce.

Now Murray has the break point! This is some game. Some match! And Murray gets 
it! What an effort from Murray. Five all in second.
 
Second set: Murray 3-6 4-5 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Murray goes to 40-15 with a big, booming serve down the middle. He wants to 
make Djokovic serve for the match, and the Serb will have to – Djokovic is wide 
with a low skidding volley.
 
Second set: *Murray 3-6 3-5 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

A poor start from Djokovic, and it’s 0-30. But Murray nets an easy backhand, 
and then Djokovic finds the white line with an overhead smash. 30-30. Murray 
misses another regulation forehand, and then Djokovic wraps the game up. He’s 
now one game away from victory.
Stuart Fraser (@stu_fraser) 
Murray a set and a break down. A streak of 111 consecutive matches in which he 
has broken serve could be coming to an end...

Second set: Murray 3-6 3-4 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic is down momentarily after a tumble, and Murray crosses the net to 
check if he’s OK, which prompts generous applause from the crowd. Murray throws 
in a double fault at 15-15, and this is chance for Djokovic. Now Murray is long 
from the baseline! 15-40, and two break points for the Serb. Big, big chance 
here.

Murray saves one, but then throws in another double fault! What a time to do 
so. Djokovic, who’s given very little away, takes the break of serve, and now 
he’s two games away from victory.
 
Second set: *Murray 3-6 3-3 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Murray looks to have put that first-set brain freeze behind him, and he’s 
playing well in the second. Mind you, so is Djokovic. Ooh, that’s a chance for 
Murray at 15-30 – a down-the-line pass is just wide, and Djokovic breathes a 
sigh of relief. 30-30, but it could so easily have been two break points.

But this time Murray does earn a break point! 30-40. Can Murray take it? No! 
Djokovic gets out of a hole, but that was a big chance for Murray. Deuce 
becomes advantage for Djokovic, and then Murray gets a lucky net cord! We’re 
back to deuce.

This time Djokovic does pass the test, and that’s a really important hold. 
Murray may live to regret those missed chances.
 
Second set: Murray 3-6 3-2 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic just misses with a two-handed backhand pass, and Murray goes up 15-0. 
Then Djokovic does put away a smash – he watched it all the way on to his 
racquet. 15-15, but Murray shows soft hands at the net to go up 30-15, and 
again for 40-15! Lovely, delicate play from Murray, and he finishes the game 
and celebrates with a fist pump.
 
Second set: *Murray 3-6 2-2 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Both players getting into their stride on serve. Djokovic goes to 15-0, and 
then 30-0, and 40-0, and finishes the game with a confident put-away after his 
first serve forced Murray out wide. Two-all in the second.
 
Second set: Murray 3-6 2-1 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Ha. Djokovic misses an easy overhead smash – not the first time we’ve seen him 
flub those – and Murray holds to love.
 
Second set: *Murray 3-6 1-1 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Murray challenges a call at 30-15, but the line judge was correct, and 
Djokovic moves to 40-15. Murray looks like he’s simmering, but then Djokovic 
drills a backhand into the net, surprisingly, and it’s 40-30. No matter: 
Djokovic wins the next point, and it’s 1-1 in the second set.

 
Second set: Murray 3-6 1-0 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Better from Murray, and he takes the first game of the second set with a 
confident hold to 15. But what happened at the end of the first set? Murray’s 
game imploded, Djokovic won eight straight points, and it’s a really tough ask 
for the Scot now.

*Murray 3-6 0-0 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

Murray has never beaten Djokovic when he’s lost the first set. And two more 
crass errors from Murray give Djokovic a 30-0 advantage. Now it’s 40-0, and 
Djokovic has three set points. And he takes the first one with a sumptuous 
down-the-line forehand. First set Djokovic, and Murray has serious work to do 
now.
 
First set: Murray 3-5 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Murray bares his teeth after missing a routine backhand to give Djokovic a 
sniff at 40-30. Then he’s long from the back of the court, and what should have 
been a hold to 15 is now deuce.

Long again from Murray! Three unforced errors in a row, and Djokovic has a 
break point. This is a huge opportunity for the Serb. Which he takes! Murray 
balloons one into the crowd, and Djokovic breaks!
 
First set: Murray 3-4 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Another hold to love for Djokovic – his second in succession. Djokovic’s 
service game just starting to look a little more secure.
 
First set: Murray 3-3 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

That’s a lovely backhand lob from Djokovic – his 10th winner – and he moves 
ahead 15-30. But then Murray fires down a big booming ace for 30-30. There’s 
nothing between these two. Djokovic dumps an easy backhand into the net, but 
recovers to force deuce. Murray is cranky.

And what a point! Another brutal cross-court drop shot from the Scot to give 
him the advantage. And Djokovic is warned by the umpire for smacking a ball 
that came perilously close to hitting someone. Murray wraps up the game and 
Djokovic just stands there, hands on hips.
 
First set: *Murray 2-3 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

An easy hold to love for Djokovic. Murray unable to get anything going in that 
game.
 
First set: Murray 2-2 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

A slight delay for a belligerent fan to be removed from the stands. We’re only 
three games in but already we’ve played 22 minutes. It’s just so competitive. 
But then Murray rattles through to hold to 15, a game marred only by his first 
double fault.
 
First set: *Murray 1-2 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

This is good stuff. Murray unfurls a two-handed backhand to peg Djokovic back 
at 15-15, and then 30-30. Hm. Now Djokovic is calling for the trainer – it 
looks as though he’s got a cut on his finger than needs to be taped. A slight 
pause, but Djokovic is back, and play can continue at 30-30.

Another big forehand from Djokovic has Murray chasing around the court, and 
it’s 40-30. That’s four or five big groundstrokes from Nole already, but Murray 
is a grinder, and he outlasts Djokovic to draw even at deuce.

What a shot! A lovely drop-volley gives Murray break point, but Djokovic gets 
out of trouble with a big first serve. Djokovic is having to work hard here, 
but he gains the advantage with a disguised drop-shot that was almost as good 
as Murray’s earlier, and then holds on after Murray is wide from the back 
court. Game Djokovic.

First set: Murray 1-1 Djokovic* (*denotes next server)

Murray goes ahead 15-0, but then Djokovic unleashes that lavish forehand of 
his, and it’s 15-15. Another big forehand is backed up by a smash at the net 
for 15-30, but then he’s long on the return. 30-30. Djokovic completely mishits 
a regulation backhand return, and then Murray clinches the game with a super 
two-handed backhand lob that Djokovic can’t return. Game Murray.
 
First set: *Murray 0-1 Djokovic (*denotes next server)

An up-and-down start from Djokovic, and Murray takes him to deuce, but 
Djokovic gets out a jam, and holds the first game.
 
OK, we’re ready. Murray’s in white, with black shorts and white cap. Djokovic 
is in blue with white shorts. Djokovic to serve first. Let’s play tennis!
 
It’s not excessively hot in Doha – about 19C – but it is humid. Incidentally, 
this is the 36th meeting between this top-class pair. Djokovic has won 24 of 
those encounters; Murray has 11.
 
The players are out on court in Doha, having a hit pre-match, so we’ll be 
starting shortly.
 
Just taking a look at the 2016 end-of-year ATP rankings: Murray ended the 
season top with 12,410 points, and Djokovic was just behind with 11,780. The 
third-ranked player was Milos Raonic, with 5,459. Which is to say, in men’s 
tennis at the moment, there’s Murray and Djokovic, and then daylight.
 
Here’s Simon McMahon: “Afternoon Tim, and Happy New Year. Can we agree that 
Andy will remain plain old Andy, on the game-by-game at least? Well deserved 
and all that, but he’ll always be Andy to me. As for the tennis, it’ll be 
interesting to see how he copes with the pressure of maintaining the No1 
ranking after his remarkable end to 2016, with Novak surely desperate to get 
back on top. No prizes for predicting that these two will probably meet again 
in the final in Melbourne, with a timely psychological boost for the winner 
today.”

Oh, definitely. Good on him and everything, but Sir Andy just doesn’t sound 
right, doesn’t it? I wonder who’s ripped the piss the most on tour. Kyrgios?
 
A tasty match-up in prospect in Qatar, and an alluring warm-up for the 
Australian Open, which begins later this month: Andy Murray takes on Novak 
Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> in the first ATP 
final of the year. Murray ended the year as the world No1, won his third BBC 
sports personality of the year, and to top it off, received a bloody 
knighthood! “Arise, Sir Andy,” etc, etc. His tennis is in supremely good order, 
and don’t bet against him winning his first Australian Open title in Melbourne 
at the end of the month.

Djokovic, who survived five match points before seeing off Fernando Verdasco 
in his semi-final here in Doha, is out to avenge his ATP World Tour finals 
defeat by Murray in November. He wants that No1 ranking back.

We’ll be getting under way in about half an hour or so. Join us then.
 
Tim will be here shortly. In the meantime, read how Andy Murray 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> set up his final against Novak 
Djokovic:

Murray went on court in the knowledge defending champion Djokovic was awaiting 
the winner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/06/novak-djokovic-beats-fernando-verdasco-qatar-open-final>
 and showed no signs of repeating the stuttering start he made to his 
quarter-final win over Nicolás Almagro the previous day.

After the first three games went with serve, the Scot broke to make it 3-1 and 
from there he never looked back as he produced one of 10 aces to clinch the 
opening set with just 48 minutes on the clock.

Berdych, coached by the former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, showed 
some resistance early in the second set but could not capitalise on a couple of 
break points in the second game before immediately failing to hold his own 
service.

The pair then exchanged breaks before Murray saw the set out to set up a 
tantalising final with Djokovic, who saved five match points on his way to 
defeating Fernando Verdasco earlier in the day.

Murray, who won the tournament in 2008 and 2009, has now recorded 28 
consecutive victories. “I want to try and keep it going, I feel a little bit 
like this year’s a fresh start,” he told Eurosport.

“The end to last year was a great way to finish the year but it’s great to be 
through to the final here and a great match against Novak tomorrow to look 
forward to.

“It’s been the perfect week to get ready for the Australian Open.”
