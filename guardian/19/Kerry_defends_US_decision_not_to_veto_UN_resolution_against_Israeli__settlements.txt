The US secretary of state, John Kerry, has offered a blistering defence of the 
US decision to allow a UN resolution condemning Israeli settlements, saying if 
Washington had vetoed it,Israel <https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> 
would have been given a licence for “unfettered settlement construction” and 
the end of the peace process.


Framing a two-state solution as “the only way to achieve a just and lasting 
peace between Israelis and Palestinians”, Kerry took aim at the Israeli prime 
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for building a coalition that was “the most 
rightwing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme 
elements”.


Kerry’s speech was the latest chapter in a high-octane diplomatic drama marked 
by a war of words between the Obama administration and Israel, since the vote 
on Friday that called Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem a
“flagrant violation” of international law 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/23/us-abstention-allows-un-to-demand-end-to-israeli-settlements>
.

The speech was immediately condemned by Netanyahu, who described it as 
“skewed” and “obsessively” focused on the settlement issue.

The exchange between Kerry and Netanyahu marked a new low in the relationship 
between Israel’s government and theObama administration

The US abstention in Friday’s security council resolution drew unprecedented 
Israeli fury directed at its closest ally – and other friendly countries that 
voted for the resolution – and accusations of betrayal and underhand dealings.

However, describing the decision, Kerry said: “If we had vetoed this 
resolution ... the United States would have been giving license to further, 
unfettered settlement construction that we fundamentally oppose.

“It is not this resolution that is isolating Israel. It is the permanent 
policy of [Israeli] settlement construction that risks making peace impossible.”

The US secretary of state’s speech came as Donald Trump vowed once again to 
reverse US policy, which he hasdescribed as hostile to Israel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/23/trump-intervenes-to-sideline-obama-over-israeli-settlements>
, as soon as he takes office on 20 January.


The US president-elect issued a pre-emptive rebuttal to Kerry’s speech earlier 
on Wednesday.

We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and 
disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but.......

 Despite being delivered in the last weeks of the Obama administration, 
Kerry’s speech – as well as the UN resolution – have been widely seen as a part 
of an effort tofuture-proof the two-state solution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/27/obama-and-allies-seek-to-isolate-netanyahu-before-trump-takes-office>
 against the incoming Trump administration, giving the EU and other 
institutions the tools to continue pressuring Israel on issues such as the 
settlements.

 This resulted in one of the most passionate speeches delivered by Kerry 
during his time as America’s leading diplomat.

Pushing back at Israel’s fury over the US abstention , Kerry pointedly 
questioned Netanyahu’s commitment to Palestinian statehood , asking whether 
Israelis believed their interests were best served by the recent attacks on the 
Obama administration by Israeli leaders.

Kerry also offered a bleak vision of the risk of the collapse of the Oslo 
peace process and the two-state solution, describing the alternative one-state 
solution in the darkest terms.

“Today, there are a similar number of Jews and Palestinians living between the 
Jordan river and the Mediterranean Sea,” Kerry told his audience of diplomats 
in Washington, out lining the demographic reality on the ground that would 
colour the future of a unitary state.

“[Israelis and Palestinians] have a choice. They can choose to live together 
in one state, or they can separate into two states.

“Despite our best efforts over the years, the two-state solution is now in 
serious jeopardy … We cannot, in good conscience, do nothing, and say nothing, 
when we see the hope of peace slipping away.

“If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic, it 
cannot be both, and it won’t ever really be at peace. ”

Kerry also took the opportunity to forcefully deny Israeli accusations that 
the Obama administration had been behind the drafting of the resolution amid 
Israeli accusations that the US colluded with the Palestinians .

The US, insisted Kerry, “did not draft or originate” the UN resolution, adding 
: “ Nor did we put it forward [in the UN].”

“The United States did in fact vote in accordance with our values, just as 
previous administrations have done,” Kerry said during the speech at the US 
state department. “The vote in the United Nations was about preserving the 
two-state solution. That’s what we were standing up for.”


Kerry outlined a series of principles he said should form the basis of a 
future peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians, with the likely 
participation of the U S, including a “secure and recognised border” between 
Israel and the new nation of Palestine.

He also said an agreement must help Palestinian refugees, designate Jerusalem 
as a capital for both states and satisfy Israel’s security needs.

Kerry insisted that far from abandoning Israel, the Obama administration had 
been one of its strongest defenders, not least in the signing of a $38bn 
(£31bn) defence assistance deal.

Responding to the speech, Netanyahu said in a statement: “Like the security 
council resolution that Secretary Kerry advanced in the UN, his speech tonight 
was skewed against Israel .

“For over an hour, Kerry obsessively dealt with settlements and barely touched 
upon the root of the conflict – Palestinian opposition to a Jewish state in any 
boundaries.”
