Teams may not be drawn against opponents from their own country, or those they 
faced in the group stage. For example,Manchester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> will not be able to play 
Arsenal, Leicester or Barcelona – the latter having finished above them in 
Group C.

As a result City know they will face one of five teams: Atlético Madrid, 
Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Monaco or Napoli.

Arsenal will play an unseeded team but not Manchester City or PSG, so will be 
drawn against one of the following six sides: Benfica, Bayern Munich, Bayer 
Leverkusen, Real Madrid, Porto or Sevilla.

Leicester finished above Porto in their group, and in their first ever 
knockout tie in the European Cup will therefore face one of Benfica, Bayern 
Munich, Bayer Leverkusen, Real Madrid, PSG or Sevilla.

The teams that finished first will play the first leg away from home and the 
second leg at home in the ties which will take place over four weeks from 14 
February-15 March 2007.
