We’re looking for the best out-of-town escapes from New York City. The seaside 
resort of the Hamptons is one well known example, easily reached on the Long 
Island Rail Road, but you might want to tell us about more adventurous trips, 
to the Appalachian wilderness perhaps, up the Hudson River or the music and 
cultural hotspot of Asbury Park on the Jersey Shore. Affordable places to stay 
once you’re there are especially welcome.

Send us your tip – including as much detail as you can (with websites and 
prices if possible) and why the place is special – and you could win a £200 
hotel voucher. Contribute viaGuardianWitness <https://witness.guardian.co.uk/>.

The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
fromHotels.com <http://www.hotels.com/>, allowing you to stay in more than 
260,000 places worldwide. Submit your tip by clicking on the blue button and 
using the text tab. Feel free to add a photo if you own the copyright to it –
but it’s the text we’ll be judging!


Your tip should be around 100 words long. Terms and conditions
