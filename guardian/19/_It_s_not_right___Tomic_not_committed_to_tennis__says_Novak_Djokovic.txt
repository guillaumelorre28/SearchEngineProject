Bernard Tomic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> might claim to 
have $10m in his bank account at age 23, but that doesn’t impress world No1 
Novak Djokovic very much. The Serbian tennis star, who has a close training 
relationship with the Australian, has accused Tomic of failing to be committed 
to the sport after he gave up in the final point of his first-round match 
against Italian Fabio Fognini at the Madrid Masters.

“I’ve seen what he has done. It’s not right and I hope he realises that,” 
Djokovic told French news agency AFP. “I’m just hoping for him, because over 
the last couple of years I got to know him better and he’s a good guy, he’s a 
good person, but he’s just failing to be committed to this sport as it is 
required.”

“The sooner the better for him because he is still relatively young and he can 
definitely be a better player and better ranked than he is now. Everybody knows 
that. I think he knows that, but he doesn’t seem to really get things the right 
way off the court. Many things that he says are not well thought from his side. 
He gets emotional very quickly and things get out of context.”

The Australian was criticised when he held his racquet by the strings and 
pointed the handle at the net as he failed to offer a return on match point. He 
then inflamed the situation further when he showed little remorse for his 
actions when quizzed on Wednesday.

“I don’t care about that match point,” Tomic told News Corp Australia. “Would 
you care if you were 23 and worth over $10m?”
