But with a separate “poor door

” entrance for social tenants housed on the lower floors, and private elevators 
for the super-rich to speed to £3m penthouse apartments on the 67th floor, the 
new tower will revive controversy over inequality in the capital.

Spire London will rise 235 metres (771ft) on a site close to Canary Wharf in 
London Docklands. It promises “five-star lifestyle amenities” including a 
35th-floor club and infinity pool with spectacular views over the city. But 
these will be reserved for private buyers, with one-bed “luxurious suites” to 
go on sale from £595,000.

The affordable housing units will make up 96 of the 861 apartments, but the 
developers insist they will have equal access to other communal facilities on 
the third floor, including a creche, meeting rooms, games room, and a 
“music/learning/cultural space”.

The developers are China’s biggest private property company, Greenland Group, 
and its UK managing director said the venture was a major confidence boost for 
London’s post-Brexit property market.

“This important launch reflects the confidence that Greenland Group continues 
to have in both the London economy and the London property market,” said Wenhao 
Qian.

In the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum vote, prices at many tower 
developments stumbled, particularly in the London area.Property 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/property> websites began advertising many 
unfinished flats below the original purchase price in an attempt to lure buyers.

 London’s tallest buildings. 
One agent, LondonDom.com <http://uk.londondom.com/>, was advertising several 
properties in central London for less than the original price charged by the 
developer. Theseincluded a three-bedroom apartment 
<http://uk.londondom.com/propertydet.asp?Id=147&propInd=S&page=1&pageSize=10&orderBy=PriceSearchAmount&orderDirection=DESC&town=1>
 in the Battersea Riverlight development. Separately, a flat in the super-luxe
One Blackfriars development 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/25/london-empty-towers-very-british-corruption-tainted-wealth>
 was advertised for “less than the developer’s price”. In both cases, the agent 
said the sales were for personal reasons and not a result of the Brexit vote.

The London office property market also stalled immediately after the 
referendum, with many leading investment funds forced toclose their doors to 
withdrawals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/commercial-property-fund-freeze-all-you-need-to-know-standard-life-aviva>
to avoid a firesale of property.

However, data in recent weeks has tended to show a more robust property market 
emerging. House price growth picked up slightly in August, according to

The average price of a home rose 0.6% to £206,145 between July and August, 
according to theNationwide house price index 
<http://www.nationwide.co.uk/~/media/MainSite/documents/about/house-price-index/2016/Aug_2016.pdf>
 – one of two monthly surveys by UK mortgage lenders. This compared with a 0.5% 
monthly gain in June. The annual rate picked up to 5.6% from 5.2%.

Greenland Group, which is developing four of the 10 tallest buildings in the 
world, said Spire London would reach half its height by summer 2018, with 
completion in 2020.
