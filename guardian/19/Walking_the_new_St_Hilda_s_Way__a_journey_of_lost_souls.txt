‘As pilgrimages go, that’s not too taxing,” I said when I came across the 
newly fledged St Hilda’s Way, which opened in June 2015 to surprisingly little 
fanfare, given its coastal location. At just 40 miles, the route – from the 
Yorkshire coast up onto theNorth York Moors <http://www.northyorkmoors.org.uk/>
, then down the Esk Valley to Whitby – seemed gentle enough. All one had to do 
en route was take in eight churches dedicated to the 7th-century Saint Hilda, 
visit a couple more with Hilda-esque connections, and finish at Whitby Abbey. 
“Not sure I’ll even bother to take a compass,” I said.

It was on our first afternoon, trundling across Easington High Moor, alone but 
for the company ofskylarks

 andlapwings 
<https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/l/lapwing/>
, when my fellow pilgrim pointed out that the reservoir ahead looked 
suspiciously like the one we should have left behind an hour previously. I had 
been following the excellent guide to the pilgrimage and simply couldn’t fathom 
what had gone wrong. We cut our losses and headed down to Ainthorpe. There, the 
16th-century Fox & Hounds inn delivered friendly faces, an open fire, reviving 
food and crisp sheets.

In truth, St Hilda’s takes a while to get going as a pilgrimage. We had jumped 
off the bus from Saltburn and started our quest, as instructed, by dipping our 
hands reverently in the waters of St Hilda’s Holy Well beside her church in 
Hinderwell, just past Staithes. However, we were not to reach our second sacred 
site – St Hilda’s near Danby, and all of 10 miles away – until the next 
morning. By then we had put behind us the austere beauty of the wild and 
apparently limitless moors, whose glimpses of civilisation amounted to 
woebegone sheep and the occasional stone wall, and began shadowing the river 
Esk. Here the scenery took on a more domesticated feel: we looked across the 
valley to brave little farmhouses and often found our way flanked by the yellow 
explosions of daffodils. Since the route also includes a wonderful descent into 
Whitby, affording cracking views of the town and the sea beyond, it’s doubtless 
only the small-scale nature of the guidebook’s publisher that has kept the 
pilgrimage from registering on the radar of Britain’s walkers thus far.

At St Hedda’s, at Egton Bridge 
<http://middlesbrough-diocese.org.uk/parishes/st-hedda-egton-bridge/>, we 
marvelled at the extraordinary relics ofNicholas Postgate 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Postgate>, an 82-year-old local priest 
who was hung, drawn and quartered in 1679 for being a little too Catholic. The 
hoard included his tiny crystal cross, a lock of his hair, and an item that can 
only have borne mute testimony against him: a worn wooden rosary.

It was impossible not to feel like pilgrims as we stepped on slabs hollowed by 
the scuffling of medieval wayfarers

The nearby Postgate Inn that bears his name <http://postgateinn.com/> boasts 
an award-winning restaurant, and the food – mine a delicious platter of spicy 
vegetables and raisin chapatis – was some distance from the fare one associates 
with a spiritual odyssey.

The next day did its best to put the “grim” into pilgrimage, with sleet, hail 
and snow. Meanwhile, the mud from all the counties of England seemed to have 
converged in North Yorkshire for some kind of conference. It meant we were 
pitifully grateful for the “trods”: these ancient pannierways, stone blocks 
laid end to end, took us up and over fields and down through pungent carpets of 
wild garlic, transforming themselves into stepping stones to bear us safely 
across thrillingly frisky becks. It was impossible not to feel like pilgrims as 
we stepped on slabs hollowed by the scuffling of medieval wayfarers, and ate 
plum bread fromBotham’s the bakers 
<https://www.botham.co.uk/bakery/bothams-whitby-sleights-shop.html>, in the 
village of Sleights.

By now, the churches were coming thick and fast. St Hilda (more properly St 
Hild) was born in 614 and raised in the court of her uncle, King Edwin. She 
became a celebrated teacher and founder of the first abbey at Whitby. Our 
guidebook included a treasure hunt, so at each church we went scurrying around, 
seeking out stained-glass windows, statues and other Hildarata, while 
attempting to answer such thought-provoking questions as, “What legacy would 
you like to leave for others to follow?”

At St Hilda’s in Sneaton, a plaque bears the legend Post Tempestatem 
Tranquillus (“After the Storm, Peace”). It proved prophetic, for the skies 
cleared soon afterwards as we made our triumphal entry into Whitby, over a 
disused railway viaduct high above the Esk. Weary but buoyed by having 
weathered the deluge like proper pilgrims, we made for our final lodgings, 
Sneaton Castle, an event-venue-cum-super-posh-hostel that conveniently shares 
its charming grounds withSt Hilda’s Priory 
<http://www.ohpwhitby.org.uk/site/the+priory/the+mother+house>. After 
breakfast, we found ourselves amid genial nuns in biscuit-coloured habits, 
congregating in their cheerful, sun-drenched chapel for Sunday service.

 St Mary’s, Whitby. Photograph: Dixe Wills for the Guardian 
Shouldering our packs for the final time, we ambled through Whitby to the 
accompaniment of pealing bells. We mopped up the final churches – atSt Mary’s 
<https://www.achurchnearyou.com/whitby-st-mary/>, the box pews (one reserved 
for the “church maid”), galleries and gargantuan triple-decked pulpit are 
really quite something – to come at last to our journey’s end:Whitby Abbey 
<http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/whitby-abbey/>, that 
prodigious skeletal landmark on the clifftops, Bram Stoker’s eternal hostage.

I have since scrutinised large-scale maps of Easington High Moor and still 
cannot explain how we went awry. I have to conclude that it was St Hilda’s 
doing. The consummate teacher, she is still handing out lessons: to me, in 
humility; to my companion, in forbearance. For both, particularly the latter, I 
am truly thankful.
