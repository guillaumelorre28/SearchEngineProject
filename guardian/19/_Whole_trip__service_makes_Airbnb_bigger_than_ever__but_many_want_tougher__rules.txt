Airbnb <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/airbnb> is taking on the 
tourism industry by offering travellers excursions and experiences hosted by 
locals, an ambitious expansion which will allow people to plan entire trips 
through the home-sharing site.

The redesigned app works for a dozen cities, including London, Los Angeles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles>, San Francisco, Paris, Tokyo 
and Nairobi, and will spread to dozens more next year, and eventually 
thousands, the company said on Thursday.

Offerings include stargazing, surfing, embroidering, food tasting, truffle 
hunting, burlesque dance lessons, mountain biking, samurai-sword classes and 
murder-mystery tours.

Brian Chesky, the company’s CEO, made the announcement at the start of Airbnb 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/airbnb> Open, a three-day gathering of 
employees, hosts and celebrities in Los Angeles. “If you want to travel, you 
basically end up on a research project,” Chesky said. “We want to fix this.”

Brian Chesky unveils Airbnb's next big thing: 'experiences'. Customized tours.

It will create a holistic travel experience, said Chesky. “This is not a tour. 
You participate. You are immersed ... this is literally just the beginning.”

The announcement came at a delicate time for Airbnb. The colossus, valued at 
$30bn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/22/airbnb-valuation-500-million-funding-round>
, is eyeing a stock market debut but a rising tide of regulation and concern 
about the company’s impact on property markets threatens to stall breakneck 
growth. It currently boasts 3m property listings in 191 countries.

Critics say that instead of ordinary people renting out spare rooms in a 
benign cultural and financial exchange, many hosts are commercial operators who 
fuel rent rises, evictions and gentrification – a reality Airbnb allegedly 
blurs bywithholding and massaging data 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/10/airbnb-new-york-city-listings-purge-multiple-apartment-listings>
.

New York last month passed a law to fine residents who rent out apartments for 
illegal short-term stays. San Francisco makes hosts register and can fine 
Airbnb for listing an unregistered property.

The next big battle is in LA, where the city council will soon debate whether 
to toughen rules.

A coalition of tenants, community activists, labour leaders and business 
allies is due to rally outside the company’s jamboree this week to try to 
engage hosts and pressure city authorities.

“We are very concerned at how short term rents are perverting our housing 
market and raising our rents,” said James Elmendorf, of the advocacy group Los 
Angeles Alliance for a New Economy (Laane). “So we are out there educating 
Airbnb hosts about their responsibilities so they’re not just hearing from the 
company.”

Airbnb’s expansion into tours and experiences will open multiple new fronts 
for authorities around the world who are still wrestling with how to tax and 
regulate its short term rentals.

Chesky, who is at 35 one of the world’s youngest billionaires, channelled the 
spirit of Steve Jobs’ Apple product launches in Thursday’s announcement, 
wearing all black and promising transformative change in a slick presentation. 
Employees, plus some of the 200 journalists Airbnb flew in for the event, 
cheered and applauded.

Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashton Kutcher will sprinkle Hollywood glitz when they 
address some of the 7,500 hosts on Saturday.

Chesky billed the company’s move as empowering travelers to connect with other 
people and authentic experiences they would not otherwise have as tourists. The 
presentation showcased hosts including an astro-photographer in LA, a jazz 
pianist in Havana and a lifestyle blogger in Nairobi.

Experiences can last a few hours or several days, said the CEO. Half are 
priced below $200. “Everything powered by people. The magic is in the people.”

Chesky evoked the company’s origin in 2007 when he and co-founder Joe Gebbia 
started hosting people on an airbed in their San Francisco apartment, a 
real-life Silicon Valley fairytale.

defence

“It’s the next really big chapter for us,” Chris Lehane, Airbnb’s head of 
global policy, said. “It has real potential to fundamentally transform how 
travel and tourism works.”

Hosting could be a lifeline for people displaced by robotics and other 
economic forces, said Lehane, a former political adviser to Bill Clinton and Al 
Gore.

Property hosts pay Airbnb a 3% commission. Experience hosts pay 20%. Those who 
signed up during a trial period earlier this year, and attended the LA event, 
lauded the collaboration.

“It’s a boost to my business. I had the structure already,” said Kike Correa, 
26, who takes clients paddleboarding, snorkeling and scuba diving in the 
Florida Keys.

Nicole Biondi, 39, has designed a murder mystery tour in Cape Town, South 
Africa, priced $212, which starts with a hike up Table Mountain. Her first 
Airbnb clients hailed from Peru, Sweden, Ireland and Britain, she said.

Chuck McCarthy, an LA-based actor who supplements his income by walking people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/los-angeles-people-walker-chuck-mccarthy>
, said he was open to becoming a host. “If Airbnb reached out to me as The 
People Walker, I’d definitely think about it.”

The LA gathering includes seminars and workshops with titles like “building 
empathy through community”, “leaps of faith: strategic risk-taking”, “interior 
design tips”, “finding your inner happy host” and “be a 5-star host”. Elizabeth 
Gilbert, the author of Eat, Pray, Love, will give a talk titled “creative 
living beyond fear: traveling with curiosity”.

Airbnb’s ambition and its hosts’ evangelical fervor will dismay detractors who 
accuse the company of driving up rents and ruining neighborhoods by siphoning 
off rental units for tourist hordes, a critique heard inLondon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/29/airbnb-backlash-customers-fight-back-london>
,Amsterdam 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/06/the-airbnb-effect-amsterdam-fairbnb-property-prices-communities>
, Berlin and elsewhere.

In LA, activists say Venice, the city’s bohemian coastal community, is the 
worst affected: an Airbnb hotspot where rents have spiked 39% between 2011 and 
2015.

“Airbnb is used by corporate property buyers who masquerade as property owners 
but are simply creating illegal hotels with no regard for Venice as a 
collection of neighborhoods, filled with neighbors and community,” said Mary 
Anne Thomas, 64, a librarian who is being evicted from the bungalow she shares 
with her husband and dog.

Tourists were often loud and disruptive, said Thomas, standing in her yard. 
People in a neighboring house which towered over the bungalow gazed down as she 
spoke. “Airbnb-ers,” she said.

Airbnb denies worsening housing crises in LA or elsewhere, saying it pays 
taxes which fund low-income housing and provides cash – an average of $7,500 
per year – which helps middle class hosts pay their own rents and mortgages.

“It’s a platform that was created to keep people in their homes,” said Lehane, 
the head of global policy. Gentrification and homelessness had wider, deeper 
causes, he said. “We’re talking about socio-economic trends going back 10 
years.”
