Indie, shoegaze

Fink, singer, DJ and producer: Paris
OK, Paris isn't famous for its music – most indie bands prefer Camden – but if 
you're into expanding your horizons it's much cooler for music than people give 
it credit for.Le Point Ephémère (200 quai de Valmy, pointephemere.org) is a 
little venue that plays good underground bands like Esben and the Witch. Right 
on the canal at Jaurès, the venue is very small but the bands are good. 
Oberkampf is the coolest street when it comes to music and drinks, but tourists 
don't go there.Le Nouveau Casino (109 rue Oberkampf, +33 1 4357 5740, 
nouveaucasion.net <http://www.nouveaucasino.net/>) is a venue that turns into a 
club at weekends. The sound system's good; the bar right next to it,Le Charbon 
(also 109 rue Oberkampf, +33 1 4357 5513), is always packed with trendy people 
as well as local drunks.

A bit higher on rue Moret you've got L'International (5/7 rue Moret, 
linternational.fr <http://www.linternational.fr/>) which is the free gig and 
trendy place in town. It's rough and ready, locals-only, and the bands are 
sometimes rubbish and sometimes surprisingly awesome: She Keeps Bees, or Peter 
Bjorn on the mainstream vibe.

Keep going up Ménilmontant and you'll get a nice view of the town right before 
you turn into rue Boyer. There you haveLa Maroquinerie (23 rue Boyer, +33 1 40 
33 35 05,lamaroquinerie.fr <http://www.lamaroquinerie.fr/>), a tiny venue with 
a courtyard where there is always a gig you wanna see (James Blake did one 
recently, and Foals have too). It's often a band's first gig on their early 
European excursions.
• Fink's (finkworld.co.uk 
<http://www.finkworld.co.uk/2011/04/new-lp-perfect-darkness-summer-2011/>) new 
album, Perfect Darkness, is out on 13 June

Hot Club De Paris: Chicago
Back in 2006 during the strong-pound-against-the-dollar days, we found 
ourselves in a Chicago neighbourhood by the name of Bucktown to make our second 
album (Live at Dead Lake) with native Brian Deck (Modest Mouse, Iron and Wine) 
at his studio, Engine. We'd picked the city because of our obsession with its 
experimental indie rock heritage, and quickly discovered the scene we'd 
romanticised from afar in Blighty was attentive, accepting, committed and 
awesome. Long studio days were generally capped with a quiet drink and a bout 
of guitar perving in Rick Nielsen's (of Cheap Trick) pizza bar,Piece Brewery 
and Pizzeria(1927 W North Ave, +1 773 772 4422, piecechicago.com 
<http://www.piecechicago.com/flash/index.html>).

Party nights involved checking out local gig venues such as the Empty Bottle 
(1035 N Western Ave, +1 773 276 3600,emptybottle.com 
<http://www.emptybottle.com/home.php>) – where we saw Joan of Arc's Tim 
Kinsella and Cryptacize, or heading out to bars like theRainbo Club (1150 N 
Damen Ave, +1 773 489 5999), in the Ukranian Village area, where Chicago's 
alt-aristocracy tend the bar. Audio holidayers should go check out Steve 
Albini's studioElectrical Audio (2621 W Belmont Ave, electrical.com 
<http://www.electrical.com/>) to see where your favourite records were made (he 
recorded albums for Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey), and to see the room where 
Albini creates his famous snare drum sound.

Mark Yarm, grunge blogger and writer: Seattle
In late 1992, a Spin magazine writer declared that Seattle was "to the 
rock'n'roll world what Bethlehem was to Christianity". The religious fervour 
surrounding Seattle has faded in the intervening decades, but there are still 
plenty of shrines in the city for the grunge faithful. A necessary stop is the 
recently opened Nirvana exhibit atExperience Music Project museum (325 Fifth 
Ave N,empsfm.org <http://www.empsfm.org/>), which houses an impressive array of 
relics, including the first guitar Kurt Cobain smashed on stage. About 18km to 
the north, in Shoreline, isLondon Bridge Studio (20021 Ballinger Way NE #A, 
Shoreline,londonbridgestudio.com <http://www.londonbridgestudio.com/>), which 
has just started giving guided tours (by appointment only) of the place where 
the rest of grunge's Big Four – Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains – 
recorded early classics. Keep the spirit of 92 alive by catching a rock show at 
theCrocodile (Alice drummer Sean Kinney is an investor – 2200 Second Ave, +1 
206 441 4618,thecrocodile.com <http://thecrocodile.com/index.html>) or engaging 
in an enduring Seattle scene pursuit – getting drunk – at Hazlewood (2311 NW 
Market St,myspace.com/hazlewoodbar <http://www.myspace.com/hazlewoodbar>) a bar 
co-owned by Soundgarden bassist Ben Shepherd.

Shane Embury, Napalm Death's bassist: Birmingham and the Black Country
Forty years ago, Birmingham and the Black Country spawned one of the greatest 
and most influential British music movements – heavy metal.Black Sabbath 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/blacksabbath>, Judas Priest, Napalm Death 
and Godflesh all hail from there, and this summer there's plenty for metallers 
to see and do.

First point of call: Birmingham's Museum and Art Gallery which this summer has 
a huge exhibition of all things metal, from Black Sabbath's legendary Mob Rules 
stage cross to handwritten Napalm Death lyrics (6 June-25 September, 
Chamberlain Square,bmag.org.uk <http://www.bmag.org.uk/events?id=893>). In 
Walsall'sNew Art Gallery you can catch contemporary artist Mark Titchner's 
metal-inspired exhibition (8 July-10 September, Gallery Square,
thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk <http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/>) 
and check out Judas Priest's original costumes at theWalsall Leather Museum (8 
July-10 September, Littleton Street West,walsall.gov.uk 
<http://www.walsall.gov.uk/leathermuseum>). Head back to Brum for a swift pint 
in our local hangout,Scruffy Murphy's (Birmingham's oldest and best rock pub; 
Newton St, Dale End,scruffymurphys.co.uk <http://www.scruffymurphys.co.uk/>), 
then catch a gig at theCrown (65 Station St), which played host to the famous 
Henry's Blues House, and where Polka Tulk – the band that went on to become 
Black Sabbath – played in their early days.
• Napalm Death's 14th studio album is out in October. Home of Metal takes over
