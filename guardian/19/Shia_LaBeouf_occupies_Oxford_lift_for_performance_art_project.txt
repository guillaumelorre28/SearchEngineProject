The actor Shia LaBeouf <https://www.theguardian.com/film/shia-labeouf> is 
occupying a lift in Oxford with two other performance artists for 24 hours as 
part of his latest project.

LaBeouf and his art collaborators Nastja Säde Rönkkö and Luke Turner will also 
address theOxford <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/oxford> Union on Friday 
evening.

The union said the trio will be occupying the elevator at EC Oxford, an 
English language course centre in Gloucester Green, for a 24-hour stint ending 
at 9am on Saturday. They will leave the elevator for their talk but will return 
afterwards.

A live audio and video feed will be broadcast inside the union debating 
chamber for the duration of the event, which is called #ELEVATE. It is also
being streamed on YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KDW4o6BYUE>.

“Visitors will be able to join LaBeouf, Rönkkö and Turner inside the elevator 
during this time, and are invited to address the artists, the debating chamber, 
and the internet, so that their collective voices may form an extended, 
expansive and egalitarian Oxford Union address,” the union said.

The performance and access to the debating chamber will be free and open to 
the public for the 24 hours.According to the BBC 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-35612864>, LaBeouf told 
students in the lift that he was invited by the union’s president when he was 
involved in an art piece in Liverpool last year, which involved him setting up 
his own call centre.

LaBeouf said: “Stuart the president said ‘Do you want to stand in the same 
spot as Malcolm X?’ Who [...] am I to argue with that?”

The actor said he was expecting students entering the lift to give a 
“performance of monologues”. Reports say he has been asked a range of questions 
including “what’s your favourite Saturday?” and has played a game of “snog, 
marry, avoid”.

LaBeouf, from Los Angeles, has worked with Rönkkö, from Finland, and Turner, 
from the UK, for the past two years. The trio worked onthe 2015 piece 
#ALLMYMOVIES 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/nov/12/shia-labeouf-watches-every-shia-labeouf-movie-back-to-back-video>
, during which LaBeouf livestreamed himself watching every one of his films 
back to back for three days.

In a 2014 artwork called #IAMSORRY, LaBeouf wore a paper bag bearing the 
message “I am not famous any more” over his head. He also sat in a room in a 
Los Angeles art gallery where members of the public could walk in and interact 
with him.

That project proved controversial after it was reported that a woman raped the 
actor 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/30/shia-labeouf-collaborators-turner-ronkko-speak-alleged-rape-iamsorry-art-show>
 during the performance. Following the claims, Rönkkö and Turner said they had 
intervened as soon as they became aware of the incident.
