The environment agency last night warned that the risk of pollution was a 
major problem facing hundreds of people returning to their flood-hit homes.

Residents in Lewes, East Sussex, and people living in villages in the 
Maidstone area of Kent, spent yesterday mopping up as weather experts forecast 
more heavy rain in the early hours of tomorrow.

With up to an inch of rainfall expected, the agency's environmental protection 
teams were checking sewage pumping stations, chemical stores, oil stores and 
farms, all of which were identified as possible sources of contamination. There 
were further warnings that electricity supplies might still be live despite the 
destruction.

Several firefighters received minor shocks while pumping water away from 
properties.

Jo Warburton, agency spokeswoman, said: "All rivers affected are being tested 
for contamination and the agency is liaising with Southern Water and South East 
Water on supplies where drinking water may be at risk."
