Several faces, mottled black and white, glance up as I alight from the car. On 
seeing no dog, theseRough Fells <http://www.roughfellsheep.com/> – burly ewes 
with horns – return to grazing the open fell, unalarmed.

Following the A685 Kendal road south from Tebay in the Lune Gorge, I had 
turned off through woodland of rowan, alder, birch and holly, and parked along 
a byway running for nine miles west towards Shap summit throughthe “other” 
Borrowdale 
<http://where2walk.co.uk/lake_district/away_from_the_crowds/the-other-borrowdale/>
. This is Howgills country, lonely and mysterious and devoid of the crags and 
lakes that bring the tourists to the Borrowdale near Keswick. Yet in a 
reshuffle of the boundaries, it too has recentlybecome part of the Lake 
District national park

“Take a look,” Hilary Wilson had suggested. “Borrowdale is thriving following 
an era of being successfully farmed by generations of Westmorland hill 
farmers.” Her family had farmed the eastern chunk of this Cinderella valley for 
the past 50 years, but they have now sold up as they are near retirement.

A pink sunset draws the eye, illuminating the sky above the little road 
heading west. As well as the Rough Fells nibbling the turf on knolls, 
commercial Charolais-cross cattle are grazing under the shelter of trees along 
the beck. Goldfinches and meadow pipits are flitting everywhere, thriving on 
the insects that in turn prosper from the cattle and sheep droppings.

A buzzard hovers over damp beck-side pasture 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwSIA1LaUUw>, which is speckled with tiny 
cranberry, sphagnum moss, butterwort, sundew and the sky-blue flowers of 
scorpion grass. The raptor soars on over lower meadows planted with thicker and 
stronger ryegrass,a highly nutritious winter feed for the farm animals 
<http://www.ryegrass.com/forage.html>. Hay cut from “finer” flower-bearing 
grasses that look pretty lacks the necessary oomph, according to Mrs Wilson.

“Meow” cries the buzzard and heads for the dry stone wall that guards 
Gillingrass Wood; an example of rewilding long before the term became 
fashionable.
