 after winning a battle to take sole charge of the 115-room grace and favour 
mansion in Kent.

Theresa May originally declared that Chevening would be shared equally between 
Johnson, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Liam Fox, the international 
trade secretary, but Johnson is now the main user and will be there with his 
family for Christmas.

The prime minister’s “house-share

” proposal fell through after the trustees who run Chevening, which was gifted 
to the nation for the use of a cabinet minister or a member of the royal 
family, objected to the idea of three people having joint responsibility for it.

As a result, Johnson, who outranks Davis and Fox in the cabinet pecking order, 
was nominated to be in charge, on the understanding that he would also allow 
his two fellow Brexiters to use it.

Davis and Fox have expressed little interest in using the 17th-century 
mansion, which is set in a 1,415-hectare (3,500-acre) estate.

Speaking at the Conservative party conference in September, Fox said he 
already had a house in his North Somerset constituency “with one of the best 
vistas to look out on” and that he did not need another country house.

May originally wanted the trio to share the house because they all might want 
to use it to host foreign visitors and leaders, Downing Street said in July.
