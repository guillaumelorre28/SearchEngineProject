The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) is urging the government to do more to stop 
pubs from being demolished or closed.

Camra is pushing for ministers to put pubs into a special class so that owners 
must always seek planning permission for a change of use or demolition.

A total of 2,000 pubs have been listed as an asset of community value (ACV), 
but Camrasaid local groups had to spend hours in a lengthy and clunky process

 to save their pubs.

ACVs can be granted on a building with a proven value to a local community, 
such as a library or post office, but pubs have had the biggest takeup since 
legislation was introduced last year.

Colin Valentine, the chairman of Camra, said: “It is heartening that so many 
communities across England have spent so much time going through the process of 
nominating their pub as an asset of community value … This shows a huge 
appetite for protecting pubs, which are more than just businesses – they are 
invaluable landmarks in our communities.

“Unfortunately, the ACV process can be time-consuming, fraught with 
difficulties and, at the end of the day, is only a temporary measure – listings 
must be renewed every five years … All we are asking for is a level playing 
field where a planning application on a pub has to go through the full planning 
process.”

A Department for Communities spokesman said the government had set up a £3.6m 
fund and introduced stronger protections to stop pubs being converted or 
demolished.

“Nominating a pub as an asset of community value gives local people time to 
make decisions about a pub’s future. Once listed as an asset, a full planning 
application is then required, providing an opportunity for local people to have 
a say,” he said.
