Special instructions

The Chambers Dictionary (2014) is recommended. 

Each of the across clues contains a misprint of one letter, always occurring 
in the definition part. Answers should be entered correctly spelt.

Down clues are normal but their answers are to be entered with a misprint of 
one letter only in each, always in a checked position. These misprints 
correspond to the misprints in the across clues, in clue order, i.e. 1 Across/1 
Down, 6 Across/2 Down … 33 Across/28 Down. No more than one letter in any 
across answer forms the misprint in a down entry.
