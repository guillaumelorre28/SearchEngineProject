Manchester United <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> 
have completed the signing of the PSV Eindhoven forward Memphis Depay on a 
four-year contract.

United announced last month they had reached a deal to sign the 21-year-old

 Holland international for £25m.

Depay, who has spent his entire career with PSV, making 124 senior 
appearances, finished as the Dutch league’s top scorer last season with 22 
goals in 30 games as Phillip Cocu’s side wrapped up their first title in seven 
seasons.

“This is a dream come true for me; to play for the biggest club in the world 
and also to have the chance to work with someone who I believe is the best 
manager in the world, Louis van Gaal,” Depay told the club’s website. “I have 
great belief in my ability and I work hard to strive to achieve my dreams.”

Depay, who can play on the left of a front three or as a central striker, 
scored two goals at last year’s World Cup as Holland finished third under the 
guidance of Van Gaal.

“I know Memphis well from our time working together in the Netherlands 
national team,” the United manager said. “He is a young versatile player who 
has the ability to play in a number of different positions.

“It will take time for Memphis to get used to the rhythm of the Premier League 
but I have no doubt that he has the potential to become a great footballer for 
this club and he is at the right club to continue the good work he has done so 
far.”
