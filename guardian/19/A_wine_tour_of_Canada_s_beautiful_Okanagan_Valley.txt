Even to someone accustomed to going round wineries, Mission Hill is just 
jaw-dropping. The 40 specially commissioned sculptures, the 12-storey bell 
tower, the collection of ancient Greek amphorae, the Chagall tapestry … this is 
as grand as a wine experience gets, yet it’s not in the Napa Valley but a 
thousand miles to the north in Canada’s Okanagan Valley.

Wine is booming in the Okanagan. Twenty years ago, there were only 31 wineries 
in the region; now there are over 130. The area is dominated by the 
spectacularly beautiful 135km-long Okanagan lake, which runs from Vernon in the 
north down to the semi-desert region of Osoyoos. It’s even reputed to have its 
own equivalent of the Loch Ness monster, the Ogopogo.

Although not that well-known to overseas tourists, it’s a favourite summer 
holiday spot for Vancouverites and a refuge for Canadians from states such as 
Saskatchewan and Alberta escaping the brutal winter temperatures of the 
midwest. “As soon as you come out here, you feel as if you’re on vacation,” my 
guide told me. “There’s so much to do on the lake – sailing, boating, kayaking 
– or you just pull over and go for a swim.”

 A garden area at Quails’ Gate. 
Ambitious wineries such as Mission Hill and Quails’ Gate have been fuelled by 
a tech industry boom that has brought an increasing number of well-heeled 
millennials to the region. Wineries have always been a plaything for rich 
entrepreneurs like Mission Hill’s Anthony von Mandl but less flamboyant 
estates, such as LaStella and Hester Creek (which has its own chef’s table and 
cookery school), are engaging places, some modelled on Tuscan farmhouses.

The Okanagan, like parts of the neighbouring US states of Oregon and 
Washington, was until recently an undeveloped rural area, dotted with ranches 
and fruit farms, and this tradition can be witnessed at first hand through 
farm-to-plate experiences on estates such as Covert Farms’ sprawling 650 
organic acres.

 Some of the wineries, such as Mission Hill (pictured), have a Tuscan farmhouse 
look. 
This is the only place I’ve been to where you can combine a tasting tour of 
the farm with a wine tasting. Owner Gene Covert, the fourth generation of his 
family to farm the property, drives us around in his pick-up truck, stopping in 
the vineyards for a glass of sparkling “pét-nat” naturally fermented rosé and 
to cram our faces with wild blueberries straight off the bush. From the farm, 
there are hikes up the towering McIntyre Bluff, a 300-metre cliff formed during 
the last ice age. Maybe before, rather than after, the wine tasting, I suggest.

Another much smaller farm, Backyard, does the farm-to-plate thing by running a 
chef’s table and cookery school. It’s owned by chef Chris van Hooydonk, who 
walks us around the heavily laden cherry trees of his two-acre “hobby” orchard 
before cooking us a simple, impeccably sourced lunch matched with local wines. 
All the ingredients are conscientiously name-checked: fat, sweet Red Bay 
scallops, sustainable prawns, organic lentils, home-grown peas and peashoots.

 The local wine washes down some exceptional food at the valley’s wineries such 
as this platter from Quails’ Gate. 
With talent that could easily have made him a shining light in Vancouver, van 
Hooydonk chose to live in the Okanagan, so he can spend more time with his 
family and “cook food I’m excited about that week”. It’s not a cheap meal – 
minimum spend for the dining room is C$500 (£300) – but it can accommodate 10 
people and you can take your own wine. “And I’m there in the kitchen,” says van 
Hooydonk. “A lot of people say they like shaking hands with the person 
preparing the food.”

There’s an individuality to the Okanagan that’s not found in Napa, or even 
Sonoma. Take the tiny Upper Bench Winery & Creamery in Penticton, where UK-born 
Gavin Miller makes the wine and his wife, Shana, an impressive selection of 
cheeses. We can taste the two together, and Gavin’s deep pink rosé is a 
unexpectedly good match with Shana’s punchy Stilton-style King Cole blue.

Upper Bench is just one of a number of wineries along the Naramata Bench, a 
14km ridge that was once part of the lakeshore. From a touring point of view, 
they’re ideal as they’re closely spaced. Practically next door to Upper Bench 
are Poplar Grove, with a showcase tasting room, and its rock’n’roll sibling 
Monster Vineyards – an allusion to the Ogopogo – which has all the urban vibe 
of a downtown Vancouver wine bar.

At biodynamic winery Summerhill in Kelowna, the wines are aged in a 
four-storey replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza, which apparently enhances 
their aroma and clarity and reveals “the knowingness of eternity”. Er … OK. But 
it makes a really rather delicious and multi-award-winning sparkling wine 
called Cipes brut (modestly named after the owner, Stephen Cipes), so maybe 
there’s something in it. I’m not sure I ever reached the “knowingness” of who I 
was, though: there’s a lot of hippy-dippy stuff in the Okanagan.

 Much of the valley, particularly around Osoyoos, is arid enough to require 
irrigation sprinklers. Photograph: Alamy 
At the other end of the valley in Summerland, a funky winery called the 
Okanagan Crush Pad is packed with tulip- and egg-shaped concrete tanks designed 
to bring out the best in the “no-additive, native ferment” wines made for its 
Haywire label and other small producers. As Captain Beefheart pumps out over 
the sound system, a small white fluffy hearth rug in the form of a Great 
Pyrenees puppy called Bijou wanders around the tasting room. They encourage you 
to have a seminar – not just a tasting. Oh, and the winemaker has a beard and 
tattoos. Of course.

As you drive further south, it gets progressively hotter and drier. A large 
part of this southern part of the Okanagan, Canada’s only desert, is owned by 
First Nation Canadians, who farm some 32,000 acres around Osoyoos. They, too, 
have a winery and resort called Nk’Mip (pronounced inkameep), along with an 
absorbing cultural centre which traces the history of the Osoyoos people.

 Nk’Mip resort. Photograph: Fiona Beckett 
Under an invitingly blue sky, I set out on the Nk’Mip walking trail but have 
second thoughts when I see the yellow warning signs: “Be alert: watch for 
rattlesnakes.”

“You rarely see one,” my guide Darlene tells me later, only half convincingly. 
Rarely is too often for me.

This comparatively unspoilt part of the world seems to be particularly rich in 
critters, including black widow spiders (eek!), wild deer and bears. These last 
are a particular hazard for winery owners as they can eat their own weight in 
grapes in one day.

I can’t honestly blame them.
