Costa has endured a below-par season with Chelsea despite finding the net 16 
times and after suffering a hamstring injury in Chelsea‚Äôs 1-1 draw with 
Liverpool earlier this month, Guus Hiddink admitted he was unsure if the 
Brazil-born forward would recover in time for next month‚Äôs tournament in France.

He was also left out of the Spain squad in March for friendlies with Italy and 
Romania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/18/spain-diego-costa-left-out-squad>
 and Del Bosque, speaking at the announcement of his squad, confirmed he was 
not prepared to risk Costa, who scored just one goal in qualifying, or 
Arsenal‚Äôs Santi Cazorla, who made his return from a long-term knee injury for 
Arsenal on Sunday.

‚ÄúWe have weighed everything up,‚Äù Del Bosque was quoted as saying by ESPN. ‚ÄúWe 
do not want to call up too many people with doubts over their fitness. The 
Cazorla situation is very like Diego‚Äôs ‚Äì he has been out five months, made a 
great effort to be ready, but we can‚Äôt have many doubts.‚Äù

Mata meanwhile has paid the price for a recent dip in form for Manchester 
United, who have effectively missed out on a place in the top four, while Del 
Bosque‚Äôs decision to omit Torres, whose form has improved in Atl√©tico Madrid‚Äôs 
run to the Champions League final, leavesSpain
