Damien Delaney expects the Sam Allardyce effect to ensure Crystal Palace 
remain in the Premier League but admitted there is still plenty of work to be 
done after allowing Watfordto rescue a point at Vicarage Road on Boxing Day

.

Yohan Cabaye’s first‑half goal had given Palace a 1-0 lead but Delaney’s tug 
on Sebastian Prödl cost them dear when Troy Deeney converted from the penalty 
spot for his 100thWatford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> goal.

It was a disappointing ending to what had been a much-improved performance 
from Palace, who sacked Alan Pardew and replaced him with the former England 
manager last week. The result left Palace two points ahead of Sunderland in 
18th spot with a trip to Arsenal on New Year’s Day to come.

Delaney believes Allardyce’s arrival will galvanise a squad who won only six 
league matches in 2016. “If the club was going to make a change I suppose there 
was only one man you would want to get the job,” he said. “It’s happened early 
enough in the season for him to come in and get his points across. Hopefully we 
can move up the table. It’s a point and a start in the right direction.

“We haven’t had long with him but you can see we were a bit more resilient and 
looked better. A draw is difficult to take when you are winning but we have to 
be happy with a point. He will bring resilience and good organisation like he 
has done with all his teams. He will give us that and with the firepower we 
have in our side, hopefully we will be OK.”

Despite calls from Allardyce for the Football Association to take action 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/27/sam-allardyce-watford-mascot-harry-hornet-out-of-order>
 against Watford’s mascot Harry the Hornet because he appeared to mock Wilfried 
Zaha by diving on the ground after the final whistle, it is understood the 
governing body will not be pursuing the matter further.

Zaha was incensed after being booked for diving by Mark Clattenburg despite 
video evidence appearing to suggest the winger was caught by the Watford 
centre-back Miguel Britos. Allardyce said the mascot was “out of order” for his 
reaction.

“It’s unnecessary really. He is the mascot so I don’t understand why he is 
getting involved in that,” Delaney said. “Maybe he thinks he is more important 
than he is. For a mascot to be doing that, it’s uncalled for.”
