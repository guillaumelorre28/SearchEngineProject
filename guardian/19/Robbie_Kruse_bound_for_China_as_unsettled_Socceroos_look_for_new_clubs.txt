Socceroos forward Robbie Kruse is set to join the growing list of 
international players moving to China after telling Bayer Leverkusen he wants 
out.

The German Bundesliga club won’t stand in his way amid reports he is in talks 
to join Liaoning Whowin in the lucrative Chinese Super League.

Kruse’s agent has confirmed to Leverkusen he is looking to continue his career 
elsewhere after limited game time at the club this season.

“He has a good character. We won’t put stones in his way,” club boss Michael 
Schade told express.de.

The 28-year-old Kruse has made three appearances for Leverkusen this season, 
including coming off the bench in last month’s 3-0 win over Monaco in the 
Champions League. But he has not made an appearance in the Bundesliga.

He has a total of 34 appearances for the club in an injury-interrupted stay 
since joining in 2013.

Kruse, who has 48 caps for the Socceroos, will join fellow Australians Dario 
Vidosic and Michael Thwaite at Liaoning Whowin if the transfer is done.

The midfielder could line up against Argentina star Carlos Tevez in China, who 
joined Shanghai Shenhua from Boca Juniors in a big-money move, and Brazilian 
Oscar, who left English Premier League side Chelsea for Shanghai SIPG.

Other recent arrivals in China include Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel (Tianjin 
Quanjian), Italy striker Graziano Pelle (Shandong Luneng) and Argentine 
Ezequiel Lavezzi (Hebei China Fortune).

Elsewhere, fellow Socceroo Bailey Wright is believed to be about to join 
Championship side Bristol City, after falling out of automatic first-team 
selection at Preston North End.
