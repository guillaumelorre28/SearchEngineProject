Insurer group Prudential has completed the sale of its loss-making internet 
bank Egg for £546m in cash toCitigroup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/citigroup>, nearly £30m less than it 
expected to get in January.

 Britain's second-biggest insurer agreed to sell Egg for £575m four months ago 
but because of a slide in the bank's net asset value between December 31 and 
completion of the deal, the sale fetched less than the Pru hoped.

 Collins Stewart analyst Tim Young said the reduced sale price "looks very 
sloppy, given that £575m was not excessive and will put [Prudential] chief 
executive Mark Tucker under greater pressure."

 The sale follows three years of on-off attempts to sell the web bank and 
values the business at almost half the £900m price tag the Pru put on it last 
year when it bought out minority shareholders. At the time the insurer pledged 
to integrate it into the wider group. In January it said it was selling Egg 
because its losses were widening.
