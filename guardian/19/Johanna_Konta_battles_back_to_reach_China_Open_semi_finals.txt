The 25-year-old 11th seed is aiming to force her way into contention for the 
WTA Finals in Singapore later this month and she certainly looked to be on a 
mission against Zhang, ranked 36 in the world.

Play was briefly held up on set point in the first as a spectator made their 
way back to their seat, and there subsequently appeared to be some concern over 
the pressure of the balls being used.

But there was little stopping Konta, who will now meet American Madison Keys 
in the last four.

Keys, seeded eight, earlier beat the 14th-seeded Czech Petra Kvitova 6-3, 6-7 
(2-7), 7-6 (7-5).
