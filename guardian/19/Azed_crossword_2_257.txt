Apart from 1 Across, which is normal, each clue is really two clues, side by 
side but not overlapping, the answers to which are to be entered in the two 
similarly numbered spaces in the diagram, either side of the central vertical 
bold line. Either word may be clued first, and the division is not necessarily 
marked by punctuation. Solvers must determine which goes where. The individual 
clues forming part of each double clue may not make much sense. Competitors 
should submit with their solutions a double clue to replace the asterisked 
definitions at 11 Across (which are presented in alphabetical order of their 
solutions).

Â£25 in book tokens for the first three correct solutions opened. Solutions 
postmarked no later than Saturday toAZED No. 2,257, The Observer, 90 York Way, 
London N19GU.
