The streets of downtown Reykjavik peel away from the stunning Hallgrímskirkja 
church and, on one of them, at Skólavörðustíg 15, is an innocuous shop frontage 
– 12 Tónar. Sitting centrally in the Venn diagram of necessities for many 
young(ish) urbanites, this store has the best of Icelandic music – and coffee.

It sounds like a utopian Scandi cliché. Genial audiophiles-cum-baristas 
advocate the wonder of vinyl and blended roasts, while Icelanders deliver niche 
music recommendations with impeccable accents and grammar in their second 
language. Both the staff and customers of 12 Tónar are effortlessly dressed, 
cultured and articulate.

 An impromptu performance inside 12 Tonar 
But this place feels anything but contrived. It’s just another of the joys 
that this fascinating island delivers without arrogance. Also operating as an 
independent record label, 12 Tónar has been a hub for music makers, such as 
Bedroom Community, Sigur Rós andBjörk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/25/bjork-royal-albert-hall-vulnicura-review>
, for many years; and it’s one of those music shops that is staffed by people 
just as passionate about the local music and arts scene as the musicians 
themselves.

My stumble into 12 Tónar began with an expertly made espresso – and ended with 
me parting with more króna than planned for, buying music I had never heard 
before, thanks to the passion and knowledge of the shop staff. Perusing the 
many lesser-known local artists it stocks is a lesson in the fascinating 
panorama of this island’s creative musicians, and this shop is a reminder of 
the warmth and good nature of the people who reside here.
