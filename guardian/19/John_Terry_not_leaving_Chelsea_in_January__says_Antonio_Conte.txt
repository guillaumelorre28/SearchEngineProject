Antonio Conte <https://www.theguardian.com/football/antonio-conte> says John 
Terry will not leave Chelsea during the January transfer window and that the 
club captain has not mentioned the interest Bournemouth have expressed in him.

Conte has recalled Nathan Aké from a loan spell at Bournemouth, a decision 
that the manager says “makes me more calm, also in the market in January”, and 
he has another centre-half, Kurt Zouma, back to fitness after an 11-month 
layoff.

With César Azpilicueta, David Luiz and Gary Cahill established as the first 
choices in the back three, Terry’s prospects have come to look bleak. He made 
his first appearance in two months against Peterborough United in the FA Cup 
victory last Sunday only to be sent off, meaning he is suspended for the trip 
to Leicester City on Sunday.

Terry is out of contract in the summer and there has been no indication Chelsea
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are prepared to offer him new 
terms. Eddie Howe, the Bournemouth manager – on the back of losing Aké – made a 
speculative inquiry this week to see whether there was be any chance of taking 
Terry this month.

However, the move has seemingly failed to turn the 36‑year‑old’s head, with 
Conte maintaining he wanted to keep a player who, even when he is not in the 
team, is an inspiration in the dressing room. “Honestly, no,” Conte said, when 
asked whether there had been a conversation between him and Terry about 
Bournemouth.

“And with John, I speak every day. John never talked to me about this 
situation and it means he is very happy to stay here and, above all, I am very 
happy John stays here and helps me.

“John is an important player for me – if he plays or doesn’t play – because 
he’s a really important man in the changing room. This squad needs him. He’s a 
great player but also a great man and for me it’s fantastic to have a person 
like him to help me in my first season at Chelsea. I repeat, John stays with 
us. He is our player, he is in my squad.”

Conte added he saw Terry as management material. “When he decides to finish 
his career, he could have a good prospect to start a new career as a manager. 
He is clever and really good at understanding situations. But [only] when he is 
finished. For now, leave him to play.”
