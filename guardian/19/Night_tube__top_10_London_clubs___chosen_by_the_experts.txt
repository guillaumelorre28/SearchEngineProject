Village Underground, Shoreditch

“The tube carriages on the roof; the ever-changing mural on the wall outside; 
the exposed brickwork and giant skylights; that green room. There are several 
features that make Village Underground one of the capital’s most distinctive 
spaces. Of course, there are some venues where ‘charm’ or ‘character’ (grot, 
basically) prevail over the alcohol company-sponsored, homogenised hegemony of 
nightclubs all over the planet. But VU is neither – salubrious yet louche. The 
team that runs the place are perhaps the nicest, warmest family of people 
behind any venue in this city, and in my opinion, the security team there is 
the best; the iron fist in the velvet glove, correctly executed. But for me, 
it’s about the people who go there. It’s a beautifully colourful cross-section 
of London’s revelling tribes: hipsters, fashionistas, voguers, goths, privates, 
choisers, geriatrics, Zoroastrians, Beliebers … all are welcome, and 
ostensibly, all attend. This eclectic roll call reflects the venue’s 
programming. A little something for everyone in a time when it is vital for our 
nightclubs to offer more.”

“Corsica Studios has to be the best club in London: it showcases world-class 
artists in two (sometimes three) contrasting rooms on an incredible 
Funktion-One sound system. It’s the only place I’ve always kept going to for 
all the time I’ve lived here. There’s a broad crowd that goes, but the common 
theme is that everyone has a passion for music. Room one is my favourite booth 
to play. You feel like you’re in a treehouse overlooking people’s heads and 
seeing arms punch the air, but I’ve had my best dancefloor experiences in the 
darker, murkier room two. It’s intimate and moody and feels like you’re at a 
wicked house party when it really gets going. The smoking area deserves a 
mention as it’s a complete vibe! You pop out for a bit of air and end up 
bumping into loads of friendly faces. I’ve caught blinding sets from Dynamo 
Dreesen, Veronica Vasicka, Lee Gamble, Mick Wills and more recently Jlin there, 
and Kyle Hall’s album launch party in 2013 was a highlight. I remember charging 
around with my mates to electrifying music and feeling pure elation. Bonds were 
definitely strengthened that night. I’m back at Corsica Studios next month, 
playing for the Discwoman x Find Me In The Dark collaboration; it’s going to be 
special.”

“I like a club to be dark, kitsch and naughty, and Metropolis has all of that 
in abundance. It’s in unassuming Bethnal Green; strippers gyrate for 
businessmen amid the neon lights Mondays through Thursdays, then on Fridays and 
Saturdays it transforms into a gay club. The girls are replaced by bearded drag 
queens in jockstraps on the poles. Saturdays is the disco night Savage, the 
crowd is the coolest you’ll find in London. The line down the street makes it 
the modern equivalent of Studio 54 and inside it looks like a sweaty music 
video. It’s a three-storey pumping pleasure palace where every room is themed. 
There’s even a beach on the top floor with cabanas and real sand – try finding 
that in a club anywhere else. In a city where money talks and the conversation 
can be so bland, this place serves up the craziest nights out.”

“Our favourite place to play at the moment is the Pickle Factory, where we 
hold our monthly All Night Long parties. It’s an intimate, 200-capacity venue, 
with a killer D&B sound system, great staff and all the right components to 
create a special atmosphere. The layout has the right balance, so that there’s 
always a great connection with the crowd. We seem to attract quite a few 
‘heads’ there too, that are keen to hear us dig deeper and hear some of the 
more obscure records in our collection that you are bound to dust off for a 
long set.”

“I’m a big fan of this place. It has a capacity of around 500, has a big 
square dancefloor and is out of the way enough for it to have become a 
destination dance – so everyone in the building is there for the right reasons. 
The sound is great, staff and security are lovely and its bookings are 
fantastic. Ostgut Ton, Body Hammer, Trilogy Tapes have all thrown parties 
there, and to declare an interest – I also run a sporadic gay rave called 
Chapter 10 at Bloc. One thing that makes the club work for me, is that there’s 
a window on the dancefloor that frames Anish Kapoor’s Olympic sculpture – just 
across the river Lea behind it – which adds nice sunrise drama.”

“Brilliant Corners is more of a listening experience than a club, but it’s a 
lovely one. An impressive roll call of selectors play vinyl-only, in a 
well-attenuated room on an old analogue sound system and through vintage 
Klipschorn speakers. Last time I was there Ade Fakile was spinning records. 
There are similarities between Plastic People and Brilliant Corners: the 
intrepid programming, the darkened dancefloor and cocoon-like quality to the 
space – and that night it truly felt like the Plastic People legacy lived on. 
One of the best things about Brilliant Corners is that it always seems to be 
packed when you want it to be, but there’s always room to pull up a stool at 
the bar and nurse one of its natural cocktails. That and its fine Japanese food 
selection. One of the few places in London I wish I’d opened myself.”

“Bussey Building and Rye Wax (below it) in Peckham are my joint favourites. 
The Bussey Building, tucked away down an alleyway off Rye Lane is an old 
warehouse that has become the creative hub of south London. It recently came 
under threat from building development next door but the community came 
together and the developers withdrew the application – unprecedented in an age 
of clubs closing down (Power Lunches, Dance Tunnel). It shows just how 
important it is to the local area. It doesn’t just hold parties either: it 
plays host to workshops, theatre and cinema. It has also hosted legends such as 
the Egyptian Lover and Lee Bannon; the latter played obscure music as his alias 
Dedekind Cut at ‘As Below, So Above’. That particular night sees Rye Wax DJs 
team up with propulsive promotor types to ‘take you on a series of ‘journeys’ 
across many sonic soundscapes’. Rye Wax is one of the few small venues left in 
London where you can hear truly exciting music made by people who live around 
the corner or across the globe. It’s seen some of the most important parties in 
London, such as new wave of grime enthusiasts Boxed and SIREN – the all-female 
techno crew. Last time I DJd for Converge they let me pick the lighting too – 
neon pink Drive vibes, obvs. The bouncers deserve an honourable mention for 
being amazingly friendly – it’s not often you get waltzed around the stage by a 
bouncer during Ce Ce Rogers Someday at 4am.”

“I’m biased because it’s where I hold my club night, Tropical Waste, but The 
Waiting Room in Stoke Newington is one of my favourite London clubs. It’s an 
intimate basement space and the atmosphere gets real hot and heady, kind of 
like a house party but with bleeding-edge DJs. We turn the lights down low and 
put the DJ booth on the floor, so whoever’s playing is basically in the crowd. 
Everyone’s in it together and this wonderful, frenetic energy gets created. 
Everyone we’ve booked has played a blinder, but recent sets from RP Boo, GAIKA 
and KABLAM will go down in the history of the venue, as well as the time that 
Björk turned up and drank the bar dry of champagne.”

Cafe Oto, Dalston
 Photograph: Tim Ferguson/Encosion 
“Although not strictly a club, over the past few years my most captivating 
experiences with electronic music at have been at Cafe Oto. It’s an intimate, 
laid-back bar and music venue that favours experimental, genre-elastic 
bookings. Audiences are more likely to sit on the floor in concentration, 
clutching a red wine, than they are to shake wildly (although I’ve seen both). 
But that respectful silence creates an intensity. It has suited Anthony Child 
improvising on his Buchla synth, Harmonious Thelonius punishing the room with a 
tiny box, Rabih Beaini DJing obscure Lebanese records and I’ve been hypnotised 
by Dalhous, Karen Gwyer, Ricardo Donoso, Gigi Masin, Colin Potter, Guido Zen 
and Not Waving, among so many others. Sitting down is the new dancing.”

“My heart lies with Studio 338, which sadly burnt down recently, but my second 
favourite club has to be Ministry Of Sound. A club’s layout always makes a big 
difference and I like how as you walk in you’re in the 103 Bar where you can 
either dance or grab a drink. There is always something different in each room, 
but the best room for me has to be The Box and the surround sound system is 
amazing, which really adds to the experience. I alway enjoy coming here to 
party and even play, although I haven’t had the pleasure of playing in The Box 
yet, which I would love to crack! Some of my favourite parties are held here, 
Groove Odyssey is always special and I definitely hold special memories from 
there, dancing with my family and favourite people. I also love the fact that 
in the VIP area, there are three little jars on the table each with different 
snacks: Skittles, peanuts and Chocolate Eclairs (which I always end up eating). 
When the older generation DJs play, they play on an analogue mixer, which makes 
House music sound at its best. It’s also rare that I go to a club and they play 
my favourite track The Braxtons – The Boss (original by Diana Ross) but 
whenever I go to Ministry Of Sound for one of my favourite parties, I hear it 
and I end up in my element.”
