 Hiking down the Grand Canyon from the south rim. Photograph: Scott Temme 
It may come second in terms of total visitors but it’s number one for sheer 
grandeur. Both the north and south rims have campsites, cabins and hotel rooms 
but the most unusual place to stay is at the bottom of the canyon at Phantom 
Ranch. Accessible only by foot, mule or raft, this bolthole has been welcoming 
travellers since the 1920s. Reserve a private cabin or a bed in the bunkhouse 
and enjoy a steak or stew at the historic canteen restaurant as a reward for 
hiking the seven miles from the south rim.

 Moraine Park Campground. Photograph: Denis Leblanc/Outdoor Project 
The mountains stretch from northern New Mexico all the way to Canada and this 
stretch, near Estes Park, protects a small pristine pocket of alpine habitat 
north-west of Denver. One of the best places to stay is Moraine Park 
Campground, 2½ miles south of the Beaver Meadows entrance. It’s a picturesque 
place to begin acclimatising to the high altitude of the site (2,487 metres). 
It is open year round and reservations are recommended in the summer.

 Lounge at the Majestic Yosemite hotel. 
The Majestic Yosemite 
<https://www.nationalparkreservations.com/lodge/yosemite-ahwahnee-hotel/>, 
formerly the Ahwahnee, is one of the service’s showcase hotels, built in its 
signature rustic style from native stone, wood and plenty of windows to frame 
the famous towering granite walls. But, at $500 a night, it’s beyond the budget 
of most visitors. Instead, head to Camp 4. This walk-in, tents-only campsite 
has been climbers’ preferred basecamp for decades – the nine-metre-high 
Columbia Boulder is at the edge of the site and boasts several challenging 
climbing routes, including the iconic Midnight Lightning.

 Old Faithful Inn, Yellowstone. Photograph: Alamy 
Built in 1904, Yellowstone’s Old Faithful Inn (named after the famous geyser, 
just a stone’s throw away), is another historic lodge built in the rustic 
style. This is the largest log hotel in the world and, some say, the world’s 
largest standing log structure. Above the multistorey lobby, a series of 
stairways and catwalks lead into the Crow’s Nest, a tree-house-like perch where 
musicians used to play for guests. Old Faithful’s regular eruptions can be 
viewed from the front porch.

This is one of the few places in the world where it’s possible to hike from a 
sandy beach, through a rainforest to a glacier-covered peak. After exploring 
all of these diverse ecological zones, soak aching muscles at the Sol Duc Hot 
Springs Resort. These natural springs along the Sol Duc river in the north-west 
of the park were used by Native Americans long before the resort was built in 
the early 1900s. Today, there are three pools, ranging in temperature from 
37-40C.

Once you set eyes on the Tetons, you may not want to close them, even to 
sleep. But to enjoy all the activities that the valley of Jackson Hole and the 
range have to offer, it’s best to sleep inside the park, on the shores of Jenny 
lake, where you’ll wake up to the mountains in their full glory, across the 
water. Get closer to those dramatic peaks by boat, bike, or on foot. Kayak and 
canoe rentals are available atJenny Lake Boating 
<http://www.jennylakeboating.com/> or hop on the bike path that runs past the 
campsite. It circles the lake and connects to the popular Cascade Canyon trail 
to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point.

This park is on twin-lobed Mount Desert island, off Maine’s scenic and rugged 
coastline. Three campsites are the only places to stay inside its boundaries: 
two are on the main island and another’s on Isle au Haut, reached by ferry. To 
rent a seaside cabin or holiday home, the Cranberry Isles, to the south of the 
main island, are home to thriving communities of mariners, lobstermen and 
artists.

 The Many Glacier Hotel on Swiftcurrent Lake. Photograph: Alamy 
It’s easy to see how this park got its nickname as the Switzerland of North 
America when you look at the chalet architecture and alpine setting of the Many 
Glacier hotel. On the shores of Swiftcurrent lake in the east of the park, Many 
Glacier is reached by driving north on the scenic Going-to-the-Sun road. From 
the hotel there are pontoon boat trips across the lake, canoes to rent and 
hiking trails to the Grinnell glacier.
