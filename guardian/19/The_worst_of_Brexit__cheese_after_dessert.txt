I am nearly 92, half-blind and not on Facebook, nor do I tweet or twitter and 
am not a member of the ruling class. But I want somehow to express my 
astonishment and delight that a senior politician (and a Tory at that!) should 
at last have spoken the truth about our relations with Saudi Arabia and other 
“puppeteers” of that region (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/08/boris-johnson-allies-line-up-to-defend-him-over-saudi-arabia-comments>
, 9 December). Well done, Boris Johnson!

• “Post truth” looks like providing a fitting end to 2016. Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> gets a job by telling lies and may 
well lose it by telling the truth.

• As a Labour supporter for over 40 years, I don’t want Momentum or Jeremy 
Corbyn saved (Momentum is a beacon of hope

• When I voted to remain in the EU, it was not with the intention of allowing 
the food industry (Assurance needed for food industry workers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/08/eu-workers-in-food-and-drink-industry-need-assurance-over-brexit>
, Letters, 9 December) to continue to exploit cheap, sorry, “highly flexible”, 
migrant labour.

• I find two Christmas presents never pall (Gaby Hinsliff, 9 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/09/peak-stuff-christmas-shopping>
): red wine, which I can consume large quantities of; and novels which I can 
give to charity shops after reading. Keeps Christmas simple; note to friends 
and family.

• Let’s not forget that Letchworth (Letters, 7 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/06/why-letchworths-cranks-deserve-our-thanks>
) is home to the UK’s first roundabout. Where would Milton Keynes have been 
without it?

• Peter Vaughan’s obituary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/06/peter-vaughan-obituary> 
(7 December) didn’t mention he was Rab C Nesbitt’s father-in-law.
