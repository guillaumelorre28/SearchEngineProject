Wall Street is failing to match the City’s lead.

Shares are dropping back, so the Dow Jones is down almost 100 points at 
19,847. That suggests that the Dow is not going to hit the 20,000 mark today. 
At least that gives us something to watch out for tomorrow.

This is what I was banging on about earlier -- the FTSE 100 is actually down 
6% this year if you measure it in US dollars (rather than up 13% in pounds).

The London stock market’s rally has helped to drive up the wealth of the 
richest in society, as well as boosting the value of pension funds and other 
asset managers.

Indeed, 2016 has been a vintage year for the ultra-rich - despite the backlash 
against populism this year (or perhaps helping to trigger it).

Bloomberg has calculated that the world’s billionaires are ending the year 
owning $237 billion more than on January 1st. Some of the most famous, 
including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, did particularly well – so it’s nice 
to remember that they’re donating much of their wealth to charity.

It was a turbulent year, though, with the US election, the Brexit vote, and 
various other shocks and panics meaning fortunes fluctuated over the last 12 
months.

With excellent timing, Bloomberg’s JP Spinetto has highlighted how the British 
pound has been one of the worst-performing currencies this year.

Sterling has shed 17%, which puts the 13% jump in the FTSE 100’s value this 
year into some context.

With just two trading days to go, the City’s mining sector in on track for its 
best year the aftermath of the financial crisis.

The Telegraph’s Tara Cunningham explains:

London-listed miners are poised for their biggest annual gain since 2009 as 
firmer oil and commodity prices pushed the sector higher.

So far this year, the FTSE 350 mining index has rallied by 102%.

City traders often talk about a “Santa Rally” this time of year, and once 
again the markets have provided.

David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading group XTB, explains:

“Observers of the markets have for many years noticed a strong propensity for 
stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and the New Year and this 
phenomenon appears to be playing out once more.”

(thanks to the Press Association for the quote).

Today’s FTSE 100 record high 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/28/housebuilder-bovis-profit-warning-december-slowdown-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-5863e923e4b05c6a81b1572d#block-5863e923e4b05c6a81b1572d>
 comes 20 months after the previous historic closing level.

That closing high, in April 2015, was followed by a sharp summer selloff 
triggered by fears over China’s economy.

This was compounded by concerns of a global slowdown in December 2015 when the 
US central bank raised interest rates for the first time in a decade.

But shares then recovered from February this year, and even the Brexit vote 
was only a blip in the FTSE’s march back over 7100 points.

Footsie up 12% since Brexit vote, but....

Today’s rally means the FTSE 100 is now 12% higher than on the day of the EU 
referendum in June.

That means that the value of Britain’s biggest listed companies jumped by 12% 
in sterling terms since the vote.

But... the pound is down by 10% against the euro since June, and around 17% 
weaker against the US dollar.

FTSE 100 hits record closing high

NEWSFLASH: Britain’s stock market has hit its new all-time closing high, 
driven by strong gains in the mining sector.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 just closed 37 points higher at 7106.08, beating the 
7103.98 point mark set in April 2015.

*U.K.'S FTSE 100 RISES 0.5% TO CLOSE AT A RECORD
 <https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/814148082074091520> December 28, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/814148082074091520> 
Mining companies drove the rally, on hopes of robust US economic growth next 
year. That sent the prices of copper, oil, etc up today, along with precious 
metals producers.

Silver miner Fresnillo and gold producer Randgold both gained around 5% today, 
followed byBHP Billiton (+4.2%) and Rio Tinto (+3.3%).

Internationally focused companies also benefitted from the weaker pound today, 
as it makes their exports more competitive.


 However, housebuilding shares suffered following this morning’s profit 
warning from Bovis Homes (which ended down 5.2%).


Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says London’s traders came back 
from Christmas with “a festive bounce in their step”.

The FTSE 100 is the star performer today, helped on its way higher by an 
excellent turn from the index’s mining contingent. The sector was one of the 
really big winners in 2016, making a remarkable comeback over the past twelve 
months, and it makes sense to think that investors are looking to juice a few 
more points out of the rally as the year-end approaches. Meanwhile, Bovis Homes 
is down over 5%, dragging the housebuilder sector with it, as it issues an 
unexpected warning on completion levels.

It is always tough to issue a profit warning, but doubly so in the fallow 
period between Christmas and the New Year. The sector has gone from being a 
star performer in recent years to one of the hardest hit since Brexit; miners 
were the contrarian play for 2016, so the same could be said of a housing 
sector still supported by healthy demand and constricted supply.

As flagged earlier, though, there is one proviso -- the FTSE 100 is priced in 
sterling, so today’s record high has not been adjusted for the fall in sterling 
since the Brexit vote.

level in late trading.

The index is up 31 points at 7099, having earlier burst over its record 
closing level (7103.98).

So we might get a new record high in around 30 minutes....

Right, that’s all for today.

Here’s my news story about the FTSE 100 hitting a new record high tonight, for 
anyone just tuning in.

FTSE 100 soars to new closing high

I’ll be back tomorrow for more live coverage of events in the markets and the 
world economy. Thanks, and goodnight (and enjoy the holidays, if you’re not 
back at work yet...). GW
 
Wall Street is failing to match the City’s lead.

Shares are dropping back, so the Dow Jones is down almost 100 points at 
19,847. That suggests that the Dow is not going to hit the 20,000 mark today. 
At least that gives us something to watch out for tomorrow.
 
This is what I was banging on about earlier -- the FTSE 100 is actually down 
6% this year if you measure it in US dollars (rather than up 13% in pounds).

The London stock market’s rally has helped to drive up the wealth of the 
richest in society, as well as boosting the value of pension funds and other 
asset managers.

Indeed, 2016 has been a vintage year for the ultra-rich - despite the backlash 
against populism this year (or perhaps helping to trigger it).

Bloomberg has calculated that the world’s billionaires are ending the year 
owning $237 billion more than on January 1st. Some of the most famous, 
including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, did particularly well – so it’s nice 
to remember that they’re donating much of their wealth to charity.

It was a turbulent year, though, with the US election, the Brexit vote, and 
various other shocks and panics meaning fortunes fluctuated over the last 12 
months.

With excellent timing, Bloomberg’s JP Spinetto has highlighted how the British 
pound has been one of the worst-performing currencies this year.

Sterling has shed 17%, which puts the 13% jump in the FTSE 100’s value this 
year into some context.

With just two trading days to go, the City’s mining sector in on track for its 
best year the aftermath of the financial crisis.

The Telegraph’s Tara Cunningham explains:

London-listed miners are poised for their biggest annual gain since 2009 as 
firmer oil and commodity prices pushed the sector higher.

So far this year, the FTSE 350 mining index has rallied by 102%.

rallied since June:

City traders often talk about a “Santa Rally” this time of year, and once 
again the markets have provided.

David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading group XTB, explains:

“Observers of the markets have for many years noticed a strong propensity for 
stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and the New Year and this 
phenomenon appears to be playing out once more.”

Today’s FTSE 100 record high 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/28/housebuilder-bovis-profit-warning-december-slowdown-brexit-fears-business-live?page=with:block-5863e923e4b05c6a81b1572d#block-5863e923e4b05c6a81b1572d>
 comes 20 months after the previous historic closing level.

That closing high, in April 2015, was followed by a sharp summer selloff 
triggered by fears over China’s economy.

This was compounded by concerns of a global slowdown in December 2015 when the 
US central bank raised interest rates for the first time in a decade.

But shares then recovered from February this year, and even the Brexit vote 
was only a blip in the FTSE’s march back over 7100 points.
The FTSE 100 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-28T16:44:06/embed.html>
 The FTSE 100 over the last two years  
Today’s rally means the FTSE 100 is now 12% higher than on the day of the EU 
referendum in June.

That means that the value of Britain’s biggest listed companies jumped by 12% 
in sterling terms since the vote.

But... the pound is down by 10% against the euro since June, and around 17% 
weaker against the US dollar.

 
NEWSFLASH: Britain’s stock market has hit its new all-time closing high, 
driven by strong gains in the mining sector.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 just closed 37 points higher at 7106.08, beating the 
7103.98 point mark set in April 2015.

*U.K.'S FTSE 100 RISES 0.5% TO CLOSE AT A RECORD
 <https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/814148082074091520> December 28, 
2016 <https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/814148082074091520> 
Mining companies drove the rally, on hopes of robust US economic growth next 
year. That sent the prices of copper, oil, etc up today, along with precious 
metals producers.

Silver miner Fresnillo and gold producer Randgold both gained around 5% today, 
followed byBHP Billiton (+4.2%) and Rio Tinto (+3.3%).

Internationally focused companies also benefitted from the weaker pound today, 
as it makes their exports more competitive.


 However, housebuilding shares suffered following this morning’s profit 
warning from Bovis Homes (which ended down 5.2%).


Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says London’s traders came back 
from Christmas with “a festive bounce in their step”.

The FTSE 100 is the star performer today, helped on its way higher by an 
excellent turn from the index’s mining contingent. The sector was one of the 
really big winners in 2016, making a remarkable comeback over the past twelve 
months, and it makes sense to think that investors are looking to juice a few 
more points out of the rally as the year-end approaches. Meanwhile, Bovis Homes 
is down over 5%, dragging the housebuilder sector with it, as it issues an 
unexpected warning on completion levels.

It is always tough to issue a profit warning, but doubly so in the fallow 
period between Christmas and the New Year. The sector has gone from being a 
star performer in recent years to one of the hardest hit since Brexit; miners 
were the contrarian play for 2016, so the same could be said of a housing 
sector still supported by healthy demand and constricted supply.

As flagged earlier, though, there is one proviso -- the FTSE 100 is priced in 
sterling, so today’s record high has not been adjusted for the fall in sterling 
since the Brexit vote.
 
Right, the FTSE 100 has entered its closing auction.....so we’ll find out any 
moment if it’s hit a new all-time closing high.
 
Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is hovering around its highest ever closing 
level in late trading.

The index is up 31 points at 7099, having earlier burst over its record 
closing level (7103.98).

So we might get a new record high in around 30 minutes....
