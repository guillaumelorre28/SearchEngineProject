Art enables people to assert their individuality in the face of hostile 
prevailing orthodoxies. In 20th century Northern Ireland, that was a potent 
force as generations of artists – from playwright and poet Seamus Heaney to the 
band Ash – sought to define themselves not as Protestant or Catholic, 
nationalist or loyalist, but primarily as human beings.

 Night Institute, held at Aether & Echo 
“There’s a massive tradition here of what I call ‘third-culture’ stuff,” says 
Adam Turkington, who runs Belfast arts organisation Seedhead. “That’s where 
Terri Hooley, Stiff Little Fingers, David Holmes, all those guys come from – a 
subculture that stands out and, in a sense, says we’re not interested in either 
political tradition.” During the Troubles, that stance was provocative. It is 
less dangerous now but, says Turkington, Belfast’s arts scene remains crucial 
to an unrepresented group who want to express themselves outside of the 
traditional binaries of community politics.

Turkington is currently working on Culture Night 
<http://culturenightbelfast.com/> (250 free events, being held on 16 September) 
and says: “I feel like we’re building shared cultural space.” Whatever the 
obstacles today – arcane licensing laws and the UK’s lowest per-capita arts’ 
funding – this is what Belfast’s creatives have always done. The city’s 
tight-knit, DIY music, clubbing and visual arts scenes have repeatedly found 
ways to work, party hard and cultivate new talent.

Belfast playlist
 Bobby Murray of Belfast Underground’s playlist 
House duo Bicep <https://www.facebook.com/feelmybicep/> were Belfast’s most 
recent breakout stars but, at venues such asVoodoo 
<http://www.voodoobelfast.com/>, Black Box <http://www.blackboxbelfast.com/>, 
Oh Yeah <http://www.ohyeahbelfast.com/> and club night Twitch 
<http://twitchbelfast.com/>, plenty of new talent is percolating through. Girls 
Names <https://www.facebook.com/GirlsNames/>, Hot Cops 
<https://hot-cops.bandcamp.com/>, Sea Pinks <https://seapinks.bandcamp.com/> and
Documenta <https://www.facebook.com/dronepopdocumenta/> are the pick of the 
current indie crop, while, on the electronic side, check outBobby Analog 
<https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/bobbyanalog>, Brién 
<https://www.facebook.com/Bri%C3%A9n-123905811293065/> and the labels Extended 
Play <https://www.facebook.com/extndply/> and Computer Controlled 
<https://www.facebook.com/ComputerControlledRecords/>.

Elsewhere, the optimism engendered by the peace process is transforming the 
food and drink scene in Belfast. From craft brewers such asBoundary 
<https://www.facebook.com/boundarybrewingcoop> to independent, Michelin-star 
restaurants such asOX <http://oxbelfast.com/>, a new wave is ramping up 
quality. Belfast now expects its restaurants to be fully cognisant of global 
trends. As OX chef and co-owner Stephen Toman puts it: “People just want to 
live. They want what every other city experiences.”

Albeit with a distinctive Belfast flavour. Here is where you can get a taste 
of it.

From one-off gigs with cult German producer Ulrich Schnauss to visits from the 
Low Profile DJs (local evangelists for leftfield electronic music), there are 
interesting things going down at the Hudson – where events are usually free. The
Belfast Music Club <http://belfastmusicclub.com/> crew regularly take over a 
huge outdoor smoking terrace for day/night hoedowns that run the gamut from 
cosmic disco to jackin’ house. Previous guests have included Optimo and Young 
Marco.

Seventeenth-century White’s Tavern is among Belfast’s oldest pubs but the 
venue cannot be defined by its history. Its landlords used to run the legendary 
Stiff Kitten club and have turned White’s top floor into Vandal, a 
graffiti-clad pizza restaurant which morphs into a late-night club. “It’s a 
hidden gem,” says Bobby Murray, from the record shop and online radio station, 
Belfast Underground. “It’s a got a low-ceiling, an intimate feel and nights 
such as Dialogue which plays the deepest house and techno.”

Ad hoc Belfast


Due to a lack of standalone music venues visitors will often find gigs and 
club nights (such as the discerning queer discoPonyhawke 
<https://www.facebook.com/ponyhawke>) happening at traditional, multi-roomed 
pubs such as Lavery’s, the Pavilion and McHugh’s, as well as various temporary 
spaces. Look out for gigs from promoterStrange Victory 
<http://strangevictory.co.uk/> and the affiliated DSNT and audio-visual Lumen 
<https://www.facebook.com/DSNTRecords> techno parties. “There’s also Warzone 
Centre <https://www.facebook.com/warzonecollective>, which has a punk, DIY 
ethos,” recommends Neil Brogan, a musician who runsCF Records 
<http://cf-records.com/>.

Like the Sunflower (below), this bar and venue is a crucial hang-out for the 
Belfast arts scene, which could easily slot into this guide’s music or culture 
sections. “It’s got an underground soul,” says Dryden, of a space that 
maintains a packed programme of leftfield cabaret, film, theatre and art events 
with upcoming gigs fromCate Le Bon <http://www.catelebon.com/> and Battles 
<http://belfast.carpediem.cd/events/378286-battles-at-black-box/>. You’ll also 
find craft beers among its 13 taps. “It’s the centre of underground art 
activity in Belfast – where that community meets,” says Seedhead’s Adam 
Turkington, who runs a weekly magic night here.

Hidden on a backstreet and identified by the Troubles-era security cage at its 
door, the lefty, boho Sunflower hosts nightly eclectic jam sessions, a monthly 
flea market, public meetings and serves wood-fired pizzas in its grungy, 
colourful beer garden (from £5). “It has a lovely intimate venue upstairs which 
is great for folk gigs,” says Brogan. For Boundary Brewing founder, Matthew 
Dick, the Sunflower’s landlord Pedro Donald is one of the heroes of Belfast’s 
craft beer scene: “He takes a risk with the bottle selection which is still 
mainly unheard of here. There’s always something interesting to choose from.”

Most visitors gravitate to the MAC arts centre <https://themaclive.com/>, but 
to get under the skin of the Belfast arts scene, head to the photography gallery
Belfast Exposed <http://belfastexposed.org/> and contemporary art hub, Golden

A project space for the artists at Paragon Studios, this former shop is a 
small room with a big rep thanks to its turnover of events, many somewhat 
off-the-wall. Recent exhibitions have included a sound diary of Belfast’s Lagan 
Meadows, a performance art piece on alcohol inspired by pubs and AA meetings 
and, currently,Amalgamate <http://www.pssquared.org/Amalgamate.php>, which 
explores the division between “art” and “craft”.

On the first Thursday of each month, most of Belfast’s galleries open late, 
many taking the chance to launch new exhibitions. It is a great opportunity to 
visit smaller galleries such asCatalyst Arts <http://www.catalystarts.org.uk/> 
and the newArtcetera <https://www.facebook.com/ArtceteraStudio> or artist-run 
spaces, such asPlatform <http://platformartsbelfast.com/> or Belfast Print 
Workshop <http://bpw.org.uk/>, which have limited public opening hours. “Most 
have free booze, too,” says Turkington, “so if you’re in town it’s basically 
free booze and loads of interesting contemporary art.”

Talking of that intersection between applied art, design and craft skills, 
Space is a shop and exhibition space – representing the Craft & Design 
Collective – where you will find everything from curious sculptural pieces to 
modern examples of traditional basketry. It is both a decorative homeware store 
and a beguiling gallery. Note: from 8 August, 2016, Space Craft will be at a 
new unit in the Fountain Centre.

This innovative group is all about rethinking the potential of theatrical 
performance in new locations. Its work can range from the relatively larky (
Belfast Bred <http://www.kabosh.net/article.php?show=belfast-bred> is a 
culinary tour by an imaginary HMS Titanic chef), to productions that deal with 
the complexities of conflict resolution, such as Laurence McKeown’sThose You 
Pass On The Street 
<http://www.kabosh.net/article.php?show=those-you-pass-on-the-street> 
(currently touring in Africa).

FOOD


Grapevine


The diligently home-cooked food at this simple sandwich shop/cafe is, insists 
Turkington, a cut-above, particularly its specials such as Maltese tomato and 
rice soup or sesame pork noodle broth. “It’s only four or five pounds for lunch 
and the gumbo’s amazing. That’s my Friday treat. If I could find a Grapevine in 
other cities I’d be delighted.”

Dimly-lit, music blaring, one bare wall covered in urban art, Gareth 
McCaughey’s restaurant is pretty rock’n’roll and his dishes, such as shortrib 
lasagne or blackened lamb with romesco, deliver in spades. “His cocktails are 
amazing too – smoking creations in whisky decanters, stuff like that. It’s good 
food in a cool setting,” says OX chef and co-owner, Stephen Toman.

The hip, minimalist Established is best known for what Toman rates as 
“outrageously good coffee”. But its breakfasts andOttolenghi-style 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes> 
lunches make this a destination even if you drink decaf. Early doors, expect 
topped slices of Zac’s Bakehouse sourdough and, later, dishes such as a 
tea-soaked raisin tabbouleh with buttermilk tzatziki, tomatoes, pickled 
cucumber, toasted cashews and crispy kale.
