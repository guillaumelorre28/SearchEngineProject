The problems with introducing driverless cars are greater than you identify in 
your editorial (Intelligent cars raise questions that only society can answer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/15/the-guardian-view-on-self-driving-cars-apply-the-brakes>
, 16 December) and yet almost certain to be ignored.

No amount of testing can prove them as safe as human drivers unless the 
software is frozen and never updated

No amount of testing can prove them as safe as human drivers unless the 
software is frozen and never updated. Verifying the behaviour of 
machine-learning systems is an unsolved research challenge. There are major 
problems of cybersecurity – many of the sensors and communications have already 
been hacked. Who would risk being a passenger alone, when anyone can easily 
force the car to stop?

But politicians are probably powerless to prevent the sale and use of these 
cars when multinational companies are investing billions of dollars and 
countries are competing for a share of the investment, tax revenues and other 
benefits. When one region has driverless vehicles on the street, how will 
others resist the pressures to follow suit? Yet the real dangers may only arise 
after there are fleets of driverless cars on the roads, when a cyberattack 
allows a criminal or terrorist to control hundreds or thousands of vehicles, 
gridlock a city, deliver bombs, or distract and obstruct emergency and security 
services while some other crime is being committed.

These scenarios should be considered and researched, and countermeasures 
should be devised with urgency, so that the necessary constraints on the 
software and hardware of driverless cars can be imposed internationally before 
fleets of such vehicles present a threat that cannot easily be overcome.

• Part of the driverless futuristic nightmare – and job losses – could come 
from platoons of lorries linked and controlled electronically by the first HGV 
and driver with the rear lorries driverless (Why the driverless future could 
turn into a nightmare 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/16/trump-uber-driverless-future-jobs-go>
, 16 December). The reality is that the government plans to trial processions 
of lorries, which could be vulnerable to cybercrime, even though our motorway 
network is congested, with frequent exits close together. Instead, why not use 
a freight train which is much safer, far less polluting, and can individually 
remove up to 136 HGVs?
