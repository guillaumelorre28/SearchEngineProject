Winning tip: Freight car motel, Pennsylvania

Visiting Amish Country on our road trip from Philadelphia to Chicago, we 
stayed in an old caboose (railroad wagon): theRed Caboose Motel in Ronks. The 
motel consists of a string of old carriages in bucolic countryside. On the farm 
beside our caboose we watched Amish men in wide-brimmed hats farming with 
old-fashioned tools; we bought produce from women in bonnets and long dresses, 
and waved to Amish children peering from buggies. The cabooses vary; larger 
units cater for families with bunk beds, whereas the smaller baggage car is 
more basic. There’s a dining car restaurant and even a honeymoon caboose with 
whirlpool bath.

Florida island restaurant

Stepping into the Bubble Room on North Captiva island, off Florida, is akin to 
stepping into every dream of 1950s America. From the vintage toys inside glass 
tables, to momma’s own cooking in the kitchen, you’re overcome with the sights 
and sounds of this playful restaurant with a kitsch Christmas theme. The 
hardest part will be choosing which room you’ll eat your dinner in.

Hooked on barbed wire? Texas

 Photograph: Mark Williamson/Getty Images 
The Devil’s Rope and Route 66 Museum in McLean, just off the old Route 66, is 
housed in a former (underwired?) bra factory. Barbed wire was used extensively 
in ranching, and many of the 2,000 different patterns of wire, and the tools 
used to construct the fences, are displayed here. Not grabbing you yet? There’s 
also a photographic and textual history of the dust bowl (the 1930s period of 
dust storms caused by drought and poor farming methods) and cattle rearing. You 
can even buy barbed wire art, including some unique sculpture; and there’s a 
section devoted to Route 66 memorabilia, including the original Big Texan Steak 
Ranch cow, an old motel sign.

God’s golf course, Kentucky


We’ve done our fair share of US road trips and often use roadsideamerica.com 
<http://www.roadsideamerica.com/> as inspiration for detours. The Bible 
mini-golf at theLexington Ice Center, set in gardens with waterfalls and 
streams, was worth stopping at for sheer quirkiness alone. You can choose from 
three different courses, Old Testament, New Testament or Miracles, where you’ll 
find holes called Mount Sinai and Jonah and the Whale, for example. We played 
Miracles ... it’s as underwhelming as you might imagine!

Classic roadside cafe, Montana

As you head south from the west side of Glacier national park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/oct/30/montana-glacier-national-tour-guide-david-eglsaer-worlds-best-workplace>
, side-step the main US93 in favour of the scenic MT-35 which hugs the eastern 
shore of Flathead Lake and takes in cinematic Montana farmlands and landscapes 
along the way.Echo Lake Cafe in Bigfork is the perfect place to refuel. A 
classic American roadside cafe with a menu to match (lunch from $9.40), wooden 
booths, outside seating, excellent bottomless coffee, and impeccable service. 
Be prepared to queue up alongside the locals; it’s definitely worth the wait.

Kitsch amusement park, Indiana


Just south of Interstate 64 in Indiana you’ll find the bewildering, charming 
town ofSanta Claus. Although the town features many Christmas-themed 
attractions, the main draw is the appropriately namedHoliday World amusement 
park. The place is planned around four holiday-themed sections: Fourth of July, 
Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas and is as kitschy and wonderful as it 
sounds. With amazing wooden rollercoasters and a superb water park, Holiday 
World is a must see if you ever find yourself driving through southern Indiana.

Big Sur literary stopoff, California

 Photograph: Alamy 
The Henry Miller Memorial Library is on Highway One at Big Sur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jun/20/big-sur-usa-cultural-trips>. It 
is dedicated to the renowned writer and describes itself as a “place where 
nothing happens”. In the winter it’s a beautiful spot where you can stop off 
and enjoy the stunning coastal surroundings, browse novels and enjoy free tea 
and coffee. During the summer it hosts a variety of cultural events – from film 
screenings in the forest, to intimate gigs on a makeshift stage. For a man who 
said memorials “defeated the purpose of a man’s life. Only by living your own 
life to the full can you honour the memory of someone”, Miller certainly has 
the most beautiful one I’ve ever been to.

Wild west jailhouse, Arizona


We found this little corner of the wild west while driving through Arizona’s 
Tonto national forest <http://www.fs.usda.gov/tonto/>. Founded as a mining camp 
in 1875, remote Globe in Gila County has remained a real frontier town – you 
can still find a few unique stores and old-time diners. There’s also the 
notorious Gila County courthouse, now the beautifulCobre Valley Center for the 
Arts <http://globearts.org/> and the adjacent rather spooky Old Jailhouse. 
Globe’s history is laced with murders, hangings, stagecoach robberies, Apache 
raids, vigilante justice and links to the Clanton brothers of Gunfight at the 
OK Corral fame. Phineas Clanton married, had a ranch and is buried there.

A desert oasis, Arizona

 Rosie’s Den in 2010. Photograph: Alamy 
We first stumbled across Rosie’s Den on the way to see the Great Wash (the 
westernmost part of the Grand Canyon). The exterior had a Bates Motel feel to 
it – clapboard shack with fading paint, windows thick with desert dust, a 
disused pickup truck surrounded by tumbleweeds and a rather sad looking Joshua 
Tree emerging from a gravel pit. Inside, there were just a few wooden tables, 
one elderly server and a short counter, so we weren’t expecting much. Then the 
menus arrived. Between the four of us we ate steak and mashed potatoes, 
biscuits and country gravy, pancakes and eggs, a cheeseburger and fries, and 
lemon meringue, blueberry and coconut cream pie. Rosie’s has undergone many 
changes since. The original building burned down, then Rosie passed away, but 
her son rebuilt, landscaped and refurnished it. He extended the counter, 
installed a jukebox and hired more staff. New menu items were added and the 
place now sells cocktails. But Rosie’s still has a huge amount of nostalgic 
charm and good, homemade food. It’s not just a roadside stop – it’s a 
destination itself.

Giant hole, Arizona

 Photograph: Tony Rowell/Getty Images 
Meteor Crater is an enormous and well-preserved meteor crash site in the 
middle of the desert. Everything about the build-up to the crater – the 
billboards, the gift shop, the museum – is wonderfully kitsch, but seeing the 
1.2km-wide crater itself is a surprisingly powerful experience. It is just a 
six-mile detour off Interstate 40 (which replaced the old Route 66) about 20 
miles west of Winslow, and is well-signed - you can’t miss it. The flat, dry 
landscape on this stretch of highway can be a little repetitive so this unique 
stop-off is certainly the best thing to break up the journey! At $18 entry this 
is a bargain – be sure to walk the crater rim for the full experience.
