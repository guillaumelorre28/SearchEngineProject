I have been reading the Observer since the age of 14. Now nearing 70, I was 
reminded why by Nick Cohen’s razor-sharp and deeply rationalanalysis of the 
rise of populism 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/27/what-has-become-of-conservatism-trump-farage-le-pen-brexit>
 and its pervasive influence over current political direction (Comment).

Read in conjunction with Andrew Rawnsley’s plea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/27/tony-blair-john-major-dont-deserve-venom-brexit-debate>
 to at least give a fair hearing to Blair and Major with their 17 years of 
experience at the summit of political decision-making and we have a powerful if 
depressing landscape upon which to cast our eyes.

I almost cheered when Cohen reminded us that what in the past kept 
demonstrably despicable regimes in power was the idea that “you can only vote 
for them once”. It is perfectly reasonable to change one’s mind. It is not 
unusual to consult “the people” again once the facts are known.

It is understandable to want to revisit a decision when the stakes are so 
high. So where are the contemporary politicians with the courage, integrity and 
sheer guts to stand up to the bias and toxicity of the rightwing press and 
speak out?

And when we find them (Tim Farron, Caroline Lucas, Kenneth Clarke), why do the 
wider media, particularly the BBC, not have the balls to give them proper 
coverage instead of parading the likes of Nigel Farage constantly before our 
gaze? Have the moguls at the corporation stopped reading the Observer? I 
haven’t.

Can Nick Cohen really be serious when comparing Alex Salmond and Nicola 
Sturgeon to Recep Erdogan and Donald Trump, or the true Finns, and suggesting 
that they are in some way “rightwing nationalists”?

Their crime: daring to challenge the palpably nonsensical idea that Scotland 
might not be able to survive as an independent state. He then goes further and 
suggests that the progressive, social democratic, secessionist movement in 
Scotland is creating a climate of intimidation and intolerance.

His arguments are also somewhat inconsistent: the winners of the referendum in 
Scotland are being ignored, in the way the losers of the UK referendum are. His 
call for the British people to have the right to a second opinion presumably 
would not extend to the Scottish people having a second independence 
referendum, despite having returned 56 SNP MPs out of 59, in a general election 
the year after the referendum.

Build a better Britain


Mike Gotch is surely wrong to suggest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/nov/27/the-big-issue-affordable-housing-green-belt>
 that housing should be built “close to centres of employment” – that is, over 
the green belt (Big issue). The unconstrained free market means that London and 
the south-east have acted for several decades as an economic black hole, 
sucking in jobs, people and housing.

This has led to overbuilding, traffic and pollution and a lack of investment – 
productive and cultural – in much of the rest of the country.

The solution is a national policy to support the regions, aiming to give every 
part of the country good jobs, homes and infrastructure. This should have 
happened 40 years ago, but such planning was then ideologically unfashionable.

It’s not too late to start now.

Let’s all be flexible


Katie Allen is right to identify flexible working as part of the solution to 
the UK’s productivity problem (“Hammond needs to look beyond road-building to 
lift UK’s productivity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/27/hammond-needs-to-look-beyond-road-building-to-lift-uks-productivity>
”, Business).

In our annual survey, two-thirds of working mothers consistently say they 
would think about childcare arrangements before taking a new job or a promotion.

But, actually, shifting the starting point so that all jobs are advertised 
flexibly as the norm rather than the exception would propel flexibility from 
being a favour to mothers to being the accepted way of doing business. Hiring 
managers would think through the best way to get the job done and what workers 
can realistically achieve in the hours allocated to the role.

Those employers who have already embraced flexibility as their modus operandi 
report increased engagement, motivation, loyalty and, hence, productivity.

Damned statistics


Much as I admire William Keegan, I worry I will soon be seeing him driving 
around Britain’s high streets in a bus with the slogan: “Only 28% of the 
population voted for Brexit! 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/27/brexit-of-course-economic-forecasts-bad-no-plan>
” (Business, last week) painted on the side.

I think he is in danger of destroying his case with the dubious use of 
figures; after all, one could say that fewer than 28% of the population voted 
Remain.

Next door to Alice


Born and bred in Alice Bacon’s Leeds constituency, I was reminded by Rachel 
Reeves’s fascinating article 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/27/debt-education-owes-to-alice-bacon-labour-comprehensive-schools>
 (Comment) of her winning slogan in the 1945 general election: “Alice Bacon 
knows your needs, send her back for North-East Leeds”.
