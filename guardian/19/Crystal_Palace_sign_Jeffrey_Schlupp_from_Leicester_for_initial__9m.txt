Crystal Palace have signed Jeffrey Schlupp from Leicester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity> for an initial £9m on a 
four-and-a-half-year contract in a deal that could be worth up to £12m.

Ghana international Schlupp has rarely featured for the Premier League 
champions this season having made just six appearances in all competitions.

Leicester rejected a bid worth £9.5m bid from Palace this week but they 
accepted an improved offer on Thursday

 which will see them pay another £3m in bonuses. West Bromwich Albion and Aston 
Villa were also interested in signing the 24-year-old, who was left out of the 
Ghana squad for the Africa Cup of Nations and is expected to be part of the 
Palace squad for the game against West Ham United on Saturday with the club 
having beaten the deadline to register players.

Sam Allardyce has been seeking left‑sided reinforcements to his squad with 
Pape Souaré a long-term absentee and Bakary Sako on international duty with 
Mali. They also expressed an interest in signing Robert Snodgrass from Hull and 
Norwich’s Robbie Brady, although it remains to be seen whether they pursue 
either of those targets now given Schlupp’s ability to play as a defender or 
further forward.

It is understood, however, the Palace manager is now keen to recruit a more 
natural left‑back, withnegotiations continuing

 with representatives of Patrice Evra over an 18-month deal.

The former Manchester United defender, 35, has been told he is allowed to 
leave Juventus, having played only 247 minutes in Serie A this season.

Palace had a £7m offer for the defender Charlie Taylor rejected by Leeds 
United this week and offered a similar amount for Sunderland’s Patrick van 
Aanholt. David Moyes confirmed on Friday that was rejected and insisted he does 
not want to sell the player who worked with Allardyce during his spell at the 
Stadium of Light.

The Villa manager, Steve Bruce, admitted he had been disappointed not to sign 
Schlupp, who has rarely featured for the Premier League champions this season 
having made just six appearances in all competitions.

“We tried for but unfortunately with the lure of the Premier League and the 
wages of the Premier League we’ve lost out. But that sort of quality is what 
we’re looking for,” he said.

“If you have a chance to play in the Premier League people want to play there 
and I can understand that too. It is a big draw that we have up our sleeve, 
that we are desirable and rightly so.

“It was not just one club, it was three. It’s disappointing but we move on.”
