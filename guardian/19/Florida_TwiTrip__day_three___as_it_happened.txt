Today began with bacon donuts in Naples, and ended with beer in Miami Beach. 
It involved airboats, alligators – both viewing them and eating them – getting 
very wet in the rain and then exploring Calle Ocho and Wynwood in Miami.

On Thursday I'm looking for more Miami tips – particularly places to eat and 
some less-frequently visited areas, perhaps.

Here's a video review of day three. Goodnight.

2.12am BST 

Wynwood came recommended by Richard Cole on yesterday's blog 
<http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/23210268>. It's noted for 
its graffiti, and I headed straight to Wynwood Walls, a little park-cum-outdoor 
eating space with beautiful street art all along the warehouse type buildings 
that surround it.

The main area for graffiti seems to be off 2nd Ave between 22nd St and 25th 
street, and there were a few other people pottering around looking at the walls.

Wynwood is a tricky place to describe. The restaurants and bars I saw - 
there's maybe six or seven spots in the neighbourhood - had a grungy, cool 
vibe, but they were interspersed with high end furniture and design shops, 
giving a slightly strange feel to the area... half way between hipster/artist 
cool and moneyed cool.

Anyway Wood Tavern looked a very appealing bar - big open entrance, dark 
interior, and so it proved. They had a good selection of beer, which was all I 
was interested in at this point, and I had a can of Dale's pale ale, which has 
nothing to do with Florida (it's from Colorado) but is a personal favourite.

The bar area was pretty small but through the back was a second bar and 
extensive seating area, where a bingo round was taking place. The participants 
were mostly in their 20s, cool looking, and drunk. The bingo called was getting 
exasperated with one table in particular, where one woman appeared to be trying 
to com her way to a full house.

Also out the back of Wood Tavern: a 1960s Mercury Commuter estate (think 
chrome and space-age styling) that had been converted into a taco truck. The 
tacos, served by a friendly woman called Sury, were $1 and delicious.

Exploring Wynwood

Adam took some time to explore Wynwood

, an eclectic, 'modern-art Lego village' district known for its street art.

Bienvenido a Miami

I made my way to Miami, in buckets of rain all the way, and went straight to 
Little Havana 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/feb/09/miami.travelfoodanddrink> at 8th 
Street (Calle Ocho) and 15th Avenue.

On Twitter @AngusTCat <http://www.twitter.com/angustcat>, @discoverusaUK 
<http://www.twitter.com/discoverusauk> and @ariellec 
<http://www.twitter.com/ariellec> had instructed me to head to the 
neighbourhood.
Ivy (@AngusTCat) 
@adamgabbatt <https://twitter.com/adamgabbatt> I grew up in Miami. Best places 
there: Crandon Park Beach, Greynolds Park, Fontainebleau hotel, Calle Ocho and

Upon parking I was immediately waved into the Cuban Cigar Corporation by a 
woman called Dunia who was sitting outside.

I know nothing about cigars but happily obliged. Dunia showed me how
she was keeping some of the cigars moist, in a wooden casket with a
glass of brandy and two glasses of water inside. She then flogged me
three cigars for the price of two and insisted I smoke one there and
then.

As I mentioned, I'm not a cigar connoisseur, but Dunia took pity and
showed me the correct way to a) hold the cigar (two fingers and a
thumb) and b) light and smoke the cigar. She did not however, teach me
how to look cool with the cigar, as I think is evident from the
pictures.

If you go to Little Havana you've got to go to Azucar Ice Cream @adamgabbatt

<https://twitter.com/ariellec/status/329676415891021825> 
Post-cigar I pottered a few doors down from Dunia's place to
Exquisitor restaurant, which I was horrified to learn sold big Cuban
cigars for $1.25 each. (I had just paid $20 for 3, although Dunia did
intimate that they were good ones).

You can just walk up to the window at Exquisitor and order a Cuban
style coffee for 75 cents, which I did. It was a blow-your-socks-off
Espresso-style thing, which went very well with my still smouldering
cigar.

After stubbing out my cigar with some difficulty (I put it out in a
small puddle onto of a trash can) I then went right across the street
to Azucar ice cream company, a specific recommendation of @ariellec. 
A chocolate-covered waffle cone with three scoops was $5.50, and had the bonus 
of ridding my mouth of the taste of the cigar. One of the scoops was labelled 
"Elvis" and was peanut butter and banana flavour. I tried it. Not for me. The 
mint chocolate chip was great though.

On the way back to the car I looked in at Maximo Gomez Park, where
mostly old men were playing dominoes and chess. I thought I might be
called over for a game, as I was still carrying my cigar at this
point, but it didn't happen. Possibly they saw that one end of it was
soaking wet and noticed all the ash on my shorts from trying to stub
it out.

Day three, the journey so far: Bacon donuts, gators and gator's tails

Adam made sure his day got off to a supercharged start by combining breakfast 
and sugar-rush in the form of a bacon donut atPeace, Love and Little Donuts 
<https://www.facebook.com/Peaceloveandlittledonutsofnaples> in Naples.

Next stop: Everglade City. After driving the single-lane Tamiami Trail, with 
its signposted warnings of Florida panthers, he headed toCaptain Doug's 
<http://www.captaindougs.net/> in Everglade City to sign up for an airboat 
ride. His six-seater airboat - piloted by Captain Dwain Daniels III no less - 
zipped through the soupy air and tangled mangroves of the swamplands. He 
spotted two gators hungrily eying up a gaze of raccoons, and caused permanent 
damage to his inner ear, before beating a retreat from an approaching storm.

Next stop: Big Cypress Gallery in Ochopee, where Adam was impressed by the 
large format black and white photographs of Clyde Butcher. He was equally 
impressed by a close-up with a slumbering gator in the creek outside. He got 
even closer at the Miccosukee Restaurant in Shark Valley – where he ate a 
gator's tale.

Now: he's on the road to Miami with no fixed plans and nowhere to stay, other 
than a vague idea to get a room at theColony Hotel <http://www.colonymiami.com>
. So, make his day, and point him in the right direction@Adam Gabbatt

Snaps, gator tails and heading for Miami

Heading east along the Tamiami trail I stopped in at the Big Cypress Gallery 
in Ochopee, as recommended by@01steven 
<https://twitter.com/01steven/status/329330955540111360> on Twitter.

It's a showcase of photographer Clyde Butcher's work 
<http://www.clydebutcher.com/>, set just off the trail around 20 miles east of 
Everglades City.

Butcher eschews digital methods and takes all his pictures using large format 
cameras, which create up to 12x20 negatives. He then develops these by hand in 
his 1,600-square-foot darkroom in Venice. Butcher's black and white pictures 
are of landscapes around south Florida and beyond, with incredible detail due 
to the size of the original sheets.

The largest piece in there is a photo of Cash Creek, Florida, roughly 10ft by 
4ft. Butcher wasn't in when we stopped by - off on another photography 
expedition - but Brian was very helpful and chatty. Some of his works are for 
sale in the gallery, too.

The gallery is right next to a little creek, and right by the side was sat an 
alligator, bold as brass. I got within about 10ft of it when I realised it 
probably wasn't going to move, and backed off. There's a $100 fine for feeding 
them, by the way. Although why you would want to is beyond me.

As we hung out at the gallery, the storm that we narrowly avoided in 
Everglades City caught up with us, with dramatic lightning and thunder. It 
drove the alligator into the water and led us to drive on towardsShark Valley 
<http://www.nps.gov/ever/planyourvisit/svdirections.htm>, where I'm going to 
eat alligator tail at Miccosukee Restaurant.

Big Cypress Gallery, archive of Everglades photographer Clyde Butcher

Adam's close encounter with an alligator... he is actually frozen with fear

But this is not about revenge... Miccosukee restaurant, just before Shark 
Valley and around 20 miles east of the Big Cypress Gallery, came recommended by 
no one, but I was really hungry so I stopped.

I had battered gator tail for the first time. It was quite fatty and chewy, 
although this could have been particular to this restaurant as the gator came 
only barely warm. What Miccosukee does have going for it is that it's next to a 
creek where alligators regularly swim past. There's a certain sense of 
one-up-manship that comes from eating alligator in front of an alligator. A 
great way to mark that classic battle between man and beast.

As I sat in the restaurant neglecting my chewy gator tail it began to 
absolutely pour down outside, prompting a dash to the car and a cancellation of 
plans for a bike ride. With outdoors things off for the moment, I'm heading 
over to Miami.

If the weather clears then the street art and hipster vibes of Wynwood have 
been suggested byRichard Cole 
<http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/23210268> in the comments, 
while@ariellec <https://twitter.com/ariellec> on Twitter has directed me to 
Little Havana for ice cream. I'm going to try and stay at the iconicColony Hotel
 <http://www.colonymiami.com>, as per @hangingwithmr

Thanks to greensox for thinking of Adam's appetite with this tip for Joe's 
Stone Crab <http://www.joesstonecrab.com> restaurant in South Beach when he 
reaches Miami. It started as a small lunch top counter in 1913, back when Miami 
was still a quiet backwater town, and served fish sandwiches. These days they 
serve all sorts of seafood as well as the stone crabs - and they round it off 
with Joe’s famous Key Lime Pie.

When you get to Miami you just have to go to Joe's Stone Crab in South Beach, 
you are just in time before the end of the season which runs to May15th. It 
isn't cheap but it would be a crime not to go.

Everglades by kayak

Top tip from LouiseKirk for another watery expedition and gator-watching 
opportunity in the southern part of the Everglades

Take a full day eco tour trip with Garl's Coastal Kayaking when you get down 
to the southern part of the Everglades. They're based out of Key Largo, but 
they also meet people at Robert's Fruit Stand southeast of Homestead near the 
Ingraham Hwy entrance to the park.

The full day starts at around noon, and includes a couple of nature walks into 
mature hammocks, freshwater kayaking with alligators, and a sunset kayak in the 
ocean off the southern tip of the Everglades, with lemon sharks feeding in the 
shallow water. Then you do a night walk to look for alligators by flashlight. 
It's definitely a full day, even without an early start!

5.50pm BST 

Gators versus raccoons

I've just got back from the airboat trip through the Everglades, guided by the 
capable hands of Captain Dwain Daniels III.

We managed to get on the last trip for a while, as there's a heavy thunder 
storm coming. The airboats are metal, so you don't want to be on the water when 
lightning strikes.

The first thing you notice about an airboat is that is it very, very loud. 
Even with the ear protectors they provide, the noise of the engine, the air 
blades, and the wind howling past is incredible. If you dare to take the 
protectors off there is just a continuous howl.

The boats are designed to just skim the surface of the water - the six-seater 
boat I was in had just a 6.5-inch "draft", meaning only half a foot of it 
dipped beneath the surface. The boats were originally developed so fisherman 
could skim across wet mud and even dry land to get to fertile territory.

We saw two alligators during the ride - one of which was lingering ominously 
beside a family of raccoons that Captain Dwain stopped to feed. Both alligators 
didn't seem at all perturbed by the racket of the airboat - ours had a 365hp 
engine. Our captain was the third Captain Dwain of his family, and the sixth 
generation of fishermen in this area.

I asked him if he'd ever had an alligator mount the boat and stage an attack, 
much to the alarm of my fellow passengers, and he said he had not.

Captain Dwain has, however, saved a 90-year-old woman's life by killing an 
alligator that had attacked her in a Florida canal 
<http://m.wect.com/autojuice?targetUrl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.wect.com%2fstory%2f15384256%2fman-pulls-90-year-old-woman-from-alligators-jaws>
.

"I was driving by, and I saw her getting dragged into the water," he said as 
we stopped on the boat. "I had a rifle. I killed it with the rifle."

He then dragged the woman to safety. The story was splashed across news 
websites for days.

The storm is coming

After all these swamps, Adam is heading to Miami, where he plans to spend the 
night. We've already compiled a list of10 budget hotels and B&Bs in Miami

If you're heading to Florida but won't have time to get down to the 
Everglades, another good tip we've received onGuardianWitness 
<https://witness.guardian.co.uk/assignment/51784cd3e4b06d5a5f3e286f/> is for the
Orlando Wetlands Park. 
<http://www.cityoforlando.net/public_works/wetlands/index.htm>Nothing Mickey 
Mouse about this.
 <https://witness.guardian.co.uk/assignment/51784cd3e4b06d5a5f3e286f/298752> 
Orlando Wetlands park is an amazing Must!! 
<https://witness.guardian.co.uk/assignment/51784cd3e4b06d5a5f3e286f/298752>

We just completed an alternative florida trip, ie avoiding the usual, so have 
lots of tips for you. This is defiantly a highlight, and is a gem. Forget the 
'sheep' tours and the so called see wildlife trips, this is the one to see. We 
must have seen 20+ Alligators here, close up and personal! The place has a 
prehistoric feel about it, palms growing from the water and pelicans flying 
above the water. We walked 5 miles and didn't see another sole. This is 
reclaimed land, set up as a water treatment (natural) works. So, I'd give it 
ago..this is the real Orlando.

Central Florida is known as Lightning Alley for all its storms and is said to 
be the lightning capital of the US. 

Jason Weingart, a storm chaser, has been in touch to explain why:

The biggest factor that contributes to all of our storms is the geography of 
our state. We are on a peninsula, which provides surfaces boundaries, known as 
the east and west coast sea breezes. Storms often occur along the boundaries 
and especially when they collide, ie almost every summer afternoon. It's also 
very hot and humid here for much of the year, which contributes to instability, 
which is like fuel for thunderstorms.

Jason has made this film to show Lightning Alley in action:

Everglades City

Everglades City <http://www.visitflorida.com/en-us/cities/everglades-city.html>
 doesn't look like somewhere you'd really want to stay,
but it seems to be a good spot for airboating. It's a small town
really, with motels and homes on stilts located off each side of one
main road.

There are airboat signs everywhere here, so without a firm
recommendation I pulled up at one that had the term "captain" in the
title: "Captain Doug's <http://captaindougs.net>".

It's $40 for an hour long ride on a six-seater airboat. We're setting
off shortly from a little inlet in Everglades City, and we end up
going through tunnels of foliage and between trees and the like,
according to the signage. Our driver will be Captain Dwain.

The drive along Tamiami trail was largely uneventful, a single-lane
road with greenery on each side. There were a lot of state prisoners
at work cleaning up and trimming bushes, with orange signs pointing
out that they were incarcerated.

The smallest post office in the US would have been worth a look. Apparently, 
its post mark is quite the collector's item.

Unfortunately, the tip from a reader came just a little too late and we'd

On the plus side, it was sent in via GuardianWitness

Smallest Post Office in USA

The Ochopee (Oh-CHOP-ee) Post Office just outside Everglades City, FL is 
officially the smallest in the USA. This 7x8-foot building used to be an 
irrigation pipe shed for a tomato farm. It was pressed into service after a 
fire destroyed the Ochopee general store -- which also housed the post office 
-- in 1953.

One thing I would love to do, but probably don't have time, is take up 
angelita's suggestion in the comments yesterday.

She said I should hire a jetski off the coast here, which would be amazing. The
website <http://www.rentaseadoo.com> she suggests hires them out for half a 
day, a full day or a week. Maybe next time.

To burn off those calories and really see the best of the Gulf coast beaches 
you should rent a jet ski from rentaseadoo.com. They let you take the jet skis 
anywhere on the water you want between Sanibel and Marco Island, so you can 
ride between the Fort Myers, Sanibel and Naples beaches, have a great time and 
see dolphins and manatees as you go. Their skis are super-charged and really 
fast -so fun.

Breakfast is served – and it's doughnuts or doughnuts

On Twitter I had a suggestion to try "Peace, Love and Little Donuts 
<https://www.facebook.com/Peaceloveandlittledonutsofnaples>", which was 
described as a "drive-thru" doughnut place.

I'm here right now. It was a little hard to find as it is tacked into a BP 
garage, but it's worth it. It's at 2201 Tamiami Trail. The fare is exclusively 
doughnut-based. There are about 15 different types on offer, including the 
"maple bacon donut".

I'm eating the bacon one right now (pictured above, centre-right). It's 
actually not too bad, but I don't think I'll be repeating the experience.

Anyway, four donuts and a coffee: $8. There are a couple of tables outside if 
you don't want to stuff your face in the car, but bear in mind that you are 
eating next to a busy road and a gas station, so it's not the most relaxed spot.

Waking up in Naples

Not a bad start to the day. This was taken on my morning walk to the beach in 
Naples. I'm now heading off to follow a tip from a reader on where to eat 
breakfast.

Another great start to the day thanks to Miami Nice 
<http://www.miaminicepopup.com/> blogger Patricia. Some great tunes from the 
Deep Down blues of Muddy Waters to the eye-watering falsetto of the Bee Gees' 
Jive Talkin'- which was originally called Drive Talking and was about their 
daily drive across the causeway from Biscayne Bay to the Criteria Studios in 
Miami. Spam Allstars crop up yet again - making them the most played Florida 
band this week - and it's always good to hear the classic Walk on the Wild 
Side. Enjoy - and remember,you can share your Sunshine State sounds via Spotify.

Day three begins ...

Morning! Yesterday was a lot of fun 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2013/apr/30/florida-road-trip-day-two>. I 
learnt a lot about sponges and subsequently bought a $10 sponge that I don't 
really have any use for; I sought sharks' teeth (unsuccessfully); and I 
splashed about in what I later learnt were shark-infested waters. Although only 
small ones apparently, so I would have lived in any case.

Today I'm driving through, and stopping in, the Everglades national park. 
We're taking theTamiami trail, as suggested by reader Muratnal 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2013/apr/29/florida-road-trip-day-one#comment-23154752>
.

Via Twitter, @01steven 
<https://twitter.com/01steven/status/329330955540111360%20> said it's worth 
checking out a photographer's gallery on the trail itself,Clyde Butcher's Big 
Cypress Gallery <http://www.clydebutchersbigcypressgallery.com/directions>, so 
I hope to call in there, too. It has "amazing Everglades photos," says Steven.

@GraemeBandeira said 
<https://twitter.com/graemebandeira/status/329266422834425856%20> we should 
stop at Cypress national reserve on the trail and get an airboat.

@imagardner2 suggested kayaking 
<http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/23176357>, which sounds 
fantastic, but is there a particular place to do it? I've also heard tell of 
bike riding, which I'm keen on, so guidance on that would be good.

Importantly, I'm hoping to see alligators. Although I'm probably not going to 
wrestle one, as my colleagueMatt Seaton suggested in a tip 
<http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/23186795> – which may be 
his ploy to kill me off so I don't sit near him in the office anymore.

Everglades aside, a breakfast spot in or around Naples would be splendid, too. 
And come Wednesday night I'll be needing a hotel in Miami.

I'll leave you with a video recap of Tuesday's happenings. Here's to day three
