St Claude Art District Second Saturday

Thirty-plus galleries participate in co-ordinated openings on the corridor of 
St Claude, just down from the French Quarter, one of the more vital underground 
arts scenes in the US. The event, held on the second Saturday of each month, 
came about after the Toxic Art Exhibit at l'art Noir New Orleans had patrons 
bursting the gallery's seams just two month after Hurricane Katrina. Come 
stroll the venues from 6pm till whenever, many with drinks provided. Highlights 
includeByrdie's Gallery and Coffesho 
<http://www.byrdiesgallery.com/Byrdies/Byrdies.html>p and The Barrister's 
Gallery <http://www.barristersgallery.com/>, currently showing Sylvain 
Sancton's gorgeous post-abstract expressionist explorations.

Marigny Opera House

This charmingly dilapidated, non-denominational Church of the Arts, originally 
founded in 1847 for German Catholics of the Faubourg Marigny and designed by 
Theodore Giraud, was bought in 2011 by Scott King and Dave Hurlbert, who began 
restoring the historic building and supporting the work of New Orleans' 
performing artists. They host performances by the Paul Taylor Dance Company 
(ballet) and New Orleans Opera Association, and events such as Cinderella 
Soirée and local Mardi Gras Krewe dancer sneak previews, along with writers' 
groups and Artist's Way workshops.

The National WWII Museum

A treasure in the Central Business District, this museum concentrates on the 
contribution the United States made to the second world war – the battle of 
Normandy, in particular. Affiliated withThe Smithsonian <http://www.si.edu/>, 
it houses world-class exhibitions like The Home Front, Planning for D-Day, and 
an atrium housing suspended aircraft, including a Supermarine Spitfire, 
Messerschmitt Bf 109, and a Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber. As befitting its 
location in Hollywood South, a gallery dedicated to The Monuments Men, who 
saved innumerable works of looted art from the Nazis and are currently 
portrayed in the George Clooney film, is slated for 2016.

M S Rau Antiques

A stunning gallery in the French Quarter housing museum-quality pieces ranging 
from French furniture and impressionist paintings to Dresden porcelain. The 
30,000-sq-ft showroom is in a 100-year-old landmark building, and one could 
spend an afternoon gazing at its walls, which bear such delights as an original 
Renoir oil portrait of his son and a recently discovered painting by Norman 
Rockwell. Not to be missed is the newly redecorated impressionist room, 
complete with original works by Monet, Van Gogh and even a Gauguin.

Alex Beard Studio
 Alex Beard Gallery, New Orleans 
While you're strolling along Royal Street be sure to make time for the Alex 
Beard Studio. Beard's paintings of animals in the natural world reflect his 
travels in Africa and are interesting in the context of African-centric New 
Orleans. Influenced by both his uncle, Peter Beard, and mother, Patricia Beard, 
Alex's creativity derives from both nature and nurture – he spent his youth 
around artists such as Warhol and Capote – which echoes throughout the 
"Abstract Naturalism" style he has created. As with those 60s icons, 
versatility reigns; his murals at Sucré, the best sweet shop in Nola, grace the 
walls with delicate whimsy redolent of both de Brunhoff's Babar and Bemelmans' 
Madeline.

NOMA
 Photograph: Alamy 
The quintessential museum of Louisiana, the permanent collection includes 
nearly 40,000 world-class works of regional, national and international art, 
such as Picasso, Braque, Dufy and Miró, and drawings by Degas, who worked just 
blocks from the museum when he visited maternal relatives in the early 1870s. 
Lectures, book clubs, film presentations, art classes and musical performances 
are all presented with aplomb – and you can even take yoga classes in the 
sublimely beautiful Sydney and Walda Besthoff Sculpture Garden, where works of 
the 20th century's master sculptors reside in a sub-tropical sanctuary.

is in large part thanks to the Preservation Resource Centre (PRC). The PRC 
celebrates its mission of promoting the preservation, restoration and 
revitalisation of New Orleans' historic architecture and neighbourhoods, a 
highlight of which is the pre-eminent Holiday Home Tour of the Garden District. 
The tour typically includes seven private homes, plus a non-residential "bonus 
house", each one fully staffed with greeters and docents, as well as volunteer 
musicians. View the splendour of original Italianate, Greek Revival, Colonial, 
Queen Anne and Victorian mansions.

Contemporary Arts Centre (CAC)

The CAC complex in historic downtown is a cultural leader, bridging the gap 
between the visual and performing arts by combining exhibitions, concerts, 
dance and plays. Past interactive events, such as Leverage by Mexican artist
Pedro Reyes <http://www.pedroreyes.net/>, had patrons delightedly playing on 
what resembled a giant see-saw. Upcoming exhibitions include 30 Americans, 
showcasing the last three decades of art by the most influential 
African-American artists, and Julian Sands in A Celebration of Harold Pinter, 
where the actor will share and provide insight into Pinter's little-known 
poetry. The CAC also hosts the spectacular Whitney White Linen Night on the 
first Saturday in August, which offers a stroll among the galleries on Julia 
Street to the beat of Nola musicians while sampling world-renowned cuisine.
