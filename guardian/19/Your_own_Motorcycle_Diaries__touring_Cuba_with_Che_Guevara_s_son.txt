It’s a sunny morning in Trinidad, Cuba, and in front of a row of brightly 
painted colonial houses, a vintage Harley Davidson is attracting admiring 
glances. But a newer Harley parked behind it, outside a guesthouse, probably 
has a more interesting story: it belongs to Ernesto Guevara, son of 
revolutionary hero Che.

Ernesto runs motorbike tours of Cuba and today, before setting off for the 
mountains and beach, he’s having breakfast in the guesthouse courtyard with his 
group. Wearing a black Harley T-shirt and wristband, he looks younger than his 
51 years.

He says he inherited his passion for motorbikes from his father and has loved 
them since he was a child. “I have had a Harley since I was 21,” he tells me. 
“After so many years they become part of you.”

He started La Poderosa Tours over a year ago, to share his love of Cuba and 
motorbikes. The name is a tribute to La Poderosa II (the name means powerful), 
the Norton bike on which his father and friend Alberto Granado rode for nine 
months across South America in 1952, a trip recorded in Che’s bookThe 
Motorcycle Diaries

 Harley trips can include a few days on the beach at Cayo Santa Maria 
Photograph: Alamy 
There are two tours. A seven-day (six night) trip 
<http://lapoderosatours.com/en/fuser-1.html> heads east from Havana to 
Trinidad, Cienfuegos and Santa Clara, with a visit to Che’s mausoleum, staying 
at small hotels or private homes. Anine-day (eight night) tour 
<http://lapoderosatours.com/en/fuser-2.html> adds a few days on the beach at 
Cayo Santa María.

“We can’t go as far as Santiago – the road is terrible,” says Ernesto. “But we 
do custom trips. If clients want to go west to Pinar del Río and Viñales for 
example, we’ll go. And we take in some places tourists wouldn’t normally go – 
like an old Harley workshop.”

There are 10 Harley Davidsons for guests – including Touring Electra Glide, 
Sportster 1200 and V-Rod models – with two people per bike. Most tours are 
booked by groups of friends, but individual bookings are taken. The driver, but 
not the passenger, must have some motorbike experience. The last group was from 
New Zealand and there’s a Chinese group on the way.

Ernesto grins: “That should be interesting. Chinese motorbikes are probably 
different from Harleys!” Then he revs up his own bike and takes off down the 
dusty road.
• Tours cost from $3,250pp (two sharing a bike and a room), including 
accommodation and meals,lapoderosatours.com
