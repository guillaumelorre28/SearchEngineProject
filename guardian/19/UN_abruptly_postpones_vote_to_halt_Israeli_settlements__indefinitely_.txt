would have demandedIsrael <https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> halt all 
settlement activities as a “flagrant violation” of international law.

The plan to call a vote – announced abruptly on Wednesday evening by Egypt, 
which had been drafting the resolution – was postponed indefinitely a few hours 
ahead of the planned security council meeting on Thursday afternoon.

Several diplomats and western officials said the Egyptians had been pressured 
to postpone the vote by the Israelis.

Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, was said to be 
meeting with Arab League diplomats to review the text.

Diplomats added that there was no time frame for when the vote may now take 
place with some suggesting it could be put off “indefinitely”.

The issue of a planned resolution, which has been in the drafting process for 
several weeks along with a second draft resolution sponsored by New Zealand, 
had drawn considerable attention amid speculation over whether President Obama 
might change US policy and not deploy its veto. Late on Thursday Reuters 
reported that the Obama administration had intended to abstain on the vote, 
citing “western officials”.

Speculation that the US might not deploy its veto had been fuelled by US 
administration frustration over recent political moves by the rightwing 
coalition of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu,not least over proposed 
and highly controversial legislation that would retroactively legalise some 100 
outposts built on private Palestinian land.

The announcement of the vote, however, had prompted immediate calls from 
Netanyahu for the US to use its veto power at the security council to block the 
resolution in a late-night tweet.

On Thursday Netanyahu returned to the fray publicly urging the US to veto the 
resolution, calling it bad for peace. “Peace will come not through UN 
resolutions, but only through direct negotiations between the parties,” he said.

The move also prompted the intervention of US president-elect Donald Trump, 
who campaigned on a promise torecognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/12/us-embassy-israel-jersusalem-trump>
 and said in a statement that Washington should use its veto to block the 
resolution.

“The resolution being considered at the United Nations security council 
regarding Israel should be vetoed,” the Republican said in a statement. “As the 
United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the 
Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, 
and not through the imposition of terms by theUnited Nations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations>,” he said.

“This puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair 
to all Israelis,” Trump added.

Israeli settlements have long been seen as major stumbling block to peace 
efforts as they are built on land the Palestinians see as part of their future 
state.

The UN maintains that settlements are illegal, but UN officials have reported 
a surge in construction over the past months.

Trump presidency bodes ill for Israel-Palestine peace process

Some in the Israeli government view Trump’s victory as an opportunity to 
expand settlements in the West Bank, Palestinian land occupied by Israel for 
nearly 50 years.

The Egyptian draft has also emerged amid a period of profound uncertainty over 
the moribund Israel-Palestine peace process largely fuelled by fears over what 
Trump’s Middle East policy might be.

Last week Trump nominated as his ambassador to Israel the hardliner David 
Friedman 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/15/trump-israel-ambassador-david-friedman>
, a man who has said Washington will not pressure Israel to curtail settlement 
building in the occupied West Bank.

Another key influence on Trump is said to be his son-in-law Jared Kushner 
whose family charity has donated money to one of the occupied West Bank’s most 
hardline settlements.

The draft resolution – in its latest form - demands that: “Israel immediately 
and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian 
territory, including East Jerusalem” adding settlements have “no legal 
validity” and are “dangerously imperilling the viability of the two-state 
solution” that would see an independent state of Palestine co-exist alongside 
Israel.
