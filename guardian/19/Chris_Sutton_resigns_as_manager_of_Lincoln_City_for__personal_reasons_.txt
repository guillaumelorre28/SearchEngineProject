his appointment 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/28/chris-sutton-lincoln-manager>
. The former Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea striker is said to have tendered his 
resignation to the Lincoln chairman, Bob Dorrian, after last night's 0-0 draw 
with Burton Albion, his 51st game in charge.

The 37-year-old, who was in his first job in management, said personal reasons 
were behind his decision. His assistant, the former-West Ham United defender 
Ian Pearce, has also left the club.

A club statement read: "The Board of Directors can confirm that Chris Sutton 
and Ian Pearce have left the club for personal reasons. A press conference will 
take place at Sincil Bank Stadium this evening. No club representatives will be 
available for further comment until then."

Lincoln <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lincoln> sit in 20th place in 
the table after a disappointing start to the season, having picked up only two 
wins from nine games.
