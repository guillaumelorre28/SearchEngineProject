The tarmac ended as night fell. I’d driven 700 miles north from Perth, seeing 
the landscape change subtly and slowly: white sand to yellow dirt, then orange 
and red. The vegetation got smaller and the bush flies grew to be a plague. I’d 
taken three days over the journey, but now I was approaching my final 
destination: Gnaraloo sheep station. It’s one of Australia’s most remote 
coastal spots, celebrated for its outback authenticity, its fearsome surfing 
and, most importantly for me, access to one of the world’s great reef systems: 
Ningaloo, a place almost unvisited compared with the Great Barrier Reef over on 
the other side of the continent – 19,000 visitors per year, as opposed to two 
million. That was the big attraction, but there were other reasons: the chance 
to explore this wild west coast, so vast and remote, and also to meet some of 
the legendary characters who make up the sparse population. One of these was 
the man who owns and runs Gnaraloo: Paul Richardson, an Irish émigré eccentric 
who had taken on this isolated outpost a decade ago when even outback-hardened 
Aussies had quailed at the prospect.

I had an idea of Paul: he would fix me with a thousand-yard stare, nail a 
stray ewe with a jet of tobacco juice and snarl: “Get down to the shearing 
shed, mate. There’s work for Poms.” Famously, he had appeared on the Australian 
version of the Farmer Wants a Wife reality TV show, though none of the women 
had been able to last long at Gnaraloo.

Would the place be a bit too much for me, too? They did accept visitors, but 
there were reports of the place being badly hit by a cyclone.

My nights en route I’d spent in my trailer tent, picked up in Perth. I’d 
spotted my first kangaroo near Jurien Bay, 140 miles up the coast, then emus 
and cockatoos at Billabong, where the petrol station sold coffee under old 
photos of sun-dried pioneers. I’d kayaked down the Murchison river with a guide 
called Alex who told me the flies were a rare epidemic brought on by the 
cyclone. They would, he said, soon be blown out to sea. They were not.

Now I had passed the last settlement, Carnarvon, and its roadside reminders to 
buy life’s essentials: “Fuel, liquor, bait.” I turned off the main highway and 
followed a long, lonely road down to where it ended at the Indian Ocean, a 
shimmering sheet of wine-dark purple in the last embers of sunset. To the 
right, a dirt track began, curling off into the darkness of the coast. My 
instructions were to follow it.

For two hours I motored north, seeing a sign for a distant salt mine and a few 
kangaroos. I passed under an arch marking the start of Gnaraloo homestead, 
then, finally, I reached it: a shadowy clutch of buildings on a low rise above 
the ocean. I walked up to one with a light shining, shouted a greeting and 
walked into an open-plan kitchen-cum-living room. Dinner was bubbling away on 
the stove, tended by a middle-aged lady who turned to me with a big smile.

“Ah Kevin,” she said, “You made it. I’m Colleen and Paul is around. Want some 
dinner? Hey Paul! Kevin’s arrived.”

It was as if I’d come home. Paul came sauntering out of his office with an 
impish grin under a shock of curly hair. “Come on in! Take a seat.” He was 
personable, friendly, and funny – nothing like I’d imagined.

We had dinner with various people: a young guy who had come on the organic 
farm work scheme, a surfer dude come to fix an engine, a gardener whose passion 
was bush flowers, Colleen, who was office manager, and Paul. He had some news: 
“There’s another cyclone coming – Cyclone Quang, heading straight for us. If 
you don’t leave before it strikes, you could be here a long while.”

After dinner we went and examined the computer screen. Sure enough, Quang, a 
Category 2 – “minor house damage, crop destruction, possible power failure” – 
was out in the ocean, aiming itself at Gnaraloo.

“You see what life here is like,” said Paul. “A cyclone brings rain; rain 
brings flies, then clouds of moths, armies of frogs, and then mice. The grass 
grows, dries out and catches fire. Then another cyclone comes. Never a dull 
moment.”

I slept in one of the smart cabins looking out towards the ocean. Gnaraloo may 
be a sheep station, but it is also home to a superb campsite (next to great 
surfing, fishing and snorkelling), and also to these upmarket self-catering 
chalets. On Paul’s advice, I tried sleeping on the verandah, but the bright 
moonlight woke me and I went back inside.

At dawn, there was no sign of Quang, only gorgeous sunshine. I went down to 
the beach and snorkelled along the inner side of the reef, marvelling at the 
quantity and size of the fish: huge, colourful parrotfish, blue-spotted wrasse 
and unicornfish. A green turtle took a look at me and sped away; a blacktip 
reef shark hung in the furthest gloom, and vast swarms of stripy convict 
surgeonfish came past, shepherded by some chunky parrotfish guards. I could 
hear them all pecking away at the coral with their teeth. The fact that this 
260km-long reef has never suffered the depredations of commercial fishing was 
obvious all around me.

After breakfast in the cabin, I went up to the house and found Paul examining 
the computer screen. Quang was now 100 miles closer and upgraded to Category 3 
– “some structural damage, caravans destroyed, power failure likely”. A call up 
the coast confirmed that my scheduled whale-shark-watching trip and all flights 
were cancelled for several days ahead. My plans would have to change – I’d stay 
here until the cyclone was in sight, then hightail it south with the wind 
behind me.

There is something about having your travel plans ripped up mid-journey. You 
feel the weight of pre-determined timetables lift; your journey is salted with 
the thrill of the unexpected – but also, to be honest, a peppering of anxiety.

Quang, however, had yet to show itself. Paul and I toured the coast of his 
domain that day, having great fun roaring the 4x4 up sandy tracks to view 
magnificent empty panoramas of blue ocean from the cliffs. “We’ve got some of 
the best left-hand breaks in the world here,” said Paul when we spotted surfers 
negotiating the improbably massive waves. “That and the fishing brings people 
back year after year.”

around in the quiet shallows. At Turtles Beach, we found a Welshman heading off 
with his surfboard. He had moved to western Australia 15 years ago.

“I could have been a teacher in Swansea, but I’m here instead. No regrets at 
all!” He ran off to join his nine-year-old son who was nonchalantly surfing 
down waves big enough to swamp Port Talbot steelworks.

Over the day, I teased out some of Paul’s own story – how he had arrived in 
Australia after seeing the film Crocodile Dundee, then ended up buying a 
sheep-farm lease: “I’d never touched a sheep before.” Not only that, but it was 
220,000 acres – bigger than many small countries. The struggle of his early 
years had become a lifelong passion. “We look after this place like no one else 
would. I’ve cut the sheep numbers down and eradicated European foxes, which 
were decimating the turtle population. We’ve now got one of the world’s best 
turtle-nesting sites.”

A lot of this is achieved with volunteers who do four or five hours work a day 
in return for board and lodging, then have the rest of their time to snorkel, 
fish, surf and swim. Among the regular visitors was Claire, a professional 
gardener, who had taken on the task of beautifying the station with indigenous 
plants, and convincing visitors like me that the surroundings were an amazing 
botanical treasure: “People think it’s just scrubby bushes.”

 “People think it’s just scrubby bushes …” Professional gardener Claire out in 
the bush at Gnarlaroo Photograph: Kevin Rushby 
The next day, she showed me otherwise: clumps of brilliant green trees where 
wedge-tailed eagles and nankeen falcons perched, tiny desert-adapted flowers 
and some very large ones, too. There was one yellow inflorescence that she 
unexpectedly dropped down and began to suck: “Ah! Delicious!” I tried it. The 
whole flower tasted of nectar.

That afternoon, Paul showed me the vehicle graveyard where he also kept a 
hump-backed whale skeleton that he was drying out before reassembling. While we 
examined the bones, he talked about the visit of the Australian Chamber 
Orchestra. Somehow he had lured them out to play in his shearing shed with 
Indigenous musicians. One of the many joys of Gnaraloo, I was realising, is 
that around Paul the unexpected happens – often.

Next to the whale skeleton was his cyclone shelter, a shipping crate tied down 
with cables, and 40 tons of rusting farming machinery. On the forecast Quang 
was now Category 4 – “caravans blown away, flying debris” – and the horizon to 
the north-west was dark and menacing.

In the evening, I went down to 3 Mile Camp to snorkel. Local knowledge said 
that there was a narrow “keyhole” in the reef and, if you swam out, there were 
big sharks and rays to see. However, the swell was surging over the reef and I 
couldn’t even hold myself against the rush of water coming in. Visibility was 
not good, but there were plenty of fish in the inner lagoon: moray eels, 
turtles and vast schools of fish.

That night I was hoping Quang would change course, but it did not. “You leave 
at first light or when the heavy rain starts,” Colleen had said. In the end, it 
came at dawn as I was hooking up my trailer. Then I was off, running from the 
black clouds behind me, driving the 15 hours back to Perth.

I’d missed out on whale shark watching, but I gained a day exploring 
Fremantle, which has excellent cafes, bookshops and museums.

That night, I turned on the television in my hotel room and watched Quang 
tearing the coast up: sideways palm trees, flying caravans, cars swimming down 
suburban streets. But when I spoke to Paul, it turned out Quang had veered off 
course and missed Gnaraloo. “It was a total non-event,” he said, with a hint of 
disappointment “We never even got inside the cyclone shelter. You could be 
snorkelling at 3 Mile Camp!” I suppressed a groan. One day I will get back to 
Gnaraloo and swim that keyhole.
