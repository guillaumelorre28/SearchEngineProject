Some of my favourite dishes come from Jaffna in the north. I have a slight 
addiction to crab, and to slow-cooked goat. The goat curry is made with 
Jaffna’s signature dark curry powder, which is freshly roasted and ground, 
ensuring an aromatic and full-bodied flavour.

The meat is cooked low and slow until it’s nice and tender, and the sauce, or 
gravy as it is more commonly known, is rich and reduced to a thick consistency. 
Like most curries in Sri Lanka, it’s a one-pot deal and super easy to prepare. 
I’ve seen it made with added offal for an even deeper flavour, but it works 
just as well without. Try it for a few pounds at Jaffna’s scruffy, lurid

 A bit nippy … fresh crab from Jaffna market 
In my other favourite, mud crab curry, the crab is meltingly soft, slightly 
sweet and delicately flavoured. It starts with a base of mustard seeds, 
shallots, garlic and green chillies, then the crabs go in, with a little water 
and fresh cumin and fennel seeds, red hot chilli powder and, of course, Jaffna 
curry powder. Once cooked, it’s finished with the creamy, thick first extract 
of coconut milk. Cosy Restaurant (+94 21 2 225899, Sirampiyadi Lane, off 
Stanley Road) does one of the best for about £6.

Another great dish, but from southern Sri Lanka, is the moist, deep-flavoured 
hill country pork curry. It’s prepared with a host of spices including roasted 
fenugreek seeds, cinnamon andgoraka – a souring and thickening fruit paste 
similar in flavour to tamarind – plus the usual mustard seeds, cumin seeds, 
chilli powder and fragrant curry leaves. TheFerncliff <http://www.ferncliff.lk/>
 a period bungalow with four guest rooms among tea plantations in Nuwara Eliya, 
does a great version that packs a fiery punch.

 Lotus root stir-fry 
Arugam Bay on the east coast is known for its world-class waves – but I love 
it for the lotus stir-fry, which I first tried many years ago at family-run 
Samanthi’s Restaurant (077 175 9620) a stone’s throw from the beach in Main 
Point Road. Many parts of the lotus plant can be eaten, but this dish is all 
about the stem: it’s crunchy and fibrous in texture and tastes great.

I first visited the south-east of the island when I went on a safari in Yala 
national park on a mission to photograph the elusive Sri Lankan leopard. I 
stayed at the fantasticElephant Camp <http://elephantcampguest.lk/> guesthouse 
(doubles £26 B&B) in Tissamaharama, where I met Jaya and Anoma.

 Seer fish white curry - to Anoma’s recipe 
Anoma is a fantastic cook – I asked her to contribute some recipes to my book. 
In my opinion she does the finest spread of rice and curries on the island. The 
standout is her seer fish white curry, made with a tropical fish a bit like 
mackerel, green chillies, mustard, turmeric and coconut.

Just to warn you, everything in Sri Lanka runs on “Sri Lankan time”, and food 
can generally take a while to reach the table, but if you go to the right 
places, it’s well worth the wait.
