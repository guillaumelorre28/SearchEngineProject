The White Horse

A relative newcomer in Austin's bustling Eastside bar scene, The White Horse 
draws tattooed rockabillies, two-stepping retirees, and hipsters in rocker 
jeans. Inside, the building is dark, dank, and unadorned – like any good honky 
tonk worth the title – with a red, gleaming stage and an ample dance floor 
tucked into a corner. The venue features some of Austin's best new country 
talent almost every night of the week, as well asConjunto

 shows on Sunday evenings that draw olderTejano 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tejano> crowds with deeper roots in the rapidly 
changing neighbourhood. Owner Denis O'Donnell regularly barbecues chicken for 
anyone who stops by.

Sahara Lounge

Formerly a beloved juke joint called TC's, the current owners of the newly 
named Sahara Lounge have stepped in to keep the long musical history of the 
building alive. The ramshackle structure on Webberville Road isn't much to look 
at, but its walls are coated with the historic sweat of a thousand raucous, 
blues-fuelled dance parties. Now the musical offerings are as eclectic as the 
folks that run the place, who hail from Austin, Houston and Niger. You can hear 
Brazilian one night and funk, African, or swing the next.

Elephant Room

Austin doesn't have many dedicated jazz spots, but the Elephant Room makes up 
for that by being quintessential. The venue's neon sign gleams at knee-level on 
Congress Avenue downtown, beckoning audiences to the cosy basement space. 
Inside, the walls are brick, the lights and ceilings are low, and – if you can 
score a table near the front – the musicians are close enough for the 
experience to be especially intimate.

<http://www.elephantroom.com>. Weekdays usually free entry but a small cover is 
charged Fri-Sat. Open Mon-Fri 4pm-2am, Sat-Sun 8pm-2am

Ginny's Little Longhorn Saloon

Ginny's Little Longhorn Saloon – a small, steeple-topped dive bar in North 
Austin – is most famous for its weekly Chicken Shit Bingo, a Sunday gathering 
that features a live chicken, cash prizes, and music by Dale Watson, one of 
Austin's best roots country performers. The venue is small and the dance floor 
gets cramped, but crowds often spill into the parking lot out back, where 
regulars set up lawn chairs and sip Lone Star beers while the music wafts out 
from inside.
• 5434 Burnet Rd, +1 512 458 1813, ginnyslittlelonghorn.com

Paramount Theatre

The Paramount sits on the former site of the War Department of the Republic of 
Texas and has been around for nearly 100 years, making it the city's oldest 
standing theatre. The venue originally featured Vaudeville and variety shows, 
and continues to book a broad assortment of offerings – from comedy to film 
screenings to live music. With immense ceilings, tiered balconies, intricate 
moulding and colorful murals, it's one of the most majestic places to see music 
in the city, and often features big-name touring acts.

Hole in the Wall

Austin is no longer just a college town – the life of the city is too diverse 
and varied to be defined by the University of Texas alone – but the Hole in the 
Wall, in operation since 1974, remains its best college bar. The yellow sign 
out front reads "cheap music, fast drinks, live women" and a mural of twin 
cowgirls wielding six-shooters (painted by local artist El Federico) decorates 
its exterior. The Hole has a long musical history – Stevie Ray Vaughan, Shawn 
Colvin, Nanci Griffith and Lucinda Williams have all performed here – and it 
continues to be a great place to catch up-and-coming local acts and a handful 
of touring musicians each month.

Victory Grill

The Victory Grill opened in 1945, back when E 11th Street was the heart of 
Austin's "Chitlin' Circuit" – a name used to describe the network of clubs 
across the country that welcomed African American performers at a deeply 
segregated time. Johnny Holmes, a booking agent and band manager, opened the 
Victory Grill to serve black soldiers returning from the second world war and 
it quickly became a hotspot for blues and jazz. Over the decades, Billie 
Holiday, James Brown, Etta James and Janis Joplin all performed here. Now on 
the National Register of Historic Places, the Victory Grill is a museum as much 
as a live music spot, but it's worth stopping by for their Monday-night blues 
jams and to take in the vibrant murals on its west-facing walls. Make sure to 
call ahead as the music schedule varies.

Beerland
 Beerland, Austin, Texas 
Beerland, a former furniture barn turned rowdy venue, is located in Austin's 
Red River music district. For more than 10 years, owners Randall and Donya 
Stockton have served up noisy fare, bringing in punk, metal and garage bands, 
and inviting fans to join them for an "all-out orgy of loud music and cheap 
beer". For those craving a more participatory experience, Rock & Roll Karaoke 
goes down on Monday nights.

The Carousel Lounge

The Carousel Lounge embodies all the oddness that Austin has to offer. A low, 
single-storey building painted with a circus motif, the place feels like a 
David Lynch set come to life. Acrobats and tigers dance across the walls; a 
pink papier mache elephant looms over bands as they play. The venue books small 
local rock, indie, and experimental acts, supporting the Austin music scene at 
its most grassroots.

The Continental Club Gallery

The Continental Club is one of the city's most famous spots, boasting some of 
the finest Country and Swing bands in the city and a crowd of dedicated boot 
scooters. But head upstairs to the Gallery for a cosier experience that feels 
more like your cool friend's living room than a club. The room features 
rose-toned lighting, rotating local art on the walls, and live jazz.
