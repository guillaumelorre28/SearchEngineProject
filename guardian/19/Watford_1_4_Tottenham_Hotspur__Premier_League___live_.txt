GOAL! Watford 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur (Kaboul 92)

Don’t call it a comeback. Watford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> get a goal in added time, with 
Kaboul sliding in a free-kick at the second attempt after a brilliant save from 
Lloris.

90 min A bit of olé football from Spurs takes us into added time. They’ve 
scored eight goals away from home in five days; not bad preparation for 
Wednesday’s humdinger at home to Chelsea.

87 min The tempo is much slower now. Spurs are content to pass the time rather 
than try to score a fifth.

84 min A well-worked free-kick from Watford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> releases Kaboul on the left of 
the box, and his volleyed cross is acrobatically claimed by Lloris. That’s the 
first significant thing he’s had to do in the match.

80 min “Hey Rob, here’s my review of the year,” says Kevin Smith. 

“Manager of the Year: obviously it’s Bob Bradley. Hands down. I mean, just 
look at Swansea - 8 of 33 points (24%) with him, 4 of 24 (17%) without him.

“Player of the Year: Scott Arfield, because it’s nice to have a Canadian in 
the premier league again.


“Disappointment of the Year: Sticking with the Canadian thing, the lack of 
consideration Christine Sinclair gets for women’s player of the year. More 
international goals than anyone other than Abby Wambach (and she’s only 19 
back), led Canada to a 2nd Olympic bronze as well as a domestic title, she’s 
still never finished higher than 5th in voting, and this year will be at best 
4th. The top 3 includes Marta and Carli Lloyd, neither of whom got a medal in 
the Olympics, with Marta only scoring one goal (a penalty) the entire 
tournament.”

64 min “The fear,” says Peter McLeod. “Sure, we’ll always have it, and with 
good reason. It was super Spursy to qualify for the Champions League, book 
Wembley for our home matches and then go and lose the first two. But we need to 
have some perspective. Back in the late 90s Spursiness consisted of trying to 
copy Arsenal by getting a fancy foreign manager, then watching as Wenger racked 
up Doubles while Christian Gross almost got us relegated. Some fans complain 
about the Levy era but it’s been a dream compared to what came before.”

58 min “Hai Rob!” says Arief. “I’m watching Spurs in Klaten, Indonesia now. 
What do you think are the chances of Harry Kane surpassing Thierry Henry’s 59 
goals in first 100 appearances in the second half?”

Ordinarily I’d say it’s unlikely but with the way Watford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> are defending he could easily 
get the 58 goals he needs.

GOAL! Watford 0-4 Tottenham Hotspur (Alli 46)

Dele Alli makes it four after 58 seconds of the second half. It’s another 
shocker forWatford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford>. Prodl gives 
the ball away to Kane, who crosses to find Alli in his own personal postcode at 
the far post. He takes a slightly heavy touch but gets to the ball before Gomes 
and slides it under him with his left foot.

46 min “Following here in Vadodara, India, rooting for my Spurs,” says Rich 
Zumkhawala-Cook. “Is Trippier playing as well all over the pitch as he is in 
attack?”

The moment he has any defending to do, I’ll let you know.

Matt Loten’s half-year awards

“Manager of the Half Year: Tony Pulis, because not even West Brom fans seem to 
give this man the love that he deserves. Not sure about his financial nous, 
mind, but I’m choosing to keep off-field issues out of my decision.
Player of the Half Year: Zlatan Ibrahimovic. To do what he’s doing, at his 
age, in ‘this league,’ is nothing short of astonishing. Context: The last 
Manchester United player to score 16 goals before Christmas was a 26 year-old 
Ruud van Nistelrooy.
Disappointment of the Half Year: Crystal Palace doing away with stripes for 
their home kit. It’s just wrong, I tell you. If Norwich were still in the top 
flight, though, it’d be their third kit.”

Peep peep! Spurs make it consecutive 4-1 wins away from home and move to third 
in the table for the time being at least. They were superb;Watford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> were crap. Thanks for your 
company, bye!

Don’t call it a comeback. Watford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> get a goal in added time, with 
Kaboul sliding in a free-kick at the second attempt after a brilliant save from 
Lloris.
 
90 min A bit of olé football from Spurs takes us into added time. They’ve 
scored eight goals away from home in five days; not bad preparation for 
Wednesday’s humdinger at home to Chelsea.
 
87 min The tempo is much slower now. Spurs are content to pass the time rather 
than try to score a fifth.
 
84 min A well-worked free-kick from Watford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> releases Kaboul on the left of 
the box, and his volleyed cross is acrobatically claimed by Lloris. That’s the 
first significant thing he’s had to do in the match.
 
82 min Janssen screams with pain as Cathcart plants studs onto the top of his 
foot. Cathcart is booked.
 
80 min “Hey Rob, here’s my review of the year,” says Kevin Smith. 

“Manager of the Year: obviously it’s Bob Bradley. Hands down. I mean, just 
look at Swansea - 8 of 33 points (24%) with him, 4 of 24 (17%) without him.

“Player of the Year: Scott Arfield, because it’s nice to have a Canadian in 
the premier league again.


“Disappointment of the Year: Sticking with the Canadian thing, the lack of 
consideration Christine Sinclair gets for women’s player of the year. More 
international goals than anyone other than Abby Wambach (and she’s only 19 
back), led Canada to a 2nd Olympic bronze as well as a domestic title, she’s 
still never finished higher than 5th in voting, and this year will be at best 
4th. The top 3 includes Marta and Carli Lloyd, neither of whom got a medal in 
the Olympics, with Marta only scoring one goal (a penalty) the entire 
tournament.”
 
79 min Watford’s final substitution: Capoue off, Christian Kabasele on.
 
78 min Spurs make their final substitution: Kane off, Vincent Janssen on.
 
77 min Son continues to not score. First the last man Doucoure makes a vital 
interception; then Son lashes a bouncing ball over the bar.

74 min Amrabat winces his way off the field to be replaced by Jerome Sinclair.
 
73 min Amrabat bumps Wanyama over while protecting the ball and then collapses 
himself in the comedy style. He’s going to go off.
 
70 min The youngster Mason does well to deny Son a shooting chance after a 
fine long pass from Wimmer.
 
68 min A substitution for each side. Watford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> bring on the teenager Brandon 
Mason for Jose Holebas, who is on a yellow card, while Spurs introduce Ben 
Davies for the ever excellent Danny Rose.
 
67 min Trippier is continuing, though he doesn’t look particularly 
comfortable. He fell awkwardly after a challenge with Holebas.
 
66 min Trippier is struggling with a shoulder injury and might need to go off.
 
64 min “The fear,” says Peter McLeod. “Sure, we’ll always have it, and with 
good reason. It was super Spursy to qualify for the Champions League, book 
Wembley for our home matches and then go and lose the first two. But we need to 
have some perspective. Back in the late 90s Spursiness consisted of trying to 
copy Arsenal by getting a fancy foreign manager, then watching as Wenger racked 
up Doubles while Christian Gross almost got us relegated. Some fans complain 
about the Levy era but it’s been a dream compared to what came before.”
 
63 min Prodl is booked for a foul from behind on Son.
 
61 min Dele Alli is substituted with Chelsea in mind. He played beautifully, 
scoring twice and smashing a long-range shot off the bar. Harry Winks replaces 
him.

59 min Deeney, put through on goal by Prodl, is erroneously flagged offside. 
Morally speaking, it’s now Watford 1-4Tottenham Hotspur 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur>.
 
58 min “Hai Rob!” says Arief. “I’m watching Spurs in Klaten, Indonesia now. 
What do you think are the chances of Harry Kane surpassing Thierry Henry’s 59 
goals in first 100 appearances in the second half?”

Ordinarily I’d say it’s unlikely but with the way Watford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford> are defending he could easily 
get the 58 goals he needs.
 
57 min “Agents Kabul and Gomes seem to have done their job, not forgetting 
Capoue who is joining in by being totally invisible,” says John Tumbridge. 
“Surely now is the opportunity to get Carter-Vickers on and see how he is in the
Premier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> and Janssen 
in the hope it will bounce off his backside and he can score without requiring 
a penalty.”
 
56 min Kane curls it low around the wall, and Gomes gets down smartly to his 
left to push it wide. I think it would have hit the outside of the post anyway.
 
55 min Capoue commits an offensively brainless foul on Rose 20 yards from 
goal. Eriksen usually takes free-kicks but Kane is on a hat-trick...
 
53 min Here’s Mark Turner. 

“Manager of the Half Year: Allardyce. You want entertainment? Big Sam got your 
entertainment.

Player of the Half Year: Hazard. Nailed on. Can’t even think of a jokey 
alternative.


Disappointment of the Half Year: John Stones still being taken seriously as a 
defender.”
 
52 min Son slices wide of the near post after another fine move. I assume 
Spurs will declare soon, with Wednesday’s match against Chelsea in mind, but 
for now they look like scoring every time they attack.
 
49 min Doucoure’s low cross finds Deeney eight yards out with his back to 
goal, but he dithers and loses possession.
 
48 min “I was very disappointed when the FA deemed Big Sam too spicy but then 
thePremier League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague> is more 
fun with him so let’s say he’s my pick for manager,” says Phil Podolsky. “Best 
player? Always liked that Yaya fella.”

<Bantz> What, Sanogo? </bantz>
 
Dele Alli makes it four after 58 seconds of the second half. It’s another 
shocker forWatford <https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford>. Prodl gives 
the ball away to Kane, who crosses to find Alli in his own personal postcode at 
the far post. He takes a slightly heavy touch but gets to the ball before Gomes 
and slides it under him with his left foot.

46 min “Following here in Vadodara, India, rooting for my Spurs,” says Rich 
Zumkhawala-Cook. “Is Trippier playing as well all over the pitch as he is in 
attack?”

The moment he has any defending to do, I’ll let you know.
 
46 min Peep peep! Spurs begin the second half.
 
“I’ll see your 3-4 and raise you a 3-5 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1567733.stm>,” says John 
Dalby. I didn’t like to mention that. No team deserves to be reminded of being 
terrorised by Juan Sebastian Veron.
 
Matt Loten’s half-year awards

“Manager of the Half Year: Tony Pulis, because not even West Brom fans seem to 
give this man the love that he deserves. Not sure about his financial nous, 
mind, but I’m choosing to keep off-field issues out of my decision.
Player of the Half Year: Zlatan Ibrahimovic. To do what he’s doing, at his 
age, in ‘this league,’ is nothing short of astonishing. Context: The last 
Manchester United player to score 16 goals before Christmas was a 26 year-old 
Ruud van Nistelrooy.
Disappointment of the Half Year: Crystal Palace doing away with stripes for 
their home kit. It’s just wrong, I tell you. If Norwich were still in the top 
flight, though, it’d be their third kit.”
