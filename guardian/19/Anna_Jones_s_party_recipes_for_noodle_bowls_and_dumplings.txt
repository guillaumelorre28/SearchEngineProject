I am that person at a party, desperately following the one tray of vegetarian 
canapes around, trying to sneak a second mouthful before I get noticed. I can’t 
count the number of parties I have left a little bleary because there just 
wasn’t anything to eat. As far as I am concerned, where there’s drink, there 
should be food – for everyone. So I have three things I keep in mind when I am 
making food for a party.

While it’s hard to cater to all tastes and whims, I cook food that I hope 
almost everyone can eat. This is a party and no one wants to feel left on the 
sidelines. Party food should be friendly, not too fussy, casual and convivial. 
Canapes aren’t my thing; I prefer something a little more substantial, 
colourful and full of flavour. One thing I always crave at a party is light, 
fresh food – especially with champagne or anything bubbly. I like a hit of 
freshness and chilli to pep everyone up, clean flavours that sing. Punchy Asian 
flavours, like the recipes below, are what I want when I’m chatting and sipping 
a drink.

champagne

Little peanut noodle bowls

These little bowls of bun cha – a fragrant, delicate rice noodle salad – are a 
take on the original Hanoi recipe. I’ve made it my own with chilli-spiked 
peanut butter tofu. It’s half noodles, half salad, all flavour. Here many of my 
favourite things jump into the same bowl: crispy tofu, bright and zippy 
vegetables and sprightly herbs. For a quick assembly, have everything prepped 
and lined up and your bowls in a row so you can quickly drop each element in 
and move on to the next. If you can get your hands on some Vietnamese basil, 
mint, coriander andperilla <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perilla>, it would 
take this bun cha to the next level, but I’ve kept it simple with mint and 
coriander here.

1 Put the tofu into a bowl. Finely chop the chilli, garlic and lemongrass. Set 
aside half the chilli and garlic and add the rest to the bowl of tofu with all 
the lemongrass, the soy sauce and half the lime juice. Set aside to marinate.

2 Mix the other half of the lime juice with the peanut butter and a splash of 
water and set aside.

3 Put the vermicelli into a bowl, cover with boiling water and leave to soak 
for 3 minutes, or follow the packet instructions.

4 Shred the lettuce. Cut the carrots and cucumber into matchsticks. Finely 
slice the spring onions. Slice the avocado thinly. Roughly chop the coriander 
and do the same to the peanuts.

5 Make the dressing by mixing the reserved chilli and garlic with the rest of 
the dressing ingredients.

6 Heat a pan and add a little coconut oil. Drain the tofu, reserving the 
marinade. Once the oil is hot, add the tofu to the pan and fry until browned on 
all sides, then add the peanut butter mixture and the reserved marinade, and 
toss together to coat. Take it off the heat.

7 Pile the drained noodles into the bowls and top with the vegetables, 
coriander, peanuts and roughly torn mint (or other herbs if you have them). Put 
the tofu and any marinade left in the pan on top and pour the dressing over. 
Each guest can mix up their own bowl.

Mini squash and chive dumplings

These take time to put together: I enlist a couple of helpers for gyoza 
folding. The finished dumplings will be more than worth the effort. They can be 
made ahead and frozen if you like. You can make gyoza pastry yourself, but I 
always buy it. You’ll find packets of fresh or frozen in most Asian 
supermarkets (andthey’re available online 
<https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Blue-Dragon-Spring-Roll-Wrappers/83883011?ULP_CAMPAIGN_ID=3&gclid=CjwKEAiA9s_BBRCL3ZKWsfblgS8SJACbST7DQz0nBEKqgLLkNdAWJdmvTMCQX9WL1VdCEdyJGAJKqxoC9qzw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CP6k3O7yvNACFXOC7Qod9SYM2g>
). If you are using frozen gyoza wrappers, make sure they are defrosted before 
you use them: it’ll take 30 minutes. Cover them with a slightly damp piece of 
kitchen paper to stop them drying out.

Makes about 30 dumplings
½ red chilli, deseeded and roughly chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled
3cm piece of ginger, peeled and chopped
2 spring onions, trimmed and chopped
200g white cabbage, roughly chopped
200g butternut squash, peeled, deseeded and roughly chopped
1 tsp sesame oil
½ tbsp soy sauce
A small bunch of chives, chopped
30 gyoza wrappers
Groundnut or vegetable oil

For the dipping sauce
8 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
8 tbsp brown rice vinegar
4 tbsp honey
2 tbsp chilli sauce
1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds

1 To make the filling, put the chilli, garlic, ginger and spring onions in a 
food processor and blitz until finely chopped (or pound by hand if you like).

2 Add the cabbage and squash to the food processor bowl, along with the sesame 
oil and soy, and blitz again until you have a coarse paste (you can finely chop 
the cabbage and grate the squash if you don’t have a food processor). Scrape 
the mixture into a bowl and mix in the chopped chives.

Guardian 
3 To assemble the dumplings, you’ll need the filling, the gyoza wrappers, a 
bowl of cold water and a clean tray. Take one of the wrappers from the pile and 
put it in the palm of your hand: you will need to do this slowly and carefully. 
Keep the rest of the wrappers covered with damp kitchen paper to stop them from 
drying out. Spoon a heaped tablespoonful of the filling into the middle of the 
wrapper – don’t be tempted to overfill or it will be hard to seal. Use your 
finger to dampen the edge of the wrapper with a little water. Fold the wrapper 
in half, pleat the edge and press down to seal completely. Keep going until 
you’ve used up all the filling. The dumplings can be stored in the fridge for a 
couple of days or in the freezer for a few months.

4 When you are ready to cook the dumplings, make your dipping sauce by 
whisking all the ingredients together in a small bowl.

5 Put a little oil in a nonstick frying pan big enough to hold at least 8 
dumplings and put on a medium heat, remembering that you need to cook them in a 
single layer. As the pan starts to warm, put the dumplings in with their flat 
bottoms on the base. Fry them until they are golden underneath.

6 As soon as the bottoms are crisp, pour in hot water halfway up the side of 
the dumplings. Turn the heat up, bring the pan to the boil and cover with a 
lid. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 8 minutes.

7 When the dumplings are cooked, remove the lid and turn the heat up to high. 
The water should have almost evaporated. You now want to cook them for a final 
minute or so until the bottoms get nice and crisp. Serve warm with the dipping 
sauce.
