The Lincoln <https://www.theguardian.com/football/lincoln> City manager, Gary 
Simpson, has revealed he used jelly babies to get across tactical instructions 
to his players before Saturday’s win against Conference leaders Barnet.

The forward Ben Tomlinson tweeted a photo of the sweets 
<https://twitter.com/buddytomo/status/500729248261615617> positioned on top of 
a kit locker, along with the words “funny tactics board”.

Simpson, who appeared to line his Jelly Babies up in a 4-4-2 formation, told 
BBC radio Lincolnshire <http://www.bbc.co.uk/radiolincolnshire> he resorted to 
desperate measures after the team bus failed to turn up, leaving players to 
make their own way to the match and preventing him from transporting his normal 
tactics board.

“It wasn’t the best situation to be in, especially when you are going to the 
league leaders that haven’t conceded a goal, and had got off to an absolutely 
unbelievable start.”
