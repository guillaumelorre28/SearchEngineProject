Game, set and match Watson and Kontinen, 7-6, 6-4!

Second set: Watson/Kontinen*7-6 (7-5), 6-4 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

What a game from Kontinen! The Finn shows no signs of faltering, serving out 
to 15 to the delight of the Centre Court crowd.Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> is beside herself with 
excitement, and well she might be. That was an outstanding performance.

Farah keeps the contest alive with a swift hold. But it’s Kontinen to serve

Second set: Watson*/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5), 5-3 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

Watson holds with an ace. It came after some more sprightly interceptions from 
Kontinen at the net, and it leaves the unseeded pair a game away from the title.

Second set: Watson/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5), 4-3 Groenefeld*/Farah (*denotes server)

Ladies and gentlemen, we have the first break, Groenefeld sending a second 
serve long on game point. Perhaps she was looking for added depth on the 
delivery, because Watson has been causing the seeded pair some real problems 
with her returning. It was Kontinen who set up the chance, body-lining Farah 
with a brilliant backhand return.

Second set: Watson/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5), 2-3 Groenefeld/Farah* (*denotes server)

The first love game of the match – perhaps curiously, given that there have 
been no breaks so far – goes the way of the seeded pair, Farah holding with 
something to spare. Nice serving there from the Colombian.

Second set: Watson*/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5), 2-2 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

There’s been so much heartbreak for Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> at Wimbledon, what with her 
tearful defeat to Mathilde Johansson in 2011 and that thrilling near miss 
against Serena Williams last year – to name but two of her many lowlights – but 
the British No2 is looking a much happier camper here. Aided and abetted by 
some fine work at the net by Kontinen, she holds to 15.

Pressure, what pressure? The German, once ranked as high as 14th in singles, 
and withWimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> and French Open 
mixed titles on her CV, holds after being taken to deuce, Watson netting a 
forehand. Nimm das, as they might say in her native Nordhorn – or at least, 
that’s what Google translate tells me.

Good stuff from Kontinen, who ensures there is no hangover from that missed 
opportunity in the previous game. He holds to love and the pressure reverts to 
the Groenefeld serve.

A chance missed by Watson and Kontinen, and then some. Farah was 0-40 down 
there, but somehow dug out a gutsy hold to keep the seeded pair’s challenge on 
hold. They’ll be kicking themselves, will Watson and Kontinen.

Watson and Kontinen win the first set 7-6!

First set: Watson/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5) Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

A good start to the tiebreak by Watson and Kontinen gets even better when the 
Finn drives a low backhand return down the middle for 3-0. Watson safely 
negotiates her two service points, sealing the second with an ace, and the 
prospect of further British glory on Centre Court hoves firmly into view as the 
Anglo-Finnish pairing moves to 5-0. The advantage is wiped out in a trice, 
however, the seeded pair reeling off five successive points to level. But two 
successive missed volleys from Groenefeld, the second off a sizzling Watson 
backhand, leave the crowd favourites firmly in the driving seat. Watson and 
Kontinen a set to the good.

First set: Watson/Kontinen 6-6 Groenefeld*/Farah (*denotes server)

Groenefeld races to 40-0 before a moment of hesitancy brings a double-fault. 
She makes amends with a solid serve down the centre that Kontinen drives wide. 
We’re into a tiebreak.

First set: Watson*/Kontinen 6-5 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

Lovely play from Watson, who jams Groenfeld with a vicious body serve before 
producing an immaculate topspin lob off her favoured backhand side. They 
enjoyed that one, did the Centre Court crowd. Kontinen cuts off a weak return 
from Farah to bring up 40-15, and a couple of points later Watson cements the 
hold with a deep first serve.

The stylish Kontinen, who also reached the last eight in the men’s doubles

defeated in the 2008 boys’ singles final to a certain Grigor Dimitrov, he’s 
clearly keen to avoid a second losing appearance in aWimbledon

to keep the seeded pair in the set.

First set: Watson/Kontinen 4-4 Groenefeld*/Farah (*denotes server)

Watson and Kontinen get off to an auspicious start when the Finn nails a 
forehand winner past Farah at the net, leaving Grönefeld with work to do on her 
serve. A missed interception by Kontinen gets her back on track, but Grönefeld 
misses a volley on the next point to land herself in trouble again at 15-30. 
The German hangs on gamely, though, and at deuce conjures a lovely forehand 
winner only to be denied by a fine backhand return from Watson on the next 
point. A couple of deuces ensue before some flamboyant work from Farah at the 
net seals the deal for the seeded pair.

First set: Watson*/Kontinen 3-4 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

The Watson serve is probably the most vulnerable of the four on paper, but it 
doesn’t show. Serving at 40-30, after a bad miss at the net from Farah on the 
previous point, she sends down a 107mph ace to hold.

First set: Watson/Kontinen 3-3 Groenefeld/Farah* (*denotes server)

Robert Farah is no slouch. He’s ranked 28th in the world in singles and, as a 
former Australian Open quarter-finalist alongside countryman Juan Sebastián 
Cabal, the classy Colombian knows his way around a doubles court, too. A 
dominant performance on serve from Farah keeps us all square.

First set: Watson/Kontinen* 3-2 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

It’s been quite a ride for the unseeded Watson and Kontinen, who hadn’t played 
together before the fortnight began. They beat the defending champions Leander 
Paes and Martina Hingis in round three, having accounted for second seeds Bruno 
Soares and Elena Vesnina a round earlier, and they haven’t looked back since. 
The streaky Kontinen isn’t taking any prisoners here, slamming down a 
succession of big serves to run out a quick hold.

As I say, we’re a bit late to the party with this one. Sorry about that. But I 
can tell you that it’s going with serve, Watson having survived a couple of 
break points in the previous game as Anna-Lena Grönefeld steps up for her first 
service game at 1-2. She’s got pedigree in the mixed, has Grönefeld, having won 
here in 2009 alongside the retired doubles supremo Mark Knowles. She also won 
at Roland Garros a couple of years ago in tandem with Jean-Julien Rojer.

So here we are, albeit somewhat belatedly, for the mixed doubles final. Here’s 
hopingHeather Watson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson>, who 
partners Henri Kontinen of Finland, can finally experience a little joy in 
SW19. They’re up against the 15th seeds, Colombia’s Robert Farah and Anna-Lena 
Grönefeld from Germany. To get you in the mood, here’s Tim Lewis’s report on 
how Watson and Kontinen got here.

With shades of Jamie Murray and Jelena Jankovic in 2007 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/feb/19/tennis>, Britain will once again 
have an interest in the Wimbledon mixed doubles final on Sunday. There was a 
carnival feel on No1 Court on Saturday afternoon as Guernsey’sHeather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson>and Henri Kontinen from 
Finland blew past Oliver Marach and Jelena Ostapenko in their semi-final 7-6, 
6-3.

Watson and Kontinen, who had never played together in competition before this 
tournament, were smiling so much that it was hard to believe that aWimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon>final was at stake. “I’m pretty 
happy – OK, very happy,” Watson, 24, said later. “I don’t know what to say, but 
I’m having so much fun on the court with Henri.”

“It’s been a lot of fun,” Kontinen agreed, “and the results are following.”

Hugs and smiles all around as the players make their way up to the Royal Box 
to receive their trophies. What an afternoon for British tennis! That’s all 
from me. Thanks for reading and enjoy your evening.

Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen triumph in Wimbledon mixed doubles

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/10/heather-watson-henri-kontinen-wimbledon-mixed-doubles> 
Second set: Watson/Kontinen*7-6 (7-5), 6-4 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

What a game from Kontinen! The Finn shows no signs of faltering, serving out 
to 15 to the delight of the Centre Court crowd.Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> is beside herself with 
excitement, and well she might be. That was an outstanding performance.
 
Second set: Watson/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5), 5-4 Groenefeld/Farah* (*denotes server)

Farah keeps the contest alive with a swift hold. But it’s Kontinen to serve 
for the match next. He has yet to be broken. Will this be a moment to remember 
forHeather Watson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson>?
 
Second set: Watson*/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5), 5-3 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

Watson holds with an ace. It came after some more sprightly interceptions from 
Kontinen at the net, and it leaves the unseeded pair a game away from the title.
 
Second set: Watson/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5), 4-3 Groenefeld*/Farah (*denotes server)

Ladies and gentlemen, we have the first break, Groenefeld sending a second 
serve long on game point. Perhaps she was looking for added depth on the 
delivery, because Watson has been causing the seeded pair some real problems 
with her returning. It was Kontinen who set up the chance, body-lining Farah 
with a brilliant backhand return.
 
Second set: Watson/Kontinen* 7-6 (7-5), 3-3 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

Not to be outdone by Farah, Kontinen replies in kind with a quick hold. The 
ebullient Finn serves out to 15.
 
Second set: Watson/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5), 2-3 Groenefeld/Farah* (*denotes server)

The first love game of the match – perhaps curiously, given that there have 
been no breaks so far – goes the way of the seeded pair, Farah holding with 
something to spare. Nice serving there from the Colombian.
 
Second set: Watson*/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5), 2-2 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

There’s been so much heartbreak for Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> at Wimbledon, what with her 
tearful defeat to Mathilde Johansson in 2011 and that thrilling near miss 
against Serena Williams last year – to name but two of her many lowlights – but 
the British No2 is looking a much happier camper here. Aided and abetted by 
some fine work at the net by Kontinen, she holds to 15.
 
Second set: Watson/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5), 1-2 Groenefeld*/Farah (*denotes server)

Pressure, what pressure? The German, once ranked as high as 14th in singles, 
and withWimbledon <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> and French Open 
mixed titles on her CV, holds after being taken to deuce, Watson netting a 
forehand. Nimm das, as they might say in her native Nordhorn – or at least, 
that’s what Google translate tells me.
 
Second set: Watson/Kontinen* 7-6 (7-5), 1-1 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

Good stuff from Kontinen, who ensures there is no hangover from that missed 
opportunity in the previous game. He holds to love and the pressure reverts to 
the Groenefeld serve.
 
Second set: Watson/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5), 0-1 Groenefeld/Farah*(*denotes server)

A chance missed by Watson and Kontinen, and then some. Farah was 0-40 down 
there, but somehow dug out a gutsy hold to keep the seeded pair’s challenge on 
hold. They’ll be kicking themselves, will Watson and Kontinen.
 
First set: Watson/Kontinen 7-6 (7-5) Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

A good start to the tiebreak by Watson and Kontinen gets even better when the 
Finn drives a low backhand return down the middle for 3-0. Watson safely 
negotiates her two service points, sealing the second with an ace, and the 
prospect of further British glory on Centre Court hoves firmly into view as the 
Anglo-Finnish pairing moves to 5-0. The advantage is wiped out in a trice, 
however, the seeded pair reeling off five successive points to level. But two 
successive missed volleys from Groenefeld, the second off a sizzling Watson 
backhand, leave the crowd favourites firmly in the driving seat. Watson and 
Kontinen a set to the good.
 
First set: Watson/Kontinen 6-6 Groenefeld*/Farah (*denotes server)

Groenefeld races to 40-0 before a moment of hesitancy brings a double-fault. 
She makes amends with a solid serve down the centre that Kontinen drives wide. 
We’re into a tiebreak.



 
First set: Watson*/Kontinen 6-5 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

Lovely play from Watson, who jams Groenfeld with a vicious body serve before 
producing an immaculate topspin lob off her favoured backhand side. They 
enjoyed that one, did the Centre Court crowd. Kontinen cuts off a weak return 
from Farah to bring up 40-15, and a couple of points later Watson cements the 
hold with a deep first serve.
 
First set: Watson/Kontinen 5-5 Groenefeld/Farah* (*denotes server)

A tight first set continues. With 39 minutes gone, Farah serves out to 15. All 
eyes on the Watson serve again.
 
First set: Watson/Kontinen* 5-4 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

The stylish Kontinen, who also reached the last eight in the men’s doubles 
alongside John Peers of Australia, reels off another quick hold. Having been 
defeated in the 2008 boys’ singles final to a certain Grigor Dimitrov, he’s 
clearly keen to avoid a second losing appearance in aWimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> decider. Farah will have to serve 
to keep the seeded pair in the set.
 
First set: Watson/Kontinen 4-4 Groenefeld*/Farah (*denotes server)

Watson and Kontinen get off to an auspicious start when the Finn nails a 
forehand winner past Farah at the net, leaving Grönefeld with work to do on her 
serve. A missed interception by Kontinen gets her back on track, but Grönefeld 
misses a volley on the next point to land herself in trouble again at 15-30. 
The German hangs on gamely, though, and at deuce conjures a lovely forehand 
winner only to be denied by a fine backhand return from Watson on the next 
point. A couple of deuces ensue before some flamboyant work from Farah at the 
net seals the deal for the seeded pair.
 
First set: Watson*/Kontinen 3-4 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

The Watson serve is probably the most vulnerable of the four on paper, but it 
doesn’t show. Serving at 40-30, after a bad miss at the net from Farah on the 
previous point, she sends down a 107mph ace to hold.
 
First set: Watson/Kontinen 3-3 Groenefeld/Farah* (*denotes server)

Robert Farah is no slouch. He’s ranked 28th in the world in singles and, as a 
former Australian Open quarter-finalist alongside countryman Juan Sebastián 
Cabal, the classy Colombian knows his way around a doubles court, too. A 
dominant performance on serve from Farah keeps us all square.
 
First set: Watson/Kontinen* 3-2 Groenefeld/Farah (*denotes server)

It’s been quite a ride for the unseeded Watson and Kontinen, who hadn’t played 
together before the fortnight began. They beat the defending champions Leander 
Paes and Martina Hingis in round three, having accounted for second seeds Bruno 
Soares and Elena Vesnina a round earlier, and they haven’t looked back since. 
The streaky Kontinen isn’t taking any prisoners here, slamming down a 
succession of big serves to run out a quick hold.
 
First set: Watson/Kontinen 2-2 Groenefeld*/Farah (*denotes server)

Grönefeld, something of a veteran at 31, survives a deuce game to draw level 
at two games apiece as Watson nets a backhand return.
 
As I say, we’re a bit late to the party with this one. Sorry about that. But I 
can tell you that it’s going with serve, Watson having survived a couple of 
break points in the previous game as Anna-Lena Grönefeld steps up for her first 
service game at 1-2. She’s got pedigree in the mixed, has Grönefeld, having won 
here in 2009 alongside the retired doubles supremo Mark Knowles. She also won 
at Roland Garros a couple of years ago in tandem with Jean-Julien Rojer.
 
So here we are, albeit somewhat belatedly, for the mixed doubles final. Here’s 
hopingHeather Watson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson>, who 
partners Henri Kontinen of Finland, can finally experience a little joy in 
SW19. They’re up against the 15th seeds, Colombia’s Robert Farah and Anna-Lena 
Grönefeld from Germany. To get you in the mood, here’s Tim Lewis’s report on 
how Watson and Kontinen got here.

With shades of Jamie Murray and Jelena Jankovic in 2007 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/feb/19/tennis>, Britain will once again 
have an interest in the Wimbledon mixed doubles final on Sunday. There was a 
carnival feel on No1 Court on Saturday afternoon as Guernsey’sHeather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson>and Henri Kontinen from 
Finland blew past Oliver Marach and Jelena Ostapenko in their semi-final 7-6, 
6-3.

Watson and Kontinen, who had never played together in competition before this 
tournament, were smiling so much that it was hard to believe that aWimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon>final was at stake. “I’m pretty 
happy – OK, very happy,” Watson, 24, said later. “I don’t know what to say, but 
I’m having so much fun on the court with Henri.”

“It’s been a lot of fun,” Kontinen agreed, “and the results are following.”
