Ice-cream sandwiches Squidgy cookie, ice-cream, squidgy cookie: remind us what 
the point of ice-cream cones is again? Drizzle with caramel and roll in 
sprinkles.

Multitasking US supermarkets are trying to lure back online shoppers with free 
childcare, spa treatments, even yoga. In the UK, grooming and eating in the 
same place is becoming a thing. Because who wouldn’t want a wax followed 
immediately by lunch? (Although wine – yes, please.)

 Anyone for cricket? Photograph: Getty Images 
Bugs Fancy nibbling on cumin mealworms with your Aperol spritz? Paprika 
crickets with craft beer? French brandJimini <http://www.jiminis.com>’s spiced 
insects are intended to replace wasabi peas as the bar snack du jour, and are a 
hit in France and Belgium.

Mac’n’cheese We’re buying 550% more oozy, cheesy deliciousness than five years 
ago. Expect it spiked with jalapeños, studded with lobster or inside a 
(practically calorie-free) fried cheese and pasta sandwich.

Delivery With UberEats, Uber has muscled in on food delivery in London and 
beyond. Will its couriers beat Deliveroo’s black-and-turquoise riders? Maybe 
not:Deliveroo <https://www.theguardian.com/business/deliveroo> has 5,000 bikes 
on the road in the UK and is growing 25% month on month.

Tree water Beyoncé’s favourite maple water is out; birch, bamboo and aloe sap 
waters are in. Good if you like electrolytes, vitamins, minerals and the taste 
of wet tree.

 Seaweed is 2016’s kale. Photograph: Getty Images 
Kale 2016’s wonder green is officially seaweed, not least as Waitrose has 
started stocking it. And not just for Asian broths and seafood dishes: use it 
in bread, instead of pasta, in butters and salads, and as a salt substitute. 
Buy it ready-to-eat, wet or dried, fromJust Seaweed in Scotland 
<http://www.justseaweed.com/> or the Cornish Seaweed Company 
<http://cornishseaweed.co.uk/>.

Pumpkin latte It’s all about turmeric latte, or “golden milk”, now (though you 
have to make it with nut milk: the clean-eating mob won’t go anywhere near real 
dairy). True hipsters will already be soaking their chia and hemp seed oats in 
this stuff overnight.

 You’ve got 10 minutes before your coffee in a cone starts dripping down your 
arm 
Coffee cups Ice-cream in a cone may be passé (see Going Up), but lining one 
with chocolate and filling it with coffee is not. Baristas in South Africa 
nearly broke Instagram when they started posting#CoffeeInACone pictures 
<https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/coffeeinacone/?hl=en>. You’ve got 10 
minutes before the chocolate melts and espresso dribbles down your arm.

The pint glass “Built by thirsty boffins” is the tagline for Cobra’s 
reinvented beer glass. It’s got a swirly pattern on the inside, designed by 
scientists to create the perfect head of foam.

slushie, or those sticking plasters chefs use. Yes,that blue.

Sushi Move over maki. Poke (pronounced po-kay) is the only raw fish dish we’re 
eating now, served as it is in Hawaii, in a bowl with sesame oil, black rice 
and pickles. President Obama is a fan.

Limoncello Nancy Dell’Olio is launching Limonbello <http://www.limonbello.com>
, a sugar-free limoncello that she says is made to a family recipe. That’s the
