Atalanta <https://www.theguardian.com/football/atalanta> have rejected a £15m 
bid from Everton for Franck Kessié, with the Italian side determined to hold on 
to the 20-year-old until the end of the season despite continued interest from 
Chelsea.

Having had a £22m offer for Morgan Schneiderlin accepted by Manchester United

 on Tuesday night, Everton manager Ronald Koeman is pressing on with his plans 
to recruit more players in the January window after his side crashed out of the 
FA Cup to Leicester on Saturday. That has led to them launching a bid for 
Kessié, who is currently on international duty with the Ivory Coast before the 
Africa Cup of Nations having helped Atalanta climb to sixth place in Serie A.

The Chelsea manager, Antonio Conte, is also a huge admirer of the powerful 
midfielder and club officials have been discussing whether to launch a formal 
bid for several weeks, having indicated they would be willing to pay €25m (£21m)
at the end of December

.

Atalanta are holding out for up to €35m-€40m (£30m-£34m) for Kessié, who spent 
last season on loan at Cesena but has become a key player for the Nerazzurri 
this campaign. The 20-year-old has scored six goals in 16 appearances so far 
this season and is also interesting Juventus.
