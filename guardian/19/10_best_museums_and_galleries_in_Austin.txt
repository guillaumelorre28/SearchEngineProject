Mexic-Arte Museum


The Mexic-Arte experience begins before you walk in the door, with its north 
wall lined with murals that celebrate Latino figures and iconography. That 
mission to showcase traditional and contemporary Mexican and Latino art and 
culture continues inside the historic building, with wooden planked floors that 
squeak pleasingly underfoot. Mexic-Arte's curators comfortably straddle a 
commitment to old and new, with an annual exhibition devoted to emerging talent 
and an all-inclusive back gallery space devoted to community projects.

The Blanton Museum of Art

Set at the south corner of the University of Texas <http://www.utexas.edu/> 
campus, the Blanton Museum of Art blends in beautifully with the classical 
architecture, and the effect carries over into the museum's interior. The 
ground-floor atrium houses Teresita Fernández's permanent wall installation,
"Stacked Waters" 
<http://blantonmuseum.org/works_of_art/collections/rapoport_atrium>– 950m of 
shimmering stripes of blue. Close your eyes, and you'd swear you could hear the 
Mediterranean lapping softly, but you'll want to keep them open to take in the 
Blanton's impressive collection. The two-storey main building includes wings 
devoted to European paintings (with an emphasis on Renaissance and Baroque 
art), modern American and Latin American Art, and contemporary art. One of the 
premier university art museums in the US, the Blanton complex also includes a 
cafe, a museum shop, and an outdoor plaza that hums with activity between 
classes.

The Harry Ransom Center

The Harry Ransom Center has ruffled a few feathers over the years – Britons 
have accused the archive of poaching their national treasures – but there's 
just no arguing with the scope of the HRC's stunning holdings. The collection 
includes some 36m manuscripts, making unlikely neighbours of Lord Byron, Isaac 
Bashevis Singer, David Mamet and Robert De Niro. (A forewarning: though 
materials are readily available to researchers, appointments are required.) The 
first-floor gallery rotates materials from the archive – recent shows include a 
retrospective on futuristNorman Bel Geddes 
<http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/2012/normanbelgeddes/> and a 
photographic history of basketball – while permanent exhibits include a 
complete Gutenberg Bible, the first-ever photograph, a chronicle of the 
Center's first 50 years, and a regularly updated showcase of books based on HRC 
research materials.

Mondo Gallery

 Mondo Gallery, Austin, Texas 
You won't find Mondo's name on its Hyde Park storefront, just its distinctive 
serpentine insignia, which seems rather fitting for the gallery arm of the 
Austin-born-and-bredAlamo Drafthouse Cinema <http://drafthouse.com/austin>, 
regularly named the "coolest movie theatre in America". The Alamo also boasts 
the coolest design shop in town, commissioning collectible one-sheets by the 
likes ofOlly Moss 
<http://collider.com/mondo-olly-moss-dark-knight-rises/181650/> and Tim Doyle 
<http://www.mondoarchive.com/poster/phantom-of-the-paradise/?refer=search&search=Alamo%20Drafthouse>
, but the gallery space (opened in spring of 2012) puts them in their rightful 
context as works of art. You can cross the length of this converted bungalow 
inside of a minute, but genre film lovers will want to linger at Mondo's mix of 
archival movie posters and limited-edition screen prints that put new spins on 
pop culture.

Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum 

 Photograph: Visualist Images/flickr 
You're in Texas. You're going to have to get your "yeehaw" on, and this is the 
place to do it. Just a few blocks from the State Capitol, this facility offers 
a rah-rah rendering of the story of Texas, taking its cue from the Sam Houston 
quote etched in granite in the entrance: "Texas is the finest portion of the 
globe that has ever blessed my vision." This kid-friendly museum covers the 
basics – cowboys and Indians, ranchers and oil barons – as well as less 
well-travelled terrain, like the influence of all-black regiments (Buffalo 
soldiers) on post-civil war Texas. Also on site are two theatres, one with a 
six-storey IMAX screen.

senior/military $7, youth (four-17) $6. Open Mon-Sat 9am-6pm, Sun 12-6pm

Yard Dog Art Gallery
 Yard Dog Art Gallery, Austin, Texas Photograph: vendhq.com 
Right in the heart of the eclectic, electric SoCo neighborhood, Yard Dog sits 
within spitting distance of a vintage clothing shop and venerated western wear 
outpostAllens Boots <http://www.allensboots.com/>; that rubbing-elbows of old 
and new, quirky and classic, is a pretty good approximation for what makes Yard 
Dog so special. A gallery space and store (they sell prints) that celebrates 
some openings with live music, Yard Dog covers a broad spectrum from fine art 
to folk and outsider art, from former Faces keyboardist (and longtime 
Austinite) Ian McLagan's migraine-inspired paintings to the Sublime Stitching 
collective's embroidery kitsch.
• 1510 S Congress Ave, +1 512 912 1613, yarddog.com <http://www.yarddog.com>, 
free. Open Mon-Fri, 11am-5pm; Sat, 11am-6pm; Sun, 12pm-5pm

AMOA-Arthouse at the Jones Center

 Photograph: AMOA-Arthouse/flickr 
When the dazzling, multimillion-dollar renovation of downtown's Arthouse at 
the Jones Center opened in 2010, it made the Austin Museum of Art down the 
street look pretty shabby. Lucky, then, that the two institutions merged in 
2011 and set up permanent residence in this light-flooded, loft-like gallery 
with rooftop deck. (A second branch, an Italianate villa calledLaguna Gloria 
<http://theartschool.amoa.org/>, on Lake Austin, houses art classes.) The 
emphasis is on contemporary art, and one of the year's highlights is the annual 
5x7 art show and sale, featuring more than 1,000 works by an eclectic group of 
up-and-coming artists.
• 700 Congress Ave, +1 512 453 5312, amoa-arthouse.org 
<http://amoa-arthouse.org>, suggested donation $5. Open Wed noon-11pm; Thu-Sat

LBJ Presidential Library & Museum

 Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis 
This museum, exhibition space and research centre has much to offer on the 
life and legacy of the US's 36th president,Lyndon Baines Johnson 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson>, who took office after JFK's 
assassination and whose tumultuous tenure included such highs and lows as the 
Great Society social reforms and the escalation of the Vietnam War. And don't 
miss the creaky – a little bit creepy – animatronic LBJ, spouting Texas 
folkisms and tall tales. The library is on the east side of the University of 
Texas campus, but it's worth the 10-minute walk across campus to the College of 
Communication's Walter Cronkite Plaza to take in Ben Rubin's outdoor 
installation "And That's the Way It Is" <http://vimeo.com/40868539>, a 
text-based electronic tribute to the legendary anchorman whose1968 broadcast on 
Vietnam <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn4w-ud-TyE> hastened the end of the 
war.

Umlauf Sculpture Garden & Museum

 Umlauf Sculpture Garden & Museum, Austin, Texas 
You don't have to travel far to find green space in Austin, but rarer is the 
kind of serene, secret-garden quality the Umlauf has in spades. A short walk 
from town twin jewelsZilker Park 
<http://austintexas.gov/department/zilker-metropolitan-park> and the Barton 
Springs Pool <http://austintexas.gov/department/barton-springs-pool>, this 
South Austin outdoor space encourages hands-on appreciation of dozens of works 
by 20th-century sculptor and long-time Austin residentCharles Umlauf 
<http://umlaufsculpture.org/about/the-sculptor/>. (The bronze statues have been 
weather- and human-proofed with a wax coating.) Art and nature commingle in 
magical ways here, and it's catching. Tranquility is easy to come by on a 
guided tour, a private ramble, or during the twice-weekly morning yoga sessions.
• 605 Robert E Lee Rd, +1 512 445 5582, umlaufsculpture.org 
<http://umlaufsculpture.org/>, adult $3.50, student/senior $1, under-six free. 
Open Wed-Fri 10am-4.30pm, Sat-Sun 1pm-4.30pm

grayDUCK

 Gray Duck Gallery, Austin, Texas 
A relative newcomer, this privately owned gallery is a must-see stop in the 
revitalised South 1st Street arts and fine-dining district. (Don't forget to 
look to the sky for the historicMoonlight Tower 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_tower#Moonlight_towers_in_Austin.2C_Texas>
 at the intersection of Monroe St and S 1st, one of only a handful of late 
19th-century structures still standing and in use.) An open, airy feel – think 
stained concrete floors, exposed brick, and bright blasts of sun through 
skylights – belies the gallery's relatively small square footage. Mixed media 
works dominate the front room, while the back hosts more modestly priced 
pieces, such as locally designed gig poster art. One recent Saturday, the 
owner's puppy snoozed on a cushion whileLCD Soundsystem 
<http://www.myspace.com/lcdsoundsystem> played softly on the stereo; the vibe 
is so chill, you'll want to slow to an amble to soak it all in.
