Barrick Museum

Once a natural history museum, the Barrick Museum on the University of Nevada 
Las Vegas campus has changed its focus to art in an attempt to fill the void 
left when the Las Vegas Art Museum closed its doors in early 2009. The small 
staff at Barrick mounts rotating exhibits for the community while raising funds 
to become a full time art institution. Shows have ranged from contemporary 
paintings and sculpture to a photography exhibit of legendary photographerAnsel 
Adams <http://www.anseladams.com/>'s black-and-white works of American 
landscapes and architecture, which spans five decades. Also, stop in at the 
Donna Beam Fine Art Gallery, which rotates student exhibits with working 
contemporary artists.

Neon Museum
 Neon Museum, Las Vegas. 
The Neon Museum's outdoor Boneyard located in the city's Cultural Corridor 
<http://www.culturalcorridorvegas.org/> is not only an international tourist 
destination, but also a beloved project and collection for the Las Vegas 
community.The sign collection 
<http://www.neonmuseum.org/the-collection/neon-signs-project> goes back to the 
1930s and tells the story of a famous city that erupted in the desert. All 
that's often left of Vegas's past is the sculptural metal and neon, arranged in 
this gravel lot on Las Vegas Boulevard. The guided tours are often given by 
employees who are exhibiting artists, and are devoted to the rich narrative of 
this unique city.

Centerpiece Gallery
 Centerpiece Gallery, Las Vegas. 
It's unlikely you'll stumble across this white-walled gallery near the valet 
at CityCenter's Mandarin Oriental, but it's certainly worth seeking out. 
Depending on where you're coming from, you'll pass chunks of CityCenter's $40m 
art collection, including works by Maya Lin (a suspended rendition of the 
Colorado River made from reclaimed silver) and Frank Stella (a 32ft work on 
canvas from his protractor series) in registration lobbies. Look out for Nancy 
Rubins's Big Edge, a large boat bouquet made of more than 200 tethered canoes 
and aluminium boats, which serves as the centrepiece for the $9bn campus of 
hotels.

Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art

The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art manages to stir up a lot of press, and had 
visitors lining the corridor overlooking the outdoor landscaped pool when it 
opened in 1998. At the time, art exhibitions on the Strip were unprecedented. 
When a subsidiary of New York's Pace Wildenstein took over the gallery, it 
shocked art-world types by partnering with Boston's Museum of Fine Art, 
bringing works by Monet to the heart of Sin City. The gallery has also tapped 
into the collection at theMuseum of Contemporary Art San Diego 
<http://www.mcasd.org/index.php> to mount exhibits, including the current A 
Sense of Place: Landscapes from Monet to Hockney.

It wasn't too unusual to find Portland artist MK Guth <http://www.mkguth.com/> 
camped out at the Cosmopolitan hotel's P3 Studio this year with more than 200ft 
of synthetic blonde hair braided into her own mane. The Rapunzel-style art 
installation and performance, which included thoughts and dreams of hotel 
guests scribbled out on pieces of fabric, is just part of the creative 
narrative playing out at the hotel, which has also presented murals by Shepard 
Fairey and Kenny Scharf in its parking garage, and rolling digital art in the 
hotel lobby. You will find the studio next to the beer-and cocktail-sipping 
guests shooting pool in the busy P3 Commons.

Contemporary Arts Center

Not-for-profit arts groups in Las Vegas have battled hard for attention in a 
community built around a 24-hour gaming industry and its flashy entertainment 
scene, but if you look hard enough you'll find success stories such as the 
21-year-old Contemporary Arts Center and its avant-garde exhibits. Located in 
the industrial downtown arts district, the small gallery has brought in a 
diverse selection of artists and their works for rotating shows, including 
SOMArts Cultural Center's touring exhibit of work by Tony Labat, Dale Hoyt and 
Guillermo Gómez-Peña who mostly address political and social issues in video 
and sculptural/conceptual installations.

Trifecta Gallery

Set in the Arts Factory, the Trifecta Gallery has been one of few downtown 
galleries to survive, financially, in the arts district, maintaining solid 
exhibits focused on contemporary representational paintings and illustrations. 
The large three-room space in the old industrial brick building is where locals 
go to buy and experience works by, in the main, emerging artists, and to enjoy 
creative art openings such as the pancake breakfast that accompany high-end 
flapjack sculptures by Todd VonBastiaans and Bryan McCarthy.

Frank Gehry <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry>'s titanium-panelled 
structures that encase the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health are cultural 
destinations of their own, but inside the complex in downtown's developing 
Symphony Park is a rotating art collection of works by some of Gehry's big-name 
artist friends. Pre-scheduled tours of the building give visitors a chance to 
see (and buy) works, and among the permanent collection is James Rosenquist's 
Cervello Spazio Cosmico, a 10ft-by-20ft vertical painting, commissioned by the 
casino mogul and art collector Steve Wynn

Big Springs Gallery
 Big Springs Gallery 
Inside this 180-acre attraction focused on interactive exhibits about 
sustainability and the history of the desert environment is The Origen gallery. 
A quiet, dimly lit, meditative and contemporary space, the gallery features 
work by mainly local and regional artists – established and emerging – who 
create pieces influenced by the desert environment and the glitter city plopped 
into it. Exhibits range from a show of multimedia contemporary works responding 
to desert colours influenced by intense natural or manmade lighting to fine art

Clark County Government Center

In an area where city galleries and museums are scarce, curators often rely on 
exhibits in public spaces to reach visitors. The circular Clark County 
Government Center, designed to reflect the desert's natural beauty in form and 
materials, includes a cavernous rotunda where locals find themselves strolling 
through large-scale installations by artists who have worked and studied in Las 
Vegas.Justin Favela's cardboard appropriations of CityCenter artworks 
<http://justinfavela.com/> may have been quizzical to the incidental observer, 
but was a favourite among locals amused by the somewhat satirical cardboard 
recreation of a $40m art collection.
