I have often wondered why we Liverpool supporters don’t join with those of 
Manchester to celebrate the great Matt Busby (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/05/manchester-united-matt-busby-old-trafford>
, Sport, 6 September) whosefive seasons at Anfield (1936-41) 
<http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/past-players/matt-busby> are too easily 
forgotten. I remember his playing style as if it were yesterday – distinctively 
hunched over the ball, using his instep to pass with accuracy and elegance. The 
most cultured footballer I’ve ever seen.

• Anyone unconvinced by Nicholas Kenyon’s defence of the Last Night of the 
Proms (Raising a flag 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/07/last-night-of-the-proms-nicholas-kenyon-brexit>
, G2, 7 September) should read Hannah French’s interesting article on Parry’s 
Jerusalem in the Proms Official Guide. She notes the piece was used, to Parry’s 
delight, by the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies.

• The Last Night of the Proms is truly international. In Esbjerg the annual 
festival week ends with Land of Hope and Glory sung in Danish to the 
enthusiastic waving of Danish flags; in Hamburg Anglophile Germans sing it 
lustily in English at their annual open-airProms

• It seems that the designers of the Philae lander were not followers of Robot 
Wars, as otherwise they would have fitted it with a self-righting mechanism (

• Ah yes, but remember, the man who was derided for attending a funeral in 
“brahn boots” (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/our-best-wishes-to-bishop-nick>, 
6 September) did so because he’d given his black boots to a poor chap who had 
no boots at all.

• In 1971 I wore my dark mulberry suit and burgundy shoes for an interview at 
the Bank of London and South America. At the end, one of the panel said, 
quietly, “Great threads, man.” I didn’t get the job.
