Svetlana Kuznetsova is one win away from qualifying for the WTA Finals in 
Singapore at the expense of Britain’sJohanna Konta 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/johanna-konta> after fighting her way into 
the final of the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. The defending champion and top seed 
defeated Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina 6-1, 6-7, 6-4 in the last four.
 If she can win the final, the Russian will overtake Konta, who was named most 
improved player of the year on Friday, and claim the final spot for the 
season-ending eight-woman showpiece. Konta is in Singapore and has been taking 
part in the buildup to the event but, having been sidelined by an abdominal 
injury, she can do nothing but watch and wait.
It is a far from ideal situation for all involved, with the draw taking place 
on Friday despite only seven of the participants being known.
The world No1, Angelique Kerber, is in the Red Group alongside Simona Halep, 
Madison Keys and Dominika Cibulkova. The second seed Agnieszka Radwanska is 
joined in the White Group by Karolina Pliskova, the French Open champion 
Garbiñe Muguruza and either Konta or Kuznetsova.
