Crystal Palace <https://www.theguardian.com/football/crystalpalace> are ready 
to rival West Ham United’s attempts to sign the Hull City winger Robert 
Snodgrass, with the Scotland international expected to cost up to £9m despite 
having just 18 months remaining on his contract.

West Ham saw a £3m bid for the 29-year-old rejected on Friday, with Slaven 
Bilic’s side expected to return with a new offer over the weekend. Sam 
Allardyce, the Palace manager, is also keen on signing Snodgrass, whorefused to 
sign a new three-year contract

extension that means he is tied to the club until the summer of 2018.
