Volkswagen has appointed a historian to look into the carmaker’s actions 
during Brazil’s military dictatorship, following allegations it had allowed the 
torture of employees critical of the regime.


The move comes after former employees filed a civil lawsuit in Brazil 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil> last year which claimed 12 workers 
were arrested and tortured in a VW factory near Sao Paulo during the 1964-1985 
dictatorship, and dozens of people there were placed on a blacklist.

Volkswagen said on Thursday that it had commissioned Professor Christopher 
Kopper of Bielefeld University in Germany “to clarify the group’s role during 
the military dictatorship in Brazil”.

The announcement was overshadowed however by a spat brewing at home over the 
sudden departure last month of VW’s longtime chief historian Manfred Grieger, 
who led efforts to shed light on the group’s actions in Nazi Germany.

Founded in the 1930s by a Nazi trade union, VW has in the past won praise for 
being open about its actions during the second world war, when it used 
concentration camp internees and prisoners of war as slave labour in its 
factories.

But Grieger’s departure apparently came after he criticised a study into the 
past of VW’s Audi subsidiary which he said downplayed its Nazi links, DPA news 
agency reported.

Some 75 researchers and historians wrote an open letter this week in Grieger’s 
defence and warned VW against trying to cover up the “dark pages” of its 
history.

But VW strongly denied that Grieger was dismissed or forced out.

“We are surprised by these assumptions. They are not based on anything,” it 
said in a reaction sent to AFP.

“Volkswagen has consistently and honestly worked through its corporate 
history, and will continue to do so,” it added.

In 1938, Adolf Hitler laid the foundation stone for a Volkswagen factory in 
the firm’s home town of Wolfsburg in northern Germany, with the aim to build an 
affordable car for all Germans – which would go on to become the famous Beetle.
