End 2016 with my take on the classic vesper. It can be vodka-heavy or 
gin-heavy: just swap one for the other, according to taste. Unlike James Bond’s 
version, however, this is stirred, not shaken. Serves one.

35ml vodka (I use Sipsmith) 
25ml gin (Sipsmith again, for preference)
15ml Cocchi Americano (or Lillet)

Fill a mixing glass with ice, add all the ingredients and stir briefly, to 
chill and balance. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass, garnish with a strip 
of lemon peel and serve.
