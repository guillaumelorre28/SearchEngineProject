Fog, which held up traffic over many parts of Britain yesterday, causing 
trains to be cancelled and dislocating air services, is expected to persist 
near large towns today. Last night dense local fog in the London area reduced 
visibility in places to only ten yards; at Richmond Bridge it was almost nil.

On British Railways yesterday, the Eastern Region was the worst hit. Although 
trains were running normally into London, a fog service, causing the 
cancellation of a number of trains, was operated on some suburban services from 
King's Cross.

About twenty British European Airways flights from the Continent, Glasgow, 
Manchester and Belfast were diverted from Northolt to London Airport, 
Blackbushe, and Bovingdon, Hertfordshire, causing delays of up to an hour and a 
half. Last night, visibility at London Airport fell to 300 yards. Four British 
Overseas Airways Incoming services were diverted to Hurn, near Bournemouth; 
passengers travelled to London by train and coach.

A baby of eighteen months was among passengers stranded at Ringway Airport, 
Manchester, last night when a K.L.M air liner from Dublin to Amsterdam was 
unable to complete its journey because of thick fog in Holland. The child, 
Johnny Boyle, was travelling alone: he was on his way from Dublin to a couple 
who are adopting him in Holland. A member of the K.L.M staff at Ringway took 
him home to be cared for until this morning's plane.

Road surfaces in the Cotswolds were still ice-bound and dangerous yesterday 
afternoon: and over high ground between Manchester and Leeds and in parts of 
Westmoreland and Cumberland A.A patrols reported "very icy" conditions.
