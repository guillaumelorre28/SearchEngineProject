Frenchmen Street and the home of jazz

Tourists flock to Bourbon Street but wise visitors head to Frenchmen Street, 
just outside the French Quarter, to hear cutting-edge jazz. The start of this 
club-lined strip provides the musical nexus for legendary locales such asSnug 
Harbor <http://www.snugjazz.com/site/>, the Blue Nile <http://bluenilelive.com/>
, andthe Palm Court Jazz Cafe <http://www.palmcourtjazzcafe.com/>. Frenchmen 
ends at theOld Mint <http://www.crt.state.la.us/museum/properties/usmint/>, now 
a jazz museum withLouis Armstrong 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/louis-armstrong>'s original horn on 
permanent display. Yet, in 1768, six Frenchmen were executed there after 
rebelling against the Spanish. Their crime? Authoring Le Manifeste, declaring 
the rights of man to form his own government – eight years before Thomas 
Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. Hence, Frenchmen Street.

From Frenchmen Street, cross the French Market, and smell the scent of beignets
 baking. Savour the cafe au lait brewing, and hear the saxophones harmonising. 
Welcome to Jackson Square, the nerve centre of historic New Orleans.St Louis 
Cathedral <http://stlouiscathedral.org/> sits across the square from Café Du 
Monde, flanked by theCabildo 
<http://www.crt.state.la.us/museum/properties/cabildo/> and Prebytere 
<http://www.crt.state.la.us/museum/properties/presbytere/> museums, all of 
which are must-visits. Experience the Louisiana Purchase and thePlessy v 
Ferguson case <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson> at the Cabildo. 
At the Presbytere, feel the fear ofHurricane Katrina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricanekatrina>'s coming waters and the 
joy of Carnival's parades, balls, andCourir de Mardi Gras 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courir_de_Mardi_Gras>. Then, travel back in time 
to the 1850 House with a Friends of the Cabildo walking tour. Beignet in hand, 
gaze upon the magnificent Mississippi river.

Mardi Gras Krewe Rooms

Cut down Pirate's Alley and pass the Royal Street art galleries to the second 
oldest restaurant in the US. At Antoine's (established 1840), dine on oysters 
Rockefeller ($14.75), and ask your waiter to tour the Mardi Gras Krewe rooms. 
Sit in the Rex Room where the Kings of Carnival are enthroned. Look at the 
photo of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor bowing before Rex – when an actual 
monarch, albeit a former one, genuflected before a carnival king. (In 1950, it 
caused an international incident.)

Congo Square

Walk another two blocks to an elegant supper club with a not-local name - but 
a truly Big Easy sound. The Bombay Club's melodies and signature martinis make 
a perfect stopover on the trek to the birthplace of jazz,Congo Square 
<http://www.nola.gov/parks-and-parkways/parks-squares/congo-square-louis-armstrong-park/>
. This where jazz developed from West African rhythms – slaves gathered here on 
Sundays, their day off, to sing, beat drums and celebrate. Also feel jazz's 
roots in the second lines of superstitious mourners, blowing horns and beating 
drums, as their ghosts dance towards St Louis #1 Cemetery, three blocks away. 
Visit the above-ground crypts, including voodoo queen Marie Laveau's.

The Carousel Bar at Montleone Hotel

To have a Ramos Gin Fizz at the rotating Carousel Bar is to commune with 
Tennessee Williams <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tennesseewilliams>, 
William Faulkner <https://www.theguardian.com/books/williamfaulkner>, Truman 
Capote <https://www.theguardian.com/books/truman-capote> and the other deans of 
American literature who gathered in this bar in the early 20th century. They 
knew that next door, 100 years earlier, Congress allowed the Orleans' Citizens 
State Bank to print $10 bills or, in French, "dix" notes. Americans called the 
money "Dixies," and hence the south became known as the Land of the Dixie.

Serio's Po-Boys and Deli

It is fitting that the oldest continuous railway in America stops here as 
po'boy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po%27_boy> sandwiches were created to feed 
striking streetcar conductors in the 1920s. And the trolley station in front of 
Serio's sits mere feet from another New Orleans peculiarity: ask a local what 
to call the wide middle of the adjacent Canal Street, and they shall reply: 
"Neutral Ground." Today, streetcars traverse the centre of Canal Street. Once, 
though, Americans feared to cross that neutral ground, the dividing line 
between the older French/Spanish colonial-era city and the American sector.

however, at Washington Avenue for jazz brunch at Commander's Palace on Saturday

erected when Louisiana sugar sold for $20 a pound – in 1840.

Oak Street

Our streetcar then carries you to Southern Bohemia, Oak Street, with its 
"FunKay" clothing resale and antique shops, bookstores, and breakfast joints 
with jazz accompaniment. Anchoring Oak Street's entrance, the Vietnamese have 
melded into our Creole culture. Just as more Irish came to New Orleans than any 
city but Boston, and more Italians than anywhere but New York, many Vietnamese 
Catholics ended up here after the fall of another tropical city, Saigon. They 
gave us both America's first Viet-American Congressman (Ánh "Joseph" Quang Cao),
and the dish pho (or Vietnamese) gumbo. And, you haven't lived until you've had 
abánh mì sandwich or, as we call it in New Orleans, a "Vietnamese po'boy".

In St Bernard, just down from the French Quarter, Sicilians settled beside 
Canary Islanders and Cajuns to create a unique culture. At Rocky and Carlos, 
fusion means meatballs with gumbo on the side – emblematic of the different 
strains of Americans who gathered to fight the last-ever US engagement against 
British troops, just down the street at Chalmette battlefield, ending the War 
of 1812. The bicentennial of thatBattle of New Orleans 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans> is in January 2015 and 
over 2,000 historical re-enactors from Britain and America will dine at Rocky & 
Carlos after they have recreated the battle itself at the 22-acre Meraux 
Battlegrounds Living History Park, just a mile from the eatery.
