I reached the age of 36 without ever owning a car. It is one of the reasons I 
find driving so romantic. I have never wasted precious evenings stuck in 
commuter traffic, my windscreen fogging with boredom. I have never noticed the 
outrageous price of petrol. My week has never been thrown into chaos by the 
sudden blinking of a warning light on the dashboard, followed by the apologetic 
cough of a failing starter motor.

Earlier this year, I took the plunge. I wanted to explore the British 
countryside – in style – so I bought my first car, a 1972 MGB soft-top, with a 
bright blue finish and a sexy growl. My popularity among my friends suddenly 
soared.

For our first adventure, I wanted a road trip that was worthy of my 
romanticism – one that combined rural charm with a spike of old-school glamour. 
I’m an utter sucker for a country house – the first thing I bought for the car 
was a National Trust sticker – and I had dreams of sweeping up a carriageway to 
a grand portico-ed entrance, emerging in a floor-length dress and handing the 
keys to a waiting footman.

Shropshire and Worcestershire. Photograph: Emma John for the Guardian 
Living in the south-east, I’ve always enjoyed the Cotswolds as a place to slip 
into a fantasy of life as it used to be lived. Just beyond them, however, is an 
area I’ve never explored at all: the western Midlands between Worcestershire 
and Shropshire, skirting the fringes of Birmingham, promises hill ranges, 
nature reserves, and long country drives punctuated with picturesque villages. 
Instead of the better-known Cotswolds destinations of Stow-in-the-Wold and 
Chipping Norton, it offers the equally quaintly named Bobbington, Stoke Bliss 
and Quatt.

This section of map, whose sole claim to urban fame is the mighty 
Kidderminster, is also pleasingly dotted with symbols for stately homes and 
gardens, most of which I’ve never heard of but which, on closer investigation, 
offer a rich seam of history, from medieval abbeys to the Civil War, Georgian 
elegance and the industrial revolution. There are teashops, village pubs, and 
eggs to be bought from roadside stalls. It’s a hidden slice of quintessential 
England – without coach tours or honeypot prices.

It was while researching the area that I came across Capability Brown’s website
 <http://www.capabilitybrown.org>. Not that the famous landscape gardener blogs 
there himself, of course – he’s been dead since 1783 – but he has left a legacy 
of more than 250 gardens, parks and pleasure grounds across the UK. Several of 
them are open to the public for the first time this year, as part of the 300th 
anniversary celebrations of his birth. There’s an even aninteractive map 
<http://www.capabilitybrown.org/map> to help with trip planning.

 Weston Park, Staffordshire 
The website helped me discover my dream destination: Weston Park 
<http://www.weston-park.com/>, Shropshire. The 17th-century mansion – in 1,000 
acres of parkland between Birmingham and Shrewsbury – positively encourages 
guests to indulge their aristo-fantasies. The main house, has 28 en suite 
bedrooms or the whole house can be hired – including multiple drawing rooms, 
banquet hall and collection of fine art and silver (from £215pp pn, meals 
included). I chose, instead, to stay in its Temple of Diana, the summerhouse 
built for Weston’s fifth baronet, Sir Henry Bridgeman, in the 1760s, and 
refurbished last year to create a classy holiday let sleeping six (from £1,051 
for a three-night stay,ruralretreats.co.uk 
<http://www.ruralretreats.co.uk/england/shropshire-holiday-cottages/temple-of-diana_sh027?Date=09-11-2016&Nights=3>
).

Shropshire’s proximity to Wales has always made me imagine a far-off place, 
but within 2½ hours of leaving London, I was approaching the neoclassical 
folly, dodging the estate’s free-roaming sheep. Curved doors set into circular 
walls led through a sequence of increasingly jaw-dropping interiors, from the 
muralled music room where Bridgeman’s wife and children took tea, up a spiral 
stone staircase straight out of Professor Dumbledore’s library, to three 
bedrooms, one of them circular.

 The Temple of Diana with its impressive orangery 
The showstopper is the orangery, with pavilion-style glass walls and stucco 
ceiling. Some friends were joining me for the night, and I waited for them in 
quiet contemplation, as the sun set behind AE Housman’s blue remembered hills. 
The light across the serene, rolling landscape glowed corn yellow, then vibrant 
orange, the colours as solid as if they literally hung in the air.

By the time my friends arrived, a super moon had risen over the lake behind 
the building, and bats flitted across its surface. The Temple itself was the 
brightest spot in the grounds, beaming light and the promise of cocktail 
parties. We put on some Justin Bieber and danced wildly across the flagstones. 
It felt like the decadent thing to do.

 Shifnal, Shropshire, is the ‘nicest little town around’ - and just 12 miles 
from Wolverhampton. 
The Temple has a kitchen to die for, but there is also, for those who wish 
they had staff to handle that side of things, a restaurant and deli in Weston 
Park’s former Granary. The head chef, Guy Day, told us he was a huge fan of 
fresh and cured meats fromWenlock Edge Farm <http://www.wenlockedgefarm.co.uk/>
. He was excited, too, aboutFish <http://fishbridgnorth.co.uk/>, a new 
fishmonger-cum-cafe in Bridgnorth. “Obviously, being landlocked, Shropshire 
hasn’t been known for its fish,” he smiled. If we decided to visit nearby 
Ironbridge, he said, we should look out forEley’s pork pies 
<http://www.eleysporkpies.co.uk/> , which can even be personalised

My friends departed for home – all but Alex, who, with one look at my car, 
shrugged off her day job and offered her services as navigator. Driving the 
B-roads around Weston we were caught out less by map-reading mishaps than by 
rural opening hours – or, more accurately, closing hours (Monday, especially, 
was not a good day to decide you want a pub lunch). Happily, the town of 
Shifnal had several pubs – including the dark-panelled, low-ceilingedPlough Inn 
<http://www.theploughinnshifnal.co.uk/> , which was still serving.

 Emma John with her new baby. 
Its high street had a mixture of unfailingly friendly businesses – coffee 
shops, bakers, grocers, a Balti house, and two of the most immaculately kept 
charity shops I’d ever seen. At Jackson’s of Shifnal, a cheery butcher named 
Graham tried to help as I stood, baffled, in front of a large range of pies. 
One of them, the “Big Fidget”, appealed precisely because it was what my mum 
used to call me when I was growing up.

“That’s a local recipe,” said Graham. “Ham, apple and onions.” We took one (it 
was delicious), along with some Shropshire Blue cheese, and eggs too big to fit 
in their boxes. I asked Graham where he was from. “Cound,” he said. It’s a 
village on the Severn about half an hour away. Should I check it out? “There’s 
nothing there but a handful of houses!” he laughed. “No, this is the nicest 
little town around: 12 miles from Wolverhampton, but it’s like you’re in a 
different world. We’ve got everything we need on our doorstep.”

 Inside a yurt at Worcester Glamping 
Heading south towards Worcester, the meandering country roads were well-suited 
to the low-slung, corner-hugging MGB – less so to Alex, who was convinced we 
were travelling far faster than our modest 50mph. We’d booked into a “glamping 
site” on the outskirts of town, and I was a little sceptical that a yurt just 
off the A449 would feel glamorous after Weston.

In the end, it wasn’t the yurts that grabbed our attention as much as the herd 
of cattle next door.Worcester Glamping <http://worcesterglamping.co.uk/> (from 
£65 a night for two) is, it transpired, on a dairy farm, one that also 
specialises in ice cream (bennettsicecream.co.uk 
<http://www.bennettsicecream.co.uk/>). This definitely seemed good news.

 Worcestershire Beacon in the Malvern Hills. Photograph: Alamy 
The yurt’s interior was more cosy than luxe, and the wood stove was easy to 
stoke, so we didn’t require the hot water bottles left thoughtfully on our 
beds. For dinner, our hosts recommended Cromwell’s 
<http://www.cromwellsrestaurant.com/>, a Nepalese curry house up the road: 
“They’ll deliver, if you give them this address.” Camping had never seemed so 
simple. A mere half-hour later, Alex and I were sitting outdoors, drinking 
beers and tucking intochhate milan, a deep, dark mushroomy dish. It may not 
have been fine dining, but it felt pretty damn luxurious.

The next day, our hosts pointed out the footpath along the banks of the 
Severn. “You can walk from here right to Worcester cathedral, or go the other 
way to where it meets the Teme – it’s really pretty.” But fuelled by the 
flavours of Nepal, we decided to the nearest thing these parts have to the 
Himalayas. The Malvern hills, 20 minutes out of Worcester, make for a great 
walk – and an even better drive, since there are car parks halfway up 
Worcestershire Beacon that help you avoid the hard schlep.

Anyway, you don’t need to have “earned” the view to appreciate the drama of 
the Malvern ridge. There was a moment, near the top of the beacon, where our 
line of sight was completely obscured by the long green ridge ahead. Then one 
footstep higher, our eyes were suddenly flooded with the green patchwork of 
three counties (Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire), and a vista 
that stretched to the Welsh border and beyond.

 Dudmaston Hall was transformed by landscape gardening. Photograph: Alamy 
If the Malverns are a dream of England, they are one that Lancelot 
“Capability” Brown spent his life attempting to make into reality.Croome 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/croome>, the Earl of Coventry’s country 
estate, was Brown’s first independent commission, and one of the best examples 
of his work in the region.

It seemed the perfect end to a trip that had been spent in pursuit of the life 
beautiful. The patch of the west Midlands where Shropshire, Staffordshire and 
Worcestershire meet has a profusion of fascinating historic houses and gardens: 
after Weston Park, we had flexed our National Trust passes first atWightwick 
Manor <http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wightwick-manor-and-gardens>, an arts 
and crafts home owned by a wealthy industrialist and filled with William Morris 
fabrics and wallpapers, and then atDudmaston Hall 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dudmaston>, a wooded, medieval estate 
transformed, in the latter half of the 18th century, by the new yen for 
landscape gardening. The “Dingle”, an artfully constructed valley, with winding 
paths, brooks and bridges, remains as romantic today as a Jane Austen heroine

But Croome was fiction on a different scale. Brown drained the water from its 
boggy land to create a lake vast enough to boat on; he hid the house’s Jacobean 
brick behind a Palladian facade; he built ha-has to create the illusion of open 
parkland; and he even dismantled and moved an entire village to make for a 
better vista.

As we walked slowly around his “pleasure grounds”, along sinuous paths, past 
tranquil bodies of water, Brown’s brilliant eye was in evidence everywhere. 
Oaks and cedars of Lebanon planted by him still stand, colouring the landscape 
with contrast. Follies drew our eyes to the horizon. “The house doesn’t have a 
bad angle,” observed Alex, as we came across yet another brilliantly conceived 
viewpoint, and bathed in the glow from its Bath stone.

A monument to Brown – placed near a grotto he’d created for imaginary nymphs 
to live in – remembers a man “who by the power of his inimitable and creative 
genius, formed this garden out of a morass”. Fifty miles away, his grandest and 
most famous work, atBlenheim Palace <http://www.blenheimpalace.com/>, is 
visited by hundreds every day. Here at Croome, it was easier to believe, as we 
stood and gazed, that it was all designed just for our benefit.
