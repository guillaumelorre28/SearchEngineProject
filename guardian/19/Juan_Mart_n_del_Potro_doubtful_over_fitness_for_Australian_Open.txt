The former US Open champion, Juan Martín del Potro 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/juan-martin-del-potro>, has said he is 
unlikely to be fit enough to play in next month’s Australian Open while casting 
doubt on whether he would play in the Davis Cup first round tie at home to 
Italy in February when Argentina begin the defence of their title.

 “What I need is to have someone get me physically fit enough to last the 
whole year,” he said. “There’s a fortnight to the Australia Open and I’m 
unlikely to make that objective. We’re looking at what the priority is. If 
tennis waited for me for two years, Australia can wait for me for one more.“

 Del Potro is set to play two exhibition matches against Spaniard David Ferrer 
in Buenos Aires and at the seaside resort of Mar del Plata on 27 and 28 
December.

 Having been plagued by injury problems, he enjoyed an unexpectedly good 2016 
season, having recovered from a third wrist operation early in the year. The 
28-year-old won the silver medal at the Rio Olympics in August, after knocking 
out favourite Novak Djokovic in the opening round, then helped Argentina win 
the Davis Cup for the first time.

 Argentina begin the defence of their title against Italy in Buenos Aires from 
3 February, but Del Potro said he was unsure if he would feature in the tie. 
“There’s still some time to the first tie against Italy but not so much and 
it’s going to be on clay and that’s a surface I struggle on,” he said.
