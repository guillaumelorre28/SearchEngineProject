Bar Tartine

This stylish Mission district restaurant is consistently packed, with 
dedicated locals frequently returning for another hit of chef Nicolaus Balla's 
unclassifiable but utterly delicious cuisine that dabbles in flavours from 
places such as Hungary, Japan and Denmark, as well as California. Try the 
irresistible fried langos potato bread and daytimesmørrebrød 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sm%C3%B8rrebr%C3%B8d> sandwiches (like steak 
tartare on owner-baker Chad Robertson's sprouted rye bread). Many dishes 
feature house-fermented and housemade items, including butter, cheese, and 
specially-grown peppers. Pair it all with choice beers and small-producer 
wines, and you'll see why this place is a hot ticket. Diners also come by for 
lunchtime sandwiches and weekend brunch.

Aziza
 Aziza San Francisco 
Dedicated local gourmands know the trek to the Outer Richmond 
<http://sanfrancisco.about.com/od/neighborhoodprofiles/ig/sfmaps/Outer-Richmond-Map---Overview.htm>
 is well worth it for the experience of dining on Mourad Lahlou's contemporary 
Cal-Moroccan cuisine. His flavour-packed food is sophisticated, soulful, and 
inspired (you've never had chicken wings like the ones here), and features 
ingredients at the height of seasonality. The culinary-minded cocktails are a 
can't-miss, and there are many choice selections on the wine list. No belly 
dancers here – but you will find some exquisite couscous andbasteeya (spicy 
chicken pastries), and desserts are quite special. Go for the tasting menu 
($95) for a full-on experience.

Chef Melissa Perello has had diners lining up at her door for her authentic 
take on California cuisine from day one for a reason – no one does it like she 
does. Her highly personal cuisine delivers on so many levels: execution, 
flavour, interest, value … it's like she knows exactly what you're craving for 
dinner. Start with the hearty bouchées, like the creamypanisse frites, baked 
cherrystone clams, and bacon beignets, before moving your way into a satisfying 
kale salad, and a perfect bavette steak. The wines will be matched seemingly 
effortlessly, and the service will strike that gentle balance of warmth and 
professionalism. Reservations are tough to land (call and see) but queuing up 
before they open can yield success.

ICHI Sushi

On a remote stretch of Mission Street – far from the Valencia Street action – 
is this buzzing place serving a new and California-ised style of sushi, 
chef-owner Tim Archuleta's creative spin onnigiri. He takes exquisite (and 
sustainably sourced) seafood and adorns it with bright touches such asyuzu-ponzu
 gel, pickled kelp, oryuzu kosho <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzukosh%C5%8D>. 
Omakase (chef's choice) is the way to go. The vibe is casual and energetic, 
with quality sake flowing, and regulars chowing down on fantastic yuzu chicken 
wings and oysters as well. Look for an expansion into a second space nearby 
later this year.
• 3369 Mission Street, +1 415 525 4750, ichisushi.com <http://ichisushi.com/>. 
Open Mon-Thurs 5.30pm-10pm, Fri-Sat 5.30pm-11pm, traditional rolls from $3.50

Mission Chinese Food
 Mission Chinese Food, San Francisco 
Who knew how much press a restaurant tucked inside a grimy Mission district 
Chinese dive named Lung Shan was going to generate? This place is a house on 
fire, just like its incendiary food. Chef Danny Bowien and crew have created a 
new genre of Chinese food, one that uses Sichuan peppercorns, quality 
ingredients, and bold flavours in abundance. The food is crazy-affordable, and 
crazy-delicious; thekung pao pastrami, Sichuan pickles, salt cod rice, and ma po
 tofu should all be on your table. There's a better chance of landing a table 
at lunch than dinner, but the nighttime scene of hungry hipsters is a large 
part of the fun.
• 2234 Mission Street, +1 415 863 2800, missionchinesefood.com 
<http://missionchinesefood.com/>. Open 11.30am-3pm and 5pm-10.30pm daily 
(closed Wednesday), small dishes from $4

Namu Gaji
 Namu Gaji, San Francisco 
Here's yet another example of why the culinary scene in the Mission district 
is one of the city's most interesting. The trio of Lee brothers have 
collaborated on this energetic restaurant with an appetising menu of new 
Korean-American dishes; from theokonomiyaki to the bibimbap (both come in 
searing-hot stone pots), you'll note the balanced flavours and fresh 
ingredients (the Lees have their own farm that grows special herbs and 
vegetables for them). The potato puffs, beef tongue, and Korean fried chicken 
are other faves. Chef Dennis Lee is such a talent, and the location – kitty 
corner to Dolores Park – makes this corner restaurant one to visit (it's also 
open for lunch). Bonus for oenophiles: the tight yet outré wine list is fun.
• 499 Dolores Street, +1 415 431 6268, namusf.com <http://www.namusf.com/>. 
Open for dinner Tues-Thurs 5pm-10pm, Fri-Sat 5pm-11pm, open for lunch Wed-Sun 
11.30am-4pm, mains from $10

Nopalito
 Nopalito, San Francisco 
This Mexican restaurant is so popular that it now has two locations: by the 
Panhandle and the Inner Sunset. Chefs José Ramos and Gonzalo Guzman learned 
about using top-notch ingredients while cooking at sister restaurantNopa 
<http://www.nopasf.com/> and have applied it to wonderful regional Mexican 
dishes here. The housemademasa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masa> in the 
tamales and tortillas tastes so sweet and full of flavour, and thecarnitas are 
regarded by many as the city's best;pozole and birria will warm you on a foggy 
evening. The vibe is casual and come-as-you-are, and be sure to order a 
cocktail: the selection of tequilas and mezcals ismuy bueno (try the Paloma).
• 306 Broderick Street, +1 415 535 3969; 1224 9th Avenue, +1 415 233 9966,

Rich Table 
 Photograph: tablehopper.com 
This unfussy and welcoming restaurant in the Hayes valley neighbourhood serves 
a creative riff on California cuisine. Chef-owners Evan and Sarah Rich update 
their menu nightly, but one constant is the trademark sardine chips (get 'em). 
The pastas can be masterful, and the use of seasonal vegetables, texture, and 
flavour excite. There's a bar area to handle the flow of walk-ins; you can even 
stop by for excellent cocktails and a few small plates. The friendly and 
skilled service will make you feel like a regular in no time.

per person

SPQR
 SPQR, San Franciso 
This Upper Fillmore spot is tiny, with diners packed in at the two counters 
and wood tables, feasting on chef Matthew Accarrino's exquisite and 
sophisticated Italian dishes. The pastas are some of the city's finest, and his 
dishes are intricate and layered with flavour. Another huge draw is partner 
Shelley Lindgren's artful Italian wine list that the savvy servers will happily 
guide you through. To experience one of the city's best restaurants, and 
certainly one of its top Italian restaurants, here's your spot.

State Bird Provisions 
 Photograph: tablehopper.com 
The wait to get a reservation at this informal but notable restaurant is no 
joke (tip: keep the size of your party small). No reservation? It's worth 
joining the line of hopeful walk-ins lined up before it opens at 5.30pm because 
the cooking here shows so much heart (and talent). Chef-owners Stuart Brioza 
and Nicole Krasinski have created their own style of California cuisine, with 
the kitchen acting like a culinary workshop. An ever-changing line-up of dishes 
is presented to guests on trays and dim sum-style carts – it's like the 
appetiser spread of your dreams. The pancake with smoked sturgeon, spicykimchi 
yuba, duck liver mousse with almond biscuits, and the namesake fried state bird 
(quail) will make you sorry when the eating extravaganza winds to an end.
• 1529 Fillmore Street, +1 415 795 1272, statebirdsf.com 
<http://statebirdsf.com/>. Open Mon-Thurs 5.30pm-10pm, Fri-Sat 5.30pm-11pm,
