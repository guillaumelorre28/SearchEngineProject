Two people have been admitted to a western Sydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> hospital with a rare 
infection commonly known as the flesh-eating disease.

The 57-year-old man and 46-year-old woman, who are now in a stable condition 
in Blacktown hospital, had contracted necrotising fasciitis in Polynesia, the 
western Sydney local area district said on Tuesday. “There is no risk to public 
health and the community should not be alarmed,” it said.

It is not yet known how the pair contracted the disease but authorities say 
the cases are unrelated.

The bacterial infection enters the body through open wounds or small cuts and 
rapidly kills flesh and muscle.

Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent a loss of limbs or organ 
failure and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead 
tissue.
