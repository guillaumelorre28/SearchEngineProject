Well, that was a grind for Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>. 
They dominated the first half, but lost all of their momentum in the second, 
and it was only due to some errant long shots and crossing from Uganda - who 
improved after the break - that they hung onto their victory.

90 mins + 2: Andre Ayew wins a free-kick on the right (read: he was chucked to

88 mins: Shaban tumbles in the area, but the referee shrewdly spots that he 
had run into Amartey and thrown himself to the ground, rather than being 
actively felled by his opponent.

87 mins: Oh my! Brimah very nearly gifts Uganda a goal, barreling out for a 
cross and punching it straight at Miya, but the forward can’t control the ball

85 mins: One final change for Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> - Afriyie Acquah is on for Jordan 
Ayew. ANd then they have a great chance to wrap up the game, as Atsu latches 
onto a ball over the top, but Onyango produces a wonderful save from the 
powerful shot at goal.

82 mins: Oh! So close for Uganda. It looked like the Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> defence was opening up, as Massa 
gets down the right and puts in a nice cross, but the ball is just whipped away 
as Serunkuma pulls back his foot to shoot on the edge of the six-yard box.

80 mins: A defensive blunder nearly lets Jordan Ayew in, but he’s wrestled to 
the ground by Wasswa. From the free-kick, Onyango comes out to claim the cross 
when he absolutely should not have done, but he somehow claims the ball in the 
air, tumbling to the ground and immediately springing up to get rid of the ball.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>. There’s another one, from 
Acheampong, after good work from Andre Ayew. That one was so strong it sparked 
a Uganda counter-attack.

75 mins: For all their dominance in the second-half, Uganda have been largely 
restricted to longish range shots. That’s partly their own fault, shooting when 
they could perhaps have tried to pierce the defence a little more carefully. 
There’s another one, as Miya scuffs a shot that Brimah saves.

72 mins: And a switch for Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> 
now - Gyan is off, and Emmanuel Badu is withdrawn. A more defensive switch from 
Avram Grant, recognising the tide of the game, but going too defensive with 
only a goal lead and 18 minutes left could be an error.

70 mins: A relatively rare Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> 
attack arrives, but Partey’s shot flies over the bar. A change for Uganda, and 
Micho is going for it: striker Geofrey Serunkuma comes on for defender Isinde. 
An attacking tactical rejig ahoy.

67 mins: Ghana try to exert something approaching control to the game, but 
Partey on the right balloons his cross way over the waiting attackers in the 
centre. Uganda then counter-attack, and substitute Shaban chases a ball with 
Boye, gets a toe to it and almost gets the ball past Brimah, but the keeper 
just about keeps it out.

59 mins: Ghana’s first attack of much note in the second half when Jordan Ayew 
dashes behind the Uganda defence, at first thinking he was offside, but delays 
his cross too long. So long, in fact, that the linesman flags for it going out 
of play on the byline, even if that decision did look a little harsh.

57 mins: Sub for Uganda now, as Muhammad Shaban comes on for Luwaga Kizoto. 
Mawejje tries a shot from somewhere in Libreville, which goes well, well, well 
over the bar. Fine optimism, but daft in the end.

54 mins: Atsu escapes the attentions of his marker for a moment, but Gyan is 
caught offside from the ball over the top. Again, a scrappy start to the half.

52 mins: A relatively slow start to the second half, just as was the case with 
the first. Uganda seem to be doubling up on Atsu, but he still manages to get a 
cross into the box from the right, which is cleared.

50 mins: Oloya tries to chisel some sort of attacking chance out on the right, 
but the ball dribbles out of play, but not before he yells some sort of 
non-specific complaint to the linesman, standing by.

46 mins: And with that, we’re off again. Even in the early moments, Uganda 
look a little more positive.

Well, Ghana should probably be further ahead than just the one goal, such has 
been their dominance, but Uganda did at least show some attacking intent later 
in the half. Atsu has been good forGhana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>, providing plenty of threat from 
the right, but Avram Grant might be fretting slightly that they only broke 
through thanks to a moment of daftness from Isinde.

45 mins + 1: Mawejje tries the most ambitious of shots, from about 30 yards 
out, but it merely dribbles into the arms of Brimah. A little attacking intent 
from Uganda though, at last.

Afcon 2017: André Ayew gets Ghana off to winning start against Uganda
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/17/afcon-2017-ghana-uganda-match-report-andre-ayew> 
Well, that was a grind for Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>. 
They dominated the first half, but lost all of their momentum in the second, 
and it was only due to some errant long shots and crossing from Uganda - who 
improved after the break - that they hung onto their victory.
 
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeep
 
90 mins + 2: Andre Ayew wins a free-kick on the right (read: he was chucked to 
the floor by Wasswa), then tries to keep the ball there, the wily old fox.
 
90 mins: Ochaya flings a cross into the box from the left, but Brimah claims 
that one with more confidence.
 
88 mins: Shaban tumbles in the area, but the referee shrewdly spots that he 
had run into Amartey and thrown himself to the ground, rather than being 
actively felled by his opponent.
 
87 mins: Oh my! Brimah very nearly gifts Uganda a goal, barreling out for a 
cross and punching it straight at Miya, but the forward can’t control the ball 
properly. What a chance that could’ve been.
 
85 mins: One final change for Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> - Afriyie Acquah is on for Jordan 
Ayew. ANd then they have a great chance to wrap up the game, as Atsu latches 
onto a ball over the top, but Onyango produces a wonderful save from the 
powerful shot at goal.
  Ghana’s Frank Acheampong shields the ball from Uganda’s Moses Oloya.

82 mins: Oh! So close for Uganda. It looked like the Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> defence was opening up, as Massa 
gets down the right and puts in a nice cross, but the ball is just whipped away 
as Serunkuma pulls back his foot to shoot on the edge of the six-yard box.
 
80 mins: A defensive blunder nearly lets Jordan Ayew in, but he’s wrestled to 
the ground by Wasswa. From the free-kick, Onyango comes out to claim the cross 
when he absolutely should not have done, but he somehow claims the ball in the 
air, tumbling to the ground and immediately springing up to get rid of the ball.
 
77 mins: A lot of overhit crosses from Ghana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>. There’s another one, from 
Acheampong, after good work from Andre Ayew. That one was so strong it sparked 
a Uganda counter-attack.
 
75 mins: For all their dominance in the second-half, Uganda have been largely 
restricted to longish range shots. That’s partly their own fault, shooting when 
they could perhaps have tried to pierce the defence a little more carefully. 
There’s another one, as Miya scuffs a shot that Brimah saves.
 
72 mins: And a switch for Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> 
now - Gyan is off, and Emmanuel Badu is withdrawn. A more defensive switch from 
Avram Grant, recognising the tide of the game, but going too defensive with 
only a goal lead and 18 minutes left could be an error.
 
70 mins: A relatively rare Ghana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> 
attack arrives, but Partey’s shot flies over the bar. A change for Uganda, and 
Micho is going for it: striker Geofrey Serunkuma comes on for defender Isinde. 
An attacking tactical rejig ahoy.
 
69 mins: Another Uganda attack, another Massa shot, but this one dribbles at 
Brimah. Massa had better options there, but Uganda’s control over the game 
continues.
 
68 mins: A free-kick to Uganda about 35 yards out, which Massa takes a Roberto 
Carlos run-up to, wallops the thing towards goal but it’s always rising, and 
goes over the bar.
 
67 mins: Ghana try to exert something approaching control to the game, but 
Partey on the right balloons his cross way over the waiting attackers in the 
centre. Uganda then counter-attack, and substitute Shaban chases a ball with 
Boye, gets a toe to it and almost gets the ball past Brimah, but the keeper 
just about keeps it out.
 
64 mins: Ochaya runs forwards from the left, assesses his options, doesn’t see 
a great deal to get excited about so launches a long-range shot, but it goes 
wide. They’re getting closer, though.
 
62 mins: From the corner the ball breaks out to Mawejje again, who rifles a 
shot that goes just, just, just wide of the post. Fine effort, that. Uganda on 
top now.
 
61 mins: Some neat, one-touch passing from Uganda creates an attacking chance. 
TwoGhana <https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana> defenders leave the ball 
for each other and the ball breaks to Mawejje, whose long-range effort is 
deflected wide.
 
59 mins: Ghana’s first attack of much note in the second half when Jordan Ayew 
dashes behind the Uganda defence, at first thinking he was offside, but delays 
his cross too long. So long, in fact, that the linesman flags for it going out 
of play on the byline, even if that decision did look a little harsh.
 
57 mins: Sub for Uganda now, as Muhammad Shaban comes on for Luwaga Kizoto. 
Mawejje tries a shot from somewhere in Libreville, which goes well, well, well 
over the bar. Fine optimism, but daft in the end.
 
54 mins: Atsu escapes the attentions of his marker for a moment, but Gyan is 
caught offside from the ball over the top. Again, a scrappy start to the half.
 
52 mins: A relatively slow start to the second half, just as was the case with 
the first. Uganda seem to be doubling up on Atsu, but he still manages to get a 
cross into the box from the right, which is cleared.
 
50 mins: Oloya tries to chisel some sort of attacking chance out on the right, 
but the ball dribbles out of play, but not before he yells some sort of 
non-specific complaint to the linesman, standing by.
 
48 mins: Gyan pulls off a backheel. It doesn’t come to anything, but it’s nice 
that they’re trying to entertain us all.
 
46 mins: And with that, we’re off again. Even in the early moments, Uganda 
look a little more positive.
 
Sub at half-time for Uganda - off goes Azira, and on comes Moses Oloya.

Well, Ghana should probably be further ahead than just the one goal, such has 
been their dominance, but Uganda did at least show some attacking intent later 
in the half. Atsu has been good forGhana 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/ghana>, providing plenty of threat from 
the right, but Avram Grant might be fretting slightly that they only broke 
through thanks to a moment of daftness from Isinde.
 
Peeeeeeeep.
 
45 mins + 1: Mawejje tries the most ambitious of shots, from about 30 yards 
out, but it merely dribbles into the arms of Brimah. A little attacking intent 
from Uganda though, at last.
