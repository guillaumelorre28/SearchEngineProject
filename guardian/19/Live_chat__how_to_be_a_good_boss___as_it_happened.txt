Closing tip: Small business 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/small-business> are like families, and 
you can learn a lot from them. We’ve seen businesses with apprentices really 
nurture staff and support particularly young or inexperienced staff as they 
develop. Being a good boss is also about recognising when people need less 
formal and more personal support and championing and building-on their 
strengths.

Also, don't discount formal leadership and management training. It's crucial 
to honing your skills, which in turn can be pass onto others. Find out what's 
out there to suit your needs and give it a go. You can only benefit.

Top tips for being a better boss: 
1. Give clarity on what you expect from employees and what you/the 
organisation will give in return - from pay to objectives to career development 
... everything.
2. See your role as boss as primarily a question of giving your workers the 
support they need to succeed.
3. Listen to their views.

Thanks Emma. 

My top tip would have to be empower and motivate your team with regular 
meetings and team days. This is the backbone of your company, utilise there 
strengths, clarify there role and listen to their needs.

Never be above the work and show your employees that you have built your 
business and that you want them to be part of the journey.

Also read the E-Myth or 'Something that Matters' by Blake Mycoskies, there 
great tips in these for being a great leader.

Thanks Emma.

My top tip is have a 'work hard, play hard' mentality. Really important to 
have a bit of fun in the work environment to promote teamwork and morale. 
Doesn't have to be big extravagant Away days, it can be simple things like 
doing a Secret Santa for the team, little quizzes during team brief meetings or 
having a team lunch at the pub. People want to work in environments where they 
feel comfortable and it's about finding out what makes your team tick.

The challenges of managing a freelance workforce

The panel’s thoughts on some of the downsides, and their advice on managing 
this type of employee effectively:

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89082450> 
I think a key challenge is they don't feel part of the team and don't always 
feel like they are included in all communication.

My advise would be to treat them the same as the other team members as much as 
possible. Granted they will not always have the same fringe benefits as other 
team members but they should be included in all other activities as much as 
possible. For example, simple things like Xmas parties, find ways where they 
can attend if team members don't have a guest to take. Team away days or 
briefings. Ultimately they are contributing to the success of the company and 
you should try to recognise this as much as possible.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89083254> 
I totally agree freelancers should be treated like permanent employees as far 
as is possible. This is actually a really thorny and increasingly complex area, 
as this great research paper on temporary agency work by Forde & Slater argues
http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JOEPP-07-2016-0043 
<http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JOEPP-07-2016-0043> . It will be 
especially difficult where employers are outsourcing specifically to push down 
wages or make employment less secure (as opposed to doing because of a genuine 
business need for flexible labour)

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89082961> 
I personally do use quite a few contractors and freelancers. The main 
challenges i have found it ensuring that they communicate with the rest of the 
team. Its important that you treat them as an extended arm to your company, 
with regular communication.

We have a on the ground sales team and they are based all across the UK 
including 1 in Ireland. We ensure we meet in the middle of the country once 
every 2 months as this enables us to all catch up on what is happening in the 
business and what are the objectives going forward. I have found that ensuring 
that the same messages are projected through the sales team can be difficult 
too.

Hiring: how to recruit the right person for a job

What are the secrets to hiring the right person the first time? What are some 
of the most common mistakes in the hiring process?

Our panel’s answers:
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17099769> JohnYatesILM  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17099769> 08 December 2016 2:28pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89083188> 
People join and leave businesses on the basis of their manager. An effective 
interview has to establish sufficient rapport to form the basis of a great 
working relationship.

In addition, the hiring manager needs to be crystal clear about the skills 
required for their organization, and the behavior and soft skills that the 
interviewee will need to demonstrate every day at work. Don't hire on 
qualifications alone, but on the potential that you see, and that you are 
committed to develop through training and coaching!

Get your criteria straight for what a good candidate is and STICK TO IT. This 
the best way to avoid bias that will stop you from hiring the best person for 
the job, as well as stopping you recruiting 'mini-me's' who all look and think 
the same as you!

You can't be right 100% of the time, however being an active part of the 
entire recruitment process can limit the risk of employing the wrong people. We 
see this with apprenticeships a lot. Most small business owners use training 
providers to recruit an apprentice, which can help deal with the administrative 
and time challenges but can also mean they are kept at a distance from the 
recruitment process. When this happens, it can lead to unsuitable appointments 
of a failure to meet expectations. Being involved in the recruitment and 
selection process from day 1 leads to much more successful outcomes all round. 
2 in 3 small businesses retain their apprentice, according to our latest 
research.

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89083462> 
Hiring is one of the hardest things to do. As when someone comes in for an 
interview they are going to be different from how they will act in the 
workforce, everyone puts on their best for the interview. This is why i think 
its so important when interviewing to try and to one interview outside the 
workplace, a more comfortable setting.

Its also great to get your PA to take the applicants around, they can get a 
feel for how they would fit in the business. The applicant will also be more 
relaxed.

Do not hire just anyone, always look for the YES GENE and never keep someone 
on who is not right for your business.

How to be a trusted leader

The panel offers tips on how to build your team’s trust as a manager or 
business owner.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17107556> Natalie Weaving  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17107556> 08 December 2016 2:07pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89081649> 
You need to lead by example. And give a little trust for your employees to 
then trust you.

By showing your employees your trust them to do their job will empower them to 
do it well. This may mean giving them the chance to try out a new process, 
pitch a new idea to you or to manage their own time through flexible working.

This doesn't mean that they won't make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes and 
by encouraging employees to take ownership and to learn from the slip ups will 
help them move on quicker with more confidence.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15649314> AnniePeateFSB

<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89081752> 
I think that this is comes down to being an empowered leader - and not being 
afraid to show it. It's about inspiring confidence. Leadership involves having 
a vision of where the company will be in the future. Successful business 
leaders will generate support for this vision and have an understanding of how 
it might be achieved. Our research shows that 77% of small business owners 
review their business strategies every 12 months. This can then be communicated 
with their staff to gain trust that they know the way forward.
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17099769> JohnYatesILM  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17099769> 08 December 2016 2:14pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89082175> 
According to ILM's research, a quarter of employees are lacking a trustworthy 
or inspirational leader. 31% of employees believe that the most important 
change they'd like to see in their leaders is that they get back onto the shop 
floor more often. This means getting onto the phones listening to customer 
complaints, getting out on the road meeting customers, getting involved in the 
business alongside their employees. It's actions like this that build trust.

At ILM we believe that effective leaders are authentic, and demonstrate 
humility. The days of command and control leadership are over - they aren't 
effective - and leaders gain the trust of their staff through being authentic 
leaders.

As others note, a coaching style works a treat in people mgt. So does FOCUSING 
ON STRENGTHS rather than weaknesses - it helps improve performance. We tend 
most naturally to think we can best improve our effectiveness as professionals 
by fixing our weaknesses but there's good research to show that we can be 
better off trying to understand what we've done well and then replicate that 
success in other areas. The 'feedforward' technique brings coaching style 
together with a strengths-based approach. It's worth looking at (see

discussion of this)

How do you cope with growing management responsibilities?

afternoon 

i moved from a large business as a sales team manager to a small engineering 
company as a sale team manager.

at times i struggle do deal with the difference in size, i now report directly 
to a director and the board where before the layers in management were vast.

my question is how would you deal with the increase in responsibility and who 
and how you report to?

Our panel’s tips:

Hi Jack, good question! Small enterprises can be a very different beast from 
large businesses. However, at both ends of the spectrum, communication is key. 
I would argue that due to the fewer stages of management it will hopefully 
easier to share your views and points of view. There are many benefits to 
working in a small business, and this is one of them. Your role is much more 
visible - what an opportunity!

This is a personal view; I see every role change as an opportunity to learn. 
While it's always challenging to start with, the more the challenge, the faster 
you learn.

In your particular context I would say the following. A coach is very helpful 
when the change is so significant. Someone you can talk things through with, 
who isn't your boss; and a good coach will just help you to work out your own 
solutions, without much direction - so after a while you realise that you're 
doing fine by yourself. You may be fortunate enough to have a boss who is a 
good coach; but if you don't there are many great coaches out there - find one 
you trust and build from there.

Reporting to a Board in particular is challenging, and a coach with experience 
in sitting on Boards, reporting to them or even leading them, will give you 
some great frameworks to use as you think about your own position.

Hi Jack, 

I went from being a small fish in a big pond to Director of the Typeface Group 
and I now do not report to anyone (the MD and I talk across the desk every 
day). It is a change, but just make sure that you are clear in what your 
responsibilities are and what is expected of you on a day to day, month by 
month basis. If you think you are being asked to do anything that you are 
unsure of or is not what you expected then ask.

We encourage our employees (there is no middle management) to speak to us if 
they are struggling, need support/training, not happy or they want to bounce an 
idea off us.

We also confirmed conversations like that in writing. Via email of course. So 
when I have spoken to one of our employees we then follow up the agreed points 
from the meeting in an email. And we expect them to do the same back to confirm 
that everything is understood.

But is sounds like you have been given a great opportunity and so relish it 
and take the chance to mould the role into the job you want it to be. The fact 
is in a small business often there are elements you have to do that aren't 
'fun' but that is part of being part of a team that you can really make a 
difference in.

Does that help? 

Natalie

To Jack Hayter, I have seen people move from big to small businesses and vice 
versa and find the culture change a challenge. You are not alone! In the 
smaller business the advantages of simplicity and transparency are big but some 
people are unaware of this fact.. None the less, you have a great opportunity. 
The first thing I would ask is 'does everyone have 100% clarity on their role?' 
Seems obvious but its a common miss. Work with your managers to establish not 
just clarity but also the correct role scopes. Often SMEs muddle though in this 
regard but this can be am impediment down the road.

Managing employee expectations around wage increases

Reader Michelle Godfrey has asked about setting wages in a small firm.

Can you give some advice on how to manage employee expectations of wage 
increases? We are a small private company and can't set the "pay scales/grade" 
which some are used to from previous positions, as we can't predict the future. 
It seems to raise a lot of questions about when or how much a payrise would be

The panel suggests:

Great question. As a small business, my MD and I have this chat often. There 
are obvious times when wages increase - promotion and if minimum wage jumps up 
- but what about those in-between times?

Performance related pay can be a way to give a raise when it is 'earned' and 
perhaps introducing a commission scheme can mean that the staff can earn what 
they want if they want to.

Also, pay rises can be small. What would be the true effect on 1% increase on 
wages year on year, to you as a business versus recruiting a new member of 
staff? On average recruiting costs a business just over £8k....the pay rise 
won't be that. much.

This is an important question to address, and of course salaries are very 
important to people. But research suggests that career development is more 
important to people than salary. The benefits to an employee of working in a 
small business are that they will generally gain a broader range of skills more 
quickly than they will in a larger one. While their immediate career 
development opportunities may at first sight seem more limited, they are 
getting very marketable skills that will place them very well in the future. In 
addition, our research indicates that people are increasingly motivated by the 
opportunity to work flexibly, in flatter and more flexible cultures. So while 
you may not be able to match others' pay, you can provide a better environment 
than larger companies.

Our research also flags that 40% of 18-25 year-olds say that they want 
leadership responsibilities, but only 5% are given the opportunity; as a small 
business you can expose them to leadership development much more readily than 
larger companies.

Motivating staff

The panel are discussing what makes a happy and productive workforce. How can 
a small business owner give employee wellbeing enough time and attention while 
running a busy enterprise?
 <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17099769> JohnYatesILM  
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17099769> 08 December 2016 1:46pm 
<https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/89079978> 
In terms of staff motivation, our recent research identified some issues with 
leaders that have a negative impact on staff. Nearly one in four employees say 
their leaders make them feel stressed. 55% of employees say the structure of 
their business is holding them back from doing their job more effectively, 
while 53% say the culture is doing the same. So leaders need to create a 
flexible working environment, have appropriate work-life balance, and provide a 
flatter, more collaborative structure, and way of working. Soft skills are 
vital in leaders, who need to recognize when staff are getting stressed out, 
and provide them with the room to relax and grow. By soft skills we mean skills 
like communication, collaboration, effective problem-solving.

It's our view fundamentally that the best leaders are coaches to their staff. 
The vital conversation - on a regular basis - is what is motivating to their 
people. They then need to provide the environment to foster this.

How do you start an employee engagement programme?

The first question comes from reader Kathy B: 

“I‘d like to know is what the panel thinks is the most important factor in an 
employee engagement programme (ignoring great internal comms). What would you 
start with?”

Hi Kathy, 

The most important thing for us is to find out what motivates our employees. 
Some it is money, some it is promotional options, some it is flexibility within 
the workplace to work the hours that they choose, some it is purely down the 
team that they are working with. I recommend identifying this early doors (even 
add it to the recruitment process and review during appraisals) and evolving it.

Hope that helps?

Employee engagement programmes clearly need to address the issues that are top 
of minds among the employee community - so the first step is getting the right 
tool to survey staff, and then the right questions...follow up to the results 
is then absolutely critical, so you need skilled leaders and managers, and a 
great process, to take the results forward. We've found that there is a lack of 
appropriate leadership and management skills throughout businesses, and 
particularly among those who are managing for the first time. So particular 
focus on this cohort from the outset, and planning ahead, is critical.

Hi Kathy,

I would echo what Natalie says, talking to your team to understand what is 
important to them. Therefore communication is a vital ingredient to find ways 
to improve staff engagement.

The role of the manager is fundamental to employee motivation and wellbeing 
and it is important clear expectations are in place so each manager knows what 
is expected. It's often said people don't leave companies, they leave Managers.

What we'll be discussing

What makes a good boss? There are some surprises around employee engagement – 
for example, piling praise on an employee for completing difficult tasks could 
be detrimental to their work, according to astudy 
<http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/job.2051/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview>
 by the Journal of Organizational Behavior.

While managing staff is one aspect of running a business, in small enterprises 
the owner usually has to also wear the hat of business leader, which comes with 
its own challenges.

According to research 
<https://www.i-l-m.com/~/media/ILM%20Website/Downloads/Research%20assets/ILM%20Leadership%20lag-%20ILM%20Manifesto%20FINAL%20pdf.ashx>
 from the ILM, there is a “leadership lag” in the UK. It found 28% of UK 
workers feel they don’t have a trustworthy or inspirational leader, while 24% 
said the leaders in their organisation make them feel stressed.

As the head of a small business, you have to strike a balance between having 
high standards and being supportive of staff. At the same time, you have to 
juggle the responsibilities you have to your team, customers and, for some, 
investors.

Questions we’ll look to cover in this webchat include:

 * What makes staff trust a business leader? 

 * What type of management or leadership training is most effective? 
 * How can you run an efficient small business without putting too much 
pressure on your staff? 
 * How do you effectively motivate staff?

 * What are the new challenges of management in a modern workplace (including 
workforces that include freelancers and contractors)?

Investing in management training, regular communication with your team and 
being clear about what you expect from staff were among the panel’s closing 
tips.

Closing tip: Small business 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/small-business> are like families, and 
you can learn a lot from them. We’ve seen businesses with apprentices really 
nurture staff and support particularly young or inexperienced staff as they 
develop. Being a good boss is also about recognising when people need less 
formal and more personal support and championing and building-on their 
strengths.

Also, don't discount formal leadership and management training. It's crucial 
to honing your skills, which in turn can be pass onto others. Find out what's 
out there to suit your needs and give it a go. You can only benefit.

Top tips for being a better boss: 
1. Give clarity on what you expect from employees and what you/the 
organisation will give in return - from pay to objectives to career development 
... everything.
2. See your role as boss as primarily a question of giving your workers the 
support they need to succeed.
3. Listen to their views.

Thanks Emma. 

My top tip would have to be empower and motivate your team with regular 
meetings and team days. This is the backbone of your company, utilise there 
strengths, clarify there role and listen to their needs.

Never be above the work and show your employees that you have built your 
business and that you want them to be part of the journey.

Also read the E-Myth or 'Something that Matters' by Blake Mycoskies, there 
great tips in these for being a great leader.

Thanks Emma.

My top tip is have a 'work hard, play hard' mentality. Really important to 
have a bit of fun in the work environment to promote teamwork and morale. 
Doesn't have to be big extravagant Away days, it can be simple things like 
doing a Secret Santa for the team, little quizzes during team brief meetings or 
having a team lunch at the pub. People want to work in environments where they 
feel comfortable and it's about finding out what makes your team tick.
 
The panel’s thoughts on some of the downsides, and their advice on managing 
this type of employee effectively:

I think a key challenge is they don't feel part of the team and don't always 
feel like they are included in all communication.

My advise would be to treat them the same as the other team members as much as 
possible. Granted they will not always have the same fringe benefits as other 
team members but they should be included in all other activities as much as 
possible. For example, simple things like Xmas parties, find ways where they 
can attend if team members don't have a guest to take. Team away days or 
briefings. Ultimately they are contributing to the success of the company and 
you should try to recognise this as much as possible.

I totally agree freelancers should be treated like permanent employees as far 
as is possible. This is actually a really thorny and increasingly complex area, 
as this great research paper on temporary agency work by Forde & Slater argues
http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JOEPP-07-2016-0043 
<http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JOEPP-07-2016-0043> . It will be 
especially difficult where employers are outsourcing specifically to push down 
wages or make employment less secure (as opposed to doing because of a genuine 
business need for flexible labour)

I personally do use quite a few contractors and freelancers. The main 
challenges i have found it ensuring that they communicate with the rest of the 
team. Its important that you treat them as an extended arm to your company, 
with regular communication.

We have a on the ground sales team and they are based all across the UK 
including 1 in Ireland. We ensure we meet in the middle of the country once 
every 2 months as this enables us to all catch up on what is happening in the 
business and what are the objectives going forward. I have found that ensuring 
that the same messages are projected through the sales team can be difficult 
too.
 
What are the secrets to hiring the right person the first time? What are some 
of the most common mistakes in the hiring process?

Our panel’s answers:

People join and leave businesses on the basis of their manager. An effective 
interview has to establish sufficient rapport to form the basis of a great 
working relationship.

In addition, the hiring manager needs to be crystal clear about the skills 
required for their organization, and the behavior and soft skills that the 
interviewee will need to demonstrate every day at work. Don't hire on 
qualifications alone, but on the potential that you see, and that you are 
committed to develop through training and coaching!

Get your criteria straight for what a good candidate is and STICK TO IT. This 
the best way to avoid bias that will stop you from hiring the best person for 
the job, as well as stopping you recruiting 'mini-me's' who all look and think 
the same as you!

You can't be right 100% of the time, however being an active part of the 
entire recruitment process can limit the risk of employing the wrong people. We 
see this with apprenticeships a lot. Most small business owners use training 
providers to recruit an apprentice, which can help deal with the administrative 
and time challenges but can also mean they are kept at a distance from the 
recruitment process. When this happens, it can lead to unsuitable appointments 
of a failure to meet expectations. Being involved in the recruitment and 
selection process from day 1 leads to much more successful outcomes all round. 
2 in 3 small businesses retain their apprentice, according to our latest 
research.

Hiring is one of the hardest things to do. As when someone comes in for an 
interview they are going to be different from how they will act in the 
workforce, everyone puts on their best for the interview. This is why i think 
its so important when interviewing to try and to one interview outside the 
workplace, a more comfortable setting.

Its also great to get your PA to take the applicants around, they can get a 
feel for how they would fit in the business. The applicant will also be more 
relaxed.

Do not hire just anyone, always look for the YES GENE and never keep someone 
on who is not right for your business.
 
The panel offers tips on how to build your team’s trust as a manager or 
business owner.

You need to lead by example. And give a little trust for your employees to 
then trust you.

By showing your employees your trust them to do their job will empower them to 
do it well. This may mean giving them the chance to try out a new process, 
pitch a new idea to you or to manage their own time through flexible working.

This doesn't mean that they won't make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes and 
by encouraging employees to take ownership and to learn from the slip ups will 
help them move on quicker with more confidence.

I think that this is comes down to being an empowered leader - and not being 
afraid to show it. It's about inspiring confidence. Leadership involves having 
a vision of where the company will be in the future. Successful business 
leaders will generate support for this vision and have an understanding of how 
it might be achieved. Our research shows that 77% of small business owners 
review their business strategies every 12 months. This can then be communicated 
with their staff to gain trust that they know the way forward.

According to ILM's research, a quarter of employees are lacking a trustworthy 
or inspirational leader. 31% of employees believe that the most important 
change they'd like to see in their leaders is that they get back onto the shop 
floor more often. This means getting onto the phones listening to customer 
complaints, getting out on the road meeting customers, getting involved in the 
business alongside their employees. It's actions like this that build trust.

At ILM we believe that effective leaders are authentic, and demonstrate 
humility. The days of command and control leadership are over - they aren't 
effective - and leaders gain the trust of their staff through being authentic 
leaders.
 
Focus on your strengths to improve performance

A helpful tip from Jonny Gifford, research adviser for organisational 
behaviour at the CIPD:

As others note, a coaching style works a treat in people mgt. So does FOCUSING 
ON STRENGTHS rather than weaknesses - it helps improve performance. We tend 
most naturally to think we can best improve our effectiveness as professionals 
by fixing our weaknesses but there's good research to show that we can be 
better off trying to understand what we've done well and then replicate that 
success in other areas. The 'feedforward' technique brings coaching style 
together with a strengths-based approach. It's worth looking at (see

afternoon 

i moved from a large business as a sales team manager to a small engineering 
company as a sale team manager.

at times i struggle do deal with the difference in size, i now report directly 
to a director and the board where before the layers in management were vast.

my question is how would you deal with the increase in responsibility and who 
and how you report to?

Hi Jack, good question! Small enterprises can be a very different beast from 
large businesses. However, at both ends of the spectrum, communication is key. 
I would argue that due to the fewer stages of management it will hopefully 
easier to share your views and points of view. There are many benefits to 
working in a small business, and this is one of them. Your role is much more 
visible - what an opportunity!

This is a personal view; I see every role change as an opportunity to learn. 
While it's always challenging to start with, the more the challenge, the faster 
you learn.

In your particular context I would say the following. A coach is very helpful 
when the change is so significant. Someone you can talk things through with, 
who isn't your boss; and a good coach will just help you to work out your own 
solutions, without much direction - so after a while you realise that you're 
doing fine by yourself. You may be fortunate enough to have a boss who is a 
good coach; but if you don't there are many great coaches out there - find one 
you trust and build from there.

Reporting to a Board in particular is challenging, and a coach with experience 
in sitting on Boards, reporting to them or even leading them, will give you 
some great frameworks to use as you think about your own position.

Hi Jack, 

I went from being a small fish in a big pond to Director of the Typeface Group 
and I now do not report to anyone (the MD and I talk across the desk every 
day). It is a change, but just make sure that you are clear in what your 
responsibilities are and what is expected of you on a day to day, month by 
month basis. If you think you are being asked to do anything that you are 
unsure of or is not what you expected then ask.

We encourage our employees (there is no middle management) to speak to us if 
they are struggling, need support/training, not happy or they want to bounce an 
idea off us.

We also confirmed conversations like that in writing. Via email of course. So 
when I have spoken to one of our employees we then follow up the agreed points 
from the meeting in an email. And we expect them to do the same back to confirm 
that everything is understood.

But is sounds like you have been given a great opportunity and so relish it 
and take the chance to mould the role into the job you want it to be. The fact 
is in a small business often there are elements you have to do that aren't 
'fun' but that is part of being part of a team that you can really make a 
difference in.

Does that help?

To Jack Hayter, I have seen people move from big to small businesses and vice 
versa and find the culture change a challenge. You are not alone! In the 
smaller business the advantages of simplicity and transparency are big but some 
people are unaware of this fact.. None the less, you have a great opportunity. 
The first thing I would ask is 'does everyone have 100% clarity on their role?' 
Seems obvious but its a common miss. Work with your managers to establish not 
just clarity but also the correct role scopes. Often SMEs muddle though in this 
regard but this can be am impediment down the road.
 
Reader Michelle Godfrey has asked about setting wages in a small firm.

Can you give some advice on how to manage employee expectations of wage 
increases? We are a small private company and can't set the "pay scales/grade" 
which some are used to from previous positions, as we can't predict the future. 
It seems to raise a lot of questions about when or how much a payrise would be

The panel suggests:

Great question. As a small business, my MD and I have this chat often. There 
are obvious times when wages increase - promotion and if minimum wage jumps up 
- but what about those in-between times?

Performance related pay can be a way to give a raise when it is 'earned' and 
perhaps introducing a commission scheme can mean that the staff can earn what 
they want if they want to.

Also, pay rises can be small. What would be the true effect on 1% increase on 
wages year on year, to you as a business versus recruiting a new member of 
staff? On average recruiting costs a business just over £8k....the pay rise 
won't be that. much.

This is an important question to address, and of course salaries are very 
important to people. But research suggests that career development is more 
important to people than salary. The benefits to an employee of working in a 
small business are that they will generally gain a broader range of skills more 
quickly than they will in a larger one. While their immediate career 
development opportunities may at first sight seem more limited, they are 
getting very marketable skills that will place them very well in the future. In 
addition, our research indicates that people are increasingly motivated by the 
opportunity to work flexibly, in flatter and more flexible cultures. So while 
you may not be able to match others' pay, you can provide a better environment 
than larger companies.

Our research also flags that 40% of 18-25 year-olds say that they want 
leadership responsibilities, but only 5% are given the opportunity; as a small 
business you can expose them to leadership development much more readily than 
larger companies.
 
The panel are discussing what makes a happy and productive workforce. How can 
a small business owner give employee wellbeing enough time and attention while 
running a busy enterprise?

In terms of staff motivation, our recent research identified some issues with 
leaders that have a negative impact on staff. Nearly one in four employees say 
their leaders make them feel stressed. 55% of employees say the structure of 
their business is holding them back from doing their job more effectively, 
while 53% say the culture is doing the same. So leaders need to create a 
flexible working environment, have appropriate work-life balance, and provide a 
flatter, more collaborative structure, and way of working. Soft skills are 
vital in leaders, who need to recognize when staff are getting stressed out, 
and provide them with the room to relax and grow. By soft skills we mean skills 
like communication, collaboration, effective problem-solving.

It's our view fundamentally that the best leaders are coaches to their staff. 
The vital conversation - on a regular basis - is what is motivating to their 
people. They then need to provide the environment to foster this.
 
The first question comes from reader Kathy B: 

“I‘d like to know is what the panel thinks is the most important factor in an 
employee engagement programme (ignoring great internal comms). What would you 
start with?”

Hi Kathy, 

The most important thing for us is to find out what motivates our employees. 
Some it is money, some it is promotional options, some it is flexibility within 
the workplace to work the hours that they choose, some it is purely down the 
team that they are working with. I recommend identifying this early doors (even 
add it to the recruitment process and review during appraisals) and evolving it.

Hope that helps?

Employee engagement programmes clearly need to address the issues that are top 
of minds among the employee community - so the first step is getting the right 
tool to survey staff, and then the right questions...follow up to the results 
is then absolutely critical, so you need skilled leaders and managers, and a 
great process, to take the results forward. We've found that there is a lack of 
appropriate leadership and management skills throughout businesses, and 
particularly among those who are managing for the first time. So particular 
focus on this cohort from the outset, and planning ahead, is critical.

Hi Kathy,

I would echo what Natalie says, talking to your team to understand what is 
important to them. Therefore communication is a vital ingredient to find ways 
to improve staff engagement.

The role of the manager is fundamental to employee motivation and wellbeing 
and it is important clear expectations are in place so each manager knows what 
is expected. It's often said people don't leave companies, they leave Managers.

What makes a good boss? There are some surprises around employee engagement – 
for example, piling praise on an employee for completing difficult tasks could 
be detrimental to their work, according to astudy 
<http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/job.2051/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview>
 by the Journal of Organizational Behavior.

While managing staff is one aspect of running a business, in small enterprises 
the owner usually has to also wear the hat of business leader, which comes with 
its own challenges.

According to research 
<https://www.i-l-m.com/~/media/ILM%20Website/Downloads/Research%20assets/ILM%20Leadership%20lag-%20ILM%20Manifesto%20FINAL%20pdf.ashx>
 from the ILM, there is a “leadership lag” in the UK. It found 28% of UK 
workers feel they don’t have a trustworthy or inspirational leader, while 24% 
said the leaders in their organisation make them feel stressed.

As the head of a small business, you have to strike a balance between having 
high standards and being supportive of staff. At the same time, you have to 
juggle the responsibilities you have to your team, customers and, for some, 
investors.

Questions we’ll look to cover in this webchat include:

 * What makes staff trust a business leader? 

 * What type of management or leadership training is most effective? 
 * How can you run an efficient small business without putting too much 
pressure on your staff? 
 * How do you effectively motivate staff?

 * What are the new challenges of management in a modern workplace (including 
workforces that include freelancers and contractors)?
