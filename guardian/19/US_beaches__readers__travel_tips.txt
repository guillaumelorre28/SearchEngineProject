Winning tip: wild beaches west of Leadbetter, Santa Barbara, California

You will see more birds than people on the wonderfully wild, sandy beaches 
that stretch between Santa Barbara’s popular Leadbetter beach and its 
dog-friendly Hendry’s beach. On a mid-August stroll, I was accompanied by 
curlews, cormorants, stilts, and dunlin that bobbed in and out of the waves, 
while a stately great blue heron stood in quiet contemplation. Make sure you 
check the tides, however, and keep an eye out for escape routes up the steps 
cut in the sheer cliffs to avoid being cut off between the rocky outcrops by 
incoming tides. Refreshments available at theBoathouse restaurant

Beautiful little Wingaersheek beach lies north of Gloucester where the 
Annisquam river flows into Ipswich Bay. At low tide its clean, hard-packed sand 
extends well into the river and to sandbars you can walk on and in the distance 
stands Annisquam lighthouse. In the middle of the beach is an outcrop called 
Barn Rocks, which provides numerous tide pools for kids to play in. During the 
summer, the town provides lifeguards, rest rooms, concessions, and showers. 
Wingaersheek is reached by car or bike over narrow, winding roads – but the car 
park fills up fast.

This is one of the last relatively unspoiled beaches on the eastern US coast, 
and still mostly unknown to those outside of South Carolina. It is truly a 
place to relax and unwind, everyday life seems a long distance away as you take 
a leisurely cycle around, pausing to photograph the scenic views, or stopping 
for a dip in the sea. Hop on a boat tour and take in the fascinating cultural 
history of the area. And it’s just a one-hour drive from Charleston.

This beach-lovers’ paradise is just an hour from New York. With miles of white 
sand it’s a refreshing change from the over-developed beaches elsewhere on the 
east coast. The island may be small (18 miles long and half a mile wide) but it 
doesn’t lack variety; Schooner’s Wharf offers boutique shopping at the foot of 
a reconstructed tall ship, Beach Haven has a surf park and fairground. The 
iconic Barnegat lighthouse is in a state park on the north of the island which 
is also where you’ll find multimillion dollar beachfront residences owned by 
celebrities – and as the island is so small, if they’re vacationing for the 
summer you’ll soon hear about it!

The pristine white sand of Siesta Key beach in Florida is made of quartz 
deposited millions of years ago from the Appalachian mountains so even in the 
hottest weather the beach is cool on the feet and great for sport or relaxing. 
The minerals give the sea a stunningly clear, shimmering aqua-marine colour at 
all times. Access and parking are free and the sheltered waters of the Gulf of 
Mexico make it easy for swimmers of all abilities. Get there by bus or taxi 
from Sarasota, four miles away.

Just 45 minutes south of Tampa airport lies the hidden paradise of Anna Maria 
Island. A spit of land emerging from nearby Bradenton, it extends like a finger 
out into the Tampa Bay – but feels a million miles away from the hustle of the 
city. This is old Florida at its best and most authentic. Rent a condo and 
start your day with eggs sunny-side up at theRod and Reel Pier restaurant 
<http://www.rodreelpier.com/>, before hitting the pristine white beaches. You 
might even get to share your swim with a manatee or two.

Just stunning. Take the unmarked hairpin right turn a couple of miles south of 
Big Sur Lodge and follow the narrow road to coastal gold. The coastline is very 
Goonies-esque. The spray, mist, noise and power of the Pacific are sensational. 
The rock formations moulded by years of wind and water are a sight to behold 
too. The wide expanse of infinitely walkable beach means that there is always a 
quiet spot – or as quiet as the wind and waves will allow. About two hours 
south of San Francisco or 30 minutes south of Monterey, right off the amazing 
Pacific Coast Highway. Bring a picnic as there are no services.

My first dip in the Pacific was in the unlikely setting of Stinson beach, 
reminiscent less of a tropical white-sand paradise and more of a wild, rough 
landscape of cliffs and icy-cold water. An hour’s drive north of San Francisco 
leads you to this gorgeous coastal town on the edge of Mt Tamalpais state park, 
where Berkeley hippies and affluent Silicon Valley workers come together to 
enjoy weekends of clam chowder and seaside ice-creams. Behind the beach and 
town are gorgeous hikes up through the hills which offer stunning views of the 
Pacific and the Golden Gate bridge – one of the reasons that this truly unique 
beach has stayed with me years after visiting.

This beach is pure heaven, particularly at sunset. Easily accessible and never 
overly busy, it’s the perfect spot to relax (although the tide can come in 
quite far). It’s often frequented by locals rather than tourists, so you know 
it’s the real deal. There’s plenty to explore around the local area too, once 
you’ve exhausted what the beach has to offer.

The peninsula west of Seattle is a land of rainforest and sublime rocky 
beaches bursting with life. This is the Olympic national park, home to my 
favourite beaches in the country. They aren’t white sand, there isn’t a posing 
strip out back, and there are no five-star hotels, fancy restaurants and 
expensive shops to retreat to. And there aren’t crowds. Instead, you get some 
of the best tidepool beaches in the world, real living beaches. My favourite is 
Shi Shi, but you can easily find your own personal beach or spend days 
exploring the coastline. So, instead of just giving your tan a top-up, give 
your brain a top-up too and go explore.
