Flour Bakery and Cafe

Close to the Boston Children’s Museum and just off buzzing Congress Street is 
the sweet satisfaction of Flour Bakery and Cafe. It was founded when 
Harvard-educated management consultant Joanne Chang swapped spreadsheets for 
cakes and cookies to became a pastry chef. Chang opened her first bakery-cafe 
in Boston’s South End in 2000 and the second in Fort Point, in 2007, and says 
the intention with each of the (now four) shops is they become a part of the 
fabric of their neighbourhood. The motto here is, “Make life sweeter ... eat 
dessert first!” and it’s an easy ethos to buy into. You’ll probably still end 
up deliberating long and hard over which cake to order, though. But if it 
helps, thesticky buns with caramel and pecans 
<http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/throwdown-with-bobby-flay/2-series/sticky-buns.html>
 ($3.50) are justly famous, the chocolate melt macaroons ($1.75) slip down well 
with an espresso, and the carrot cake with cream cheese frosting ($5.50) will 
sate anyone’s sweet tooth.

Lean against the impressively solid bar at this family-owned brewing company 
during its tasting hours and you’ll get the chance to savour samples of up to 
three of its brewed-on-the-premises ales. If you like what you sup – and on our 
visit the note-perfect selection was a Belgian-style house IPA, the 
tropical-slanted Dry Stack Batch and the sturdy but smooth Pot & Kettle porter 
– then you can buy a glass or take some away in bottles or ‘growlers’. Though 
the building was acquired four years ago, the tasting room has only been open 
for 18 months. The site had to be cleared of Big Dig dirt from Boston’s public 
works highway project but there’s a local-legacy touch that comes from knowing 
the wood for that solid bar was donated by a place around the corner.

If a family-friendly activity floats your boat then indulge in some American 
revolutionary behaviour at a museum that’s on Fort Point Channel. The Boston 
Tea Party Ships and Museum reopened in June 2012 following an impressive 
renovation, and its hour-long group tour is led by actors dressed up in 
18th-century garb. It paints a vivid, though fun, picture of a city’s 
frustration at ongoing “taxation without representation” under King George III. 
And explains why, on the night of 16 December 1773, Bostonians gave vent to 
their anger at this by throwing crates of tea overboard from ships. Naturally, 
you exit through a cafe and a gift shop that sell tea – it’s not water-damaged, 
though. Part of the annual re-enactment is now ticketed as the city makes a 
bigger spectacle of the event with a waterfront viewing area. If you’re 
tempted, the InterContinental Boston hotel, which overlooks the museum, offers
Tea Party packages from $299

Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (ICA)

When it opened in December 2006 in a prime Seaport spot with views of the 
harbour and the financial district skyline, the ICA was the first new art 
institution built in the city in nearly 100 years. The gallery/museum – 
designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro – keeps a fresh focus, too, with 
exhibitions and projects from artists includingRagnar Kjartansson 
<http://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/exhibit/ragnar-kjartansson_the-visitors/>,
Adriana Varejão 
<http://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/exhibit/adriana-varej%C3%A3o/> and 
Christina Ramberg 
<http://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/exhibit/Christina_Ramberg/>, and in 
displaying work in a range of media. It organises group visits, offers regular 
free tours and film nights, puts on music events and talks, and has a superb 
resources room with a superlative view. Inside and out, its clean lines and 
fresh feel give freedom to the art to express itself and for the public to 
enjoy a relaxing space to take it all in afterwards.

 Summer Street Bridge and wharfs. Photograph: Robert Hull 
Fort Point has an artistic heritage and it is one that is kept going by 
numerous galleries in the area. This includes the Fort Point Arts Community 
(FPAC) gallery on Summer Street that, along with its exhibition space, also 
puts together public art displays, such as the recentShimmer piece on the 
Congress Street bridge <http://www.fortpointarts.org/exhibitions/publicart/>. 
FPAC has its own store, called Made in Fort Point, which exhibits and sells 
artists’ work out of a new location on A Street. For a travel-inspired look at 
art and photography, the Grand Circle Gallery has an extensive collection of 
vintage travel posters that make for an entertaining stop-off. The helpful 
staff take time to explain what’s on show and are handy for local tips, too.

 Boston Harborwalk near the Childrens Museum. Photograph: Robert Hull 
The Boston Harborwalk encompasses shoreline, beaches and wharves as it 
wriggles around the edges of the city, helping to reinforce its credentials as 
a walkable metropolis. The segment of the Harborwalk that takes in Fort Point 
and the Seaport waterfront opened in 2005 and guides you past theChildren’s 
Museum <http://www.bostonchildrensmuseum.org/> and the John Joseph Moakley 
Courthouse towards the ICA and on to the 5,000-capacity Blue Hills Bank 
Pavilion venue. It also brings you close to the three-floored wonder (with 
retractable roof) that isLegal Harborside 
<http://www.legalseafoods.com/restaurants/boston-legal-harborside>, the new 
flagship restaurant for Legal Sea Foods. If strolling’s not your thing then you 
can explore the rest of the harbour area by calling a water taxi. Ring from a 
mobile or the public phones at pick-up points around Fort Point, including the 
InterContinental Boston hotel and the Seaport World Trade Center.

 Sportello gnocchi with mushroom ragu, peas and cream. Photograph: Susie Cushner
Chef and restaurant owner Barbara Lynch hails from South Boston and is a star 
of the local and national food scene. Sportello is her attempt at blending a 
menu of Italian-inspired food with a design ethic that puts an engaging, though 
not overly formal, spin on the classic diner. It works perfectly: the 
atmosphere is affable not austere, the service fast and friendly, and the food, 
which you can see being cooked as you sit up at the counter, bursts with bright 
ideas. The Heirloom Tomato Salad with mozzarella, basil and corn relish ($15) 
is zingy and bright, and the potato gnocchi with mushroom ragu, peas and cream 
($22) is a velvety delight. You may also want to pop downstairs to another 
Barbara Lynch joint,Drink <http://www.drinkfortpoint.com>. At this cocktail bar 
there is no menu. Instead, you describe what tastes you like and a concoction 
is crafted just for you.

Boston Children’s Museum and the Hood Milk Bottle
 Photograph: Alamy 
Boston’s Fort Point/Seaport district may be hot property right now but kids 
and families have been coming to the Children’s Museum in this location since 
1979 – and to the museum in its previous incarnations ever since it was 
“birthed” in 1913. Still, the current property enjoyed a $47m renovation in 
2007, so it’s no slouch in design and interactivity terms. The focus is on 
science, culture, environmental awareness, health, and the arts, but what 
underpins the experience is the emphasis on “hands-on engagement and learning 
through experience”. Or, if you prefer, having fun. For a sweet treat as you 
leave (to reward good behaviour – adult or child!) stop at the Hood Milk 
Bottle. It’s a 40ft tall milk bottle … from which they sell ice-creams and 
snacks.

Row 34
 Photograph: Lane Turner/Boston Globe via Getty Images 
In a city where seafood is a zealously debated topic, it’s a testament to Row 
34’s success that asking people what they think of this oyster house often 
brings just smiles of satisfaction. Oysters take top billing, of course, while 
it pays to explore the menu’s lettuce cups ($12), which are an Asian-influenced 
dish that sees the oysters wrapped in leaves with pickled vegetables. The warm 
buttered lobster roll ($24) is a thing of crustacean perfection that will 
elicit purrs of pleasure or just moments of contented contemplation. The 
restaurant’s name comes from the farm where the bivalves are harvested, and 
which happens to have 34 rows of oyster racks.

Harpoon Brewery

Out towards the more industrial-looking fringes of the Seaport area is Harpoon 
Brewery, but fear not, there’s nothing to worry over – other than the sheer 
amount of brews that will face you at this beer-hall-style brewery and bar. 
IPAs, rye IPAs, white ale, summer, autumn and winter beers, fruit beers, ciders 
and a Boston stout are all often on the menu. Decision-making becomes much 
clearer (before inevitably getting more fuzzy) if you grab a spot on one of the 
brewery tours – which cost $5 and take around 50 minutes.
