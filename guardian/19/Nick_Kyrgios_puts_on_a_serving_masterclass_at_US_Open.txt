Nick Kyrgios <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nick-kyrgios> has defied 
injury to surge into the third round of the US Open with a serving masterclass.

Kyrgios showcased some substance to complement his undoubted style in sweeping 
past Horacio Zeballos 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 in one hour and 56 minutes.

Despite battling a painful hip flexor injury, the 14th seed was untouchable on 
serve, belting 27 aces and not offering his Argentine opponent a solitary 
break-point.

Kyrgios’s impressive victory vaulted the 21-year-old into the last 32 of all 
four grand slam events in a single season for the first time.

Australia’s last man standing faces Illya Marchenko next on Saturday and will 
be a hot favourite to preserve his proud record of having never lost to an 
unseeded player in 14 appearances at the majors.

He will likely need some handy work on his hip before then, though, after 
requiring a medical timeout and a couple of mid-match massages before seeing 
off Zeballos.

At one point he complained to his courtside entourage: “I can’t move”.

But the inconvenience didn’t stop Kyrgios racking up aces at an average of 
almost two a service game.

All up, he won an extraordinary 45 of 48 points after landing his first serve.

Kyrgios also happily fed off six double-faults from Zeballos to break the 
world No.71 once in each set.

It was more than enough for Kyrgios to be on and off inside two hours and 
without dropping a set for the second successive match this campaign.
