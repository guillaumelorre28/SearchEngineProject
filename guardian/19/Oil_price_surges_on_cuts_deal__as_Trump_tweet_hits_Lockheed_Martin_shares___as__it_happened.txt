Closing summary: Oil jumps, yield rise, Lockheed gets Trumped

European stock markets are now closed, so let’s wrap up:

Financial markets are expecting higher inflation after a group of oil 
producers sealed their first joint production cut deal since 2001 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/12/oil-price-producers-cuts-italy-banks-lagarde-business-live?page=with:block-584e5395e4b06a0d55b1a0e3#block-584e5395e4b06a0d55b1a0e3>
.


Brent crude is trading at a 17-month high, up 3.6% or $2 per barrel at $56.27, 
after 11 non-Opec members including Russia agreed to cut their production by 
around 550,00 barrels per day.

That commitment means Opec will now deliver the 1.2m bpd cut agreed at the end 
of November, potentially putting a floor under oil prices.

However the move has also sparked a selloff in European government bonds

, driving borrowing costs higher as investors anticipate a spike in consumer 
price inflation, and higher interest rates.

UK 10-year bond yields hit 1.5% for the first time since March. 

Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, sum up the situation.

“The historic OPEC deal over the weekend has led to confidence in the market 
pushing up to a 5 % surge inOil <https://www.theguardian.com/business/oil> 
prices.

Euro <https://www.theguardian.com/business/euro> Zone government bond yields 
have risen significantly reflecting among other things an expectation of higher 
inflation. As Saudi Arabia made greater than expected cuts and non-OPEC 
countries agreed cuts of 558,000 barrels a day, oil prices peaked at a 17 month 
high with WTI trading at $54.2 and U.S. Brent rising 4.4% at $56.73 per barrel, 
steadily clawing out from the slump – boosting oil stocks and Middle Eastern 
bonds among other assets.

There’s been drama on Wall Street, where $4bn was wiped off Lockheed Martin’s 
value in early trading after Donald Trump tweeted that its F-35 jets were too 
expensive.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will 
be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.

Investors rushed to sell Lockheed shares, as the defence firm rushed out a

But there’s been little progress in the frenzied push to recapitalise Italy’s 
banking sector. That could be a good sign -- Rome’s government hasn’t given up 
persuading private investors from injecting fresh cash into Monte dei Paschi 
(MPS)

Italian bank stocks have gained ground today, with MPS closing 3.7% higher 
tonight.

Paolo Gentiloni is being sworn in as Italy’s next prime minister today, so he 
should soon be able to crack on with tackling the situation. Sources in the 
Italian Treasury have said that they are prepared to bail out MPS if needed, 
but hope that the bank can raise €5bn from investors.

A senior ECB policymaker has said the bank has never discussed resorting to 
helicopter money, in an attempt to stimulate the eurozone economy.

Over in Paris, Christine Lagarde has faced judges over claims of negligence 
during her time as finance minister

.


And European stock markets have just closed after a fairly unimpressive day. 
In London the FTSE 100 shed 63 points, or almost 1%, to 6890. That’s partly 
because the pound had a good day against the US dollar, up almost one cent (bad 
news for exporters).

, Christine Lagarde has not stayed silent - instead, she’s told judges in Paris 
that she will fight the allegations that she was negligent by allowing the 
€400m payment to Bernard Tapie in 2008.

Lagarde told the court that:

“I would like to show you that I am in no way guilty of negligence, but rather 
that I acted in good faith with only the public interest in mind.”

“Was I negligent? No. And I will strive to convince you allegation by 
allegation.”

(thanks to Reuters for the quotes)

Rupert Murdoch’s attempt to take over broadcaster Sky has taken an interesting 
twist, as my colleague Mark Sweney explains:

Advisers on the transaction between Sky and Fox, which is expected to lodge an 
official bid later this week, are pursuing a so-called “scheme of arrangement”.

This tactic, which requires Sky to gain approval from investors representing 
75% of the voting rights, will ensure that all shareholders against the deal 
are forced to sell once the threshold is reached.

This would protect Murdoch from the unfortunate scenario where he finally 
claims his prize, but is left with a mutinous rump of investors who don’t sell 
their Sky shares.

Murdoch plans Sky bid tactic that would squeeze out opponents

Christine Lagarde’s lawyer has urged the judges at the Plais de Justice to 
pause her trial for negligence during her time as French finance minister.

Associated Press has the latest details from today’s court hearing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/12/oil-price-producers-cuts-italy-banks-lagarde-business-live?page=with:block-584e9fc9e4b08659393bb88c#block-584e9fc9e4b08659393bb88c>
.

International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde went on trial Monday in a 
Paris court, accused of negligence for allowing a huge handout to a 
well-connected businessman when she was in the French government.

Poised and serious, Lagarde took notes as the judge summed up the years-long 
legal saga that led to charges against her charges she contests. A 
well-respected pioneer for women in leadership, Lagarde faces up to a year in 
prison if convicted.

A lawyer for Lagarde, Patrick Maisonneuve, pleaded for a delay in the 
proceedings, arguing that it doesn’t make sense for her to face trial while a 
separate investigation in the broader case is still underway. It is unclear 
whether the judges will decide Monday on the appeal or adjourn for 
deliberations.

The case revolves around a €403m ($425 million) payout to tycoon Bernard Tapie 
in an arbitration deal in 2008 over the botched sale of sportswear maker Adidas 
in the 1990s, when Lagarde was finance minister. The amount of the award 
prompted indignation in France.

Investigators suspect that the whole process was rigged in favor of Tapie, a 
business magnate with close connections with political circles, including 
then-President Nicolas Sarkozy.

Civil courts have since quashed the unusually generous award, declared the 
arbitration process and deal fraudulent and ordered Tapie to pay the money back.

Lagarde is accused of “serious negligence” that allegedly allowed other people 
in the case to commit a suspected major misappropriation of public funds.

Investigating judges say Lagarde committed a series of serious errors when she 
made the arbitration choice and also, later on, when she refused to challenge 
the deal, suggesting she may have been influenced by the political connections 
between Tapie and Sarkozy, according to court documents.

Despite Lockheed Martin’s problem, the S&P 500 index has hit a fresh record 
high in early trading on Wall Street.

The Dow Jones industrial average has also hit a new high, and at 19,776 is 
getting close to the 20,000 mark.

Energy companies are rallying on the back of the oil production cut deal 
agreed over the weekend.

A Lockheed Martin executive has responded to Donald Trump’s attack, insisting 
that the company has taken steps to cut the costs of its F-35 programme.

Reuters has the details:

Since the beginning, we have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to 
reduce the price of the airplane by about 70% since its original costing, and 
we project it to be about 85 million dollars in the 2019 or 2020 time frame”, 
said Jeff Babione, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 programme leader.

That hasn’t stopped the company’s shares falling by almos 5% in early trading, 
knocking almost $4bn off its value.

The European Central Bank has never discussed flooding the eurozone with 
helicopter money.

That’s according to ECB board member Benoît Cœuré, who has just completed an 
online Q&A about monetary policy.

Asked if the ECB could embrace helicopter funding (which means either a) 
handing the public money, or b) creating money to explicitly fund government 
spending), Cœuré indicated that it isn’t on the ECB’s agenda.
ECB (@ecb) 
.@stanjourdan <https://twitter.com/stanjourdan> "Helicopter money" not a well

Cœuré also defended the ECB’s decision to trim its QE programme to €60bn per 
month of new bond purchases, from April, even though it sees inflation below 
target in 2019.

Cœuré also argued that banks shouldn’t grumble too much about record low 
interest rates -- ultraloose monetary policy does benefit them too:

Trump attack hits Lockheed Martin shares

The president-elect has done it again.....

Shares in US defence firm Lockheed Martin are losing altitude in pre-market 
trading after Donald Trump tweeted that the F-35 fighter jet programme was “out 
of control”/

Trump is promising to make big cuts once in office, which will wipe 2% off the 
company’s share price when trading begins on Wall Street in 45 minutes.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will 
be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.

The F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter is a stealth jet, designed and 
manufactured by Lockheed Martin in partnership with other defence firms.

Last month the Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin a $6.1bn contract to produce 
57 F-35 stealth fighters 
<http://www.star-telegram.com/news/business/article112183547.html> -- the ninth 
batch, and 58% cheaper than the first order.Clearly not enough of a saving for 
Mr Trump....

The Russian rouble has leapt by 2%, after oil producers hammered out that deal 
to cut global output by 1.8m barrels per day

Officials representing Greece’s creditors will head back to Athens tomorrow, 
in another attempt to complete the latest review of its bailout.

European Commission officials say they hope to complete the work soon:

But...the two sides still seem someway apart, with Greece’s lenders demanding 
economic reforms to hit its bailout targets.

And finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has warned creditors not to be too 
hardline, urging them to consider compromises.

As Tsakalotos put it 
<http://www.ekathimerini.com/214495/article/ekathimerini/business/greece-seeks-honest-compromise-in-reform-standoff-says-tsakalotos>
:


“The Greek expression is ‘put water into wine’. It’s not an expression I like, 
because I wouldn’t like my wine watered down, but you know what I mean, to 
reach an honest compromise.”

Bloomberg also have a snappy summary of the case against Christine Lagarde:

Basically, that Lagarde didn’t do enough to stop a payout to [businessman 
Bernard] Tapie.

She’s accused of gross negligence in the use of public funds, a rarely used 
charge brought in cases where the evidence suggests the defendant didn’t 
knowingly participate in activities to defraud the state.

According to the indictment, Lagarde got at least two things wrong. First, she 
gave her go-ahead in October 2007 to the arbitration procedure even though the 
French investment agency, Agence des Participations de l’Etat, “repeatedly” 
advised her against it.

She’s also accused of waiving the right to appeal the arbitration decision 
even though she was told that a possible legal challenge was available.

European stock markets are now closed, so let’s wrap up:

Financial markets are expecting higher inflation after a group of oil 
producers sealed their first joint production cut deal since 2001 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/12/oil-price-producers-cuts-italy-banks-lagarde-business-live?page=with:block-584e5395e4b06a0d55b1a0e3#block-584e5395e4b06a0d55b1a0e3>
.


Brent crude is trading at a 17-month high, up 3.6% or $2 per barrel at $56.27, 
after 11 non-Opec members including Russia agreed to cut their production by 
around 550,00 barrels per day.

<https://twitter.com/PKN_ORLEN/status/808276071074463744> 
That commitment means Opec will now deliver the 1.2m bpd cut agreed at the end 
of November, potentially putting a floor under oil prices.

However the move has also sparked a selloff in European government bonds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/12/oil-price-producers-cuts-italy-banks-lagarde-business-live?page=with:block-584e61b9e4b08659393bb722#block-584e61b9e4b08659393bb722>
, driving borrowing costs higher as investors anticipate a spike in consumer 
price inflation, and higher interest rates.

UK 10-year bond yields hit 1.5% for the first time since March. 

Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, sum up the situation.

“The historic OPEC deal over the weekend has led to confidence in the market 
pushing up to a 5 % surge inOil <https://www.theguardian.com/business/oil> 
prices.

Euro <https://www.theguardian.com/business/euro> Zone government bond yields 
have risen significantly reflecting among other things an expectation of higher 
inflation. As Saudi Arabia made greater than expected cuts and non-OPEC 
countries agreed cuts of 558,000 barrels a day, oil prices peaked at a 17 month 
high with WTI trading at $54.2 and U.S. Brent rising 4.4% at $56.73 per barrel, 
steadily clawing out from the slump – boosting oil stocks and Middle Eastern 
bonds among other assets.

There’s been drama on Wall Street, where $4bn was wiped off Lockheed Martin’s 
value in early trading after Donald Trump tweeted that its F-35 jets were too 
expensive.

But there’s been little progress in the frenzied push to recapitalise Italy’s 
banking sector. That could be a good sign -- Rome’s government hasn’t given up 
persuading private investors from injecting fresh cash into Monte dei Paschi 
(MPS)

Italian bank stocks have gained ground today, with MPS closing 3.7% higher 
tonight.

Paolo Gentiloni is being sworn in as Italy’s next prime minister today, so he 
should soon be able to crack on with tackling the situation. Sources in the 
Italian Treasury have said that they are prepared to bail out MPS if needed, 
but hope that the bank can raise €5bn from investors.

A senior ECB policymaker has said the bank has never discussed resorting to 
helicopter money, in an attempt to stimulate the eurozone economy.

And European stock markets have just closed after a fairly unimpressive day. 
In London the FTSE 100 shed 63 points, or almost 1%, to 6890. That’s partly 
because the pound had a good day against the US dollar, up almost one cent (bad 
news for exporters).

, Christine Lagarde has not stayed silent - instead, she’s told judges in Paris 
that she will fight the allegations that she was negligent by allowing the 
€400m payment to Bernard Tapie in 2008.

Lagarde told the court that:

“I would like to show you that I am in no way guilty of negligence, but rather 
that I acted in good faith with only the public interest in mind.”

“Was I negligent? No. And I will strive to convince you allegation by 
allegation.”

Rupert Murdoch’s attempt to take over broadcaster Sky has taken an interesting 
twist, as my colleague Mark Sweney explains:

Advisers on the transaction between Sky and Fox, which is expected to lodge an 
official bid later this week, are pursuing a so-called “scheme of arrangement”.

This tactic, which requires Sky to gain approval from investors representing 
75% of the voting rights, will ensure that all shareholders against the deal 
are forced to sell once the threshold is reached.

This would protect Murdoch from the unfortunate scenario where he finally 
claims his prize, but is left with a mutinous rump of investors who don’t sell 
their Sky shares.

Christine Lagarde’s lawyer has urged the judges at the Plais de Justice to 
pause her trial for negligence during her time as French finance minister.

Associated Press has the latest details from today’s court hearing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/12/oil-price-producers-cuts-italy-banks-lagarde-business-live?page=with:block-584e9fc9e4b08659393bb88c#block-584e9fc9e4b08659393bb88c>
.

International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde went on trial Monday in a 
Paris court, accused of negligence for allowing a huge handout to a 
well-connected businessman when she was in the French government.

Poised and serious, Lagarde took notes as the judge summed up the years-long 
legal saga that led to charges against her charges she contests. A 
well-respected pioneer for women in leadership, Lagarde faces up to a year in 
prison if convicted.

A lawyer for Lagarde, Patrick Maisonneuve, pleaded for a delay in the 
proceedings, arguing that it doesn’t make sense for her to face trial while a 
separate investigation in the broader case is still underway. It is unclear 
whether the judges will decide Monday on the appeal or adjourn for 
deliberations.

The case revolves around a €403m ($425 million) payout to tycoon Bernard Tapie 
in an arbitration deal in 2008 over the botched sale of sportswear maker Adidas 
in the 1990s, when Lagarde was finance minister. The amount of the award 
prompted indignation in France.

Investigators suspect that the whole process was rigged in favor of Tapie, a 
business magnate with close connections with political circles, including 
then-President Nicolas Sarkozy.

Civil courts have since quashed the unusually generous award, declared the 
arbitration process and deal fraudulent and ordered Tapie to pay the money back.

Lagarde is accused of “serious negligence” that allegedly allowed other people 
in the case to commit a suspected major misappropriation of public funds.

Investigating judges say Lagarde committed a series of serious errors when she 
made the arbitration choice and also, later on, when she refused to challenge 
the deal, suggesting she may have been influenced by the political connections 
between Tapie and Sarkozy, according to court documents.
 
Despite Lockheed Martin’s problem, the S&P 500 index has hit a fresh record 
high in early trading on Wall Street.

The Dow Jones industrial average has also hit a new high, and at 19,776 is 
getting close to the 20,000 mark.

Energy companies are rallying on the back of the oil production cut deal 
agreed over the weekend.

A Lockheed Martin executive has responded to Donald Trump’s attack, insisting 
that the company has taken steps to cut the costs of its F-35 programme.

Reuters has the details:

Since the beginning, we have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to 
reduce the price of the airplane by about 70% since its original costing, and 
we project it to be about 85 million dollars in the 2019 or 2020 time frame”, 
said Jeff Babione, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 programme leader.

That hasn’t stopped the company’s shares falling by almos 5% in early trading, 
knocking almost $4bn off its value.

The European Central Bank has never discussed flooding the eurozone with 
helicopter money.

That’s according to ECB board member Benoît Cœuré, who has just completed an 
online Q&A about monetary policy.

Asked if the ECB could embrace helicopter funding (which means either a) 
handing the public money, or b) creating money to explicitly fund government 
spending), Cœuré indicated that it isn’t on the ECB’s agenda.

Cœuré also argued that banks shouldn’t grumble too much about record low 
interest rates -- ultraloose monetary policy does benefit them too:

The president-elect has done it again.....

Shares in US defence firm Lockheed Martin are losing altitude in pre-market 
trading after Donald Trump tweeted that the F-35 fighter jet programme was “out 
of control”/

Trump is promising to make big cuts once in office, which will wipe 2% off the 
company’s share price when trading begins on Wall Street in 45 minutes.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will 
be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.

The F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter is a stealth jet, designed and 
manufactured by Lockheed Martin in partnership with other defence firms.

Last month the Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin a $6.1bn contract to produce 
57 F-35 stealth fighters

batch, and 58% cheaper than the first order.Clearly not enough of a saving for

The Russian rouble has leapt by 2%, after oil producers hammered out that deal 
to cut global output by 1.8m barrels per day

One US dollar now buys just 61.2 ruble, the lowest since October 2015 - before 
fears over Russia’s economy hammered the currency:

Officials representing Greece’s creditors will head back to Athens tomorrow, 
in another attempt to complete the latest review of its bailout.

European Commission officials say they hope to complete the work soon:

But...the two sides still seem someway apart, with Greece’s lenders demanding 
economic reforms to hit its bailout targets.

And finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has warned creditors not to be too 
hardline, urging them to consider compromises.

As Tsakalotos put it 
<http://www.ekathimerini.com/214495/article/ekathimerini/business/greece-seeks-honest-compromise-in-reform-standoff-says-tsakalotos>
:


“The Greek expression is ‘put water into wine’. It’s not an expression I like, 
because I wouldn’t like my wine watered down, but you know what I mean, to 
reach an honest compromise.”

Bloomberg also have a snappy summary of the case against Christine Lagarde:

Basically, that Lagarde didn’t do enough to stop a payout to [businessman 
Bernard] Tapie.

She’s accused of gross negligence in the use of public funds, a rarely used 
charge brought in cases where the evidence suggests the defendant didn’t 
knowingly participate in activities to defraud the state.

According to the indictment, Lagarde got at least two things wrong. First, she 
gave her go-ahead in October 2007 to the arbitration procedure even though the 
French investment agency, Agence des Participations de l’Etat, “repeatedly” 
advised her against it.

She’s also accused of waiving the right to appeal the arbitration decision 
even though she was told that a possible legal challenge was available.
