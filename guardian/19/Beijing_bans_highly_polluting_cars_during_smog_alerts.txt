Next year, Beijing will ban highly polluting old cars from being driven 
whenever air-quality alerts are issued in the city or neighbouring regions, 
according to its environmental protection bureau.

China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> has adopted various measures 
over the years to reduce the smog shrouding many of the country’s northern 
cities in winter, causing hazardous traffic conditions and disrupting daily 
life.

 From 15 February, vehicles that don’t meet the government’s current standard 
on emissions (those more than 10 years old) will be banned in Beijing’s main 
urban area whenever orange or red alerts are issued in Beijing or neighbouring 
Hebei province and Tianjin city.

 Vehicles breaking the restrictions will be fined 100 yuan (£11.75) every four 
hours they are on the road, the bureau added.

 Cars at the National 1 or National 2 emissions standards, which the rules are 
aimed at, only account for 8% of the cars in the city, but they account for 
more than 30% of smog causing nitrogen oxide emissions, the bureau said.

 The adjustment to regulations also said that schools would only be closed 
selectively during alerts, rather than the blanket approach that was used 
originally whenBeijing issued its first ever red alert in December last year

.

 The government has been tweaking the new system since its introduction. It 
has worked to unify it across the Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei provinces. In 
February the minimum threshold for issuing alerts was raised.

 Beijing officials are also taking measures to reduce the emissions of 
vehicles driven in the city. Measures include using licence-plate restrictions 
to limit the overall number of cars and providing subsidies to electric vehicle 
buyers to promote fuel-replacement vehicles.
