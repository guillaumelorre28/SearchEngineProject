, which became a bestseller upon release in 2013, is being adapted by Akiva 
Goldsman, who won an Oscar for adapting A Beautiful Mind and also wrote the 
scripts for Batman & Robin and Practical Magic.

The plot follows Danny Torrance years after the events in the Overlook Hotel

 as he suffers from the trauma of what happened to him and his family. He 
develops a psychic link to a 12-year-old girl who he must save after she gets 
involved with a sinister group of paranormals.

King will be an executive producer on the project while a director is still to 
be confirmed. It’s one of a number of King adaptations on the way. Later this 
year sees the release of Cell, with John Cusack and Samuel L Jackson while It 
and The Dark Tower, starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are also 
heading towards production.

King has confessed that he’s not a fan of Stanley Kubrick’s take on The 
Shining. Last year, he spoke toRolling Stone 
<http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/stephen-king-the-rolling-stone-interview-20141031?page=5>
 and called the movie “misogynistic” for presenting Wendy Torrance as “a 
screaming dishrag”. He was also involved in a TV miniseries based on the same 
book, starring Steven Weber and Rebecca de Mornay.
