Eastern Standard Kitchen & Drinks

Pull up a stool at the bar or lounge on the patio at this swanky, but not 
snobby,Kenmore Square <http://kenmoresquareboston.com/> bar and restaurant. The 
wine list will impress and the beer selection is solid but the cocktails are 
where they shine. Favourites include the Whiskey Smash ($10, not on the menu) 
and egg-centric cocktails such as the fluffy and decadent Flip Royal (ginger 
liqueur, rooibos tea syrup, Angostura bitters, $11). And while it can get 
packed – it's in the heart of the square and down the street from Fenway Park 
(home of the Boston Red Sox) – the service never lacks. Go for oysters or 
roasted bone marrow if you're feeling fancy.

Deep Ellum
 Deep Ellum, Boston 
Deep Ellum in the west Boston Allston neighbourhood is a food-beer-cocktail 
triple treat. Beer lovers will find bliss in its rotating draft selection, 
featuring local picks and German, Spanish and Belgian brews. You can't go wrong 
with any of the cocktails, but in the narrow, dimly lit and lively bar, with 
old westerns playing on the TVs, the Deep Ellum Old Fashioned (rye, cherry, 
orange, sugar, bitters, $10) feels right. Top it off with bar snacks like the 
Best Wurst Appetizer (housemade sausage, mustard and pickles, $6), then mosey 
next door for a tequila and taco chaser at its sister spot,Lone Star Taco Bar 
<http://www.lonestar-boston.com/>.

Stoddard's Fine Food & Ale
 STODDARD'S FINE FOOD AND DRINK, BOSTON. 
Corsets from the original tenants, Chandler's Corset Store, hang on the wall 
at this downtown drinking destination steeped in history, and the long bar, 
high ceilings, and attentive, polished bartenders add an air of grandeur. It's 
not all atmosphere, though – it has one of the best local beer selections in 
town, especially if you're seeking cask. Close to the theatre district, it's 
also perfect for post- or pre-show drinks and the house cocktail, the Moscow 
Mule ($10), receives high marks.

Lord Hobo
 LORD HOBO, BOSTON. 
Lord Hobo is one of the best beer bars in the city, but perhaps not the most 
hip. If there's a new, rare, or hard-to-find beer, Lord Hobo probably has it 
among more than 40 draft lines or its extensive bottle selection. It's not 
snobbish though: bartenders are always quick with a recommendation and a 
sample. The crowd is young, and while it can get packed, you can usually snag a 
bar seat or a high top. The red walls and dim lights make it feel a bit like a 
dungeon – but one you're OK spending all day (and night) in.

Trina's Starlite Lounge
 Photograph: Pat Piasecki 
Trina's, in Cambridge's hip Inman Square neighbourhood, may look like a dive, 
but it's more retro diner once you step in. It caters for a service industry 
crowd with its popular Service Industry Brunch on Mondays and fun, strong 
drinks and cheap beers. The kitschy, unpretentious vibe comes through the 
diner-like atmosphere, with favourites such as corn dogs, fried chicken, tater 
tots, and the appeal of a bucket of Miller High Life "ponies" (7oz beer 
bottles) for $11.
• 3 Beacon Street, Somerville, +1 617 576 0006, trinastarlitelounge.com 
<http://trinastarlitelounge.com/>. Mon noon-1am, Tues-Sun 5pm-1am 

Brendan Behan Pub
 THE BREDAN BEHAN PUB, BOSTON. 
The Behan may be the most perfect pub in Boston. Cosy, uncomplicated, and just 
divey enough, it feels like your neighbourhood bar even if you don't live in 
the area. The dogs love it too: people are allowed, encouraged even, to bring 
in their pooches while their owners work their way through the great beer list. 
You can also order in food, as there's a Chinese takeaway across the street and 
pizza nearby. It's cash-only though, so bring plenty.

Brick & Mortar
 BRICK AND MORTAR, BOSTON. 
There's no sign outside this Central Square cocktail bar, but if you head up 
the stairs over Central Kitchen, you'll find the perfect mix of classy and 
cheeky. Records spin behind the copper-top bar, there are exposed brick walls, 
uber-chilled vibes, and excellent cocktails served along with (also excellent) 
shooters and shots like the daily changing special, "Crush on a Stripper". They 
have fun here, and you probably will too.
• 567 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, + 1 617 491 0016, brickandmortarbar.com 
<https://www.facebook.com/BrickandMortarBar>. Sun-Wed 5pm-1am, Thur-Sat 5pm-2am 

Cambridge Brewing Company
 CAMBRIDGE BREWING COMPANY, BOSTON. 
Brewmaster Will Meyers and his team produce some of the best beer in Boston, 
and you can find it fresh at this Kendall Square brewpub. The house beers – 
such as the Tall Tale Pale Ale and Charles River Porter – are as worthy as the 
seasonals, such as Great Pumpkin Ale, brewed with local, organic sugar 
pumpkins, or the one-off sour and wild beers, and projects like an oak-aged 
wild fermented sour red ale. Students and locals flock here.
• 1 Kendall Square, #100, +1 617 494 1994, cambrew.com 
<http://www.cambrew.com/>. Open Mon 11.30am-11pm, Tue-Thur 11.30am-midnight, 
Fri 11.30am-1am, Sat 11am-1pm, Sun 11am-11pm

Drink
 DRINK, BOSTON. 
This was named the World's Best Cocktail Bar at the 2013 Spirited Awards  
<http://www.talesofthecocktail.com/2013-spirited-awards-nominations/>, so 
expectations are high for this Fort Point destination. Disappointment is 
unlikely, however, especially for those who are craft cocktail curious and 
adventurous. There's no set drinks menu - you tell your bartender what you like 
or what spirits you prefer, and they whip up something you never knew you 
needed. Queues can belong at weekends, so head in early or spend a weekday 
night here.
• 348 Congress Street, +1 617 695 1806, drinkfortpoint.com 
<http://drinkfortpoint.com/>. Open daily 4pm-1am 

Backbar
 BACKBAR, BOSTON. 
In an alley in Union Square with only a small sign out front, Backbar is a 
modern-day speakeasy, but no password is required: just head down the hallway 
to the small, cosy bar at the end to find some of the best drinks in the city. 
Caged light fixtures dangle over couches and high-top tables and a sprawling 
mural is painted in black against the white cinderblock wall. Cocktails are 
outstanding and surprising. Bar manager and co-owner Sam Treadway innovates 
with a milk punch special, a drink of the week and day, and a bartender's 
special, where you pick your spirit and a fruit.
