Great bridge for sunsets


The Brooklyn Bridge is so crammed you can barely move. Instead, walk over the 
Pulaski Bridge 
<http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/infrastructure/bridges-newtown.shtml>, which 
connects the tip of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, to Long Island City, Queens. The 
bridge isn’t glam but it offers the best skyline sunsets, with the Empire State 
and the Chrysler buildings visible just across the water. It also has a new 
bike path. On the Greenpoint side, is the famedPeter Pan Donuts 
<http://www.peterpandonuts.com/> (Tina Fey spoke of her love for them rather 
graphically), lots of bars, and the tinyTransmitter Park 
<https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/transmitter-park>, which is also primo 
sunset viewing.


Cutting edge new art 

 Photograph: Alamy 
The city offers loads of great smaller museums, such as the Studio 
<https://www.studiomuseum.org/> in Harlem, the Lower East Side’s Tenement 
<http://www.tenement.org/> and the new Whitney <http://whitney.org/> in 
Chelsea. My favourite is theNew Museum (at 235 Bowery), which is always packed 
with super-interesting contemporary art that isn’t just paintings on a wall. 
Past exhibits I’ve loved include one in 2014 by Icelandic artistRagnar 
Kjartansson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/17/ragnar-kjartansson-barbican-review>
, where a dozen young men drank beers and strummed guitars to a score composed 
by a former member of Icelandic rock bandSigur Rós 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/26/sigur-ros-iceland-euro-2016-georg-holm-glastonbury>
, and another in mid 2016, choreographed by British artistCally Spooner 
<http://www.callyspooner.com/>, where dancers tackled, fought and cuddled each 
other in a white room while songs by Drake played. Until mid-January, the 
dreamy light-filled Pixel Forest created by video artistPipilotti Rist 
<http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/pipilotti-rist-pixel-forest> is 
showing.

Friendly dive bar

Times Square is notoriously the most hated part of the city – soulless, 
expensive and packed with tourists. But Broadway shows and attractions means 
visitors end up there, so I suggest sneaking away toJimmy’s Corner, a much 
beloved Midtown dive bar, for a drink. The walls are covered in boxing posters 
and memorabilia from owner and former boxing trainer Jimmy Glenn, including 
snaps of Jimmy with Muhammad Ali. The prices are so cheap, it’s confusing ($5 
for a Jameson on the rocks? $3 beers?), you can usually snag a table at the 
back and staff are friendly.

Brilliant chocolate babka

 Photograph: Sidney San Martín 
I went to a holiday party last year and someone brought chocolate babka from 
Oneg, a Jewish bakery in Brooklyn. Every conversation between every guest that 
evening began with the words “have you tried the babka?”, and this delicious 
folded buttery chocolatey masterpiece is a perfect holiday treat. It’s worth 
the trek to Oneg, in the middle of the deeply traditional Hasidic area of South 
Williamsburg, which will make you feel millions of miles away from the 
hyper-gentrified Williamsburg just next door.

Go to a baseball game

People often suggest tourists go to a New York Yankees game but it took me 
over two years of living here before I did because I thought baseball – like 
most sports – was deathly boring. Turns out, a game at Yankee stadium is the 
kind of cliched Americana dream experience I always hoped for. The cheap seats 
offer great views. You down expensive hot dogs and beer. Take Me Out to the 
Ballgame is played and Village People’s YMCA gets everyone dancing, including 
workers sweeping the field between innings. People propose on the scoreboard. 
Every player gets a personal song as they step up to the plate. Mindless 
yelling is encouraged. And even I can follow three-strikes-you’re-out.

Escape from New York: art and nature

 Photograph: Alamy 
Escaping the city briefly makes the crowds and concrete easier to handle, and 
theStorm King Art Center in New Windsor is the perfect dose of art and nature. 
Over 100 sculptures lie among the fields, woods and hills in the 500-acre park; 
my favourite is the enormous Three-Legged Buddha by Chinese artistZhang Huan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/09/sydney-buddha-artist-zhang-huan-interview>
. The perfect way to take it all in is to rent one of the onsite bikes and 
bring a picnic. The park is about an hour and a half’s drive from Midtown 
Manhattan and there are train and bus options.

Perfect pizza

The new Gilmore Girls reboot jokes about how much New Yorkers love to queue 
for the newest craze, but locals have been lining up forDi Fara pizza for 
years. Arguably the finest slice in town comes from a no-frills shop front in 
Midwood, Brooklyn, about a 40-minute subway ride from Midtown. Store owner 
Domenico DeMarco, who was born in Italy, is in his late 70s and insists on 
making every pizza himself, which explains the wait. The queues begin before 
the store opens at 12 (1pm on Sundays – DeMarco goes to church), and on 
weekends you will wait anywhere between 30 minutes to three hours. Expect an 
hour minimum, but it’s worth it.

Potent fancy cocktails

 Photograph: Daniel Krieger 
’Tis the season for drinking fancy cocktails in snug settings, and nowhere 
seems more appropriate than theThe Library at The Nomad, one of the bar spaces 
inside theNoMad Hotel on 28th and Broadway. French spiral staircases wind 
through the two-storey room full of wooden floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. A 
giant lit up fairytale holiday tree dominates the room. The cocktails are 
expensive and strong: I like the Broadway, an almost medicinal-like rye whisky 
drink for $17.

Iconic exhibitions

It’s not the most famous, but the Brooklyn Museum is the third largest in the 
city (only the Met and the Natural History Museum are bigger). Its permanent 
collection has some gems – the iconic, and deeply moving, feminist artwork The 
Dinner Party byJudy Chicago 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/04/judy-chicago-art-feminism-britain>
 is on the fourth floor – but it really excels at exhibits, both of household 
names and local artists. Portrait painterKehinde Wiley 
<http://kehindewiley.com/>’s 2015 New Republic was the best art show I’ve ever 
seen (making the next door Basquiat notebooks exhibit look boring), and Chinese 
star Ai Weiwei and US artist Kara Walker have both had recent exhibits. Right 
now you can check out a collection of 53 drawings by 22 artists of a naked Iggy 
Pop, created from a life drawing class of the rock star led by Turner 
Prize-winning artistJeremy Deller <http://www.jeremydeller.org/>.

Karaoke in K-Town

 Photograph: Christoph Wilhelm/Getty Images 
There is great live music to be found every night in New York – try Pianos 
<https://www.facebook.com/pianosnyc/> in the Lower East Side, Baby’s All Right 
<http://babysallright.com/> and Rough Trade <http://www.roughtradenyc.com/> in 
Williamsburg,C’mon Everybody <http://www.cmoneverybody.com/> in Bed-Stuy and 
Silvana and The Shrine <http://silvana-nyc.com/> in Harlem. But for guaranteed 
great tunes, book yourself a private karaoke room atGagopa in Koreatown 
(organise it at least a week in advance, this place is popular). It’s BYOB – 
yes, seriously – making it like a private house party that you don’t have to 
clean up afterwards. Rooms start at $32 per hour for four people and there’s 
tens of thousands of songs in a variety of languages available – you’ll be able 
to croon along with Alicia Keys and raise one hand in the air for the big city 
while sipping a bodega beer.
