The country road narrows towards the end of the peninsula, trees disappear, 
and as we curve around the last bend, the lighthouse comes into view, a tall 
yellow-and -black striped tower watching over the sea. St John’s Point 
lighthouse is on a rocky headland in County Down, Northern Ireland. It’s been a 
working lighthouse since 1844 and now, thanks to the Great Lighthouses of 
Ireland tourism initiative, visitors can stay in the former lightkeepers’ 
cottages.

The project has brought together 12 working lighthouses around the whole of 
Ireland that visitors can either take a guided tour of or stay at. At St John’s 
Point, there’s a lighthouse tower and four dwellings, one of which is for the 
lighthouse keeper and his family (the light was automated in 1981 but keepers 
still play an important role). One is used for storage, and two opened in 
August for visitors to rent.

In our cosy two-bedroom house under the lighthouse tower there’s plenty of 
maritime paraphernalia – on windowsills there are lighthouse books, plus 
binoculars, an old sextant and a barometer. The house is bright and simply 
furnished, with sea-green doors and other features keeping to the nautical feel.

There’s lots to explore outside too. The tower itself is not open but a man 
and boy are fishing at a boat landing cut into the rocks and nearby are the 
ruins of 10th-century St John’s Point church.

Later, relaxing with tea outside the front of the cottage, with the lighthouse 
towering above, I wonder what the lightkeepers once grew in the now-overgrown 
garden. Beyond the sea wall I can hear the roar of the sea and the cries of 
seabirds, while cows gaze in the fields.

At 40 metres high, St John’s Point is the tallest onshore lighthouse on the 
Irish coast. Irish writer Brendan Behan once helped paint the tower (his father 
was a lighthouse painter). The experience was not a success – the principal 
keeper complained that Behan was “wilfully wasting materials and opening paint 
tins by blows from a heavy hammer” and had turned the place into a shambles. 
Luckily, he found a skill he was better at.

Later that night I watch the two beams of light sweeping past at regular 
intervals as the lens turns, warning ships of the headland and guiding mariners 
safely to shore. It feels nice to fall asleep under this beacon of safety.

“This building is unique in Ireland. It’s a corbelled pigsty,” says Duane 
Fitzsimons next day, pointing out a tiny medieval stone building near the 
lighthouse.Local guide Duane runs tours of the Lecale peninsula 
<http://www.lecalepeninsula.com/>, where St John’s Point is, and thanks to his 
knowledge, I find out how rich the area is in historical sites.

 Mini dark hedges on the path leading to Ballynoe Stone Circle. Photograph:

“Will we start the tour at the mini dark hedges which lead to a stone circle?” 
he asks, as my eyes widen, realising that this is like real-life Game of 
Thrones (which features the dark hedges in Ballymoney) and Outlander (a stone 
circle) all in one. The mini hedges don’t disappoint – we take the long 
downhill Cow Path, lined with hawthorn and gorse which have entwined to form a 
low arch over the path. At the end is Ballynoe stone circle, a mysterious 
circle of with 50 evenly spaced stones. The circle is 33 metres across and is 
probably from the late Neolithic or early bronze age; excavations carried out 
in the 1930s found graves in a central cairn.

Next we visit Struell Wells, to see holy wells linked with St Patrick, who 
founded Ireland’s first church in the area and was reputedly buried in 
Downpatrick in 461. The site has bath houses for pilgrims who came in the 
middle ages. Duane also shows us Lecale’s beaches and the town of Arglass, 
which has six castles.

 The Mourne Wall passes over 15 mountains and marks a reservoir catchment area. 
Photograph: Alamy 
From the lighthouse, the view across Dundrum Bay is of the black and pointy 
Mountains of Mourne in the distance. These are Northern Ireland’s highest 
peaks, and we set off on the Blue Lough walk – a fairly easy introduction to 
the mountains – with Mournes walking guide Peter Rafferty 
<http://www.walkthemournes.com/>. It’s raining, but Peter keeps us entertained, 
explaining how the 22-mile granite Mourne Wall was built, passing over 15 
mountains to enclose a reservoir catchment area. He also shows us spongy 
sphagnum moss, used as an antiseptic in the first world war trenches. We climb 
to a cave as Peter tells stories of smugglers and the “brandy path” route they 
used here in the 18th century.

The plan was a post-hike swim at Newcastle’s Rock Pool 
<https://www.facebook.com/RockPoolNewcastle> – one of Ireland’s last outdoor 
seawater pools – but stormy seas have closed it, so we ease our aching muscles 
inSoak seaweed baths <http://www.soakseaweedbaths.co.uk/> opposite instead. 
Owner Dermot Devine harvests wrack seaweed from local shores, and once it hits 
warm water, it releases a mineral-rich gel from its fronds. “Do you know that 
your blood plasma is almost identical in makeup to seawater,” says Dermot, as 
he explains how the bath restores the body’s minerals.

Thanks to the bath, my inner system is probably more in harmony with the 
surrounding seawater. That night back at the lighthouse, as I sit outside and 
watch the beams sweep past every few seconds, I feel even more connected to the 
sea. It’s a shame so few permanent lightkeepers are needed now that lighthouses 
are all automated, I reflect. I could grow used to this life.
