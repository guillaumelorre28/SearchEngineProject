A late newsflash: German media are reporting that the head of the Bundesbank, 
Jens Weidmann, opposed today’s moves:

This explains why Draghi couldn’t say that the decisions to extend QE was 
unanimous.

Lena Komileva of G+ Economics <https://www.gpluseconomics.com/> has fired over 
a useful explanation of the ECB’s policy measures, and the way it has steepened 
the yield curve on eurozone debt:

This is important. The ECB is prioritising yield curve steepeners: the policy 
decision to embed a technical “taper” in its 9-month QE programme extension, by 
scaling down its monthly purchases from €80bn to €60bn, to ensure policy 
continuity, sends a clear signal that there is a limit to how far the ECB’s QE 
can run and how high the ECB’s balance sheet can grow beyond 2017, before it 
runs into hard technical, and political, constraints.

The ECB’s announcement of changes to the parameters of the asset purchase 
programme from January by increasing the maturity range to 1-30yrs from 2-30yrs 
and buying assets yielding below the deposit rate (‑0.4%) for the first time – 
also led to a sharp declines in the yields at the short end of the curve, 
reinforcing a curve steepener bias. The prospect of tapered monthly purchases 
and lower-for-longer negative yields means that the ECB’s reflation channels 
have shifted in favour of a weaker euro and higher equity markets, with 
negative discount rates and a cheaper exchange rate clearly benefiting stock 
valuations.

PS: It’s also worth checking out the German government bond market tonight.

The yield on short-term bunds has fallen deeper into negative territory, 
meaning prices have jumped because the ECB has now given itself the ability to 
buy this debt.

But the yield on longer-dated bunds has risen, showing that investors are 
dumping the debt -- showing disappointment that the QE rate has been cut to 
€60bn per month.

ECB extends QE: A full summary

today’s news conference at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt. Photograph: Ralph 
Orlowski/Reuters 
Here’s what you need to know about the European Central Bank’s decision.

1) The European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> has pledged to 
pump more money into the eurozone economy until the end of next year, and 
longer if needed.

At today’s meeting, its governing council decided to extend its asset purchase 
scheme (which buys assets from banks with newly created money) by an extra nine 
months. From April 2017 it will buy €60bn of assets each month, down from €80bn.

President Mario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> 
insisted that Europe’s economy needed more stimulus, help drive inflation and 
growth back up.

There are indications of a somewhat stronger global recovery. However, 
economic growth in the euro area is expected to be dampened by a sluggish pace 
of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustments 
in a number of sectors.

2) Draghi said the decision had “very, very broad” support - implying that he 
couldn’t get unanimous backing for the plan.

This analysis shows that the changes mean the ECB now shouldn’t run out of 
eligible assets until 2018:

<https://twitter.com/fwred/status/806870486785396737> 
3) Draghi was adamant that the ECB is not “tapering” its QE programme, leaving 
some City experts a little confused.

The ECB president argues that today’s changes to not amount to tapering, as 
there’s no plan to stop asset purchases.

“The natural way to look at a word like that is to have a policy whereby 
purchasers would gradually go to zero, and that’s not been discussed or, as a 
matter of fact, it’s not even been on the table.”

Draghi gave increasingly terse answers to journalists who tried to push him on 
this issue -- clearly the president doesn’t want to provoke a US-style ‘taper 
tantrum’ by encouraging bond investors to sell up.

He insisted that the ECB could boost the pace of asset purchases if 
circumstances demanded, or run the programme into 2018.

But Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services wasn’t convinced:


The problem is that however much Draghi tried, and by the end of the press 
conference he was not only very irritated by the endless taper questions and 
stumbling in terms of explanation, he could not refute the point that cutting 
to €60bn/month could be a staging post to further cuts, because it is simply 
not refutable.

It may not be their intended path, but it is not out of the realm of 
possibilities.

them. That’s a taper."

4) The ECB also made some important changes to its QE programme, including 
removing the limit that prevented it buying extremely expensive bonds.

The ECB will now consider buying bonds with a yield below its deposit rate 
(the interest rates charged on bank deposits at the ECB). That deposit rate is 
a historically low MINUS 0.4% (to encourage banks to get out and lend).

So the ECB can now buy more bonds for more than their face value -- meaning it 
would incur losses when the bonds mature.

Why would it do that? Because it widens the pool of potential assets which can 
be mopped up by the ECB.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index says:

The ECB had to change its standards for bond purchases to ensure that its QE 
programme did not disrupt the debt markets. It will now include bond purchases 
below its own deposit rate, which is already -0.4%. Thus, the ECB will be 
paying to hold some bonds that will be included in its QE programme.

The craziness doesn’t stop there, some of those bonds have a negative yield 
because of the ECB’s QE programme in the first place. This meeting has been 
like a financial version of Alice in Wonderland.

5) Shares up, euro down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/08/ecb-stimulus-qe-draghi-italy-bank-rescue-business-live?page=with:block-58497348e4b08659393ba3aa#block-58497348e4b08659393ba3aa>
.

The euro has now slid all the way back to $1.061 against the US dollar, down 
1.3 cents today, having been pressing its nose against $1.08 before the ECB 
announcement.

Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says:

“The euro plunged after ECB chief Mario Draghi presented an unexpectedly 
dovish outlook on monetary policy, hinting that QE could go on for years if 
required.

 In fact he even said the QE programme is ‘in effect open-ended’ and the 
overall dovish tone of the announcement means EURUSD is down 1% having risen 
earlier in the day. It’s fair to say this is at the dovish end of what markets 
had expected.

And that’s why European stock markets have jumped, welcoming the prospect that 
the ECB will remain in ‘easing mode’ until the end of next year.

6) Draghi warned against complacency over the impact which the Brexit vote, 
and Donald Trump’s election win, will have on the eurozone and the financial 
markets.


 “It is difficult to judge the effect of these big events,not only the 
election of Mr Trump, but Brexit, the defeat of the Italian referendum.

Markets proved much more resilient than people expected them to be. This 
probably has many reasons, many causes. One of these is certainly the good work 
that regulators have done ... All these events ... have effects that by their 
very nature are going to develop their full dimensions in the medium to long 
term ... these consequences are very difficult to assess now.”

Quite. That’s a good moment to end this blog. Thanks for reading and 
commenting. GW.

Frank Engels, head of fixed income at Union Investment, explains why shares 
have jumped:

“Today’s ECB decision was a very smart move of Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi>.

Lowering the monthly purchasing volume, abandoning the yield floor for 
security purchases and extending the program’s maturity should cause the yield 
curve to become steeper, with the short end firmly anchored. This is a strong 
support signal for equities, particularly for banks and insurance companies. It 
is bearish, but not overly bearish for rates, though. We consider today’s

Markets soar on back of ECB QE

Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic have jumped, as the promise of 
more cheap money raises spirits on the trading floors.

Investors are welcoming the European Central Bank’s decision to extend its QE 
programme by an extra nine months.

The slump in the euro, now down 1% at $1.0634, has also driven up the value of 
European exporters.

Germany’s DAX hit a one-year high, over 11,000 points for the first time since 
December 2015. The French CAC also hit a one-year high.


And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones index, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq index of 
tech stocks have all hit record highs in early trading.

Daghi: QE is open-ended (ish)

Q: Why didn’t you decide on an open-ended QE extension, rather than just 
committing to buying more bonds for another nine months beyond March?

Our programme says it goes until December 2017 or beyond, if necessary, and 
until we see a sustained rise in inflation,Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> replies.

It is, to an extent, open-ended -- it’s state-dependent.

And finally, Draghi reveals that the ECB has made some changes to its 
securities lending programme - and will now accept cash as collateral (this 
wasn’t expected, so we’ll find some expert reaction).

Draghi: Higher oil prices will feed into inflation

Q: How important is the recent rise in the oil price?

It’s an important change, says Draghi, driven by better demand conditions, 
better supply conditions, and the reestablishment of some international 
agreements.

There is no doubt that these higher prices will feed into higher inflation, 
but we must see if it’s just a one-off effect, whether it has any secondary 
effects, and if it effects inflation excluding energy costs.

Q: What’s the advantage to doing an extra nine months of QE at €60bn per 
month, not €80bn for six months?

Draghi says the ECB wants to ensure a sustained pressure on market prices, 
without distorting them of course (perish the thought, Mario!)

And we want to ensure that the reduction in size does not mean tapering 
(everyone got that? Good).

Q: Your colleague Mr Mersch hinted recently that tapering might be discussed 
today, but you say it wasn’t discussed. So how should we interpret these 
conflicting signals?

I tell you what happened today, it was not discussed, insists Draghi curtly.


Q: So did no governing council member argue for tapering today? 


Exactly, says Draghi, curtlier.
Lorcan Roche Kelly (@LorcanRK) 
Draghi down to one word answers.

Draghi: We've not stifled eurozone reform

Q: How would you respond to critics who say you have “stifled” the push 
towards economic reforms in Europe, by easing monetary policy so much

Draghi gives a little sigh, and then replies.

We’ve been discussing this for a long time. Our view is different - we think 
that easing monetary conditions helps governments to implement reforms, he says.

Governments can reform their education, judicial, political and legal systems 
regardless of the cost of borrowing, Draghi insists.

Q: How would you respond to claims that you are biased towards Southern Europe 
countries, such asItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, by extending 
your QE scheme?


Draghi smiles, and says “no, of course” the ECB is not biased.

Our policies are not very different from other top central banks, he points 
out.

Q: Do you see a risk of a new eurozone crisis next year?


Draghi does not. Different countries do have different problems, which should 
be dealt with stability, but these problems can be “contained”.

Draghi: We've not seen the impact of Brexit and Trump yet

Draghi is then asked about the US election.

The financial markets have proved “more resilient” to the shock caused by the 
Brexit vote, the US election, and the Italian constitutional referendum, says
Mario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi>.


But he then warns that the full effects have not played out: 

All these events, especially Brexit and the new administration in the United 
States, have effects which by their very nature will develop their full 
dimensions in the medium-to long term.

So we’ll certainly see consequently in the medium-to-long term.

Draghi says he doesn’t expect any legal problems following today’s changes to 
the ECB’s QE scheme.

The ‘self-imposed boundaries’ that we have changed today are not the ones 
which were needed to ensure the programme fell within our mandate, he argued.

A late newsflash: German media are reporting that the head of the Bundesbank, 
Jens Weidmann, opposed today’s moves:

This explains why Draghi couldn’t say that the decisions to extend QE was 
unanimous.

BUNDESBANK CHIEF WEIDMANN DID NOT AGREE WITH THURSDAY'S ECB DECISION ON 
EXTENDING BOND PURCHASES - FAZ

(and that really is all for tonight!)
 
Lena Komileva of G+ Economics <https://www.gpluseconomics.com/> has fired over 
a useful explanation of the ECB’s policy measures, and the way it has steepened 
the yield curve on eurozone debt:

This is important. The ECB is prioritising yield curve steepeners: the policy 
decision to embed a technical “taper” in its 9-month QE programme extension, by 
scaling down its monthly purchases from €80bn to €60bn, to ensure policy 
continuity, sends a clear signal that there is a limit to how far the ECB’s QE 
can run and how high the ECB’s balance sheet can grow beyond 2017, before it 
runs into hard technical, and political, constraints.

The ECB’s announcement of changes to the parameters of the asset purchase 
programme from January by increasing the maturity range to 1-30yrs from 2-30yrs 
and buying assets yielding below the deposit rate (‑0.4%) for the first time – 
also led to a sharp declines in the yields at the short end of the curve, 
reinforcing a curve steepener bias. The prospect of tapered monthly purchases 
and lower-for-longer negative yields means that the ECB’s reflation channels 
have shifted in favour of a weaker euro and higher equity markets, with 
negative discount rates and a cheaper exchange rate clearly benefiting stock 
valuations.

 
PS: It’s also worth checking out the German government bond market tonight.

The yield on short-term bunds has fallen deeper into negative territory, 
meaning prices have jumped because the ECB has now given itself the ability to 
buy this debt.

But the yield on longer-dated bunds has risen, showing that investors are 
dumping the debt -- showing disappointment that the QE rate has been cut to 
€60bn per month.

Here’s what you need to know about the European Central Bank’s decision.

1) The European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> has pledged to 
pump more money into the eurozone economy until the end of next year, and 
longer if needed.

At today’s meeting, its governing council decided to extend its asset purchase 
scheme (which buys assets from banks with newly created money) by an extra nine 
months. From April 2017 it will buy €60bn of assets each month, down from €80bn.

President Mario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> 
insisted that Europe’s economy needed more stimulus, help drive inflation and 
growth back up.

There are indications of a somewhat stronger global recovery. However, 
economic growth in the euro area is expected to be dampened by a sluggish pace 
of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustments 
in a number of sectors.

2) Draghi said the decision had “very, very broad” support - implying that he 
couldn’t get unanimous backing for the plan.

This analysis shows that the changes mean the ECB now shouldn’t run out of 
eligible assets until 2018:

<https://twitter.com/fwred/status/806870486785396737> 
3) Draghi was adamant that the ECB is not “tapering” its QE programme, leaving 
some City experts a little confused.

The ECB president argues that today’s changes to not amount to tapering, as 
there’s no plan to stop asset purchases.

“The natural way to look at a word like that is to have a policy whereby 
purchasers would gradually go to zero, and that’s not been discussed or, as a 
matter of fact, it’s not even been on the table.”

Draghi gave increasingly terse answers to journalists who tried to push him on 
this issue -- clearly the president doesn’t want to provoke a US-style ‘taper 
tantrum’ by encouraging bond investors to sell up.

He insisted that the ECB could boost the pace of asset purchases if 
circumstances demanded, or run the programme into 2018.

But Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services wasn’t convinced:


The problem is that however much Draghi tried, and by the end of the press 
conference he was not only very irritated by the endless taper questions and 
stumbling in terms of explanation, he could not refute the point that cutting 
to €60bn/month could be a staging post to further cuts, because it is simply 
not refutable.

It may not be their intended path, but it is not out of the realm of 
possibilities.

them. That’s a taper."

4) The ECB also made some important changes to its QE programme, including 
removing the limit that prevented it buying extremely expensive bonds.

The ECB will now consider buying bonds with a yield below its deposit rate 
(the interest rates charged on bank deposits at the ECB). That deposit rate is 
a historically low MINUS 0.4% (to encourage banks to get out and lend).

So the ECB can now buy more bonds for more than their face value -- meaning it 
would incur losses when the bonds mature.

Why would it do that? Because it widens the pool of potential assets which can 
be mopped up by the ECB.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index says:

The ECB had to change its standards for bond purchases to ensure that its QE 
programme did not disrupt the debt markets. It will now include bond purchases 
below its own deposit rate, which is already -0.4%. Thus, the ECB will be 
paying to hold some bonds that will be included in its QE programme.

The craziness doesn’t stop there, some of those bonds have a negative yield 
because of the ECB’s QE programme in the first place. This meeting has been 
like a financial version of Alice in Wonderland.

5) Shares up, euro down 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/08/ecb-stimulus-qe-draghi-italy-bank-rescue-business-live?page=with:block-58497348e4b08659393ba3aa#block-58497348e4b08659393ba3aa>
.

The euro has now slid all the way back to $1.061 against the US dollar, down 
1.3 cents today, having been pressing its nose against $1.08 before the ECB 
announcement.

Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says:

“The euro plunged after ECB chief Mario Draghi presented an unexpectedly 
dovish outlook on monetary policy, hinting that QE could go on for years if 
required.

 In fact he even said the QE programme is ‘in effect open-ended’ and the 
overall dovish tone of the announcement means EURUSD is down 1% having risen 
earlier in the day. It’s fair to say this is at the dovish end of what markets 
had expected.

And that’s why European stock markets have jumped, welcoming the prospect that 
the ECB will remain in ‘easing mode’ until the end of next year.

6) Draghi warned against complacency over the impact which the Brexit vote, 
and Donald Trump’s election win, will have on the eurozone and the financial 
markets.


 “It is difficult to judge the effect of these big events,not only the 
election of Mr Trump, but Brexit, the defeat of the Italian referendum.

Markets proved much more resilient than people expected them to be. This 
probably has many reasons, many causes. One of these is certainly the good work 
that regulators have done ... All these events ... have effects that by their 
very nature are going to develop their full dimensions in the medium to long 
term ... these consequences are very difficult to assess now.”

Quite. That’s a good moment to end this blog. Thanks for reading and 
commenting. GW.
 
Frank Engels, head of fixed income at Union Investment, explains why shares 
have jumped:

“Today’s ECB decision was a very smart move of Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi>.

Lowering the monthly purchasing volume, abandoning the yield floor for 
security purchases and extending the program’s maturity should cause the yield 
curve to become steeper, with the short end firmly anchored. This is a strong 
support signal for equities, particularly for banks and insurance companies. It 
is bearish, but not overly bearish for rates, though. We consider today’s 
decision to be the first step out of the ECB’s QE.”
 
Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic have jumped, as the promise of 
more cheap money raises spirits on the trading floors.

Investors are welcoming the European Central Bank’s decision to extend its QE 
programme by an extra nine months.

The slump in the euro, now down 1% at $1.0634, has also driven up the value of 
European exporters.

Germany’s DAX hit a one-year high, over 11,000 points for the first time since 
December 2015. The French CAC also hit a one-year high.


And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones index, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq index of 
tech stocks have all hit record highs in early trading.

Q: Why didn’t you decide on an open-ended QE extension, rather than just 
committing to buying more bonds for another nine months beyond March?

Our programme says it goes until December 2017 or beyond, if necessary, and 
until we see a sustained rise in inflation,Mario Draghi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi> replies.

It is, to an extent, open-ended -- it’s state-dependent.

And finally, Draghi reveals that the ECB has made some changes to its 
securities lending programme - and will now accept cash as collateral (this 
wasn’t expected, so we’ll find some expert reaction).

And that’s the end of the press conference. Summary and reaction to follow.....
 
Q: How important is the recent rise in the oil price?

It’s an important change, says Draghi, driven by better demand conditions, 
better supply conditions, and the reestablishment of some international 
agreements.

There is no doubt that these higher prices will feed into higher inflation, 
but we must see if it’s just a one-off effect, whether it has any secondary 
effects, and if it effects inflation excluding energy costs.
 
Q: What’s the advantage to doing an extra nine months of QE at €60bn per 
month, not €80bn for six months?

Draghi says the ECB wants to ensure a sustained pressure on market prices, 
without distorting them of course (perish the thought, Mario!)

And we want to ensure that the reduction in size does not mean tapering 
(everyone got that? Good).
 
Q: Your colleague Mr Mersch hinted recently that tapering might be discussed 
today, but you say it wasn’t discussed. So how should we interpret these 
conflicting signals?

I tell you what happened today, it was not discussed, insists Draghi curtly.


Q: So did no governing council member argue for tapering today? 


Exactly, says Draghi, curtlier.

Q: How would you respond to critics who say you have “stifled” the push 
towards economic reforms in Europe, by easing monetary policy so much

Draghi gives a little sigh, and then replies.

We’ve been discussing this for a long time. Our view is different - we think 
that easing monetary conditions helps governments to implement reforms, he says.

Governments can reform their education, judicial, political and legal systems 
regardless of the cost of borrowing, Draghi insists.

 
Q: How would you respond to claims that you are biased towards Southern Europe 
countries, such asItaly <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, by extending 
your QE scheme?


Draghi smiles, and says “no, of course” the ECB is not biased.

Our policies are not very different from other top central banks, he points 
out.

Q: Do you see a risk of a new eurozone crisis next year?


Draghi does not. Different countries do have different problems, which should 
be dealt with stability, but these problems can be “contained”.

 
Q: Won’t the ECB take a loss if it buys government bonds below your deposit 
rate?

Our aim is to ensure price stability, not to make a profit, declares Draghi 
nobly

Draghi is then asked about the US election.

The financial markets have proved “more resilient” to the shock caused by the 
Brexit vote, the US election, and the Italian constitutional referendum, says
Mario Draghi <https://www.theguardian.com/business/mario-draghi>.


But he then warns that the full effects have not played out: 

All these events, especially Brexit and the new administration in the United 
States, have effects which by their very nature will develop their full 
dimensions in the medium-to long term.

So we’ll certainly see consequently in the medium-to-long term.
 
Draghi says he doesn’t expect any legal problems following today’s changes to 
the ECB’s QE scheme.

The ‘self-imposed boundaries’ that we have changed today are not the ones 
which were needed to ensure the programme fell within our mandate, he argued.
