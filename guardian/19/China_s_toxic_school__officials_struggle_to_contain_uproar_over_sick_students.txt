Environmental activists in China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> are 
calling for new laws and an independent investigation into how hundreds of 
Chinese students fell ill – in some cases severely – after attending a school 
built on a toxic waste dump.

In a case that is being compared to one of the worst environmental 
catastrophes in US history 
<http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1979/12/love-canal-and-the-poisoning-of-america/376297/>
, about 500 students at a school in the eastern province of Jiangsu have 
reportedly been affected since late 2015 by ailments including nosebleeds, 
headaches, coughs, rashes and, in the worst instances, lymphoma and leukaemia.

According to reports in the Chinese media, tests on the soil and air around 
the Changzhou Foreign Languages School have detected hazardous levels of 
toxins, including chlorobenzene, ahighly toxic solvent 
<http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=488&tid=87> that causes damage to 
the liver, kidney and nervous system.

The scandal hit China’s front pages and sparked a major public outcry this 
week after tens of millions of television viewers tuned into a report about the 
students’ plight on state broadcaster CCTV.

“My leg cramps and I get pimples,” one 12-year-old girl told the channel’s 
reporters. “My hands start to peel.”

CCTV claimed that of 641 students seen by doctors, 493 were suffering from a 
range of illnesses. Ma Jun, a leading Chinese environmentalist, said the 
tragedy bore a shocking resemblance to the notoriousLove Canal disaster of 1978 
in the US

.

In August that year, President Jimmy Carter declared a state of emergency 
after toxic chemicals – dumped during the 1940s and 50s – were found oozing 
into a residential community in upstate New York. The chemicals were blamed for 
health problems ranging from skin rashes to birth defects, miscarriages and an 
increased incidence of cancer. Hundreds of residents were evacuated to escape 
the contamination.

Speaking on Tuesday, Ma, the director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public 
and Environmental Affairs, called for a “comprehensive and independent” 
investigation into how a similar disaster had been allowed to happen in China.

“It is very sad. It’s tragic. It’s hard to imagine the feelings, especially 
for the parents, whose children have been exposed to such toxic sites,” he told 
the Guardian.

According to reports in China’s domestic media, the Changzhou Foreign 
Languages School opened a new campus in 2015 near the former premises of three 
chemical factories: Changyu, Huada and Changlong. Classes reportedly began 
before the completion of an environmental impact report warning that the area’s 
groundwater and soil had been contaminated.

A former employee at the Changlong factory – the largest of the three – told 
CCTV that staff hadpoured “highly toxic chemicals” 
<http://www.cctv-america.com/2016/04/18/news-report-reveals-contamination-at-school-that-may-have-caused-500-illnesses>
 into a local river and buried toxic waste nearby. Chlorobenzene was found at 
nearly 100,000 times the levels that are considered safe.

Facing public outrage, China’s environment ministry this week announced an 
emergency inspection 
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-04/18/c_135290724.htm> at the school 
and vowed it would “work to protect students’ physical and mental health”.

However, on Tuesday, authorities in Changzhou sought to play down the scandal. 
According to the Beijing News, city authorities claimed that only four of the 
school’s 2,451 students hadasked for sick leave 
<http://www.bjnews.com.cn/feature/2016/04/19/400600.html> and officials denied 
any students had been diagnosed with leukaemia.

Activists, experts and the families of those affected have reacted to those 
claims with suspicion. “We are very scared and don’t know which side we should 
believe,” the mother of one teenage victim said, according to the South China 
Morning Post. “It’s horrific.”

Greenpeace said the tragedy underlined “how dangerously lax China’s hazardous 
chemical management is”. In a statement, the environmental group said 
authorities had failed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the risks 
involved in building a school on the site of a former chemicals factory.

Concrete proof of a connection between the students’ illnesses and the 
contamination has yet to be found but experts suspect the two are linked. “The 
pollution was obvious and as far as I am concerned the pollutants detected are 
similar to the chemical discharge of those factories,” Pan Xiaochuan, a public 
health expert from Peking University,told CCTV 
<http://www.cctv-america.com/2016/04/18/news-report-reveals-contamination-at-school-that-may-have-caused-500-illnesses>
.

Ma Jun said that in the wake of the Love Canal disaster US lawmakers had 
introducedpowerful legislation <http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/154300/> 
that made chemical companies “extremely cautious” about the disposal of 
hazardous materials. Similarly tough laws were needed in China as the country 
embarked upon the massive redevelopment of so-called contaminated brownfield 
sites.

Ma said that when Chinese companies illegally dumped toxic waste they tended 
to dump the most harmful substances because they were the most expensive to 
dispose of.

“It’s all about ultra-high profits – illegal profits. So we need to make sure 
that they understand that [if they illegally dump waste] it will cost them not 
just a fortune – but it will cost them the whole company if they do that,” he 
said.

“The lesson from Love Canal and the experience in the west is that we need to 
have really powerful legislation so that polluters will take no chances.”
