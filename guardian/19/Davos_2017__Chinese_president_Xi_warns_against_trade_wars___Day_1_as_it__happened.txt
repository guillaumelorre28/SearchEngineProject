The inflation figure is the highest level since mid-2014, with higher air 
fares and the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote fuelling the 
price rises.

Food prices were higher after the sterling slump (remember Marmitegate?) and 
there was also a smaller fall in petrol prices than in December 2015, following 
the recovery in the crude price since then.

The move pushes inflation closer to the Bank of England’s 2% target. In 
November the Bank forecast it would exceed 2.7% by the end of this year as the 
pound’s slump pushes up the price of imports, and these figures are showing 
signs of that effect.NF

HSBC chief: Brexit wasn't a vote for free trade

The chairman of HSBC has criticised those who argue that Britain’s Brexit vote 
was a vote for free trade.

Speaking in Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> this morning, 
Douglas Flint was asked whether voters in the North of England were voting for 
free trade when they ticked the “No” box in last June’s referendum, as some 
Brexiteers have argued.

Flint dismissed the idea as “extraordinary”:

No, I think they were voting to leave the EU. I think the interpretation of 
the vote is extraordinary, just as it is in the US as well.

People can have theories, but at the end of the day certainly in relation to 
Brexit there was a single question on the voting slip and that’s what people 
voted for. They voted to leave Europe, whatever was in their minds that caused 
them to vote that way is up to them.

The priority now is to implement Brexit, in as painless a way as possible, 
Flint continued.


Lot of people can have theories, usually backing up their own 
perception....but we’ve had a vote, and we’re now in the implementation phase, 
of what does that mean and how to you execute it in a way that does the least 
harm to the EU 27 and the UK and can be completed as efficiently and quickly as 
possible.

Flint says that HSBC is now doing a “huge amount of work” helping clients 
understand what Brexit means. Their supply chains may be ‘longer and clunkier’ 
than before, and revenue may take longer to flow through.

The “real challenge” is helping small and medium-sized forms who haven’t had 
to think about these issues for the last 40 years, as they were part of the 
single market.

Flint reminded his audience that the City had coped extremely well with the 
turbulence in the markets after June 23; that’s a reason not to fragment 
London’s financial system.

Very few financial systems in the world that could cope with that event, there 
was so much volatility, and nothing broke, Flint said.

What exists in London today is the aggregation of decades of experience, risk 
management, and so forth, he added. Fragmenting that across New York, 
Singapore, etc would go against efforts to reduce risks in the financial sector.

Flint also warned that Europe’s economy could suffer if the Brexit deal hurts 
the City:


One of the dangers is that the aggregate supply of financial capacity to the 
economy of Europe drops in two years time, which would not be consistent with 
trying to grow the economy.

One of the attendees at Davos is the head of the world’s biggest fund manager 
Blackrock, which has been making headlines in the financial world by attacking 
executive pay and becoming the largest shareholder in LloydsBanking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/banking> Group. Jill Treanor has the 
background:

Among the 3,000 politicians, business leaders, economists and celebrities 
attending this year’s World Economic Forum inDavos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> will be a 64-year-old with 
receding hair and rimless glasses.

The academic demeanour of Larry Fink belies his role running BlackRock, an 
outfit he founded 30 years ago and which has become the biggest fund manager on 
the planet, overseeing $5.1tn (£4.2tn) of investments for pensioners and savers.

The sheer size of the operation – the UK economy is worth £1.8tn 
<http://visual.ons.gov.uk/tag/gdp/> – puts Fink at the helm of an international 
powerhouse, with tentacles across markets for stocks and bonds around the globe.

In the UK alone, BlackRock is usually found among the top three shareholders 
in FTSE 100 blue-chip companies. Last weekit pipped the UK government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/08/blackrock-biggest-lloyds-banking-group-shareholder>
 to become the biggest investor in Lloyds Banking Group.

While Fink makes regular appearances at major events such as Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> – this year he is to opine on the 
global economy – BlackRock is not known for its public pronouncements. It does 
not provide specific detail on its shareholdings in each company or offer 
opinions on individual investments.

However, there are signs that it may be about to become more vocal in public 
after its UK arm fired offa letter to the boards of the biggest 350 companies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/15/blackrock-demands-cuts-to-executive-pay-and-bonuses>
 listed in London to urge them to rein in executive pay.

Jill’s full piece is here:

Can a $26m-a-year fund manager really rethink executive pay?

Lloyds of London chairman: Let's crack on with Brexit

Larry Elliott

We just caught up with John Nelson, chairman of Lloyd’s of London, about 
Britain’s exit from the European Union.


Nelson was a “remainer” but says:

“We’ve had all the arguments about the various options. We are leaving. We’ve 
got to get used to it. Let’s get cracking. The sooner we get negotiations going 
the better. We need decisions at the top.”

Nelson said the signs ahead of Theresa May’s speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/16/theresa-may-to-confirm-uk-exit-from-eu-single-market-speech>
 were that the UK would not have access to the single market after Brexit, and 
the City would lose the passporting rights that allow staff to work across the 
EU.

“We need to make the best of it,” he said.

“It doesn’t make sense to discriminate against the UK as a punishment.

It is in everyone’s interests to have as much free trade as possible. But I 
don’t expect a special deal.”

Lloyd’s is setting up a European subsidiary to get round the passporting 
issue. The location of the office will be announced in the next three months, 
Nelson said.

Nelson also had mixed feelings about the arrival in the White House of Donald 
Trump.

He expressed concern about the president elect’s views on climate change - a 
key issue for the insurance industry - but thinks Trump could stimulate growth.

“Climate change is a long-term problem. Our concern is that Trump will reverse 
the slow progress that has been make. It will put humanity at risk if we 
continue to blow carbon into the air.”

Introduction: Davos 2017 begins

Good morning from Davos, where the World Economic Forum is getting underway.

Once again world leaders, top business people, economists, academics and the 
media have descended on this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world 
and hammer out deals.

Much is the same as usual - from the bustling high-powered CEOs to the armed 
police on the streets.

But this year’s WEF is different; taking place under the twin shadows of 
Donald Trump’s election victory and the Brexit vote, and the broader tide of 
populism.
Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) 
#WEF2017 <https://twitter.com/hashtag/WEF2017?src=hash> : rise of populism. 
Not just Brexit & Trump. Also authoritarian populists in Russia, Turkey, 
Hungary, Poland, Philippines, etcm
 <https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/821244560747597825> January 17, 2017 
<https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/821244560747597825> 
Last night, WEF founder Klaus Schwab told the assembled throng that they must 
“prioritise” the public social good, over their own interests.

“Sometimes it seems that the world is overwhelmed by pessimism and cynicism. 
But we have to look in a confident way into the future.”


This morning we’ll get an insight into the new world order, when Chinese 
president Xi Jinping formally opens WEF.

Xi is expected to make a powerful defence of globalisation, and pitch China as 
a country that could fill the void if Trump tries to take America way from free 
trade.

Quartz has a good take this morning:

Xi will defend trade and make a pitch for China to step into the leadership 
void left by a more-protectionist US under president Trump. It’s worth keeping 
an eye on@realDonaldTrump 
<http://www.us5.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=610c6c88d981c23e5c6638b14&id=13747674ae&e=7d38f539ab>
, to see if the US president-elect tries to steal the Chinese president’s 
thunder with a trademark early-morning tweetstorm.

One of Trump’s key advisers, Anthony Scaramucci, is also taking the stage 
today to discuss where the US economy is heading. That could give some crucial 
insights into the Trump camp’s thinking.

There’s also masses of other meetings, covering issues such as the 4th 
Industrial Revolution, equality and climate change, a speech by outgoing 
secretary of state John Kerry, and Hollywood star Matt Damon with his water.org 
charity.

 * 11am Davos time/10am GMT: Xi Jinping speech

 * 1pm/noon GMT: Anthony Scaramucci on the Outlook for the United States

 * 3.15pm/2.15pm GMT: John Kerry on ‘diplomacy in an era of disruption’.

We’ll be tracking all the key events in Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> today, and trying to explain what 
it means for the world economy.

The inflation figure is the highest level since mid-2014, with higher air 
fares and the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote fuelling the 
price rises.

Food prices were higher after the sterling slump (remember Marmitegate?) and 
there was also a smaller fall in petrol prices than in December 2015, following 
the recovery in the crude price since then.

The move pushes inflation closer to the Bank of England’s 2% target. In 
November the Bank forecast it would exceed 2.7% by the end of this year as the 
pound’s slump pushes up the price of imports, and these figures are showing 
signs of that effect.NF
 
Breaking news: UK inflation came in higher than expected in December, with the 
Bank of England’s preferred CPI measurement up 1.6% compared to 1.2% in the 
previous month and expectations of 1.4%.
 
The chairman of HSBC has criticised those who argue that Britain’s Brexit vote 
was a vote for free trade.

Speaking in Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> this morning, 
Douglas Flint was asked whether voters in the North of England were voting for 
free trade when they ticked the “No” box in last June’s referendum, as some 
Brexiteers have argued.

Flint dismissed the idea as “extraordinary”:

No, I think they were voting to leave the EU. I think the interpretation of 
the vote is extraordinary, just as it is in the US as well.

People can have theories, but at the end of the day certainly in relation to 
Brexit there was a single question on the voting slip and that’s what people 
voted for. They voted to leave Europe, whatever was in their minds that caused 
them to vote that way is up to them.

The priority now is to implement Brexit, in as painless a way as possible, 
Flint continued.


Lot of people can have theories, usually backing up their own 
perception....but we’ve had a vote, and we’re now in the implementation phase, 
of what does that mean and how to you execute it in a way that does the least 
harm to the EU 27 and the UK and can be completed as efficiently and quickly as 
possible.

Flint says that HSBC is now doing a “huge amount of work” helping clients 
understand what Brexit means. Their supply chains may be ‘longer and clunkier’ 
than before, and revenue may take longer to flow through.

The “real challenge” is helping small and medium-sized forms who haven’t had 
to think about these issues for the last 40 years, as they were part of the 
single market.

Flint reminded his audience that the City had coped extremely well with the 
turbulence in the markets after June 23; that’s a reason not to fragment 
London’s financial system.

Very few financial systems in the world that could cope with that event, there 
was so much volatility, and nothing broke, Flint said.

What exists in London today is the aggregation of decades of experience, risk 
management, and so forth, he added. Fragmenting that across New York, 
Singapore, etc would go against efforts to reduce risks in the financial sector.

Flint also warned that Europe’s economy could suffer if the Brexit deal hurts 
the City:


One of the dangers is that the aggregate supply of financial capacity to the 
economy of Europe drops in two years time, which would not be consistent with 
trying to grow the economy.
 
One of the attendees at Davos is the head of the world’s biggest fund manager 
Blackrock, which has been making headlines in the financial world by attacking 
executive pay and becoming the largest shareholder in LloydsBanking 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/banking> Group. Jill Treanor has the 
background:

Among the 3,000 politicians, business leaders, economists and celebrities 
attending this year’s World Economic Forum inDavos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> will be a 64-year-old with 
receding hair and rimless glasses.

The academic demeanour of Larry Fink belies his role running BlackRock, an 
outfit he founded 30 years ago and which has become the biggest fund manager on 
the planet, overseeing $5.1tn (£4.2tn) of investments for pensioners and savers.

The sheer size of the operation – the UK economy is worth £1.8tn 
<http://visual.ons.gov.uk/tag/gdp/> – puts Fink at the helm of an international 
powerhouse, with tentacles across markets for stocks and bonds around the globe.

In the UK alone, BlackRock is usually found among the top three shareholders 
in FTSE 100 blue-chip companies. Last weekit pipped the UK government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/08/blackrock-biggest-lloyds-banking-group-shareholder>
 to become the biggest investor in Lloyds Banking Group.

While Fink makes regular appearances at major events such as Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> – this year he is to opine on the 
global economy – BlackRock is not known for its public pronouncements. It does 
not provide specific detail on its shareholdings in each company or offer 
opinions on individual investments.

However, there are signs that it may be about to become more vocal in public 
after its UK arm fired offa letter to the boards of the biggest 350 companies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/15/blackrock-demands-cuts-to-executive-pay-and-bonuses>
 listed in London to urge them to rein in executive pay.

Perhaps Davos <https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> 2018 should have

We just caught up with John Nelson, chairman of Lloyd’s of London, about 
Britain’s exit from the European Union.


Nelson was a “remainer” but says:

“We’ve had all the arguments about the various options. We are leaving. We’ve 
got to get used to it. Let’s get cracking. The sooner we get negotiations going 
the better. We need decisions at the top.”

Nelson said the signs ahead of Theresa May’s speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/16/theresa-may-to-confirm-uk-exit-from-eu-single-market-speech>
 were that the UK would not have access to the single market after Brexit, and 
the City would lose the passporting rights that allow staff to work across the 
EU.

“We need to make the best of it,” he said.

“It doesn’t make sense to discriminate against the UK as a punishment.

It is in everyone’s interests to have as much free trade as possible. But I 
don’t expect a special deal.”

Lloyd’s is setting up a European subsidiary to get round the passporting 
issue. The location of the office will be announced in the next three months, 
Nelson said.

Nelson also had mixed feelings about the arrival in the White House of Donald 
Trump.

He expressed concern about the president elect’s views on climate change - a 
key issue for the insurance industry - but thinks Trump could stimulate growth.

“Climate change is a long-term problem. Our concern is that Trump will reverse 
the slow progress that has been make. It will put humanity at risk if we 
continue to blow carbon into the air.”
 
Harvard professor Ken Rogoff has been predicting tense times in the world’s 
government bond markets, once Donald Trump gets his hands on the keys to the 
White House:

Theresa May’s upcoming speech on Britain’s exit strategy is the talk of Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> this morning.

Yesterday’s reports that the UK PM will announce the UK will leave the single 
market has disappointed those hoping for a ‘soft Brexit’.

It’s a chilly minus 13 degrees Celsius in Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> this morning, and some of the 
pavements are a little treacherous, but at least it’s not snowing.

Here’s Facebook’s WEF HQ - which the Daily Mail says  
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4119004/The-smuggest-Earth-ROBERT-HARDMAN-visits-Davos-five-star-Swiss-resort-attention-seeking-celebs-billionaires-world-s-political-elite.html>
was built specially for the occasion.

Good morning from Davos, where the World Economic Forum is getting underway.

Once again world leaders, top business people, economists, academics and the 
media have descended on this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world 
and hammer out deals.

Much is the same as usual - from the bustling high-powered CEOs to the armed 
police on the streets.

But this year’s WEF is different; taking place under the twin shadows of 
Donald Trump’s election victory and the Brexit vote, and the broader tide of 
populism.

Last night, WEF founder Klaus Schwab told the assembled throng that they must 
“prioritise” the public social good, over their own interests.

“Sometimes it seems that the world is overwhelmed by pessimism and cynicism. 
But we have to look in a confident way into the future.”


This morning we’ll get an insight into the new world order, when Chinese 
president Xi Jinping formally opens WEF.

Xi is expected to make a powerful defence of globalisation, and pitch China as 
a country that could fill the void if Trump tries to take America way from free 
trade.

Quartz has a good take this morning:

Xi will defend trade and make a pitch for China to step into the leadership 
void left by a more-protectionist US under president Trump. It’s worth keeping 
an eye on@realDonaldTrump 
<http://www.us5.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=610c6c88d981c23e5c6638b14&id=13747674ae&e=7d38f539ab>
, to see if the US president-elect tries to steal the Chinese president’s 
thunder with a trademark early-morning tweetstorm.

One of Trump’s key advisers, Anthony Scaramucci, is also taking the stage 
today to discuss where the US economy is heading. That could give some crucial 
insights into the Trump camp’s thinking.

There’s also masses of other meetings, covering issues such as the 4th 
Industrial Revolution, equality and climate change, a speech by outgoing 
secretary of state John Kerry, and Hollywood star Matt Damon with his water.org 
charity.

 * 11am Davos time/10am GMT: Xi Jinping speech

 * 1pm/noon GMT: Anthony Scaramucci on the Outlook for the United States

 * 3.15pm/2.15pm GMT: John Kerry on ‘diplomacy in an era of disruption’.

We’ll be tracking all the key events in Davos 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/davos> today, and trying to explain what 
it means for the world economy.
