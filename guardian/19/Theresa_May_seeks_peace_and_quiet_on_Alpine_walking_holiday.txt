Theresa May has headed off on an Alpine trek with her husband, Philip, as they 
began a two-week holiday inSwitzerland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland>.

The couple are regular visitors to the Swiss Alps, with the prime minister 
previously saying she loves holidaying in Switzerland because she can get some 
“peace and quiet”.

Allowing photographers to capture an image at the start of her break, the 
premier’s holiday looked to be rather different to those of her predecessor.

David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, were regularly photographed enjoying a 
drink 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/14/david-cameron-treated-swimmers-ear-holiday-portugal>
 at a beachside cafe, wearing summer clothes, as they relaxed in sunnier 
climes. The Mays, however, looked ready for action as they headed out into a 
forest using hiking poles and wearing walking trousers, boots, polo shirts and 
rucksacks.

The prime minister said she and her husband “discovered the joys” of walking 
in the country quite by chance. In a piece for the Telegraph in August 2007, 
she said: “We first visited the country about 25 years ago, but spent most of 
the time in Lucerne.

“On a return trip, we decided to go walking, enjoyed it and gradually began 
doing more adventurous hikes. We have been going back ever since and have 
walked all over the country.”

May said her two favourite areas are Zermatt and the Bernese Oberland, which 
are both “fantastic for walking”.

“If you’re a keen walker, Switzerland is a wonderful summer destination: the 
views are spectacular, the air is clear and you can get some peace and quiet,” 
she said.

During a recent visit to Berlin 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/theresa-may-to-angela-merkel-uk-will-need-time-to-prepare-for-brexit>
, her first overseas trip as prime minister, May gave the German chancellor, 
Angela Merkel, two books about hiking to reflect their shared passion for the 
hobby.

Her holiday comes a month after May was handed the keys to No 10 following 
Cameron’s resignation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jul/13/david-cameron-and-family-leave-downing-street-for-the-last-time-video>
, precipitated by the Brexit vote.

Downing Street said the prime minister remains in charge and will be kept 
fully briefed while she is away. The chancellor,Philip Hammond 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond>, is the most senior 
cabinet minister in London during her absence.

May’s trip has been interpreted as symbolic by some, with Switzerland being 
neither a member of the EU or the European Economic Area,nor having access 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/03/eu-swiss-single-market-access-no-free-movement-citizens>
 to the single market.

She is not the first prime minister to have taken a holiday in Switzerland. 
Margaret Thatcher visited the country several times while prime minister to see 
the retired Conservative MP Sir Douglas Glover and his wife.
