The NHS <https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs> needs to spend more money 
looking after people in their own homes rather than in hospital, the chief 
nursing officer for England has warned.

Jane Cummings of NHS England said too much cash was being pumped into caring 
for patients in “old and expensive” hospitals, rather in a more efficient 
domiciliary setting.

In a letter to the Telegraph, Cummings said a greater emphasis on home care 
would result in a service that was better catered to a patient’s individual 
needs.

She said: “With more care provided at home, the NHS can spend more cash on 
patients rather than maintaining old and expensive buildings. And more people 
can be better looked after, with care personalised to their needs.”

She said refocusing the spending priorities towards domiciliary care would be 
controversial, but were necessary for the benefit of patients. In her letter, 
she said: “Whatever the merits of these plans, choices like these will always 
be controversial because we are talking about changes to strongly supported 
services that have served communities well for years.

“So this is not a moment to sit on our hands, nor to instigate big-bang 
changes. What we need is decisive but well-debated, locally owned improvements, 
doing things for which nurses, doctors and other health and care workers have 
argued for years.”

She said there was a real need to change “outdated models of care” so patients 
“don’t fall into the cracks between different parts of the system and ensuring 
that we provide care based around their needs, and not those of NHS 
organisations”.
