Old India hands know Kolkata as the most soulful city in India. Contrary to 
the picture painted in Dominique Lapierre’s novel City of Joy, Kolkata is 
vibrant, uplifting and probably the friendliest city in the subcontinent. 
Strangers will invite you for a chai just to talk and exchange ideas. 
Friendships are struck up in an instant and the city is abuzz with intellect 
and creativity.

For great photo opportunities go to the wholesale flower market at Mallick Ghat
, under the eastern end of Howrah bridge. Wind through the mountains of 
marigolds and jasmine, then climb the steps on to the bridge and look along the 
railing for the evil eye graffiti: this is the spot for the best aerial shots.

West Bengal is home to some of the finest weaving in India. Byloom 
<http://byloom.co.in/byloom/> and Weavers Studio <http://weaversstudio.in/> are 
well-known showrooms, but I also love the contemporarykhadi (hand-woven cotton) 
bySsahaworks <https://www.facebook.com/people/Ssaha-Works/100003135352258> and 
natural indigo garments byMaku Textiles 
<https://www.facebook.com/pg/MakuTextile/photos/>. The city is also home to 
some of the country’s best fashion designers, includingSabyasachi Mukherjee 
<https://www.facebook.com/Sabyasachi-Mukherjee-172689552749420/>, who has a 
passion for traditional Indian craft and embellishment.

Make sure to have a gimlet or gin fizz at Mocambo (25B Park Street). This 
much-loved restaurant, unchanged since 1956, was once the epitome of European 
glamour, with live jazz, low lighting and devilled crab on the menu.

The best food in Kolkata is served at home. Bomti Iyengar, a charming art 
collector and bon vivant who lives in a great heritage building and specialises 
in emerging artists welcomes clients to browse the collection. He hosts lunches 
and dinners of Bengali cuisine (about £25 a head,bomtiyengar@yahoo.com <mailto: 
bomtiyengar@yahoo.com>), including mishti doi (sweet yoghurt).

For eating out, try Suruchi  <http://bengalcuisine.in/suruchi>(89 Elliot 
Road), an all-women social enterpriseserving home-style Bengali food. For a 
beer with your meal, head toOh Calcutta 
<http://speciality.co.in/oh_calcutta/kolkata.html>, the only Bengali restaurant 
with an alcohol licence outside the big hotels.

<http://fairlawnhotel.com/> (doubles from £50). The building, on hippy Sudder 
Street, dates from 1783, and has hosted Eric Newby, Tom Stoppard and Felicity 
Kendal. The best rooms are 2, 3, 4 and 7.

Start your day with a stroll round the Agri-Horticultural Society of India 
<http://www.agrihorticultureindia.com/location> garden, established almost 200 
years ago. Then breakfast nearby on a crisp dosa at the basic Garden Café (8/1, 
Alipore Road). Carry on the walking theme with an expert such asManjit from

When I’m researching my books I ask locals about places they love. A famous 
jeweller recommended Alipore furniture market, and told me to go upstairs in 
the tiny shops and search for Burmese teak amid the dust. A diplomat shared his 
nostalgia for sweets fromNahoum and Sons 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/30/nahoum-sons-jewish-bakery-kolkata-india>
, an old Jewish bakery in New Market. A schoolteacher revealed her favourite 
sari store,Balaram Saha <http://www.balaramsaha.com/>, which grew out of a 
door-to-door business, and my taxi driver took me to a great chai shop, Sharma 
Tea House (5C Shambhunath Pandit Street).
