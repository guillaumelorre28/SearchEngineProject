Thomas Cook <https://www.theguardian.com/business/thomascookgroup> is to fly 
almost 1,000 UK customers out of The Gambia, as the UK Foreign Office (FCO) 
advises against all but essential travel to the country.


The country’s political situation has been deteriorating since incumbent 
president Yahya Jammeh refused to hand power to Adama Barrow, who won in last 
month’s elections. The Gambia’s parliament extended president Yahya Jammeh’s 
term by 90 days on Wednesday, but regional leaders have threatened to use 
military force if he refuses to cede power.

The FCO have advised tourists: “The potential for military intervention and 
civil disturbance is high and could result in Banjul International Airport 
being closed at short notice.”

Thousands of Gambians are also reportedly been leaving the country in fear of 
the situation deteriorating into war.
