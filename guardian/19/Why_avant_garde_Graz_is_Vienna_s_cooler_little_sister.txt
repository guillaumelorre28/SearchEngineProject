Graz, Austria’s second city, is like Vienna without the pomposity. There is 
the sweep of architectural styles – from gothic to Renaissance to baroque – 
you’d expect in a former imperial city with a Unesco-listed old town. But it is 
less traditional than the capital and the vibe is more relaxed, thanks partly 
to the fact that nearly one person in five is a student, and partly because it 
hosts the oldest avant garde festival in Europe.

Steirischer Herbst <http://steirischerherbst.at/> (until 16 October), which 
has run annually since 1968, will see 650 artists transform the city with 100 
projects including screenings, readings, music, theatre and parties. Highlights 
of this year’s festival include Chinese artist Ai Weiwei’s exhibition at the 
Kunsthaus, Kneaded Knowledge: The Language of Ceramics (to 19 February 2017).

 Lemm & Barkey’s Forever, at Steirischer Herbst this month. 
The music programme features a performance this Saturday by Kairo is Koming 
<http://www.steirischerherbst.at/english/Programme/club-panamur/Kairo-is-Koming>
, a collective of electronic musicians and DJs from Cairo who came together 
during the Arab spring. Venues include abandoned factories, swimming pools and 
mine tunnels.

Graz has a rich history of avant garde art – in 1959, a group of artists, 
scientists and cultural workers turned a vacant city park cafe, now the Forum 
Stadtpark, into a venue for cross-genre exhibitions and events. In 2003, Graz 
was crowned European Capital of Culture, and the city’s futuristic contemporary 
art museum, theKunsthaus 
<http://www.austria.info/us/austria/say-hello-to-graz-friendly-alien>, was 
built in the same year. From 2011-13 it was a Unesco City of Design. Ever 
since, the art scene has been growing, with new architecture such as the steel 
and glass rooftopFreiblick cafe  <http://freiblick.co.at/>on the sixth floor of 
department store Kastner & Öhler, an artwork tunnel at Graz’s main railway 
station, and the extension of theJoanneum <https://www.museum-joanneum.at/en> 
museum complex.

The west bank of the Mur, once the red light district, is now a vibrant, 
neighbourhood with Bosnian, Serb, Slovenian, Turkish and Albanian communities. 
Two squares here are being hyped as “the next Neukölln”, after the hip Berlin 
district, because of the influx of artists and businesses popping up in 
formerly empty shops.

Griesplatz runs regular street festivals with DJs blaring from balconies and 
pop-up street markets (the next is on 28 October). Cultural startups from 
architecture practices to music magazines have moved into the area, along with 
non-profitLiving Rooms <http://www.living-rooms.at/>, which hosts garden swaps 
(like a clothes swap but with plants).

 Chivito, in Graz’s Lendpltaz 
Lendplatz, to the north, has flower markets, restaurants and bars that draw a 
young crowd.Chivito <http://chivito.at/> is a tiny Uruguayan bar where the 
bartender serves mojitos out of a window. Vegetarian restaurants includeMangolds
 <http://www.mangolds.at/>, where diners fill a plate from a daily changing 
spread and pay by weight. Nearby, theKunsthaus Café 
<http://kunsthauscafe.co.at/> serves tasty suppers of, say, bulgur, falafel and 
grapefruit, and moonlights as a bar with DJs spinning electronica. This 
December, the Murinsel, the artificial river island created for the Capital of 
Culture, reopens with a new bar and cafe.
