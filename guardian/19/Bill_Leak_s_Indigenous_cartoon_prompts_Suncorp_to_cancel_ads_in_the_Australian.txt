The Australian has come under fire from advertisers over Bill Leak’s 
Indigenous cartoon with one major bank cancelling its advertising.

SunCorp Bank said on Twitter it “definitely [does] not support the cartoon in 
yesterday’s issue”.

“We are now working with our media placement agencies to remove our 
advertising from this content.”

Another advertiser, the Adelaide festival, said it had placed ads “well in 
advance of Bill Leak’s disgraceful cartoon” and was now reviewing further ads.

“The Adelaide festival does not endorse the sentiments of Bill Leak’s 
cartoon,” the festival said. “The festival deplores all forms of racism and 
editorial commentary that vilifies Australia’s First Nations people: it betrays 
the complex economic, social and cultural issues that face many Indigenous 
communities with racist stereotypes.

“The Adelaide festival and the artistic directors, Neil Armfield and Rachel 
Healy, have a long history of providing a platform for contemporary Indigenous 
creative expression and will continue to do this proudly into the future.

“It is through the power of creative storytelling that the diversity of 
Indigenous history and experiences have most successfully been shared with the 
broader Australian community.”

Despite widespread criticism that the cartoon was racist, Leak and the 
newspaper’s editor-in-chief, Paul Whittaker, have defended the drawing of a 
drunk Aboriginal father who had forgotten his own son’s name.

The Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, released a statement saying 
he was appalled by the cartoon’s racist stereotypes.

: “I was trying to say that if you think things are pretty crook for the 
children locked up in the Northern Territory’s Don Dale youth detention centre, 
you should have a look at the homes they came from. Then you might understand 
why so many of them finished up.”

Whittaker cited columns by high profile Indigenous Australians

Langton and Noel Pearson when defending the cartoon. But Langton told Guardian 
Australia she was not comfortable being used in the defence of the cartoon.

The advertisers appear to be responding to people who have complained directly 
to them, perhaps prompted byan article in New Matilda 
<https://newmatilda.com/2016/08/05/a-punters-guide-to-bill-leak-the-oz-and-the-companies-that-finance-their-racism/>
 which listed the companies which appeared in Thursday’s paper.

Greenpeace <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace> Australia has 
also condemned the cartoon and the paper for publishing it.

“We are saddened and upset by the offensive Bill Leak cartoon in the 
Australian that denigrates Australia’s first peoples,” it said in a statement.

A spokeswoman for Suncorp Bank confirmed the bank had removed its advertising 
from the Australian.

“We have removed our advertising from the content, and have temporarily 
suspended any future placements,” she said.
