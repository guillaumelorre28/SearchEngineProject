Is there not a certain irony in Liam Fox’s exhortation to business leaders 
that “if you want to share in the prosperity of our country you have a duty to 
contribute to the prosperity of our country” (Trade minister attacks ‘fat and 
lazy’ British business bosses 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/fat-and-lazy-britain-is-ill-prepared-to-secure-future-outside-eu-says-fox>
, 10 September), considering the fact that he demonstrated little restraint in

putting up the words of the discarded “frustrate their knavish tricks” verse 
during the national anthem?
