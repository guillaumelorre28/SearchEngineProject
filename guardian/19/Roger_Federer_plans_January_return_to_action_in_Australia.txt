Roger Federer, who is sidelined for the rest of the year, has said he plans to 
return to competition in Australia in January at the Hopman Cup and the
Australian Open <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>.


 The record 17-times grand slam singles winner announced last month that he 
would be missing the Rio Olympics, the US Open and the remainder of the 2016 
schedule in order to properly recover after having knee surgery earlier this 
year.

 The Swiss world No4 said he was taking a positive outlook. “I don’t see it as 
the end of something. I see it as a beginning to something I’m working for, and 
when I come back to the Hopman Cup and then to the Australian Open ... that’s 
what I’m working for now,” said the 35-year-old.

 Federer was speaking at a news conference where it was announced that he and 
Rafa Nadal were committing to play for Team Europe in the inaugural Laver Cup 
matches next year against a rest of the world team in Prague on 22-24 September.

 “I’m doing well and I’ve been training as much as I possibly could to 
restrengthen my quad and my body to keep it in shape,” said Federer, who had 
surgery on his left knee in February.

 “So when I head back into the gym for full on fitness in the next couple of 
months, then I’m ready for it. I just hope to be super strong when I come back 
in January.”
