The Showbox at The Market

Located just across the street from the picture-perfect Pike Place Market, the 
Showbox at the Market is a Seattle legend. It opened in 1939 and everyone from 
Muddy Waters to Pearl Jam has played beneath its stately chandeliers. With a 
capacity of just over 1,100, the Showbox mostly hosts national and 
international touring bands – and local bands with the largest draw. With two 
bars just a few steps above the main floor, even the most vertically challenged 
concert goers can usually find a spot to see the stage, making it one of the 
most enjoyable places in Seattle to see a show for all ages, heights and 
interests.

Cafe Racer

A cosy neighbourhood coffee shop and a colourful hole-in-the-wall bar, Cafe 
Racer is home to the Obama (Official Bad Art Museum of Art) and The Racer 
Sessions. Curated by a different musician every Sunday, the sessions are 
dedicated to exploring innovative original compositions and improvisation. The 
community of avant-garde musicians who jam here every Sunday have been hailed 
by the New York Times as the future of Seattle's jazz tradition. If 
improvisational music isn't to your taste, stop by the bar at night from 
Thursday to Saturday, when local punk and rock bands play live and loud.

Columbia City Theater
 Columbia City, Seattle 
Built in 1917, Columbia City Theater is the oldest vaudeville theatre in the 
state of Washington. In the 1940s jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Ella 
Fitzgerald graced its stage. In the 1980s it was home to the burgeoning DIY 
punk movement, and in the 1990s it was an art commune and underground rave 
house. Renovated, and then reopened in 2010, it was named "[Seattle's] 
finest-sounding room" by New York-based Spin magazine. Today, the elegant 
theatre, with its soaring ceilings, exposed brick walls, and red velvet 
curtains ,hosts largely local line-ups spanning genres from acoustic Americana 
to hip-hop, as well as the occasional burlesque revue.

The Crocodile

The Crocodile, formerly The Crocodile Cafe, has been a staple of the Seattle 
music scene since it first opened in 1991. In its first incarnation, local 
bands such as Nirvana andDeath Cab for Cutie <http://www.deathcabforcutie.com/> 
filled its cramped stage before becoming international sensations. Briefly 
closed for two years, the Crocodile is again in tune with a flourishing Seattle 
music scene: hip-hop. While the bookers here choose touring and local acts of 
all stripes and sounds, their hip-hop booking is reminiscent of the club's 
early days.

Electric Tea Garden

If you're looking to dance at a spot that feels more after-hours house party 
than strobe-lit meat market, Electric Tea Garden (ETG) is the perfect place. 
Located on the outer edge of Capitol Hill's bustling bar strip of Pike Street, 
this second-floor club has a decidedly underground feel. In part, that's 
because it began as a quasi-legal after-hours club and it has no signage. 
Dedicated to "promoting all forms of DJ culture", ETG's events cover all styles 
of electronic music – though weekend nights tend to be house and techno, while 
week nights offer more down-tempo fare.

The Highline

If you like your music metal and your food meatless, the Highline has just 
what you're looking for. With a dark and divey ambience, the Highline is run by 
metalheads for metalheads, and is the epicentre of Seattle's robustCVLT 
<http://www.cvltnation.com/cvlt/about/> metal scene. It boasts a vegan menu 
that even carnivores will crave: you can wash down your country fried tofu with 
one of 25-plus beers on tap or a housemade booze infusion. Live (and LOUD!) 
music usually happens from Wednesday to Sunday. If you prefer to take the stage 
yourself, stop by for "cakearoke" on Tuesdays: "a pastry positive environment, 
with karaoke choices you won't see anywhere else".

Q Nightclub

To tourists, Seattle may be best-known for grunge, but locals know the city 
boasts one of the best and brightest electronic music communities in the 
country. The newest addition to this energetic scene is sleek Capitol Hill 
megaclub Q, boasting an exceptional Funktion One sound system and booking 
world-class DJs, as well as local favourites. You'd be hard-pressed to find a 
better space to experience electronic music in Seattle. This come-as-you-are 
club (there's no dress code) has queues out the of door Wednesday to Saturday 
nights, but Sunday afternoon's weekly Revival party offers a less-hectic chance 
to dance to high-quality DJs.

The Royal Room
 Photograph: 
Located in the diverse neighbourhood of Columbia City, the Royal Room is a 
quick light-rail trip from downtown Seattle, but shows a side of the city that 
visitors rarely see. Describing itself as a "collaborative community space", 
the Royal Room, with its permanent backline, offers a comfortably chic space 
for jazz, blues and improvisational musicians to jam. From Thursday to Monday, 
local artists are featured with no cover charge, melding neighbourhood bar and 
destination music venue. Tuesday and Wednesday nights are reserved for national 
touring acts, and reservations are recommended.

Tractor Tavern

With cowboy boots hanging from the ceiling, a cow skull adorning the stage, 
and stiff pours of bourbon from behind the bar, the Tractor is a little bit 
country, a little bit rock'n'roll. Set in the heart of now-bustling Ballard, a 
once-sleepy enclave of Scandinavian fishermen, the Tractor is the heart of 
Seattle's Americana, alt-country, blues and rockabilly scene, though it hosts 
concerts of all genres. Open only for shows, the Tractor books a mix of local, 
national, and international acts as well as a raucous bi-monthly Monday night 
honky-tonk, complete with square-dancing lessons for beginners.

Vera Project

Located in the shadow of the Space Needle, the Vera Project isn't just a music 
venue, it's a movement. Beyond hosting weekly concerts, open to music lovers of 
all ages, it also offers hands-on education about the music industry. The space 
offers courses on everything from sound engineering to screen printing. It is 
run by volunteers, so you'll see teenagers filling every role from stage 
manager to ticket taker. Vera's stage hosts both local and touring bands, but 
keep in mind that it's an all-ages venue, so shows start and end early and 
there's no alcohol sold or allowed on-site.
