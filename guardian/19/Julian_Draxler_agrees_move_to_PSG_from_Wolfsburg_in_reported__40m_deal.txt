Wolfsburg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/wolfsburg> say the 23-year-old 
Draxler will sign a four-and-a-half-year deal from 1 January subject to a 
medical. Both sides agreed not to disclose the transfer fee but the news agency 
dpa reports an agreement of €42m (£35.8m) with add-ons of up to €5m.

Draxler joined Wolfsburg from their Bundesliga rivals Schalke in August 2015 to
replace Kevin De Bruyne

, but he never really settled at the Volkswagen-backed club. He scored five 
goals in 34 league games for Wolfsburg. Altogether he has 23 goals in 153 
Bundesliga games, and three in 27 games for Germany.

“Of course I’m sad to see Julian go because he’s an outstanding footballer,” 
the Wolfsburg head coach, Valérien Ismaël, toldhis club’s website 
<https://www.vfl-wolfsburg.de/info/aktuelles/detailseite/artikel/abschied-44937.html>
.

“He gave everything in the recent matches against Frankfurt and Gladbach and 
once again showed how much this club meant to him. I hope his move to France 
provides him with a fresh challenge.”
