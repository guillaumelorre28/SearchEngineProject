I’m knee deep in gaffer tape. Rolls and rolls of the stuff have secured two 
chunky ice-hockey shin pads to my Lycra-clad legs, and I’m wearing shoes that 
have been meticulously customised with dozens of tiny metal screws to stop me 
slipping. Before me, the St Lawrence river is a treacherous tapestry of chunky 
ice and fast-moving water, the backdrop of sub-zero cyan sky spiked by the 
majestic outline of Quebec City.

I’m about to sample ice canoeing, the latest high-octane winter activity 
that’s set to feature on every adrenaline junkie’s bucket list. Historically a 
means for locals to cross the water between the cities of Levis and Quebec, the 
old-school transport method has evolved since the 17th century into a 
fast-paced competitive sport. Now, thrill-seeking amateurs like myself can have 
a go withCanot à Glace Québec <http://www.canotaglacequebec.com/>’s new tours, 
launched earlier this year.

The vast width of Quebec’s St Lawrence river (an average of 1km), combined 
with the region’s brutal climate creates huge slabs of ice that cover the water 
surface and float with the ever-changing currents. It is the only place in the 
world with the right conditions for the sport. If canoeing in Canada makes you 
think of a filtered Instagram shot of a wooden boat on a placid lake, then 
you’re wrong. So, so wrong.

 Hitching a lift on a passing berg. 
Our French- and English-speaking instructors, Benjamin and Marie-Janic, are 
welder and student during the week, but on the weekends they are ice canoeing 
dons, with a brag-worthy collection of medals between them.

The reality of the challenge sinks in as we’re led to the snowy shores of the 
river, where a 12-metre, 165kg hunk of carbon fibre waits. The three of us 
rookies – myself and friends Adam and Sarah-Jane – are told to choose positions 
in the canoe. “If you fall in,” warns Marie-Janic, “do not panic. The water is 
far warmer than the air.”If?

The first few minutes on the river are relatively straightforward. We’re 
rowing backwards with Benjamin counting us through our strokes in a pattern 
that’s strangely hypnotic. But not for long. “Get ready for scootering!” he 
shouts. We launch ourselves from our seats and scramble our way along the 
centimetre-thin rim of the boat into an ungainly straddling position, with one 
leg in and one leg out of the boat and force our canoe over spiky, frozen 
blocks of ice.

Our farcical efforts continue for two thrilling, terrifying, hours. Benjamin 
warns us each time we approach obstacles (“ICE LEFT! ICE RIGHT!”) and we 
scooter about 20 times. I dunk myself to thigh-height regularly, nearly topple 
out the canoe on three others, and almost lop Marie-Janic’s head off with my 
paddle (which is covered in ice-slicing blades).

The icy wind is vicious, but it’s not to blame for the savage pain in my ears. 
That’s caused by the deafening crunch of the canoe hitting the ice – like a 
glass skyscraper shattering around me. I swear frantically, loudly and 
constantly, but no one hears. We learn how to do a race start too, which 
prompts hysterical nervous laughter. Sprinting our canoe across the top of a 
large flat slab of ice, we take it in turns to slip, fall and slide off in 
various directions across the marble-hard surface.

Just as I’m starting to flag, it’s time for a break. We park our canoe by 
ramming into a floating berg, and for the first time I can truly appreciate my 
surroundings. We’re totally alone on the river, with shafts of sunlight 
bouncing off jagged boulders of ice.

“You could get these views by taking the 10-minute car ferry crossing,” Michel 
tells me, sipping a hot chocolate he’s brought for the ride, “but where’s the 
fun in that?”
