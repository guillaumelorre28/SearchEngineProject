Andy Murray, the year end world, No1 lifts the trophy above his head. He 
finishes the year as the best player in the world, too good even for the 
wondrousNovak Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic>. I 
suspect they’ll be meet again in the final of the Australian Open in January. 
For now, though, they’re both off for a well earned rest. That’s all from me. 
Thanks for your emails over the past week. Bye!
 Murray. World number one. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian

Sorry for the slight delay in the last update, the wifi inside the O2 Arena 
decided to cut out just as Djokovic hit his final return long.

ANDY MURRAY BEATS NOVAK DJOKOVIC 6-3, 6-4 TO WIN THE ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS AND 
FINISH THE YEAR AS THE WORLD NO1!

Serving for the title, Murray is greeted by a huge roar of encouragement as he 
walks to the baseline. You sense that Djokovic isn’t finished yet, though. It’s 
rarely been his style to leave without a fight. But it’s 15-0 when Djokovic 
sends a shabby backhand long. An ace down the middle from Murray makes it 30-0. 
The cheers become that bit more urgent. Murray nets a backhand to make it 
30-15, though, before netting a forehand to make it 30-all. It’s never easy, is 
it? Thoughts drift back to the Wimbledon final in 2013. But Murray earns his 
first championship point, a volley forcing Djokovic to dab a strange lob well 
past the baseline. The roar is deafening. What Murray would give for a first 
serve here. Before they can get down to business, though, the umpire has to 
tell everyone to turn the lights off their phones. Eventually Murray swings an 
ace down the middle. But it’s a let. So they go again. Djokovic cracks a 
forehand into the right corner and charges forward to stay alive with a smash. 
Another monstrous serve from Murray earns him asecond championship point, 
though. Naturally, he nets a first serve. His first serve is weak. Djokovic 
dominates a short rally and wins it with a wonderful forehand, but then he 
drags a forehand wide. Murray has athird championship point. Murray sends a 
first serve long. The tension is unbearable. The second serve is there to be 
hit, so Djokovic hits it. Unfortunately for him, brilliantly for Murray, his 
forehand flies wide and long! That’s it! Murray has won theATP World Tour Finals
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atp-world-tour-finals> for the first time 
in his career and finishes the year as the world No1!

Second set: Djokovic* 3-6, 4-5 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic is serving 
to stay in the final. Murray completely mishits a forehand to make it 15-0, 
then nets a backhand return to make it 30-0. Djokovic misses a backhand to make

40-15. Djokovic lashes a forehand away to hold. Murray will serve for the 
title. We’ve been going for 92 minutes. What must be going through Murray’s 
head?

Second set: Djokovic 3-6, 3-5 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray will be 
desperate not to lose momentum completely here. He’ll know better how difficult 
it is to stop Djokovic if he gives him any encouragement and it’s not looking 
too clever when he sends a forehand at the end of a punishing rally. Djokovic 
leads 0-15. Murray manages to move into a 30-15 lead, serving well. Then 
Djokovic pushes a backhand inches wide, much to the relief of a wheezing 
Murray, who’s having to work so hard here. It’s 40-15. Murray thinks he’s won 
the game with an ace. Djokovic challenges. Murray strides off towards his 
chair, convinced it was in. It was miles out. That was curious behaviour from 
Murray, who nonetheless manages to hold when Djokovic knocks a backhand long. 
Djokovic will serve to stay in the final.

Second set: Djokovic* 3-6, 3-4 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic suddenly 
looks like a different animal, charging into a 30-0 lead. Murray probably 
suspected this might happen. Soon Djokovic leads 40-0 as Murray whistles a 
forehand long despite reaching a smash. The Serb holds to love, winning the 
drop shot war with Murray, who is likely to come under intense pressure now.

Second set: Djokovic 3-6, 2-4 Murray* (*denotes server): “Do you think that 
both of these players really just want to get back to the dressing room to 
watch Planet Earth II, they’re getting through the match in an 
uncharacteristically quick time so far,” wonders David Wall. Not so fast, 
David. Murray pulls a forehand wide to make it 0-15, challenging 
unsuccessfully. He makes up for it with a beauty down the line, though. The 
game goes to 30-all, though, when Murray double faults. Then a deep return from 
Djokovic earns him his first break point of the match, which feels faintly 
absurd given who he is. This isn’t over yet. Murray sends a forehand long and 
Djokovic, ever the warrior, has one break back. The Serb clenches his fist.

Second set: Djokovic* 3-6, 1-4 Murray (*denotes server): These are choppy 
waters for Djokovic as he nets a forehand for 0-15, before dumping one long to 
make it 0-30. Djokovic approaches the net. Murray comes up with a stupendous 
backhand pass from left to right to earn three break points. That’s good 
tennis. Djokovic is in serious trouble now. He saves the first point. But not 
the second. A backhand goes long andMurray leads by a set and two breaks.

Second set: Djokovic 3-6, 1-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Having stopped the 
rot, Djokovic is likely to attack with renewed intent here and he leads 0-15 
when Murray arrows a backhand wide. It’s 15-all when Djokovic nets a forehand, 
though, and 30-15 after a swinging serve out wide from Murray. Then, 
astonishingly, Djokovic somehow crashes a forehand volley into the net, to the 
amazement of everyone here, even Murray, who can hardly believe his luck. 
That’s the boost Murray needs to hold to 15 with an ace out wide. What a miss 
that was from Djokovic. The Serbian journalist sitting next to me is beside 
himself.

Second set: Djokovic* 3-6, 1-2 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic challenges 
when a forehand is called long, but Hawkeye doesn’t come to his aid. Murray 
leads 0-15. Djokovic makes up for it with a precise backhand winner for 15-all

Murray netting a forehand at 40-15. This one is far from over.

Second set: Djokovic 3-6, 0-2 Murray* (*denotes server): A few fans are waving 
Serbian flags in the crowd. Djokovic really needs their support now. He trails 
by a set and a break and the majority of the crowd is with Murray, who’s got 
the bit between his teeth. But can he keep this going? Can he consolidate that 
precious break? Moving into a 40-0 lead with barely any trouble suggests that 
he can. And he holds to 15 thanks to a granite serve.

Second set: Djokovic* 3-6, 0-1 Murray (*denotes server): Looking a little 
edgy, Djokovic lifts a backhand wide to make it 15-30. Murray receives cries of 
encouragement from the crowd and then he earns two break points, overpowering 
the advancing Djokovic with a drilled backhand. This is a potentially huge 
moment. Murray can’t take the first, missing a backhand return off a deep first 
serve. Djokovic saves the second with a stunning serve out wide to force deuce. 
Murray finds a fine angle with a forehand to earn a third opportunity, Djokovic 
wasting a challenge on a ball that clipped the line. A deep slice from Djokovic 
draws a forehand error from Murray, though. Murray couldn’t quite sort out his 
feet in time. Djokovic gives up a fourth opportunity with an errant forehand, 
though. He didn’t miss it by much, but it was by enough, and Murray breaks when 
Djokovic nets a backhand!

Andy Murray wins the first set 6-3!

Serving for the set, Murray’s unlucky to lose the first point, Djokovic 
getting away with a net cord at the net. It’s 0-15, though, and that’s all that 
matters. Murray is immediately under pressure. Djokovic looks bewildered after 
knocking a forehand wide for 15-all, though. Then comes one of those endless 
baseline rallies these two specialise in. It has to end at some point, of 
course, and this one does with Djokovic lifting a slice wide for 30-15. 
Djokovic tries to stay positive, but his level has dipped and he sends another 
backhand wide to hand Murray two set points. If it had been in, Murray wasn’t 
getting there. But here we are. Murray has two set points. He only needs one. 
Djokovic nets a tame forehand and Murray leads this final!

First set: Djokovic* 3-5 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic doesn’t look like 
he’s in the mood for any funny business at the start of this game, remembering 
how to smash and making it 15-0. A tight backhand into the net makes it 15-all; 
another one that drifts past the baseline makes it 30-all. Murray chops a 
backhand slice long, though, and uses up a challenge for no good reason. But 
the game goes to deuce as Djokovic splatters a forehand long. He’s not always 
looked entirely steady out there, but he’s probably just putting on an act. 
Then again, a dismal backhand into the net that hands Murray a break point 
suggests otherwise. You sense Murray really needs to take this chance. He has 
to be clinical. He is clinical. They trade cautious slices for a while, but 
it’s Murray who ups the ante with a vicious forehand into the left corner that 
Djokovic can only slice into the net. Murray breaks and he’ll serve for the 
first set.

First set: Djokovic 3-4 Murray* (*denotes server): Wary of the dangers of 
allowing his focus to drop, Murray begins this game positively, slapping a 
forehand into the right corner for a 15-0 lead, then serving firmly to lead 
30-0. Another cracking serve makes it 40-0. Murray holds to 15, picking 
Djokovic off at the net with a glorious backhand down the line. This is turning 
into a very good match.

First set: Djokovic* 3-3 Murray (*denotes server): Murray sends a heavy 
forehand long to lose the first point of this game, but then he clumps one down 
the line to win one against the Djokovic serve for the first time. The game 
goes to 30-all, Murray edging another baseline rally. The volume in the arena 
rises and Murray earns the first break point of the match, forcing Djokovic to 
net an insipid forehand. Murray can’t convert it, though. Djokovic is rock 
solid on the baseline and Murray blinks first, netting a forehand. Murray earns 
another opportunity, though, a low slice drawing another error from Djokovic, 
who nets a forehand. Murray nets a slice, though. It’s deuce for a while, 
though, which is partly down to Djokovic absolutely butchering a gimme of a 
smash. Something falls on to the court, possibly from his racket. It’s 
difficult to make out what it was. Whatever. Djokovic raises his level to hold. 
Do not be surprised if he breaks in the next game.

First set: Djokovic 2-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray engages in a 
baseline rally with Djokovic, never the wisest of moves, but wins it with a 
cannily disguised forehand for 15-0. Djokovic responds with a rasping backhand 
down the line, though, and gobbles up a smash at the net for 15-all. Murray 
moves into a 40-15 lead after two weak Djokovic returns, though, and holds to 
30 thanks to a rollocking serve out wide.

First set: Djokovic* 2-2 Murray (*denotes server): Looking bright and 
energetic, Djokovic clips a forehand into the left corner and skips forward to 
volley astutely, before serving well to make it 30-0. Murray decides to attack 
a second serve but puts too much behind a rasping forehand, the game going to 
40-0. Djokovic holds to love with a confident smash. Murray needs to return 
better.

First set: Djokovic 1-2 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray didn’t make many 
first serves in his first service game and he won’t win this match if that 
trend continues. He makes a decent start here, though, forcing Djokovic to 
block a backhand return long for 15-0. Another solid serve makes it 30-0 and he 
hits a backhand well to make it 40-0. But Djokovic pulls it back to 40-15, 
lobbing cleverly, then makes it 40-30 when a backhand that was heading wide 
hits the top of the net and lands in. Murray holds to 30, though.

winning even though they didn't let him serve!@JacobSteinberg

First set: Djokovic* 1-1 Murray (*denotes server): There’s a delay before the 
start of this game, the umpire telling an idiot in the crowd to switch off the 
light on their phone. Why do these people bother buying a ticket? It happens in 
every match. Djokovic isn’t fussed, though. An ace takes him to 30-0 and he 
races through the next two points to hold to love. Fine serving from the world 
No2.

First set: Djokovic 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Andy Murray won the toss 
and the final begins him with serving. Ominously, he starts with a double 
fault. A careful rally ensues, both men exuding tension. It ends with Djokovic 
knocking a backhand long. Given that confidence boost, Murray pings an ace down 
the middle, Djokovic challenging to no avail. He follows that up with another 
double fault, though, the game going to 30-all, nerves getting the better of 
Murray, who steadies himself by moving to 40-30. Murray holds to 30. “Murray 
all in black & Nole almost back to his early season All Blackesque form,” says 
John McErnerney. “This should go the distance with Novak just having a tad more 
left in the tank than Andy. “Whatever it takes” the last words The 97 Lions 
heard as they left the dressing room for the 2nd Test well the same goes for 
these two.”

This is their 18th meeting in a final, their fifth this year alone. Djokovic 
was victorious in Melbourne, Madrid and Paris. Murray’s sole victory came in 
Rome in May. Overall Djokovic leads 10-7 in this department. Can Murray close 
the gap tonight?

Preamble

Hello. Even when Novak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> was beginning uncertainly 
against Dominic Thiem last weekend, even when Andy Murray was match point down 
against Milos Raonic last night, you knew that it was going end like this. 
Could it be any other way? No tearing up the script, no changing the ending 
just to make it look less predictable, no final between Gael Monfils and Marin 
Cilic; the two best players in the world meet in the final match of 2016, 
competing for the not insignificant honour of finishing the year as the world 
No1.

Back when Djokovic embarrassed Murray in the Australian Open final in January, 
no one viewed them as equals. Djokovic looked untouchable and he continued to 
assert his dominance over his old rival by beating him in the French Open final 
at the start of June, writing his name into tennis’s hall of fame by completing 
the career slam in the process. But the narrative has changed since then. 
Perhaps the strain of that remarkable achievement had more of an impact on 
Djokovic than anyone could have imagined. All of a sudden, he was carrying 
aches and strains, his mood was dark, there was talk of problems away from the 
court and his tennis suffered. Sam Querrey – Sam Querrey! – shocked him at 
Wimbledon. He wept after losing to Juan Martin del Potro in Rio. Stan Wawrinka 
toppled him in New York. He lost to Cilic and Roberto Bautista Agut, for crying 
out loud. He sought solace in a spiritual guru.

While Djokovic showed few signs of flushing out the funk that had gripped his 
mind and body, Murray prospered during a golden summer that featured glory at 
Wimbledon and Olympic gold, before the Scot took his game to new heights, 
reaching staggering levels of consistency by rising to the top of the rankings 
for the first time in his career.

Once again, though, the mood has changed since Murray celebrated becoming No1 
by winning the Paris Masters a fortnight ago. Take nothing away from Murray, 
but Djokovic is looking ominous again. The world No2 - it still feels strange 
to call him that - needed only 66 minutes to destroy Nishikori last night, 
while Murray earlier needed three hours and 38 minutes to see of Raonic in the 
day’s first semi-final. As brilliantly as Murray has played in the last six 
months, he faces one hell of a challenge to hold on to that No1 spot. 
Overcoming battle fatigue is one thing, but there must be better ways to spend 
a Sunday evening than trying to survive an assault from a resurgent Djokovic.

This is their 35th meeting and Djokovic leads 24-10 in their head-to-head 
record. So tough to beat on an indoor court, the Serb is bidding to win this 
title for the fifth consecutive year and he must be the favourite after his 
performance against Nishikori last night.

Would Murray have it any other way, though? After all, if there has been one 
thing missing from his recent run, it is a win over Djokovic.

Play begins at: 6pm BST.

Andy Murray, the year end world, No1 lifts the trophy above his head. He 
finishes the year as the best player in the world, too good even for the 
wondrousNovak Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic>. I 
suspect they’ll be meet again in the final of the Australian Open in January. 
For now, though, they’re both off for a well earned rest. That’s all from me. 
Thanks for your emails over the past week. Bye!

Sorry for the slight delay in the last update, the wifi inside the O2 Arena 
decided to cut out just as Djokovic hit his final return long.
 
Serving for the title, Murray is greeted by a huge roar of encouragement as he 
walks to the baseline. You sense that Djokovic isn’t finished yet, though. It’s 
rarely been his style to leave without a fight. But it’s 15-0 when Djokovic 
sends a shabby backhand long. An ace down the middle from Murray makes it 30-0. 
The cheers become that bit more urgent. Murray nets a backhand to make it 
30-15, though, before netting a forehand to make it 30-all. It’s never easy, is 
it? Thoughts drift back to the Wimbledon final in 2013. But Murray earns his 
first championship point, a volley forcing Djokovic to dab a strange lob well 
past the baseline. The roar is deafening. What Murray would give for a first 
serve here. Before they can get down to business, though, the umpire has to 
tell everyone to turn the lights off their phones. Eventually Murray swings an 
ace down the middle. But it’s a let. So they go again. Djokovic cracks a 
forehand into the right corner and charges forward to stay alive with a smash. 
Another monstrous serve from Murray earns him asecond championship point, 
though. Naturally, he nets a first serve. His first serve is weak. Djokovic 
dominates a short rally and wins it with a wonderful forehand, but then he 
drags a forehand wide. Murray has athird championship point. Murray sends a 
first serve long. The tension is unbearable. The second serve is there to be 
hit, so Djokovic hits it. Unfortunately for him, brilliantly for Murray, his 
forehand flies wide and long! That’s it! Murray has won theATP World Tour Finals
 <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/atp-world-tour-finals> for the first time 
in his career and finishes the year as the world No1!

Second set: Djokovic* 3-6, 4-5 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic is serving 
to stay in the final. Murray completely mishits a forehand to make it 15-0, 
then nets a backhand return to make it 30-0. Djokovic misses a backhand to make 
it 30-15, but a Murray backhand clips the top of the net and lands on his side. 
40-15. Djokovic lashes a forehand away to hold. Murray will serve for the 
title. We’ve been going for 92 minutes. What must be going through Murray’s 
head?

Second set: Djokovic 3-6, 3-5 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray will be 
desperate not to lose momentum completely here. He’ll know better how difficult 
it is to stop Djokovic if he gives him any encouragement and it’s not looking 
too clever when he sends a forehand at the end of a punishing rally. Djokovic 
leads 0-15. Murray manages to move into a 30-15 lead, serving well. Then 
Djokovic pushes a backhand inches wide, much to the relief of a wheezing 
Murray, who’s having to work so hard here. It’s 40-15. Murray thinks he’s won 
the game with an ace. Djokovic challenges. Murray strides off towards his 
chair, convinced it was in. It was miles out. That was curious behaviour from 
Murray, who nonetheless manages to hold when Djokovic knocks a backhand long. 
Djokovic will serve to stay in the final.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 3-6, 3-4 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic suddenly 
looks like a different animal, charging into a 30-0 lead. Murray probably 
suspected this might happen. Soon Djokovic leads 40-0 as Murray whistles a 
forehand long despite reaching a smash. The Serb holds to love, winning the 
drop shot war with Murray, who is likely to come under intense pressure now.
 
Second set: Djokovic 3-6, 2-4 Murray* (*denotes server): “Do you think that 
both of these players really just want to get back to the dressing room to 
watch Planet Earth II, they’re getting through the match in an 
uncharacteristically quick time so far,” wonders David Wall. Not so fast, 
David. Murray pulls a forehand wide to make it 0-15, challenging 
unsuccessfully. He makes up for it with a beauty down the line, though. The 
game goes to 30-all, though, when Murray double faults. Then a deep return from 
Djokovic earns him his first break point of the match, which feels faintly 
absurd given who he is. This isn’t over yet. Murray sends a forehand long and 
Djokovic, ever the warrior, has one break back. The Serb clenches his fist.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 3-6, 1-4 Murray (*denotes server): These are choppy 
waters for Djokovic as he nets a forehand for 0-15, before dumping one long to 
make it 0-30. Djokovic approaches the net. Murray comes up with a stupendous 
backhand pass from left to right to earn three break points. That’s good 
tennis. Djokovic is in serious trouble now. He saves the first point. But not 
the second. A backhand goes long andMurray leads by a set and two breaks.
 
Second set: Djokovic 3-6, 1-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Having stopped the 
rot, Djokovic is likely to attack with renewed intent here and he leads 0-15 
when Murray arrows a backhand wide. It’s 15-all when Djokovic nets a forehand, 
though, and 30-15 after a swinging serve out wide from Murray. Then, 
astonishingly, Djokovic somehow crashes a forehand volley into the net, to the 
amazement of everyone here, even Murray, who can hardly believe his luck. 
That’s the boost Murray needs to hold to 15 with an ace out wide. What a miss 
that was from Djokovic. The Serbian journalist sitting next to me is beside 
himself.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 3-6, 1-2 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic challenges 
when a forehand is called long, but Hawkeye doesn’t come to his aid. Murray 
leads 0-15. Djokovic makes up for it with a precise backhand winner for 15-all 
and quickly moves into a 30-15 lead. He surely has to hold here. He does, 
Murray netting a forehand at 40-15. This one is far from over.

Second set: Djokovic 3-6, 0-2 Murray* (*denotes server): A few fans are waving 
Serbian flags in the crowd. Djokovic really needs their support now. He trails 
by a set and a break and the majority of the crowd is with Murray, who’s got 
the bit between his teeth. But can he keep this going? Can he consolidate that 
precious break? Moving into a 40-0 lead with barely any trouble suggests that 
he can. And he holds to 15 thanks to a granite serve.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 3-6, 0-1 Murray (*denotes server): Looking a little 
edgy, Djokovic lifts a backhand wide to make it 15-30. Murray receives cries of 
encouragement from the crowd and then he earns two break points, overpowering 
the advancing Djokovic with a drilled backhand. This is a potentially huge 
moment. Murray can’t take the first, missing a backhand return off a deep first 
serve. Djokovic saves the second with a stunning serve out wide to force deuce. 
Murray finds a fine angle with a forehand to earn a third opportunity, Djokovic 
wasting a challenge on a ball that clipped the line. A deep slice from Djokovic 
draws a forehand error from Murray, though. Murray couldn’t quite sort out his 
feet in time. Djokovic gives up a fourth opportunity with an errant forehand, 
though. He didn’t miss it by much, but it was by enough, and Murray breaks when 
Djokovic nets a backhand!
 
Serving for the set, Murray’s unlucky to lose the first point, Djokovic 
getting away with a net cord at the net. It’s 0-15, though, and that’s all that 
matters. Murray is immediately under pressure. Djokovic looks bewildered after 
knocking a forehand wide for 15-all, though. Then comes one of those endless 
baseline rallies these two specialise in. It has to end at some point, of 
course, and this one does with Djokovic lifting a slice wide for 30-15. 
Djokovic tries to stay positive, but his level has dipped and he sends another 
backhand wide to hand Murray two set points. If it had been in, Murray wasn’t 
getting there. But here we are. Murray has two set points. He only needs one. 
Djokovic nets a tame forehand and Murray leads this final!

First set: Djokovic* 3-5 Murray (*denotes server): Djokovic doesn’t look like 
he’s in the mood for any funny business at the start of this game, remembering 
how to smash and making it 15-0. A tight backhand into the net makes it 15-all; 
another one that drifts past the baseline makes it 30-all. Murray chops a 
backhand slice long, though, and uses up a challenge for no good reason. But 
the game goes to deuce as Djokovic splatters a forehand long. He’s not always 
looked entirely steady out there, but he’s probably just putting on an act. 
Then again, a dismal backhand into the net that hands Murray a break point 
suggests otherwise. You sense Murray really needs to take this chance. He has 
to be clinical. He is clinical. They trade cautious slices for a while, but 
it’s Murray who ups the ante with a vicious forehand into the left corner that 
Djokovic can only slice into the net. Murray breaks and he’ll serve for the 
first set.
 
First set: Djokovic 3-4 Murray* (*denotes server): Wary of the dangers of 
allowing his focus to drop, Murray begins this game positively, slapping a 
forehand into the right corner for a 15-0 lead, then serving firmly to lead 
30-0. Another cracking serve makes it 40-0. Murray holds to 15, picking 
Djokovic off at the net with a glorious backhand down the line. This is turning 
into a very good match.
 
First set: Djokovic* 3-3 Murray (*denotes server): Murray sends a heavy 
forehand long to lose the first point of this game, but then he clumps one down 
the line to win one against the Djokovic serve for the first time. The game 
goes to 30-all, Murray edging another baseline rally. The volume in the arena 
rises and Murray earns the first break point of the match, forcing Djokovic to 
net an insipid forehand. Murray can’t convert it, though. Djokovic is rock 
solid on the baseline and Murray blinks first, netting a forehand. Murray earns 
another opportunity, though, a low slice drawing another error from Djokovic, 
who nets a forehand. Murray nets a slice, though. It’s deuce for a while, 
though, which is partly down to Djokovic absolutely butchering a gimme of a 
smash. Something falls on to the court, possibly from his racket. It’s 
difficult to make out what it was. Whatever. Djokovic raises his level to hold. 
Do not be surprised if he breaks in the next game.
 
First set: Djokovic 2-3 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray engages in a 
baseline rally with Djokovic, never the wisest of moves, but wins it with a 
cannily disguised forehand for 15-0. Djokovic responds with a rasping backhand 
down the line, though, and gobbles up a smash at the net for 15-all. Murray 
moves into a 40-15 lead after two weak Djokovic returns, though, and holds to 
30 thanks to a rollocking serve out wide.

First set: Djokovic* 2-2 Murray (*denotes server): Looking bright and 
energetic, Djokovic clips a forehand into the left corner and skips forward to 
volley astutely, before serving well to make it 30-0. Murray decides to attack 
a second serve but puts too much behind a rasping forehand, the game going to 
40-0. Djokovic holds to love with a confident smash. Murray needs to return 
better.
 
First set: Djokovic 1-2 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray didn’t make many 
first serves in his first service game and he won’t win this match if that 
trend continues. He makes a decent start here, though, forcing Djokovic to 
block a backhand return long for 15-0. Another solid serve makes it 30-0 and he 
hits a backhand well to make it 40-0. But Djokovic pulls it back to 40-15, 
lobbing cleverly, then makes it 40-30 when a backhand that was heading wide 
hits the top of the net and lands in. Murray holds to 30, though.

First set: Djokovic* 1-1 Murray (*denotes server): There’s a delay before the 
start of this game, the umpire telling an idiot in the crowd to switch off the 
light on their phone. Why do these people bother buying a ticket? It happens in 
every match. Djokovic isn’t fussed, though. An ace takes him to 30-0 and he 
races through the next two points to hold to love. Fine serving from the world 
No2.
 
First set: Djokovic 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Andy Murray won the toss 
and the final begins him with serving. Ominously, he starts with a double 
fault. A careful rally ensues, both men exuding tension. It ends with Djokovic 
knocking a backhand long. Given that confidence boost, Murray pings an ace down 
the middle, Djokovic challenging to no avail. He follows that up with another 
double fault, though, the game going to 30-all, nerves getting the better of 
Murray, who steadies himself by moving to 40-30. Murray holds to 30. “Murray 
all in black & Nole almost back to his early season All Blackesque form,” says 
John McErnerney. “This should go the distance with Novak just having a tad more 
left in the tank than Andy. “Whatever it takes” the last words The 97 Lions 
heard as they left the dressing room for the 2nd Test well the same goes for 
these two.”

Tok! Tok! Tok! They’re knocking up. By the way, I lied. There are a few empty 
seats here. Presumably they’ll be filled soon enough.
 
And here comes Andy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray>, the 
world No1 greeted by a deafening roar. He’s got his game face on. Just how will 
he have recovered from yesterday’s epic against Milos Raonic?

Novak Djokovic is out first. He gets a hearty cheer from the crowd. He’s got a 
big grin on his face.

For the first time this week, it doesn’t look like there’s an empty seat in 
the house here.A fine atmosphere is brewing.
 
This is their 18th meeting in a final, their fifth this year alone. Djokovic 
was victorious in Melbourne, Madrid and Paris. Murray’s sole victory came in 
Rome in May. Overall Djokovic leads 10-7 in this department. Can Murray close 
the gap tonight?
 
While we wait, relive yesterday’s semi-finals with these highlights.
Andy Murray beats Milos Raonic in epic semi-final 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/nov/19/andy-murray-beats-milos-raonic-epic-semi-final-tennis-atp-london-video-highlights> 
Hello. Even when Novak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> was beginning uncertainly 
against Dominic Thiem last weekend, even when Andy Murray was match point down 
against Milos Raonic last night, you knew that it was going end like this. 
Could it be any other way? No tearing up the script, no changing the ending 
just to make it look less predictable, no final between Gael Monfils and Marin 
Cilic; the two best players in the world meet in the final match of 2016, 
competing for the not insignificant honour of finishing the year as the world 
No1.

Back when Djokovic embarrassed Murray in the Australian Open final in January, 
no one viewed them as equals. Djokovic looked untouchable and he continued to 
assert his dominance over his old rival by beating him in the French Open final 
at the start of June, writing his name into tennis’s hall of fame by completing 
the career slam in the process. But the narrative has changed since then. 
Perhaps the strain of that remarkable achievement had more of an impact on 
Djokovic than anyone could have imagined. All of a sudden, he was carrying 
aches and strains, his mood was dark, there was talk of problems away from the 
court and his tennis suffered. Sam Querrey – Sam Querrey! – shocked him at 
Wimbledon. He wept after losing to Juan Martin del Potro in Rio. Stan Wawrinka 
toppled him in New York. He lost to Cilic and Roberto Bautista Agut, for crying 
out loud. He sought solace in a spiritual guru.

While Djokovic showed few signs of flushing out the funk that had gripped his 
mind and body, Murray prospered during a golden summer that featured glory at 
Wimbledon and Olympic gold, before the Scot took his game to new heights, 
reaching staggering levels of consistency by rising to the top of the rankings 
for the first time in his career.

Once again, though, the mood has changed since Murray celebrated becoming No1 
by winning the Paris Masters a fortnight ago. Take nothing away from Murray, 
but Djokovic is looking ominous again. The world No2 - it still feels strange 
to call him that - needed only 66 minutes to destroy Nishikori last night, 
while Murray earlier needed three hours and 38 minutes to see of Raonic in the 
day’s first semi-final. As brilliantly as Murray has played in the last six 
months, he faces one hell of a challenge to hold on to that No1 spot. 
Overcoming battle fatigue is one thing, but there must be better ways to spend 
a Sunday evening than trying to survive an assault from a resurgent Djokovic.

This is their 35th meeting and Djokovic leads 24-10 in their head-to-head 
record. So tough to beat on an indoor court, the Serb is bidding to win this 
title for the fifth consecutive year and he must be the favourite after his 
performance against Nishikori last night.

Would Murray have it any other way, though? After all, if there has been one 
thing missing from his recent run, it is a win over Djokovic.

Play begins at: 6pm BST.
