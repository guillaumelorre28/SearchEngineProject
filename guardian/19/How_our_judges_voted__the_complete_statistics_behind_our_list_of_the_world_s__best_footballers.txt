Our 124 judges from 45 countries cast nearly 5,000 votes in total to choose 
the world’s top 100 male footballers for 2016. Led by 11 former players 
boasting a combined total of 767 international caps, each member of the 
Guardian panel chose their own top 40 players from a longlist of global names. 
These votes were then collated to create the Guardian’s Top 100.

To allow our judges the freedom to express their opinions without fear or 
favour, individual voting records are anonymised in the full breakdown of 
scores. The judges’ numbers are allocated at random and bear no relation 
whatsoever to the alphabetical list of judges’ names.

You can see a reminder here of the full list of judges and rules.

How they made their choices

• Our judges were sent a longlist of more than 300 players drawn from leagues 
on every continent and asked one simple question: who have been the best male 
players in the world in 2016?

• We asked our judges to choose 40 names each, and rank their selection in 
order from 1-40, No1 being their choice of the best player in the world this 
year.

How the voting works

• The No1 choice of each judge was awarded 40pts, No2 given 39pts, down to 1pt 
for their No40 choice. All the votes were added together to give a raw score.

• To minimise the influence of outliers in the list, the highest score awarded 
to a player was then deducted to give a final score.


• A player needed to receive votes from at least five judges to qualify for 
the list.

• If players are level on points in the scoring, the number of individual 
votes cast is used as a tie-breaker.
