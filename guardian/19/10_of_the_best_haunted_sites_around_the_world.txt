Versailles, France

The French are the least susceptible to believing in ghosts among the world’s 
nationalities, according to at least one study. The visitors who witnessed one 
of the most famous “time-slips” of them all were British women from Oxford. In 
August, 1901, Anne Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain had an experience at the Petit 
Trianon in the gardens of Versailles in which they believed they saw the ghost 
of Marie Antoinette from 1789. Belief in the supernatural is susceptible to 
fashion and this tale started a trend for “time-slip ghosts” that ran for 
several decades.

One of Scotland’s most seductive folkloric haunts, the turreted fortress has 
more historical ghosts than rooks in a rookery – nearly all of them connected 
to treachery, witchcraft and cruelty. Gifted to the Lyon family (latterly 
Bowes-Lyon) by Robert the Bruce, and standing swathed in Highland mists not far 
from Dundee, Glamis has at least 20 apparitions, including a phantom African 
pageboy seen by a young Queen Mother (it was her childhood home), a witch in 
the chapel, a tongueless woman screaming in the park, a man playing dice with 
the devil in a sealed room, spectres in chain-mail, a gibbering madman on the 
roof and numerous other Halloween-like oneiric tales.

This haunting is one of the greatest of English ghost stories, considered by 
celebrated British academic and broadcaster Sir Christopher Frayling to be the 
source for Henry James’s 1898 novella, The Turn of the Screw. Funny goings-on 
started following the death of the mistress of the house owner Lord Stawel, 
known locally as an “evil liver”, in 1754. The story was well-known among the 
Anglican church establishment and it was the Archbishop of Canterbury who told 
James the “true” version. In the old Elizabethan house (now demolished), a 
mother fought tooth and nail to stop the incursion of a wicked spectral 
manservant and his paramour prowling outside her children’s nursery. It’s now a 
National Trust property.

Ghost-hunting is sweeping Scandinavia as a secular form of religion, some 
commentators say. Want to stay in a haunted vicarage in Jämtland, with the 
possibility of waking to find three cobwebby phantom females staring at you? 
Generations of clergymen have suffered poltergeist activity and the attention 
of apparitions in this neat little wooden manse – it’s all very Bergmanesque. 
It has a restaurant and you can, in fact, rent the whole house if you want to. 
But hurry, it’s closing for the winter in a few days. The website is in Swedish.

Please don’t knock on the door of this private home but, from the outside, 
feel free to gaze at the house that spawned a horror franchise and dozens of 
books. The story of 112 Ocean Avenue begins in December 1975, when the Lutz 
family moved into a home that had witnessed a horrific family massacre not long 
before; by all accounts some of the furniture was still there. A succession of 
demonic events and a plague of flies was the least of it. Recently, Danny Lutz 
was involved in a documentary about his experiences there as a child; the 
jury’s very much out on this one.

For corner-of-the-eye encounters, this dark and most unsavoury of locations 
has become the object of great interest for Japanese demonologists and 
ghost-hunters. A 3,500-hectare forest of dense woodland at the base of mount 
Fuji is one of the most popular places in Japan to commit suicide. It’s not 
advised to stray from the official paths because naturally occurring magnetic 
anomalies add both to the legend and the likelihood of getting lost. Some say 
this story dates back to Seicho Matsumoto’s 1960 novel, Black Sea of Trees, but 
superstitions about this uncanny place seem to predate it.

In the news last year, when its 99-year lease came up for sale, the myth of 
Poveglia includes the story that Venetians are too superstitious to take you 
there. In the Venetian lagoon and dotted with suitably ruined buildings, tales 
of plague victims and mad asylum directors are all part of the story. Most of 
the rumours about its spookiness seem to originate from non-Venetian sources, 
including a 2009 US show called Ghost Adventures. City Tours offers trips 
around the island; it takes 10 minutes to get there from San Marco square.

Speak to any American ghost-hunting enthusiast and, sooner or later, the 
subject of Winchester House comes up – and the good news is that you can tour 
110 of the 160 rooms. It is full of dead-ends and staircases going nowhere, 
built under the orders of Sarah, the guilt-ridden widow of the son of the “Gun 
that Won the West” manufacturer. It is said she was terrified of the vengeful 
spirits created by this most efficient and deadly of US weapons. The tour lasts 
two-and-a-half hours; look out for repetitions of the number 13 and spider-web 
motifs. Not National Rifle Association approved.

I was lucky enough to have a personal after-hours tour of the Tower by the man 
who wrote the most famous book on the subject of its ghosts: yeoman warder 
George Abbott. Recently, Historic Royal Palaces has become less strict about 
letting the public in after hours; it now has limited Sunday twilight tours at 
7-8.30pm in November (nothing in December, sadly). Expect the subjects of 
spooked sentries and Anne Boleyn’s headless ghost to be raised.

Travel by train to a place called Xochimilco in the Mexico City suburbs and 
then convince abarco (barge) punter that you need to visit the island. A 
disturbing array of decaying dolls hang in this man-madechinampa (ancient 
farming island), apparently the work of one individual who, legend has it, lost 
his mind when the body of a child washed up on his island. Or some say it’s a 
kind of art installation. Because it looks creepy, rumours abound that it is 
populated by ghosts, making it an unlikely tourist attraction.
