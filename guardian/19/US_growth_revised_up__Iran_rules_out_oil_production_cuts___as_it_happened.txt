Closing summary: US picks up pace, Opec bogged down

OK, time for a brisk recap.

1) America’s economy is performing even better than expected; growth in the 
last quarter has been revised up to a 3.2% annual rate, from 2.9%. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/29/italian-referendum-worries-stock-markets-opec-oil-executive-pay-live?page=with:block-583d83d1e4b049350cc9424e#block-583d83d1e4b049350cc9424e>
 Consumer spending, investment and exports all helped to push GDP up.

Analysts say the figures show the US is in fairly robust shape, making a 
December interest rate rise even more likely.

2) There’s deadlock in Vienna tonight, as Opec ministers struggle to make 
headway towards a deal to cut production.

Iran has thrown down the gauntlet, saying it will not reduce its output and 
suggesting Saudi Arabia takes the hit itself.

The oil price has slumped by 3.5% tonight, as the markets prepare for 
tomorrow’sOpec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> meeting.

3) Investors are bracing for volatility as Italy heads to the polls on Sunday 
to vote on PM Matteo Renzi’s constitutional reforms. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/29/italian-referendum-worries-stock-markets-opec-oil-executive-pay-live?page=with:block-583d7c1de4b056d3d56ab9bf#block-583d7c1de4b056d3d56ab9bf>

ECB sources have hinted that they would use their QE programme to stabilise 
the markets on Monday, if the public vote No -- a move that could prompt 
Renzi’s resignation.

Adam Chester, head of economics for commercial banking at Lloyds Bank, 
predicts turbulence if Renzi loses (as seems likely):

Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> is being asked whether to 
accept a broad package of measures aimed at making the country’s gridlocked 
political system more efficient and its government more stable.

It has had more than 60 governments since the Second World War, so one might 
think that measures to improve stability would be strongly welcomed.

But a key implication of the proposed changes is that incumbents would have 
far more power, which is strongly resisted by opposition parties, and there is 
a clear risk that the people will vote against the government, particularly 
given the weakness of Italy’s economy.

If the referendum is not passed – and the polls suggest a ‘No’ win – Prime 
Minister Renzi could step down, leading to early elections and boosting the 
anti-EU Five Star Movement (M5S), which has pledged a referendum on whether 
Italy should stay in the euro.

If Italy votes ‘No’, the euro is likely to come under immediate downward 
pressure and contagion could also see government bond and credit spreads across 
much of Europe rise.

Italian stock market closes higher, but oil stocks slide

Italy’s stock market has defied worries about Sunday’s referendum to close 2% 
higher.

The FTSE MIB index outperformed the rest of Europe, helped by that Reuters 
report that the ECB would step in to stabilise the markets next week, if needed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/29/italian-referendum-worries-stock-markets-opec-oil-executive-pay-live?page=with:block-583d7c1de4b056d3d56ab9bf#block-583d7c1de4b056d3d56ab9bf>
.

The German, French, and Spanish indices also finished the day higher,

But the FTSE 100 lost 27 point, or 0.4%, to finish at 6772 - dragged down by 
energy companies including BP (-2.1%) and Shell (-2%).

City traders haven’t been impressed by the lack of progress at Opec’s meeting 
in Vienna today 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/29/italian-referendum-worries-stock-markets-opec-oil-executive-pay-live?page=with:block-583d8b41e4b049350cc94283#block-583d8b41e4b049350cc94283>
:

Joshua Mahoney of IG says:

Despite an initial consensus, a deal feels as far away as ever, with members 
continuing to conduct an intricate game of political poker, utilising the media 
to further their cause. It is becoming increasingly evident that some of the 
more prominent OPEC members care more about holding on to market share than 
helping raise the price of oil.

Hence despite agreeing to a production cut, we have seen the likes of Saudi 
Arabia, Iraq and Iran all continue to raise production.

In another signal that America’s economy is solid, sales of recreational 
vehicles are on track to hit their highest level in four decades.

Shipments of new RVs are expected to hit 419,500 this year, industry figures 
say, up 12% on last year. These whopping motorhomes and trailers are, 
apparently, popular with Millennials who want to get into the Great Outdoors in 
some comfort.

But....these things don’t come cheap. A typical RV will cost six-figures

Eurogroup's Dijsselbloem shows Greece sympathy over bailout targets

Meanwhile in Greece... Athens has received an unexpected boost ahead of next 
week’smeeting of eurozone finance ministers (the eurogroup).

Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. 


The Dutch finance minister and eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has not 
always batted for Greece but today he came out firmly in favour of Athens’ 
longstanding argument that primary surplus targets set by international 
creditors in the years ahead are simply unachievable.

Addressing the European Parliament’s economic affairs committee, the Dutchman 
suggested it would be counter-productive if Greece was given unrealistic fiscal 
targets once its current bailout program expires in 2018.

“We need to be realistic” he said adding that it would be a big ask if Athens 
was made to pull off the herculean task of achieving a 3.5% primary surplus 
when its fiscal adjustment program was finally completed.

Djisselbloem’s comments come in the wake of similar optimism expressed by 
visiting European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici.

Conducting a two-day visit to Athens ahead of next week’s euro group, the 
Frenchman also voiced support for the leftist-led government’s bid to secure 
debt relief saying reprofiling of the unustainable load should also begin by 
year’s end.

At over €300bn, or 180% of GDP, Greece’s debt burden is the biggest in Europe 
and widely viewed as the root of its financial woes. But demands for more 
austerity still loom large and could threaten to overturn economic progress in 
the months ahead.

Back in Vienna, the UAE’s oil minister has told energy reporters that Opec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> could still achieve a deal to cut 
output tomorrow.

Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei said it was premature to assume that the 
cartel would fail, despite the clashes between Saudi Arabia and Iran behind the 
scenes.

UK firms back Giving Tuesday

After the excesses of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, British business has been 
showing its charitable side today.

For the third year running, voluntary bodies have been working with companies 
to encourage people to give money, or time, to good causes - from cancer 
charities to Syrian aid.

Some 1,500 UK-based businesses and charities are taking part this year, 
including BT - which hosted an event at its iconic Tower this morning - Royal 
Mail, Royal Bank of Scotland, and several retailers including Morrisons, 
Sainsbury’s, and the Co-op.

The idea started in the 2012 in America, and last year, it raised over $45m 
worldwide.

The Charities Aid Foundation <https://www.cafonline.org/> is co-ordinating it 
in the UK. They’ve sent some details over:

 * A choir of MPs singing Christmas carols on College Green to raise money to 
support the work ofdoctors in Aleppo, as part of the Singing for Syrians 
appeal. MPs taking part included Victoria Prentis, Will Quince, Robert 
Buckland, Andrea Jenkyns and Eilidh Whiteford. Pictures are available on 
request.

 * Great British Bake Off winner Candice Brown appearing in a video for 
Paypal, promoting its offer to add £1 toCancer Research UK donations over £10 
made using Paypal.

 * Staff at Marie Curie UK writing personalised thank you letters to their 
supporters.

 * Checkout staff at Morrisons wearing #givingtuesday stickers today and 
encouraging customers to top up their shop with a charitable donation.

 * eBay launching a pop up #givingtuesday shop to raise money for a number of 
good causes.

An Opec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> source has now told 
Reuters that Iran want Saudi Arabia to cut its output to 9.5m barrels per day, 
from around 10.5m today.

That means Saudi would be taking the entire one million barrel per day cut 
which was provisionally agreed in September in Algeria.

That may be unacceptable to Riyadh -- both economically and politically....

Reuters: Iran and Iraq at loggerheads with Saudi

These latest comments out of Vienna show that Iraq and Iran are at odds with 
Saudi Arabia over the proposedOpec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> 
output cut.

The hardline stance from Iran’s Zangenah shows that Tehran is not willing to 
curb its own output. The situation is complicated; there’s no real agreement on 
how much Iran is actually pumping today!

So Saudi Arabia are effectively being challenged to swallow the output cut 
themselves, while other cartel members would simply benefit from the resulting 
higher prices.

Here’s Reuters’ latest dispatch from the Opec HQ:

OPEC sources told Reuters a meeting of experts in Vienna on Monday failed to 
bridge differences between OPEC’s de factol eader, Saudi Arabia, and the 
group’s second- and third-largest producers over the mechanics of output cuts.

“We will leave the level of production (where) we decided in Algeria,” Iranian 
Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters upon arrival in Vienna, effectively 
signalling he was not prepared to reduce output.

OPEC, which accounts for a third of global oil production, agreed in September 
to cap output at around 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day versus the current 
33.64 million bpd to prop up oil prices, which have halved since mid-2014.

OPEC said it would exempt Iran, Libya and Nigeria from cutsas their output has 
been crimped by unrest and sanctions.

The deal was seen as a victory for Iran. Tehran has long argued it wants to 
raise production to regain market share lost under Western sanctions, when its 
political arch-rival SaudiArabia increased output.

In recent weeks, Riyadh offered to cut its own output by 500,000 barrels per 
day, according to OPEC sources, and suggested Iran limit production at around 
3.8 million bpd - in line with or slightly above the country’s current output. 
But Tehran has sent mixed signals including that it wanted to produce 4.2 
million bpd.

Oil plunges as Iran rules out cutting production

There is high drama in Vienna, where Iran’s oil minister has declared that his 
country will NOTcut oil production.

Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told a heaving throng of oil reporters that Iran would 
stick to the production levels set earlier this year, and would not accept any 
output cuts.

That’s a blow to Opec’s chances of finalising a deal to cut production levels 
at tomorrow’s official meeting in Vienna.

And Bloomberg is now reporting that Saudi will reject a deal, unless Iran and 
Iraq agree to a compromise

As we covered earlier, Indonesia’s oil minister had also told reporters that 
he’s not optimistic about a deal this week.

FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says traders aren’t confident either:

Reports of Russia not attending the OPEC gathering has dented hopes of a 
meaningful deal while concerns of Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia failing to bridge 
their differences continues to encourage sellers to attack oil.

OK, time for a brisk recap.

1) America’s economy is performing even better than expected; growth in the 
last quarter has been revised up to a 3.2% annual rate, from 2.9%. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/29/italian-referendum-worries-stock-markets-opec-oil-executive-pay-live?page=with:block-583d83d1e4b049350cc9424e#block-583d83d1e4b049350cc9424e>
 Consumer spending, investment and exports all helped to push GDP up.

Analysts say the figures show the US is in fairly robust shape, making a 
December interest rate rise even more likely.

2) There’s deadlock in Vienna tonight, as Opec ministers struggle to make 
headway towards a deal to cut production. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/29/italian-referendum-worries-stock-markets-opec-oil-executive-pay-live?page=with:block-583d8b41e4b049350cc94283#block-583d8b41e4b049350cc94283>

Iran has thrown down the gauntlet, saying it will not reduce its output and 
suggesting Saudi Arabia takes the hit itself.

The oil price has slumped by 3.5% tonight, as the markets prepare for 
tomorrow’sOpec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> meeting.

3) Investors are bracing for volatility as Italy heads to the polls on Sunday 
to vote on PM Matteo Renzi’s constitutional reforms. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/29/italian-referendum-worries-stock-markets-opec-oil-executive-pay-live?page=with:block-583d7c1de4b056d3d56ab9bf#block-583d7c1de4b056d3d56ab9bf>

ECB sources have hinted that they would use their QE programme to stabilise 
the markets on Monday, if the public vote No -- a move that could prompt 
Renzi’s resignation.

Adam Chester, head of economics for commercial banking at Lloyds Bank, 
predicts turbulence if Renzi loses (as seems likely):

Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> is being asked whether to 
accept a broad package of measures aimed at making the country’s gridlocked 
political system more efficient and its government more stable.

It has had more than 60 governments since the Second World War, so one might 
think that measures to improve stability would be strongly welcomed.

But a key implication of the proposed changes is that incumbents would have 
far more power, which is strongly resisted by opposition parties, and there is 
a clear risk that the people will vote against the government, particularly 
given the weakness of Italy’s economy.

If the referendum is not passed – and the polls suggest a ‘No’ win – Prime 
Minister Renzi could step down, leading to early elections and boosting the 
anti-EU Five Star Movement (M5S), which has pledged a referendum on whether 
Italy should stay in the euro.

If Italy votes ‘No’, the euro is likely to come under immediate downward 
pressure and contagion could also see government bond and credit spreads across 
much of Europe rise.

That’s probably all for today. Tomorrow will be extra-busy, with Bank of 
England stress test results released at 7am GMT, and Opec’s meeting running

Italy’s stock market has defied worries about Sunday’s referendum to close 2% 
higher.

The FTSE MIB index outperformed the rest of Europe, helped by that Reuters 
report that the ECB would step in to stabilise the markets next week, if needed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/29/italian-referendum-worries-stock-markets-opec-oil-executive-pay-live?page=with:block-583d7c1de4b056d3d56ab9bf#block-583d7c1de4b056d3d56ab9bf>
.

The German, French, and Spanish indices also finished the day higher,

But the FTSE 100 lost 27 point, or 0.4%, to finish at 6772 - dragged down by 
energy companies including BP (-2.1%) and Shell (-2%).

City traders haven’t been impressed by the lack of progress at Opec’s meeting 
in Vienna today

Joshua Mahoney of IG says:

Despite an initial consensus, a deal feels as far away as ever, with members 
continuing to conduct an intricate game of political poker, utilising the media 
to further their cause. It is becoming increasingly evident that some of the 
more prominent OPEC members care more about holding on to market share than 
helping raise the price of oil.

Hence despite agreeing to a production cut, we have seen the likes of Saudi 
Arabia, Iraq and Iran all continue to raise production.
 
In another signal that America’s economy is solid, sales of recreational 
vehicles are on track to hit their highest level in four decades.

Shipments of new RVs are expected to hit 419,500 this year, industry figures 
say, up 12% on last year. These whopping motorhomes and trailers are, 
apparently, popular with Millennials who want to get into the Great Outdoors in 
some comfort.

But....these things don’t come cheap. A typical RV will cost six-figures

Meanwhile in Greece... Athens has received an unexpected boost ahead of next 
week’smeeting of eurozone finance ministers (the eurogroup).

Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. 


The Dutch finance minister and eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has not 
always batted for Greece but today he came out firmly in favour of Athens’ 
longstanding argument that primary surplus targets set by international 
creditors in the years ahead are simply unachievable.

Addressing the European Parliament’s economic affairs committee, the Dutchman 
suggested it would be counter-productive if Greece was given unrealistic fiscal 
targets once its current bailout program expires in 2018.

“We need to be realistic” he said adding that it would be a big ask if Athens 
was made to pull off the herculean task of achieving a 3.5% primary surplus 
when its fiscal adjustment program was finally completed.

Djisselbloem’s comments come in the wake of similar optimism expressed by 
visiting European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici.

Conducting a two-day visit to Athens ahead of next week’s euro group, the 
Frenchman also voiced support for the leftist-led government’s bid to secure 
debt relief saying reprofiling of the unustainable load should also begin by 
year’s end.

At over €300bn, or 180% of GDP, Greece’s debt burden is the biggest in Europe 
and widely viewed as the root of its financial woes. But demands for more 
austerity still loom large and could threaten to overturn economic progress in 
the months ahead.
 
Back in Vienna, the UAE’s oil minister has told energy reporters that Opec 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> could still achieve a deal to cut 
output tomorrow.

Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei said it was premature to assume that the 
cartel would fail, despite the clashes between Saudi Arabia and Iran behind the 
scenes.

After the excesses of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, British business has been 
showing its charitable side today.

For the third year running, voluntary bodies have been working with companies 
to encourage people to give money, or time, to good causes - from cancer 
charities to Syrian aid.

Some 1,500 UK-based businesses and charities are taking part this year, 
including BT - which hosted an event at its iconic Tower this morning - Royal 
Mail, Royal Bank of Scotland, and several retailers including Morrisons, 
Sainsbury’s, and the Co-op.

The idea started in the 2012 in America, and last year, it raised over $45m 
worldwide.

The Charities Aid Foundation <https://www.cafonline.org/> is co-ordinating it 
in the UK. They’ve sent some details over:

 * A choir of MPs singing Christmas carols on College Green to raise money to 
support the work ofdoctors in Aleppo, as part of the Singing for Syrians 
appeal. MPs taking part included Victoria Prentis, Will Quince, Robert 
Buckland, Andrea Jenkyns and Eilidh Whiteford. Pictures are available on 
request.

 * Great British Bake Off winner Candice Brown appearing in a video for 
Paypal, promoting its offer to add £1 toCancer Research UK donations over £10 
made using Paypal.

 * Staff at Marie Curie UK writing personalised thank you letters to their 
supporters.

 * Checkout staff at Morrisons wearing #givingtuesday stickers today and 
encouraging customers to top up their shop with a charitable donation.

 * eBay launching a pop up #givingtuesday shop to raise money for a number of 
good causes.

An Opec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> source has now told 
Reuters that Iran want Saudi Arabia to cut its output to 9.5m barrels per day, 
from around 10.5m today.

That means Saudi would be taking the entire one million barrel per day cut 
which was provisionally agreed in September in Algeria.

That may be unacceptable to Riyadh -- both economically and politically....

These latest comments out of Vienna show that Iraq and Iran are at odds with 
Saudi Arabia over the proposedOpec <https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec> 
output cut.

The hardline stance from Iran’s Zangenah shows that Tehran is not willing to 
curb its own output. The situation is complicated; there’s no real agreement on 
how much Iran is actually pumping today!

So Saudi Arabia are effectively being challenged to swallow the output cut 
themselves, while other cartel members would simply benefit from the resulting 
higher prices.

Here’s Reuters’ latest dispatch from the Opec HQ:

OPEC sources told Reuters a meeting of experts in Vienna on Monday failed to 
bridge differences between OPEC’s de factol eader, Saudi Arabia, and the 
group’s second- and third-largest producers over the mechanics of output cuts.

“We will leave the level of production (where) we decided in Algeria,” Iranian 
Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters upon arrival in Vienna, effectively 
signalling he was not prepared to reduce output.

OPEC, which accounts for a third of global oil production, agreed in September 
to cap output at around 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day versus the current 
33.64 million bpd to prop up oil prices, which have halved since mid-2014.

OPEC said it would exempt Iran, Libya and Nigeria from cutsas their output has 
been crimped by unrest and sanctions.

The deal was seen as a victory for Iran. Tehran has long argued it wants to 
raise production to regain market share lost under Western sanctions, when its 
political arch-rival SaudiArabia increased output.

In recent weeks, Riyadh offered to cut its own output by 500,000 barrels per 
day, according to OPEC sources, and suggested Iran limit production at around 
3.8 million bpd - in line with or slightly above the country’s current output. 
But Tehran has sent mixed signals including that it wanted to produce 4.2 
million bpd.
 
Here’s a video clip of the scrum (or possibly rolling maul) which greeted 
Iran’s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, as he arrived in Vienna.

There is high drama in Vienna, where Iran’s oil minister has declared that his 
country will NOTcut oil production.

Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told a heaving throng of oil reporters that Iran would 
stick to the production levels set earlier this year, and would not accept any 
output cuts.

That’s a blow to Opec’s chances of finalising a deal to cut production levels 
at tomorrow’s official meeting in Vienna.

And Bloomberg is now reporting that Saudi will reject a deal, unless Iran and 
Iraq agree to a compromise

These comments have sent the Brent crude oil price plunging by over 3% to 
46.51 per barrel, down over 1.5 dollars.

The press scrum also sent a vase flying to the floor of Opec’s hotel foyer -- 
the second broken vase in as many days!

As we covered earlier, Indonesia’s oil minister had also told reporters that 
he’s not optimistic about a deal this week.

FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says traders aren’t confident either:

Reports of Russia not attending the OPEC gathering has dented hopes of a 
meaningful deal while concerns of Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia failing to bridge 
their differences continues to encourage sellers to attack oil.
