In each of the answers to across clues, one letter occurring as part of a 
consecutive pair of identical letters must be omitted in the diagram. In each 
of the answers to down clues, one letter must be doubled in the diagram, the 
resulting pair to be entered consecutively. Clues throughout refer in their 
definition parts to the original answers and in their cryptic parts to the 
modified entries (rarely real words). Numbers in brackets indicate the lengths 
of original answers throughout.

The Chambers Dictionary (2014) is recommended.
