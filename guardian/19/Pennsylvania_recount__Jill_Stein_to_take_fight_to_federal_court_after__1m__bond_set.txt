Green party candidate Jill Stein vowed late on Saturday to bring her fight for 
a recount of votes cast inPennsylvania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania> in the US presidential 
election to federal court, after a state judge ordered her campaign to post a 
$1m bond.

“The judge’s outrageous demand that voters pay such an exorbitant figure is a 
shameful, unacceptable barrier to democratic participation,” Stein said in a 
statement. “No voter in America should be forced to pay thousands of dollars to 
know if her or his vote was counted.”

The Stein campaign said it would file for emergency relief in the Pennsylvania 
effort in federal court on Monday, “demanding a statewide recount on 
constitutional grounds”.

Jonathan Abady, lead counsel to Stein’s recount efforts, said in a statement 
it had become clear “the state court system is so ill-equipped to address this 
problem”, the statement said “we must seek federal court intervention”.

The bond was set by the Commonwealth court of Pennsylvania a day after 
representatives of President-electDonald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> requested a $10m bond, 
according to court papers. The court gave the petitioners until 5pm local time 
on Monday to post the bond, but said it could modify the amount if shown good 
cause. Instead, Stein’s campaign withdrew.

“Petitioners are regular citizens of ordinary means. They cannot afford to 
post the $1,000,000 bond required by the court,” wrote attorney Lawrence Otter, 
informing the court of the decision to withdraw.

Stein, who garnered about 1% of the presidential vote on 8 November, has also 
sought recounts inMichigan

Trump and his allies have attempted to stop the initiatives in the states, 
calling the recount effort a “scam”.Clinton’s campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/29/hillary-clinton-election-recount-wisconsin-jill-stein>
 has said it would take part in the recounts.

Stein said she planned to announce “the next step” in the recount effort on 
Monday at a previously scheduled news conference at Trump Tower in New York 
City.

She said recounts already under way in some Pennsylvania counties would 
continue. The state’s election commission had approved recounts in 75 precincts 
where voters requested one, but refused to allow a full forensic audit of 
voting machines.

Even if all the recounts were to take place, the overall election outcome 
would not likely change. The race is decided by the electoral college, or a 
tally of wins from the state-by-state contests, rather than by the popular 
national vote.

Trump won 306 electoral votes, surpassing the 270 needed to win. Recounts 
would have to flip the result to Clinton in all three states to change the 
result. In the popular vote, Clinton had more than 2.5m votes over Trump, the 
independent Cook Political Report said.
