Join a witch hunt at the London Dungeon with 17th-century Witchfinder General 
Matthew Hopkins, who rounded up those suspected of witchcraft and had more than

submerged in a divers’ net exploring eerie dark waters with red-light torches.

This cookery school is running two Halloween-themed sessions. Mini Chefs (aged 
six to 10) will make garlicky eyeballs with slimy dip, while Young Chefs (aged 
11-16) will cook the rather more appetising-sounding pumpkin and lentil soup 
with bread bowls. Both will whip up ghostly fancies.
