Andy Murray says he is happy to have a Sir in front of his name – even if it 
will take some getting used to. The world No1 wasgiven a knighthood in the New

 after a spectacular season that brought him a second Wimbledon title and 
Olympic gold medal.

Murray had previously said that he felt too young to receive the honour but 
the clamour had been growing and he was among a number of high-profile sporting 
stars to be recognised.

Mo Farah and Lee Pearson were also knighted while Jessica Ennis-Hill and 
Katherine Grainger received damehoods. Murray gave his first reaction to the 
news after beating Milos Raonic 6-3, 7-6 (8-6) at an exhibition tournament in 
Abu Dhabi.

“I still feel like Andy Murray <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray> 
– that feels more normal – but I am happy with the knighthood and it is a nice 
way to start the new year,” Murray said.

As well as his Wimbledon and Rio successes, Murray also reached grand slam 
finals in Australia and France and overhauled Novak Djokovic at the top of the 
rankings with a stunning run to finish the season. The 29-year-old won 24 
matches in a row, claiming titles in Beijing, Shanghai, Vienna and Paris before 
beating Djokovic in the final of the ATP World Tour Finals in London to clinch 
the year-end No 1 spot.

He lost for the first time since September in his opening match in Abu Dhabi 
against David Goffin on Friday,

although the exhibition status of the event means it does not count in official 
records. It was not the way Murray would have wanted to start the new season, 
though, so it was a boost to finish the tournament with victory over world No3, 
Raonic.

“It was good to finish the year with a win,” Murray said. “It was a good match 
to work on returns as Milos has a strong serve.”

Murray will hope to pick up where he left off when he begins the new ATP Tour 
season at the Qatar Open in Doha that starts on Monday.

Laura Robson was beaten in the first round of qualifying for the ASB Classic 
in Auckland, losing in three sets to Tereza Martincova of the Czech Republic. 
Robson, now ranked 222nd in the world, lost 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (10-8) to an opponent 
ranked 59 places above her.
