A split among senior Labour <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs 
over whether to serve in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet has led to a warning 
that the party is in danger of wallowing in a “fresh round of division and 
resentment” between “innies and outies”.

In recent days the new deputy leader, Tom Watson, and Corbyn’s campaign 
manager, Simon Fletcher, have been seeking to persuade mainstream frontbenchers 
to engage with the new leader despite their major differences on policy.

On Saturday, those who said they would be willing to join the new team 
included the MPs Liam Byrne, Mary Creagh and John Healey.Lucy Powell MP, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lucypowell> vice-chair of Labour’s last 
general election campaign, said she could also serve under Corbyn if the 
position offered was right and certain “conditions” were met, including the 
appointment of someone other thanJohn McDonnell MP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/15/jeremy-corbyn-world-supporters-mentors-influences>
, chair of the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs, as shadow chancellor.

However, a host of other major names, including Tristram Hunt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tristram-hunt>, the shadow education 
secretary, Emma Reynolds, the shadow communities secretary and Rachel Reeves, 
shadow work and pensions secretary, announced or indicated they could not 
serve. Jamie Reed, a shadow health minister, tweeted his resignation letter 
immediately on the announcement of Corbyn’s victory.

Liz Kendall, who received 4.5% of the vote in the leadership contest, will not 
serve andneither will shadow chancellor Chris Leslie.

It is understood that Andy Burnham, who came second in the leadership contest, 
is now unsure as to whether he will take up an invitation to work with Corbyn. 
One source said Burnham had been approached but that the chances of him joining 
the shadow cabinet were “slim”.

Corbyn will announce shadow cabinet positions over the next 48 hours, with the 
position of shadow chancellor regarded as a key indicator of whether he is 
truly seeking to incorporate a range of different sections of the party in his 
team.

McDonnell, his closest political ally, is in the frame, but his appointment 
would be seen as an insular move by many in the centre of the party who would 
prefer to see Angela Eagle in the role.

Passions were running high as one current shadow cabinet minister, who has 
ruled out joining the new shadow cabinet, condemned those who were now 
indicating a willingness to work with Corbyn.

“People think we are unprincipled, and to be fair for the last five years I 
have defended things I haven’t agreed with to an extent,” he said.

“I’m not willing to do that again. It is quite simply a matter of principle. 
It is the old right who are saying that they are ready to serve because they 
cannot bear the idea of letting go of the party machinery.”

The resentment growing within the parliamentary party between those who will 
serve and those who will not has led to John Woodcock MP, chair of the Blairite 
group, Progress, to warn of the emergence of a new split to replace the 
Blair-Brown chasm that marked the last two decades of Labour politics.

Writing on this newspaper’s website, Woodcock, who supported Liz Kendall, 
said: “MPs face an early choice over whether they wish to serve on Jeremy’s 
front bench if asked. Some, like me, will decide that his position on issues 
like the EU, on Nato and his willingness to meet proscribed terrorist 
organisations means they could not accept the burden of collective 
responsibility and unity of voting that being part of the front bench team 
requires. Others will feel duty bound to serve as shadow ministers in spite of 
their differences.

“Both choices will be motivated by the same desire to maximise Labour’s 
chances of winning again and putting our values into practice.

“There are many ways to serve; it is critically important these deeply 
personal decisions do not entrench a fresh round of division and resentment 
between MPs who choose to be ‘innies’ and those who are ‘outies’.

“If we are to move on from here we must recognise how damaging it has been for 
Labour people – who have all basically wanted the same thing – to have knocked 
lumps out of each other for 20 years.”

Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, has not resigned from the shadow 
cabinet but sources close to the former leadership candidate said he had not 
yet been approached by Corbyn about continuing in a role, and it was unlikely 
that he would continue in position beyond this week.

Highlights from Tom Watson’s victory speech

In his acceptance speech, Watson made public a call for unity which he has 
been making privately in a series of meetings in recent days. Watson said: “To 
those who feel alarmed by the scale of difference between the old world and the 
new I say this: There is only one Labour.”

Former Labour leader Ed Miliband also said that he hoped the parliamentary 
party would now support Corbyn. TheObserver has learned that Miliband had been 
privately backing Burnham for the job, and even considered making an 
intervention at a late stage, asking in an email to one aide to the shadow 
health secretary: “Will it make a difference?”

Miliband did not, in the end, speak out and on Saturday said he would back the 
new leader: “I offerJeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> my support in what is a 
very difficult and demanding job, and I hope that people across the party will 
do the same.

“At the same time, I hope and expect that Jeremy will do everything he can to 
reach out and use the talents of people right across the party in the task of 
taking on the Tories and facing up to the very big challenges that we face.

“For my part, I will be supporting his work by advancing the causes I care 
most about – including tackling inequality and climate change – from the 
backbenches.”

Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott also urged high-profile figures to 
“get behind” Corbyn, warning that the “real enemy is the Tories”.

“The party gave an overwhelming endorsement to this man. He got more votes 
than Tony Blair. The party has spoken in a very, very strong voice,” he said.

Lord Soley, a former chairman of the parliamentary Labour party, said he 
feared that Corbyn’s victory “may have handed the next election to the Tory 
party”.

Comparing the choice of leader to that of Iain Duncan Smith taking charge of 
the Conservatives in 2001, Soley said: “They very quickly got rid of IDS. I do 
not see that happening as quickly with Labour.”
