A woman from Peru lost all four of her children at Berlinâ€™s main train station 
after briefly turning her back on them to buy a ticket.

German police said the tearful mother approached officers for help and they 
were able to find two of the children wandering around the station. A third 
turned up at another station in Berlin.

The fourth child, aged three, was discovered by a conductor on a high-speed 
train bound for Leipzig.


Police said on Tuesday that the family, who live in Italy, were eventually 
reunited and were able to continue their journey to Munich the same day.
