Three children missing in Melbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> overnight have been 
found by a television reporter on his way to work.

Jai, Beau and Chase Masters – aged nine, 10 and 12 – went missing from their 
home in Mornington, south-east of Melbourne, on Sunday night.

The Channel Seven News reporter Dean Felton found the siblings in South 
Melbourne, more than 60km from their home, while he was “simply driving to work 
as normal”.


Felton told local Melbourne radio station 3AW 
<http://www.3aw.com.au/news/three-children-missing-on-the-mornington-peninsula-20170115-gtry8j.html>
 that he had spied the missing boys as he was stopped in traffic, after hearing 
about them on the station’s 9am news bulletin.

“To my surprise, I noticed three boys, about the right age, just standing on 
the traffic island,” he said. “One was eating from a packet of Jatz, and I 
thought, ‘Well, that doesn’t look right.’”


He stopped his car and spoke to them. “They denied everything, ‘That’s not us, 
it must be someone different.’ But it didn’t quite ring true, so I stayed with 
them.”

The boys said they had arranged to meet their parents but were “fairly nervous 
at being approached and pretty cagey”. They then told Felton that they had 
hitched a ride to Melbourne with a stranger and had spent the night at a 
friend’s house.

“But they weren’t any more forthcoming than that … Once they cracked under 
questioning, that was when I called the police.”

Felton gave his phone to one of the boys to call their father.
