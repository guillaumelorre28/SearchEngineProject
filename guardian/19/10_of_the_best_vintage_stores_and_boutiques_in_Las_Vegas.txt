Gypsy Den
 Gypsy Den, Las Vegas. 
In the heart of Colorado Street's (and Vegas's) growing arts district, this 
adorable store occupies an adorable house. While the Attic (see above) cranks 
disco, the Gypsy Den favours Patti Smith. If the vibe at The Attic is meant to 
evoke the Summer of Love, this place is meant to evoke the brief romance 
between Stevie Nicks and Don Henley. Looking for some feather earrings? A 
shearling vest? A turquoise velvet jacket? Perhaps you're newly obsessed with 
US indie rock queen/harp player Joanna Newsom and think you too would like to 
start wearing Gunne Sax dresses? The books here are straight off your dad's 
kooky girlfriend's shelf – Coma, No Naughty Cats, The Nixon Recession Caper – 
and not to be missed.

C-Level
 C-Level, Las Vegas. 
You need fancy dress for a night out on the Strip but you think you'll let 
everyone else atKrave <http://kravelasvegas.com/> and Pure Rain look like a 
streetwalker while you simply look sexy. In Boca Park on Vegas's Beverly Hill's 
flavoured Westside, this women's store's red-satin walls add sumptuous luxury 
to the otherwise minimalist space. C-Level is calm and uncluttered but 
well-stocked. Example: a green strapless dress from Donna Mizani that's Jackie 
Kennedy class with the slightest 80s edge. Jewellery includes rubber rings 
studded with diamonds (Nikki Minaj <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicki_Minaj> 
andAlessandra Ambrosio <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandra_Ambrosio> are 
proud owners) and delicate little rhinestone initial necklaces, choices which, 
as with this store, are ultra-trendy without being obnoxious.

A short drive from Boca Park, Tivoli Village is brand new, fancy, and aspires 
to resemble an old European village – an old European village with 3,400 
parking spaces. Vasari has a hushed, elegant feeling. There's a vast couch and 
turquoise chair for non-shoppers to lounge on while shoppers lust over brands 
such as Alice and Oilvia, J Brand, Chloe, and Haute Hippie. Sure, you can get 
this stuff on the strip, but you'd have to wade through more than what's been 
perfectly curated here.

Droog
 Droog, Las Vegas. 
This shop (in the new, amazing, totally deserving of every accolade 
Cosmopolitan Hotel) from the eponymous Dutch design firm, is kind-of 
ridiculous, but it's also a big box of light and beauty. Unless you are a hedge 
fund manager or one of the luckier Kardashians, you won't be able to afford the 
$65,000 dresser with the 20-plus artfully askance drawers or the $17,000 
polypropylene chair. That's OK, because you're not supposed to buy that, you're 
supposed to buy the $19 temporary hooks, made of rubber, a perfectly sufficient 
conversation piece.

RetroSpecs

Eyeglass stores are not generally the most exciting retail spaces in the 
world, but RetroSpecs has spent 18 years breaking that convention. It presents 
its wares with museum-like elegance and diligence. Spectacles are curated in a 
timeline, beginning in 1910 and ending around 1970, with the rarest items, the 
Museum Collection, stored inside an antique safe. Prices range from $300 for 
70s-era military-issue Ray Bans to $5,000 for a pair of second world war-era 
Bausch and Lombs with solid gold nosepads. There's also a great couch and the 
cleanest, shiniest oak floors in the known world.

The Attic
 The Attic, Las Vegas. 
Since 1989, this jam-packed downtown Vegas vintage store has been giving both 
natives and visitors a place to sate all their old man shirt/platform 
boots/patchwork skirt/wacky-Bill-Cosby-sweater needs. There's an affordable 
selection of great vintage sunglasses and enough evening gowns to channel Cher, 
Marie Osmond and Chaka Khan, or all three in one night. Tip: go ahead and pet 
Miss Kitty but if you're planning on buttoning up your fly new Arrow brand 
shirt with your own fingers, leave that crazy parrot alone!

Chrome Gypsy Tattoo
 Chrome Gypsy Tattoo, Las Vegas. 
The artists working out of this award-winning parlour take the permanent, 
looks-altering nature of their trade seriously. "Lots of tattoo places in Vegas 
are about tourist price and tourist quality," says artist Dras (yes, one word). 
"We really care." The artistry is evident in photos of their work, and the 
diversity's impressive as well: each of Chrome Gyspy's eight artists has 
distinct obsessions and specialities. So, whether you want a gothic, inky 
skull, an explosion with fiery, realistic reds and/or a photorealist portrait 
of your mum, just check the website to see who's on your wavelength. It's next 
door to Spearmint Rhino, so you can pop in and ask a stripper if she likes it.

Undefeated
 New Balance shoes at Undefeated, Las Vegas. 
If it's not unusual for you to say that a certain style of sneaker has 
"dropped", provided no one has murdered you over this, you owe it yourself to 
take a trip here. The store itself, with its industrial-minimal design, "Give 
Me Everything" on the sound system, just makes you feel important, like you're 
walking to your great seats at a big NBA game. New (recently dropped!) 
acquisitions currently include the David Beckham adidas and the New Balance 
574, which, for the right kind of woman, is the equivalent of male lingerie.
• 4480 Paradise Road, Suite 400, +1 702 732 0019, undftd.com

Kiki de Montparnasse
 Kiki de Montparnasse, Las Vegas. 
In a town where you never know what's going to happen next, nice underwear is 
crucial. And no one has nicer underwear than Kiki De Montparnasse. This 
lingerie store at Crystals at CityCenter is named for a 1920s Paris nightclub 
chanteuse, and its magical pink interior is a much stronger dose of France than 
the nearby Paris Hotel. Try on the subtle but kinky Night Nurse ensemble in one 
of the special couple's changing rooms – but try to behave, because the 
question: "Hmmn, anything else go on in there besides trying stuff on?" did not 
get a laugh.

Boulevard South, +1 702 736 7883,kikidm.com

Ted Baker Outlet

Las Vegas is a big outlet store city, and people will try to tell you to shop 
at them. Feel free to resist, generally – most of the offerings are not that 
impressive – but the Ted Baker outlet is an exception. First of all, there are 
only three Ted Baker outlets in the US; so while no one can promise that you 
will walk out with one of their luxuriously soft, normally $180 shirts for 69 
bucks, or one of the nattily cut, $795 suits with the neato lining for a mere 
$325, you have a pretty good shot. And you certainly have a much better shot 
than if you never made the eight-minute drive from the Strip.
