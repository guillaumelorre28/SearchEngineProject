Tesco <https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco> will have phased out 
microbeads from all its own brand cosmetics and household cleaning products 
within a month, it was announced on Thursday.

While UK ministers recently said personal care products containing these tiny 
pieces of plasticwill be banned from sale by the end of 2017 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/02/uk-government-to-ban-microbeads-from-cosmetics-by-end-of-2017>
, it is not clear yet whether the ban will extend to other types of products 
that rely on their abrasive properties.

But Tesco said that it was listening to customers’ concerns and in the spring 
it had instructed suppliers to either cut microbeads from productssuch as 
toothpaste <http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=261983104> 
entirely, or to use natural alternatives such as ground coconut shell in face 
scrubs.

The supermarket will also make “do not flush” labels much bigger 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/26/uk-water-firms-call-for-do-not-flush-labelling-on-wet-wipes>
 on the front of its own brand wet wipes, which campaigners and water companies 
say areclogging up sewers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/26/disposable-wipes-sewer-toilet-cities-flushable>
 and causing pollution. And the company’s own brand “flushable” wipes will soon 
be manufactured to break down more easily.

Tesco admitted it had been “behind the game” on issues affecting the oceans 
and marine life before.

Microbeads are pieces of plastic less than 0.5mm in diameter and have been 
commonly used in health and beauty products to provide an exfoliating effect. 
But they have beenblamed for harming marine life’s ability to reproduce

, andexperts say more research is needed on their potential human health impacts
 <https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/4501>.

“What we’re effectively doing by and large is turning the clock back,” said 
Tim Smith, group quality director at Tesco, adding there was no reason industry 
and consumers could not go back to a decade ago when microbeads were not so 
widely used in products.

 Greenpeace’s David Santillo on microbeads. 
The company’s action will affect 10 personal care and 10 household products, 
with the microbeads simply dropped completely in most cases and in others 
replaced by natural alternatives such as calcium salts. Smith said there would 
be no difference to shoppers in price or performance.

“We’ve had to do quite a lot in a short time because Tesco has been slightly 
behind the game,” he said of the supermarket’s approach to the health of the 
oceans, including stocking of sustainable fish.

The company has also asked other brands to disclose what is in their products 
and what their intent is regarding microbeads, but Smith would not promise to 
stop selling such products if the brands were not taking action.

Kerry McCarthy, Labour MP and a member of the environment audit committee, 
said: “We’ve won the argument for a ban on microbeads in cosmetics and personal 
products. We need to take it a step further and see if companies can disclose 
what is in their products rather than relying on the likes of Greenpeace to do 
that analysis.”

Greenpeace, whose Esperanza ship is docked in London for the start of a major 
oceans campaign by the group, said that microbeads needed to be stopped at 
source because cleaning it up in the oceans was almost impossible.

“You can’t clean this stuff up effectively, partly because it’s too big a 
problem and partly because so little ends up at the surface,” said David 
Santillo, a scientist at Greenpeace and the University of Exeter, as he held up 
a Petri dish of the beads.

That dish, he said, contained hundreds of thousands of the blue and white 
beads, some measuring as little as 0.1mm across, that he had extracted from a 
single tube of Clearasil face scrub. But he added that with products beyond 
cosmetics, it was often hard to discern microbeads using infrared analysis and 
other techniques because their make-up was so much more complex.
