If you are anything like me, you live in horror of running out of food – 
especially over the festive period. When I have invited guests over, I buy and 
bake more than I will ever need, then relish getting creative with leftovers in 
the days that follow. If, once the halls have been undecked and all the dishes 
washed, you find yourself with a few beaten-up mince pies and a lump of blue 
cheese, these are the recipes for you.

Blondies are among my favourite things to make because they are a blank canvas 
for whatever bits and bobs you have in your sweet cupboard, much like chocolate 
chip cookies. My latest iteration contains broken bits of mince pies and 
sultanas plumped in brandy. The booze cuts through the sweetness; you could 
even replace the butter in the recipe with leftover brandy butter. Remember not 
to overbake the blondies so they stay gooey and chewy, one of the last 
indulgences of the season.

This year, any blue cheese remnants will find a home in buns, or be rolled 
into spicy folds of pastry and baked into cheesy scrolls. As with all my 
baking, I recommend tasting as you go. You could try the recipe with any cheese 
you have left lying around: cheddar, lancashire, parmesan … And be bold with 
your spicing: if you fancy a little more bite, just add a pinch of cayenne 
pepper.

Mince pie blondies

Serves 12
50ml brandy, cognac or rum
170g sultanas
Juice and zest of an orange
250g unsalted butter
2 eggs
200g light brown sugar
1 ½ tsp vanilla
250g flour
1½ tsp baking powder
1½ tsp fine salt
About 210g leftover mince pies

1 Heat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Butter a 30x20cm baking tin and line 
with greaseproof paper.

2 Put the brandy, sultanas, orange juice and zest in a small saucepan over a 
low heat until the fruit has plumped up. Remove from the heat, cover and set 
aside.

3 Melt the butter in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan and set aside to cool 
slightly.

4 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until fluffy. Whisk in 
the vanilla, then the melted butter.

5 In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add 
this to the egg mixture, and mix until just combined. Stir in the sultanas.

6 Pour the mixture into the prepared baking tin and smooth the top with a 
palette knife or spatula. Break up the mince pies with your fingers, then 
sprinkle the chunks over the top. Bake the blondies for 30 minutes. The centre 
should be puffed and set but still a little gooey.

7 Leave to cool completely in the tin, then cut into 12 thick but smallish 
pieces. These will keep well for up to 3 days in an airtight container.

Blue cheese buns

Makes 12
560g plain flour, plus more to roll
2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp fine salt
2 tsp paprika
250g unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes, plus 50g for melting and extra 
for greasing
300ml cold milk
About 350g blue cheese
1 egg plus 1 tbsp milk, for brushing

1 Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Butter a 12-cup deep muffin tray.

2 To make the dough, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and paprika with 
the diced butter in the bowl of a food mixer until you have a coarse meal. 
Slowly pour in the cold milk while the mixer is running, until the dough forms 
into a ball and comes away from the edges of the bowl. Turn the dough out on to 
a lightly floured surface and leave to rest for a few minutes. Fold the dough 
gently over itself once or twice to pull it all together. Let the dough rest a 
second time, for 10 minutes.

3 Melt 50g butter in a small saucepan, then set aside to cool slightly.

4 Clear a large work surface, dust lightly with more flour and roll out the 
dough into a large rectangle about 5mm thick. Brush the surface of the dough 
with the melted butter and, before the butter hardens, crumble over the blue 
cheese.

5 Now roll up the dough, starting at the long side, keeping it neat and tight. 
Gently tug the dough towards you to keep it taut while rolling away from you. 
Once it’s all rolled up, gently squeeze it to ensure it’s the same thickness 
throughout. Using a sharp knife, cut the roll crossways into 12 even slices. 
Take a slice of the blue cheese roll, peel back about 5cm of the loose end of 
the pastry and tuck this flap under the roll to loosely cover the bottom. Place 
each slice in the muffin tray, flap-side down. Repeat with the remaining slices.

6 Beat the egg lightly with the milk, then brush this over the surface of the 
buns.

7 Bake for 25 minutes. As soon as the buns are out of the oven, flip them out 
on to a wire cooling rack, so that they don’t stick to the tray.
