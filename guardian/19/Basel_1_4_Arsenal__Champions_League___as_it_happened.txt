89 min: Steffen limps off, possibly with a hamstring injury. Basel will have 
to finish with 10 players. The prospects of them getting the four goals they 
need to denyArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> top spot in

85 min: Walcott has ping from 20 yards. A deflection takes it wide. Perez 
delivers the corner. Janko clears it at the near post. That’s not a sequence of

GOAL! Basel 1-4 Arsenal (Doumbia 78)

That’s a splendid goal. Holding gives the ball away to Doumbia, who then

and dink the ball over Ospina.

66 min: Freekick to Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, 
about 30 yards out. Sanchez, the foulee, sizes it up ... and swipes a swerving 
over the wall and against the crossbar! That was witchcraft, the keeper had no 
clue where the ball was headed!

64 min: Koscielny heads Steffen’s corner away. Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> could do with sparing him any 
further strain tonight, too. Wenger should really be preparing a triple 
substitution, otherwise people might start thinking he’d wouldn’t mind injuries 
to key players because that would enable him to rationalise failure this season.

Sanchez are still on the pitch, by the way. I don’t know why.

68 min: Steffen takes a short corer to Xhaka. But Perez robs it and sets off 
towards the opposing half at a rattling clip. BUt somewhere along the way he 
forgot the ball, allowingBasel <https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel> to 
take it back. No matter.

GOAL! Basel 0-4 Basel (Iwobi 54)

That’s a glorious goal. Sanchez played a sumptuous pass over the defence for 
Ozil to run on to. Once he got it, he played a deft reverse pass from the left 
to Iwobi, who slotted into the net from seven yards. Awareness, guile and 
precision, all in one deadly move.

50 min: Xhaka does his best to keep up his yellow card rate, jumping into a 
challenge on Steffen without any chance of getting the ball. Steffen decides 
against taking the hit and going to ground, instead riding the challenge and 
haring towards theArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> box. 
He opens fire from 25 yards. But his shot is way off target.

GOAL! Basel 0-3 Arsenal (Perez 47)

Gibbs alertly wins possession in midfield and then snaps a pass towards 
Sanchez. It’s too hot for the Chilean to stop, but runs on through to Perez, 
who is suddenly clear on goal. He shoots low and hard from 18 yards and a 
little to the right. The keeper gets a hand to it but can’t deny the striker a 
hat-trick. Game over.

Half-time: Basel 0-2 Arsenal

That was almost too easy for Arsenal. Perez scored the simplest goals he’ll 
ever get and thenArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> just 
began enjoying what we may call a Swiss ramble. But towards the ends of the 
half there were a couple of warnings that they’d best not nod of or they could 
get a rude awakening when it’s too late. But the still looks unlikely, 
especially with PSG trailing at home to Ludogorets.

40 min: Steffen cuts into the box rom the left and lets fly with a fierce 
curling shot towards the far corner. Ospina saves well ... and then jumps on 
the rebound before Janko can pounce. It’s been a while sinceArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> posed a threat at the other end, 
and Basel’s confidence is slowly rising.

31 min: Better from Basel. Intricate, pacey passing in midfield takes them to 
the edge of theArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> area, 
where Iwobi commits a foul. Delgado uses the freekick to send a cross into the 
box. Ospina dashes off his line and punches it clear before Janko can get his 
head to it. Good goalkeeping.

23 min: Gabriel cuts out a cross from the left by Traoré. Danger averted, but 
Basel <https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel> are starting to piece 
together some vaguely promising moves.

Ozil. No sense tempting fate now.

16 min: Ludogorets have taken the lead at PSG! That’s an unexpected turn-up: 
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> could finish top of the 
group, after all. It’s hard to shirk the suspicion that everything’s going just 
a little too swimmingly for them so far....

GOAL! Basel 0-2 Arsenal (Perez 16)

Another close-range finish into an empty net for Perez, this time after a shot 
by Gibbs is parried into his path. There was nice interplay byArsenal

10 min: Xhaka sloppily gives the ball away mid-way inside his own half, 
allowing Basel to create their clearest chance of the match. Delgado peels off 
Holding to meet a chipped pass from the right and send a header back towards 
the far corner of goal. Ospina makes a tremendous save ... but he needn’t have

GOAL! Basel 0-1 Arsenal (Perez 8)

Sanchez clips a nice pass to Gibbs on the byline. The left back knocks it 
backs across goal and Balanta falls over to leave Perez with the simple 
pleasure of rolling the ball into an empty net from four yards. Easy.

5 min: A Ramsey potshot from distance takes a nick of Balanta. Ozil deposits 
an in-swinging corner on the foot of a defender, who wellies clear at the near 
post.

3 min: Don’t tell Sanchez that this or any other match is meaningless, he wont 
understand. He’s from the ‘if it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right’ school 
of thought, and he’s started with his customary vigour here. He’s great to 
watch.

They had it in their hands when it began spinning but lost their nerve half-way 
through.

Preamble

Hello. We’re going to have to enjoy this match solely for its recreational 
value, unless PSG start to give it more significance by floundering against 
Ludogorets. And unless you’re interested in seeing whether Basel can make it to 
the Europa League (they’ll only need a draw if PSG win). That’s fine, there 
will be lots of good players in action andBasel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel> usually has a fun atmosphere.

close  
An accomplished victory by the visitors in Basel and a terrific achievement by 
Ludogorets, who have drawn 2-2 in Paris, have deliveredArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> to the top of the group. Smiles 
all around the Gunners’ camp, especially from Perez, who bagged himself a 
hat-trick.

<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/06/basel-arsenal-champions-league-match-report> 
90 min: Just two more minutes. Ludogorets are still leading in Paris. 
 
89 min: Steffen limps off, possibly with a hamstring injury. Basel will have 
to finish with 10 players. The prospects of them getting the four goals they 
need to denyArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> top spot in 
the group have dimmed.
 
88 min: Pass, pass, pass, pass. Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are just winding the (cuckoo) 
clock down.
 
85 min: Walcott has ping from 20 yards. A deflection takes it wide. Perez 
delivers the corner. Janko clears it at the near post. That’s not a sequence of 
play you’ll be seeing in the highlights, all told.
 
83 min: The substitutions and the knowledge that the game is effectively over 
have resulted inArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> sagging 
a little and allowing Basel to stage a late rally. Holding makes a good 
defensive header to relieve pressure.
 
81 min: Corner to Basel <https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel>. Hoiked 
high to Lang on the penalty spot. He applies a powerful downward header, but 
Ospina saves.
 
That’s a splendid goal. Holding gives the ball away to Doumbia, who then 
produced a skilful flourish to roll past Koscielny, receive perform a one-two 
and dink the ball over Ospina.
 
76 min: In any other job, Arsenal’s players would have agreed to untuck their 
shirts and head off to the pub by now. Their job has been done for ages.
 
Basel substitution: Zuffi on, Dié off. 
 
Arsenal substitution: Walcott on, Ozil off. 
 
70 min: Ozil, always keen to add to his assist collection, zips a low pass 
towards the near post. Giroud tries to help it on into the net, but finds only 
the sidenetting.
 
67 min: Ludogorets are back in front in Paris! It’s starting to lool like 
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> really are going to top 
the group. They’re going to draw Real Madrid in the next round, aren’t they?
 
Arsenal substitutions: Elneny and Giroud on, Sanchez and Ramsey off.
 
66 min: Freekick to Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>, 
about 30 yards out. Sanchez, the foulee, sizes it up ... and swipes a swerving 
over the wall and against the crossbar! That was witchcraft, the keeper had no 
clue where the ball was headed!
 
64 min: Koscielny heads Steffen’s corner away. Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> could do with sparing him any 
further strain tonight, too. Wenger should really be preparing a triple 
substitution, otherwise people might start thinking he’d wouldn’t mind injuries 
to key players because that would enable him to rationalise failure this season.
 
63 min: Corner to Basel <https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel>. Ozil and 
Sanchez are still on the pitch, by the way. I don’t know why.
 
61 min: PSG have equalised through Cavani, presumably after his seventh 
chance. Give him another seven and PSG may yet top this group...
 
Basel substitution: Calla on, Elyounoussi off.
 
68 min: Steffen takes a short corer to Xhaka. But Perez robs it and sets off 
towards the opposing half at a rattling clip. BUt somewhere along the way he 
forgot the ball, allowingBasel <https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel> to 
take it back. No matter.
 
56 min: The fog is growing denser, almost creating a Hound of the Baskervilles 
vibe. And, now that we mention it, thatArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> kit does have a bit of a 
phosphorous glow...
 
That’s a glorious goal. Sanchez played a sumptuous pass over the defence for 
Ozil to run on to. Once he got it, he played a deft reverse pass from the left 
to Iwobi, who slotted into the net from seven yards. Awareness, guile and 
precision, all in one deadly move.

Images  
51 min: Delgado clips a nice cross over from the left. Janko leaps above 
Koscielny and flicks a header ... wide.
 
50 min: Xhaka does his best to keep up his yellow card rate, jumping into a 
challenge on Steffen without any chance of getting the ball. Steffen decides 
against taking the hit and going to ground, instead riding the challenge and 
haring towards theArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> box. 
He opens fire from 25 yards. But his shot is way off target.
 
Gibbs alertly wins possession in midfield and then snaps a pass towards 
Sanchez. It’s too hot for the Chilean to stop, but runs on through to Perez, 
who is suddenly clear on goal. He shoots low and hard from 18 yards and a 
little to the right. The keeper gets a hand to it but can’t deny the striker a 
hat-trick. Game over.

46 min: Here comes the ret of the match. No personnel changes. 
 
That was almost too easy for Arsenal. Perez scored the simplest goals he’ll 
ever get and thenArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> just 
began enjoying what we may call a Swiss ramble. But towards the ends of the 
half there were a couple of warnings that they’d best not nod of or they could 
get a rude awakening when it’s too late. But the still looks unlikely, 
especially with PSG trailing at home to Ludogorets.
 
42 min: Close again by Basel! Delgado botches a free header from six yards 
afterArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> stood off Basel and 
watched them pick a way forward. Time for them to jack up the tempo again, just 
a touch.
 
40 min: Steffen cuts into the box rom the left and lets fly with a fierce 
curling shot towards the far corner. Ospina saves well ... and then jumps on 
the rebound before Janko can pounce. It’s been a while sinceArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> posed a threat at the other end, 
and Basel’s confidence is slowly rising.
 
38 min: Dié scurries down the right, past Gibbs, but overhits his cross. 
 
36 min: Gibbs booked for catching an opponent on the follow-through. 
 
34 min: As ostentatious no-look pass by Sanchez to Ozil, who attempts to slide 
in Perez. ButBasel <https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel> foil that 
wheeze.
 
31 min: Better from Basel. Intricate, pacey passing in midfield takes them to 
the edge of theArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> area, 
where Iwobi commits a foul. Delgado uses the freekick to send a cross into the 
box. Ospina dashes off his line and punches it clear before Janko can get his 
head to it. Good goalkeeping.
 
28 min: Arsenal are back in cruising mode. This isn’t much of a spectacle, but 
there is intrigue, nonetheless, in wondering whether PSG will get back on track 
against Ludogorets and willArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> find a way to complicate things.
 
26 min: Traoré has been useful down the left, providing a good test of 
Gabriel’s right-back credentials, which are looking decent so far.
 
23 min: Gabriel cuts out a cross from the left by Traoré. Danger averted, but 
Basel <https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel> are starting to piece 
together some vaguely promising moves.
 
21 min: At this point Wenger should be thinking of taking off Sanchez and 
Ozil. No sense tempting fate now.
 
19 min: Traoré cracks a decent shot from the left just wide of the far post. 
 
16 min: Ludogorets have taken the lead at PSG! That’s an unexpected turn-up: 
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> could finish top of the 
group, after all. It’s hard to shirk the suspicion that everything’s going just 
a little too swimmingly for them so far....
 
Another close-range finish into an empty net for Perez, this time after a shot 
by Gibbs is parried into his path. There was nice interplay byArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> before that, too.

Couldridge/Reuters  
12 min: This is one of those (many) matches where Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have nothing to fear but arsenal 
themselves. They are a class above Basel.
 
10 min: Xhaka sloppily gives the ball away mid-way inside his own half, 
allowing Basel to create their clearest chance of the match. Delgado peels off 
Holding to meet a chipped pass from the right and send a header back towards 
the far corner of goal. Ospina makes a tremendous save ... but he needn’t have 
bothered, as Delgado was offside. That was the first moment of bother forArsenal
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> and it was all their own fault.
 
Sanchez clips a nice pass to Gibbs on the byline. The left back knocks it 
backs across goal and Balanta falls over to leave Perez with the simple 
pleasure of rolling the ball into an empty net from four yards. Easy.

7 min: Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are making 
themselves at home. Basel are struggling to get the ball.
 
5 min: A Ramsey potshot from distance takes a nick of Balanta. Ozil deposits 
an in-swinging corner on the foot of a defender, who wellies clear at the near 
post.
 
3 min: Don’t tell Sanchez that this or any other match is meaningless, he wont 
understand. He’s from the ‘if it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right’ school 
of thought, and he’s started with his customary vigour here. He’s great to 
watch.
 
2 min: It’s a cushy beginning for Arsenal. Basel gave the ball away almost 
immediately andArsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> have been 
stroking it around since then, giving a couple of easy touches to Holding, 
who’s making his debut in the tournament.
 
1 min: We have kickoff, performed by Basel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel>. A light mist is beginning to 
envelop the ground.
 
Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> lose the coin toss. 
They had it in their hands when it began spinning but lost their nerve half-way 
through.
 
[Enter teams] Basel are in all white clobber. Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> are in black socks, luminous 
lime shorts and black jerseys with high-viz trims. The temperature is below 
zero but the crowd are jumping up and down and singing to keep warm.

Ludogorets. And unless you’re interested in seeing whether Basel can make it to 
the Europa League (they’ll only need a draw if PSG win). That’s fine, there 
will be lots of good players in action andBasel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/basel> usually has a fun atmosphere.
