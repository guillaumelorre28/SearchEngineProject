The Land Yacht

Few things embody the Austin spirit as much as an Airstream trailer; housing 
everything from food trucks to boutiques, they're all over town, so a stay at 
The Land Yacht is the quickest way to feel like a true local. This restored 
vintage trailer is parked on the East Side of town, close to East 6th Street's 
upscale dive bars and dozens of art galleries; the proprietors (who live right 
next door) even have a few scooters for rent, for exploring the neighbourhood 
in style. The Yacht has an electric fireplace and is equipped with AC, sleeping 
two comfortably no matter the season; there's a fully equipped kitchen, and a 
grill outside, if you feel like trying your hand at a Texas barbecue. And to 
really embrace the trailer life, head to the nearby 6th Street food trailers 
for a culinary adventure.

family-sized pastel homes, is like a little suburb within city limits, and The

Elisabet Ney, whose palatial stone estate is just down the block – the house is 
outfitted with lush upholstery, huge windows, and light-blocking shutters for 
late sleepers. Walk a few blocks to the east for a culinary experience at

Park Lane Guesthouse
 Park Lane Guest House, Austin, Texas 
Boasting both a main house and adjacent private cottages, this Travis Heights 
B&B is as well-known for its innovative chefs as its eclectic decor; co-owned 
by a retired carpenter, the Victorian house has been renovated with brightly 
coloured shingles, stained glass detailing, and repurposed materials. While 
each cottage includes a full kitchen, chances are you'll prefer Park Lane's own 
creations; their organic, vegetarian breakfasts feature eggs from the 
property's own chickens, as well as homegrown fruits and herbs, and there are 
vegan and gluten-free options for health-conscious guests. Park Lane is near
