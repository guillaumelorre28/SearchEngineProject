That’s all from me today. Andy Murray has put everyone through the wringer 
again and now we’re all exhausted. There were also wins for Stan Wawrinka, Nick 
Kyrgios and Kei Nishikori on the men’s side and for Simona Halep, Petra Kvitova 
and Garbine Muguruza on the women’s side, while Heather Watson lost to Svetlana 
Kuznetsova. I’ll be back tomorrow – Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Serena 
Williams are in action. Until then, spend the rest of the evening readingKevin 
Mitchell’s report on Murray’s win

The good news for Murray is that he’s got a 6-0 winning record against Ivo 
Karlovic. They met at Wimbledon last year and Murray won 7-6, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. 
The bad news is that it’s bound to be an emotionally draining match.

Murray finishes by saying he’s hoping for a quick match in the next round. 
He’s not aware that he’s facing tie-break obsessive Ivo Karlovic on Friday.

It’s safe to say that Murray has earned a day off tomorrow. He must be 
exhausted. “He was excellent,” says Murray. “He was the one dictating a lot of 
the points. He’s going to have a fantastic future. This is the first time we’ve 
played each other but he was very good. I was thinking what happened? I was up 
6-2, 2-0 and he started to play magnificent. I just tried to fight through to 
the end. It’s been a tough few days and I’m going to have to recover well.”

Andy Murray beats Mathias Bourgue 6-2, 2-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3!

Murray begins with one of his favourites, a backhand lob drifting over 
Bourgue’s and landing well inside the baseline for 15-0. But Bourgue responds 
by winning the next point, monstering a backhand down the line for 15-all. It’s 
his 25th backhand winner. This has been a heroic effort and it might not be 
over yet. Murray then slashes a defensive slice into the net for 15-30. Are we 
about to witness something truly incredible. Maybe not. Murray summons all his 
genius to drop shot and lob for 30-all before earning his first match point 
with a powerful forehand at the net. Is this it? It’s hit. He hammers a 
backhand down the line and Bourgue can only swipe into the net. Murray looks at 
his box and points to his heart. He’s had to show a lot of it in the past three 
days. After seven hours and five sets, he’s into the third round to face Ivo 
Karlovic.

Fifth set: Bourgue* 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 3-5 Murray (*denotes server): A wicked 
backhand winner on game point from Bourgue and Murray’s going to have to serve 
for it again. And the volume from the crowd is rising.

Fifth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 2-5 Murray* (*denotes server): The 
first two points are shared, before a dismal attempt at a lob from Murray makes 
it 15-30. Why do it the easy way? Murray then nets a backhand to hand over two 
break points. Is there to be another twist? Perhaps. Bourgue gets one break 
back! Quick, someone get that man a Chomp.

Fifth set: Bourgue* 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 1-3 Murray (*denotes server): Bourgue 
nets a forehand, Murray dinks a drop shot and it’s 0-30, cause for alarm for 
the French fans. The atmosphere is even flatter when Bourgue knocks a backhand 
long to hand over two break points. And Murray only needs one. A battered 
backhand kisses the line and a floored Bourgue can only net his riposte.

Fifth set: Bourgue* 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 1-1 Murray (*denotes server): The game 
goes to deuce, with Bourgue’s energy levels dipping. Bourgue is beginning to up 
the pace on his serve but that leads to a double-fault, giving Murray a break 
point. Impressively, though, he saves it with some positive tennis, a smash 
forcing deuce again, and somehow he holds with a gorgeous drop shot at the net. 
It’s still on.

Fifth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Did you 
know that this is the first time Murray’s played consecutive five-set matches 
in the first two matches of a slam since the US Open in 2005? Back then, he 
beat Andrei Pavel before losing to Frenchman Arnaud Clement. That defeat to 
Clement featured a 6-0 collapse in the fifth set. That won’t happen here, at 
least, because he’s held to love in the first game of the decider.

Andy Murray wins the fourth set 6-2 to level the match!

Bourgue is serving to stay in the set. But Murray quickly races into a 0-30 
lead and he has three set points when Bourgue nets a backhand. Is the 
Frenchman’s inexperience, mentally and physically, beginning to tell? 
Double-faulting on set point suggests that it is. The applause is muted as the 
players walk back to their chairs.

Fourth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-5 Murray* (*denotes server): That hold 
seems to have given Bourgue renewed belief; 15-0 becomes 15-30. But Murray then 
comes out on top in a battle of drop shots at the net. Bourgue tries to lob him 
but Murray comes up with the overhead backhand for 30-all. That was an escape. 
From there, Murray holds. He’s a game away from levelling the match.

Fourth set: Bourgue* 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-4 Murray (*denotes server): Incidentally 
Murray hasn’t lost to a player outside the top 100 since losing to Mardy Fish 
in Miami six years ago. He’s beginning to restore some order. A vicious 
backhand up the line earns him a break point – but Bourgue clings on to force 
deuce and holds to stay in the fourth set.

two points are shared. Is Murray beginning to settle into a nice groove? 
Moments later, he pummels a backhand into the left corner to earn a break 
point. It’s his first for a while and it’s his first break since the start of 
the second set. Bourgue cracks a backhand long and Murray roars.

Fourth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 1-2 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray holds 
to 15. A funny thought: will Aljaz Bedene be the last Brit standing at the end 
of the day? Kyle Edmund has just lost 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to John Isner.

Fourth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Andy Murray 
has changed his hat. He’s changed his shirt. But is that going to be enough to 
change the flow of this match? It doesn’t look like it at the moment, Bourgue 
toying with Murray and winning the first two points of this game for a 0-30 
lead. Before long, Murray’s facing two break points as Bourgue picks him off at 
the net with a diagonal backhand winner. But Murray saves them both to earn 
deuce. Is the fire back? He screams at his box by way of celebration. Yet the 
Bourgue forehand has become a fearsome weapon. A huge one earns him a third 
break point. Murray, though, responds with an incredible half-volley down by 
his feet, the ball landing just inside the line. Eventually Murray holds on. 
That could be a big game.

Mathias Bourgue wins the third set to lead 2-6, 6-2, 6-4!

Nerveless. Bourgue glides into a 40-0 lead, three set points, thanks to two 
shimmering drop shots. Murray is stunned. We’re all stunned. Don’t pretend 
you’re not. Move aside, Leicester City, there’s a new show in town. Bourgue 
can’t take the first set point. But it doesn’t matter. He slams a backhand down 
the line and roars as the crowd goes wild! Murray is in a world of pain now!

That’s all from me today. Andy Murray has put everyone through the wringer 
again and now we’re all exhausted. There were also wins for Stan Wawrinka, Nick 
Kyrgios and Kei Nishikori on the men’s side and for Simona Halep, Petra Kvitova 
and Garbine Muguruza on the women’s side, while Heather Watson lost to Svetlana 
Kuznetsova. I’ll be back tomorrow – Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Serena 
Williams are in action. Until then, spend the rest of the evening readingKevin 
Mitchell’s report on Murray’s win

The good news for Murray is that he’s got a 6-0 winning record against Ivo 
Karlovic. They met at Wimbledon last year and Murray won 7-6, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. 
The bad news is that it’s bound to be an emotionally draining match.
 
Murray finishes by saying he’s hoping for a quick match in the next round. 
He’s not aware that he’s facing tie-break obsessive Ivo Karlovic on Friday.
 
It’s safe to say that Murray has earned a day off tomorrow. He must be 
exhausted. “He was excellent,” says Murray. “He was the one dictating a lot of 
the points. He’s going to have a fantastic future. This is the first time we’ve 
played each other but he was very good. I was thinking what happened? I was up 
6-2, 2-0 and he started to play magnificent. I just tried to fight through to 
the end. It’s been a tough few days and I’m going to have to recover well.”

Murray begins with one of his favourites, a backhand lob drifting over 
Bourgue’s and landing well inside the baseline for 15-0. But Bourgue responds 
by winning the next point, monstering a backhand down the line for 15-all. It’s 
his 25th backhand winner. This has been a heroic effort and it might not be 
over yet. Murray then slashes a defensive slice into the net for 15-30. Are we 
about to witness something truly incredible. Maybe not. Murray summons all his 
genius to drop shot and lob for 30-all before earning his first match point 
with a powerful forehand at the net. Is this it? It’s hit. He hammers a 
backhand down the line and Bourgue can only swipe into the net. Murray looks at 
his box and points to his heart. He’s had to show a lot of it in the past three 
days. After seven hours and five sets, he’s into the third round to face Ivo 
Karlovic.

Fifth set: Bourgue* 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 3-5 Murray (*denotes server): A wicked 
backhand winner on game point from Bourgue and Murray’s going to have to serve 
for it again. And the volume from the crowd is rising.
 
Fifth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 2-5 Murray* (*denotes server): The 
first two points are shared, before a dismal attempt at a lob from Murray makes 
it 15-30. Why do it the easy way? Murray then nets a backhand to hand over two 
break points. Is there to be another twist? Perhaps. Bourgue gets one break 
back! Quick, someone get that man a Chomp.

 
Fifth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 1-5 Murray* (*denotes server): Bourgue 
has eaten a Twix and a Mars Bar and drunk a can of Coke during this match. It’s 
not quite had the desired effect. Murray breaks again and will serve for a very 
weird match.

Fifth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 1-4 Murray* (*denotes server): From 
40-0 up, Murray threatens to make life difficult for himself, losing the next 
two points. But a classy drop shot finishes the job.
 
Fifth set: Bourgue* 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 1-3 Murray (*denotes server): Bourgue 
nets a forehand, Murray dinks a drop shot and it’s 0-30, cause for alarm for 
the French fans. The atmosphere is even flatter when Bourgue knocks a backhand 
long to hand over two break points. And Murray only needs one. A battered 
backhand kisses the line and a floored Bourgue can only net his riposte.
 
Fifth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 1-2 Murray* (*denotes server): Two 
scratchy shots from Murray and he’s down 15-30. Yet Bourgue is annoyed with 
himself after failing to make two returns, an increasingly angry Murray edging 
into a 40-30 lead. Murray holds when a Bourgue forehand goes wide.

Fifth set: Bourgue* 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 1-1 Murray (*denotes server): The game 
goes to deuce, with Bourgue’s energy levels dipping. Bourgue is beginning to up 
the pace on his serve but that leads to a double-fault, giving Murray a break 
point. Impressively, though, he saves it with some positive tennis, a smash 
forcing deuce again, and somehow he holds with a gorgeous drop shot at the net. 
It’s still on.
 
Fifth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Did you 
know that this is the first time Murray’s played consecutive five-set matches 
in the first two matches of a slam since the US Open in 2005? Back then, he 
beat Andrei Pavel before losing to Frenchman Arnaud Clement. That defeat to 
Clement featured a 6-0 collapse in the fifth set. That won’t happen here, at 
least, because he’s held to love in the first game of the decider.
 
Bourgue is serving to stay in the set. But Murray quickly races into a 0-30 
lead and he has three set points when Bourgue nets a backhand. Is the 
Frenchman’s inexperience, mentally and physically, beginning to tell? 
Double-faulting on set point suggests that it is. The applause is muted as the 
players walk back to their chairs.

Fourth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-5 Murray* (*denotes server): That hold 
seems to have given Bourgue renewed belief; 15-0 becomes 15-30. But Murray then 
comes out on top in a battle of drop shots at the net. Bourgue tries to lob him 
but Murray comes up with the overhead backhand for 30-all. That was an escape. 
From there, Murray holds. He’s a game away from levelling the match.
 
Fourth set: Bourgue* 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-4 Murray (*denotes server): Incidentally 
Murray hasn’t lost to a player outside the top 100 since losing to Mardy Fish 
in Miami six years ago. He’s beginning to restore some order. A vicious 
backhand up the line earns him a break point – but Bourgue clings on to force 
deuce and holds to stay in the fourth set.
 
Fourth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 1-4 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray 
consolidates the break, holding to love thanks to a glorious drop shot, and 
he’s not looking that tired any more. The mind’s a funny thing.
 
Fourth set: Bourgue* 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 1-3 Murray (*denotes server): The first 
two points are shared. Is Murray beginning to settle into a nice groove? 
Moments later, he pummels a backhand into the left corner to earn a break 
point. It’s his first for a while and it’s his first break since the start of 
the second set. Bourgue cracks a backhand long and Murray roars.

Fourth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 1-2 Murray* (*denotes server): Murray holds 
to 15. A funny thought: will Aljaz Bedene be the last Brit standing at the end 
of the day? Kyle Edmund has just lost 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to John Isner.
 
Fourth set: Bourgue* 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 1-1 Murray (*denotes server): A highly 
welcome, icy hold to love for Bourgue puts the pressure straight back on Murray.
 
Fourth set: Bourgue 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 0-1 Murray* (*denotes server): Andy Murray 
has changed his hat. He’s changed his shirt. But is that going to be enough to 
change the flow of this match? It doesn’t look like it at the moment, Bourgue 
toying with Murray and winning the first two points of this game for a 0-30 
lead. Before long, Murray’s facing two break points as Bourgue picks him off at 
the net with a diagonal backhand winner. But Murray saves them both to earn 
deuce. Is the fire back? He screams at his box by way of celebration. Yet the 
Bourgue forehand has become a fearsome weapon. A huge one earns him a third 
break point. Murray, though, responds with an incredible half-volley down by 
his feet, the ball landing just inside the line. Eventually Murray holds on. 
That could be a big game.

With apologies to other players, this live blog will now entirely focus on the 
Murray v Bourgue match until its conclusion. Can you blame us?
 
Nerveless. Bourgue glides into a 40-0 lead, three set points, thanks to two 
shimmering drop shots. Murray is stunned. We’re all stunned. Don’t pretend 
you’re not. Move aside, Leicester City, there’s a new show in town. Bourgue 
can’t take the first set point. But it doesn’t matter. He slams a backhand down 
the line and roars as the crowd goes wild! Murray is in a world of pain now!
 
Murray holds his serve to trail 5-4 in the third set. Can Bourgue serve it 
out? This is the biggest moment of his career.
 
Nick Kyrgios has beaten Igor Sijsling 6-3 6-2 6-1. He’ll probably face old foe 
Richard Gasquet in the next round.
 
Bourgue holds to love for 5-3. He’s bouncing. Murray looks forlorn.
 
Andy Murray saves two break points to hold. But Bourgue still leads 4-3 in the 
third set.
 
As John McEnroe points out on Eurosport, this is Mathias Bourgue’s first ever 
grand slam. His second ever grand slam match. And he’s beating the world No2.
 
Poor British tennis! Now Kyle Edmund is down 6-4, 6-4 against John Isner.

Richard Gasquet is making mincemeat out of Bjorn Fratangelo. The ninth seed 
takes the first set 6-2 off the American.
