Midnight Cowboy

Midnight Cowboy adds a touch of class and exclusivity to a street otherwise 
known as "Dirty Sixth". According to the prohibition-era theme, you won't find 
a sign illuminating the way to Midnight Cowboy. Instead, you must make a 
reservation, whereupon the staff will give you the correct buzzer number for 
the evening. This luxury cocktail speakeasy was formerly a brothel by the same 
name and accommodates no more than eight people in a party at once. Depending 
on your order, the mixologist might concoct your poison tableside with a 
rolling-cart full of fresh ingredients. As former patrons might have said, 
don't be fooled by size – small drinks pack quite a potent punch.

Yellow Jacket Social Club
 Photograph: John Pesina/johnpesina.com 
People are first drawn to Yellow Jacket Social Club by the smattering of 
wooden tables amid an explosion of crepe myrtle trees on a gravel patio. 
They're then won over by an interior bar that's a modern take on an old saloon 
with some winning details: reclaimed steel, timbers, railroad spikes and 
swinging doors, all of which are sourced from the surrounding East Side 
neighbourhood. Don't expect any dressed-up cocktails or fancy service here, but 
do explore the hard-to-beat Cuban-influenced food menu. Most importantly, the 
prices run across the board. Bring your dog, your bike and your tattoos – the 
culture here is highly accepting of all.

Easy Tiger
 Easy Tiger bar, Austin, Texas 
Easy Tiger's indoor/outdoor beer garden is so well designed and busy that it 
caught the attention ofFood & Wine 
<http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/americas-best-beer-gardens/5> magazine. 
Nestled up against Waller Creek, which runs through downtown Austin, Easy Tiger 
boasts views of high-rises, greenery, rock and water. The Wes Anderson-inspired 
decor is evidenced by the 1970s vignettes of bold wallpaper and retro 
hand-painted signage. In addition to a full bar, this place offers a rotating 
menu of obscure beers and wines, though they tend to sell out fast. Go for the 
housemade sausage and bread once you're sauced and ready to hit one of the 
ping-pong tables.

Dry Creek Cafe & Boat Dock

Hold your horses, for there is neither a cafe nor a boat dock here. Instead, a 
landlocked winding road leads to a ramshackle bungalow atop Mount Bonnell that 
looks as delicate as a house of cards. So what's the draw? Simplicity in the 
form of ice-cold beer, an old country jukebox, and a rickety deck that offers a 
lush view of where Texas Hill Country begins. Though the surrounding area has 
been populated with the mansions of the nouveaux riches, Dry Creek holds fast 
to its humble history and roots, refusing to change with the times.

Lustre Pearl

As the founding and most frequented bar of the Rainey Street district, Lustre 
Pearl charms its visitors with a semi-restored aesthetic and sprawling 
backyard. Social butterflies hit the giant, deliberately dilapidated house to 
hang out, hook up and hoolah hoop. The place is so consistently charged with 
energy, an entire night in Austin could be devoted to weaving in and out of the 
young professional and/or collegiate crowd. Should you indulge in one too many 
Black Eyes (Shiner Bock with a shot of Jack Daniel's), theBomb Tacos 
<http://lustrepearlaustin.com/content/bomb-tacos> food truck conveniently 
resides in Lustre Pearl's backyard, ready to come to the rescue one greasy 
plate at a time.

Whip In
 Whip In, Austin, Texas 
Whip In is revered for its novel interpretation of a convenience 
store-turned-restaurant and bar, located on an unassuming (and unattractive) 
corner of Interstate 35 in South Austin. It is a place to shop for obscure 
grocery items, order Texas-influenced Indian food (dal puppies are a must), 
participate in a trivia game, or drink from a selection of 72 microbrews on 
tap. Family-owned and operated, beer lovers will always find someone behind the 
bar who can talk shop and knowledgeably guide a tasting. And should you like 
something you drink, chances are you can find it in store to take away.

Bar Congress

Bar Congress serves as a sophisticated conduit between its popular eatery, 
Second Bar + Kitchen, and the five-star Congress restaurant. The dark, narrow 
bar is classy, sophisticated and well-appointed. The operation is stacked with 
top Austin talent, featuring an approachable sommelier and artistic bartender 
whose concoctions may well erase the memory of any other drink you've ever put 
to your lips. Service is paramount at any institution run by award-winning chef
David Bull, <http://congressaustin.com/second/team/david-bull/> and Bar 
Congress is no different. But it's not all pomp and circumstance here: this is 
Austin, and Bar Congress does know how to kick back and relax, as evidenced by 
seasonal series like the summer's Tiki Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

Hotel San Jose bar

This private, understated patio par sits in the hotel grounds. Frequented by 
the creative, artistic types seeking asylum from the Texas heat, the bar serves 
a small but fine selection of beer, wine and sake, as well as quite possibly 
the most refreshing sangria in town. Hotelier Liz Lambert (of theBunkhouse Group
 <http://www.bunkhousemgmt.com/>) is behind the minimalistic south-western 
design accented with desert plants, vibrant red glassware, and a consistently 
killer soundtrack. Careful, you might get so comfortable in this South Congress 
oasis that a happy hour could turn into an overnight stay.

Barbarella

Feel like dancing (dirty or otherwise)? Then make your way to Red River 
Street's Barbarella. Smoky, red-lit rooms are tucked away at the turn of every 
corner and an always packed dancefloor is illuminated by several large screens 
and a disco ball. Weeknight themes cater to an array of cultures and sub-genres 
from "Tuesgayz" to Thursday "Gritz & Gravy", Friday "Footloose", and Saturday 
"New Noise". If you need a brief break from the sweaty shimmying, the back 
patio connects to the calmer neighbouring bar, Swan Dive. But if you're young 
and looking to make a home-run, chances are you'll stick close to hipster-heavy 
Barbarella.

Bar Ilegal
 Bar Ilegal, Austin, Texas 
Set within the grounds of Clive Bar <http://clivebar.com>, many people don't 
even realise Bar Ilegal exists. The tiny, nondescript stone shed might look 
like a storage unit, but inside awaits a quiet alternative to the general 
hoopla of Rainey Street. The bar only serves mezcal imported from an authentic, 
small-batch distillery in Oaxaca, southern Mexico, the bottles of which neatly 
line the wall of the small bar, backlit by flickering candles. Because of the 
size, there is usually only one – knowledgeable – bartender on hand. As with 
mezcal itself, this hidden bar-within-a-bar should be savoured slowly as you 
discover its subtle nuances.
