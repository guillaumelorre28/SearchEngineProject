The scores of sights and activists in central Boston can leave you famished, 
but it is possible to find affordable cafes, diners and restaurants in the 
centre of the city. Chinatown, which is near the Theatre District, the Boston 
Commons, the Financial District and the trendy South End, has numerous 
inexpensive but good-quality restaurants. Squeeze into the crowded Gourmet 
Dumpling House (52 Beach St, +1 617 338 6223, onFacebook

), a local favourite where all lunch specials cost $7.95, or enjoy some dim sum 
atChina Pearl <http://chinapearlboston.net/> (9 Tyler St, +1 617 426 4338): 
small dishes are $3.50 and large are $5.25. If you’re on the other side of town 
in Brookline, the legendaryAnna’s Taqueria <http://www.annastaqueria.com/> 
(1412 Beacon St and 446 Harvard St, +1 617 739 7300/617 277 7111) does a 
regular burrito at $5.95. While there are many restaurants near historicFaneuil 
Hall <http://www.faneuilhallmarketplace.com/>, not all of them are as cheap or 
as sumptuous asSaus <http://www.sausboston.com/> (33 Union St, +1 617 248 
8835), which specialises in homemade french fries. A large order of fries is 
$7, and a sandwich is $8.

 The Samuel Adams brewery. Photograph: Boston Globe via Getty Images 
The famous Samuel Adams <https://www.samueladams.com/> brewery gives free tours
 <https://www.samueladams.com/boston-brewery/brewery-tours> and tastings with a 
recommended $2 donation to help local charities. A lesser known brewery worth 
getting to know isNight Shift Brewing <http://www.nightshiftbrewing.com/> in 
Everett, a 10-minute ride on the Orange Line from central Boston and a 
15-minute walk from the Wellington Station stop. It has a similar policy to 
Samuel Adams: asking for a $1 (or non-perishable food item) donation to help 
benefit the Greater Boston Food Bank. The unusual flavours (think beer brewed 
with oysters), outdoor patio with local food trucks and a taproom featuring 
arcade games, board games and a bean bag toss more than make up for its banal 
neighbourhood.

centre of Boston, and the second largest library in the US. Created in 1885 as

courtyard is decorated with Italianate white arches, the coffee shop is a map 
room and there are always two or three free exhibitions organised.Free tours

Salem’s cobblestone streets, colourful colonial houses and peculiar history of 
witchcraft allegations set it apart from other picturesque New England towns by 
the sea. A 30-minute ride on thecommuter rail from North Station 
<http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/> ($14 return), the town has many 
unusual boutiques, cafes and psychic shops reflecting its past. Beach bums 
should go to Revere Beach, which was made the first public beach in the US in 
1896, right on the Blue Line at either the Wonderland stop orRevere Beach 
<http://reverebeach.com/> station. Get in line at Kelly’s 
<http://www.kellysroastbeef.com/> when the salty air works up your appetite – 
it has been a local institution for decades; the crab rolls are $11.95 and a 
large roast beef sandwich is $8.95.

People’s Show on Sundays, featuring old and new talent, is pay by donation. Its

Emerald Necklace <http://www.emeraldnecklace.org/> is a series of parks of over 
1,000 acres, such as theArnold Arboretum <http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/>, 
owned by Harvard University just south of the Jamaica Plain neighbourhood. 
Climb Peters Hill, inside the Arboretum, for a fantastic view of the Boston 
skyline. On the other side of Jamaica Plain isJamaica Pond 
<http://jamaicapond.com/>, a picturesque body of water formed by a glacier. The 
Back Bay Fens <http://www.cityofboston.gov/Parks/emerald/Back_Bay_Fens.asp>, 
next to the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, is another great spot for a promenade 
along the water or a picnic in its rose garden.

As one of the oldest cities in the nation, Boston has a lot of history-related 
activities to offer.The Freedom Trail <http://www.thefreedomtrail.org/>, a red 
line on the sidewalk that runs (for 2.5 miles) past the city’s historical 
landmarks, is the first activity Bostonians will mention. While walking along 
the red line costs nothing, there are daily public tours that cost $14 for 
adults. Another inexpensive way to engage with Boston’s past is a visit to the
USS Constitution <http://www.navy.mil/local/constitution/> (for non-US visitors 
a passport is required to board the vessel), a famous battleship from the 
American revolutionary war, which is free of charge.
