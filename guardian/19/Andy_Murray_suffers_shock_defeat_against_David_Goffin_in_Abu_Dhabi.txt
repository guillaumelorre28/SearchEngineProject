The 7-6, 6-4 defeat in the last four of the low-key year-ending exhibition 
will hardly worry the Scot, who ends the year at world No1 having won titles at 
Wimbledon, the Rio Olympics and the ATP World Tour Finals.

Murray is a two-times winner of the MWTC but will not be fighting for a third 
title on New Year’s Eve after being edged out by his Belgian opponent, who had 
never before taken a set off the Scot.

Neither man broke serve in the first set, which Goffin wrapped up on tie-break 
with a pair of aces to finish.

Murray, who was this month named BBC Sports Personality of the Year for a 
third time 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/dec/19/andy-murray-sports-personality-third-time>
, made the first service break to take a 4-2 lead in the second but was 
immediately broken back by the battling Goffin.

Goffin then held and broke again, despite Murray establishing a 40-0 lead in 
his final service game, to progress to the final.

Murray’s focus now turns to the Qatar Open in Doha as he builds towards his 
push for an elusive first Australian Open title next month.
