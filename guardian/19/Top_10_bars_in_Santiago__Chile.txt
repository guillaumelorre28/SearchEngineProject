Santiago has never really had its moment in the spotlight. Overshadowed by 
flashier neighbours, such as Rio and Buenos Aires, it has traditionally been 
nothing more than an unavoidable stopover en route to somewhere more exciting: 
Patagonia, Easter Island, the Atacama desert. But, in recent years, this 
metropolis of seven million has established itself as a destination in its own 
right. No longer content to hide beneath the shadow of the Andes, it now has a 
number of vibrant cultural centres (such as the striking, copper-encasedGAM 
<http://www.gam.cl/>, which specialises in promoting the performing arts and 
music), glittering skyscrapers, award-winning restaurants and fantastic bars. 
The latter of these focus on the things Chile does best: wine and pisco, the 
local brandy with a grassy colour and spicy-sweet taste. Add to the mix a 
forward-looking music scene, growing interest in high design and superb craft 
brews from Patagonia and you begin to see why Santiago is a city out to 
surprise.

If Chile is known for one thing around the world it’s wine. When a trip to one 
of the dozen wineries in the nearby Casablanca valley – or more than two-dozen 
wineries in the more famous Colchagua valley two hours south – doesn’t fit in 
the schedule, BocaNariz in the trendy Lastarria neighbourhood is the next best 
thing. Santiago’s newest and finest “vinobar” has the look and feel of a cosy 
wine library, with a massive wine menu and flights of wine (three samples) 
themed by region or style. Better still, it has well-trained, English-speaking 
staff and is one of the only places in town where premium-quality wine is 
available by the glass (from £4). Scroll the menu for the daily selection of 
carménère, Chile’s signature grape that was, until 20 years ago, thought to be 
a variety of merlot.

A Santiago institution, this old-school favourite has three outposts across 
town that are equally heavy on character, with walls covered with vintage 
posters and Chilean memorabilia. For the best of the best, head to the original 
Manuel Montt location where the tables inside are as sought after as the ones 
on the patio outside (though, if you arrive early on “gringo time”, you won’t 
need to queue). Liguria is a cross between a restaurant and a pub, and locals 
and tourists alike come for a traditional dinner (think razor clams doused in 
parmesan or crab casserole) and stay long into the night to enjoy live music 
and to chat over a bottle of cabernet sauvignon (from £7.90). Call +562 2235

Chipe Libre

It’s best not to mention Peruvian pisco in affectionate terms while visiting 
Chile. Why? Because there is much sour feeling over who made South America’s 
beloved brandy first (and who, today, distils the finest batch). Get the 
lowdown at Chipe Libre, a welcome addition to the Lastarria neighbourhood with 
checkered floors, wooden tables and an expansive garden patio. This 
self-described “republic of pisco” not only boasts Chile’s largest pisco menu 
but also knowledgeable staff eager to share the variations – and there are many 
– between the Peruvian and Chilean brandy. Order a flight of pisco (from £3.45) 
or a round of pisco sours (from £3.25 each) and decide for yourself which 
country’s tipple tickles your fancy.

Owned by Chile’s top satirical magazine, The Clinic <http://www.theclinic.cl/>
, and covered in its political cartoons, this infamous bar is where the 
intelligentsia comes to bicker over beers. It’s also a great introduction to 
the political landscape, particularly for any left-leaning, socialist-minded, 
Chile-curious individuals. Bar The Clinic is one of the best places in town to 
sample some of the fantastic craft brews coming out of Chilean Patagonia, 
including Austral Calafate and Kunstmann Arándano (both £2.90). Or, if you 
prefer wine, the menu has four pages of Chilean varieties within its cheeky, 
tabloid layout, which mimics the tone of its parent magazine. Unlike most other 
bars in town, this place is open by 1pm and hopping soon after.

Ky is an Asian-themed speakeasy that’s behind a graffiti-tagged wall that you 
might otherwise mistake for the entrance to an abandoned building. Far from 
being neglected, however, what you’ll find inside is an opulent funhouse with 
an eclectic interior design that could easily pass for the set of aWong Kar-wai

curtains and funky lighting from competing chandeliers give the place an 
aesthetic that serves as the perfect setting for fusion martinis such as 
Rozameltini (pisco, kaffir lime and fresh blueberry juice, £8) or Mirotini 
(Grand Marnier, pisco, passion fruit and raspberry juice, £4.80). Call ahead

Gin is not a liquor often found on menus in this pisco-loving country, but 
it’s the raison d’être for one of the newest bars in Santiago’s rapidly 
gentrifying Barrio Italia neighbourhood. Ruca Bar is a popular expat hangout 
and gin-lover’s paradise, with 10 cocktails honouring the spirit that range in 
price from £3.80-£5. It’s also notable for its menu of tapas such as Pulpo On 
The Rocks: octopus sautéed inmerkén (an earthy Chilean spice), draped over 
charred black potatoes and served on a slate. Be sure to go early on Thursdays 
when Bombay Sapphire “Gin Tonics” (no need to use the “and” here) are just a 
luca (£1) from 6pm-10pm.

Tramonto Bar and Terrace

Tramonto Bar and Terrace tends to attract the upper echelon of Chilean 
society, thanks to its prime location on Alonso de Córdova, Santiago’s mini 
Madison Avenue. This hotel bar (it belongs to the Noi Vitacura) is the best of 
a growing number of rooftop options in Santiago and pairs the see-and-be-seen 
atmosphere of the exclusive Vitacura neighbourhood with stunning Andean views. 
The best time to go is sunset when you can order a pisco sour (£4) and watch as 
the towering Andes light up in amber hues. When daylight fades, waiters bring 
out candles and the poolside terrace takes on a more romantic tone.

This audacious new addition to Santiago’s restobar scene boasts “cross-dress 
Peruvian gastronomy” (aka Asian-Latin fusion) and a design style that can only 
really be described as Catholic kitsch. Opened in late 2014 by Gino Falcone, 
one of Chile’s top interior designers, Sarita Colonia is home to a menagerie of 
religious artefacts such as stained-glass windows, wooden confessionals and a 
faux cemetery replete with a life-size statue of Sarita Colonia, the patron 
saint of all “misfits”. It’s not quite a gay bar – you’ll find many of those on 
Bombero Nuñez street in the adjacent Bellavista neighbourhood – but it’s 
gay-friendly and attracts a mixed crowd. Go early to snag a seat on the rooftop 
patio for dinner (book on +562 2881 3937) and then stick around for cocktails, 
such as Hell’s Sour or Corazón de Sarita (both £6)

Opera-Catedral

Santiago has one of the most exciting music scenes on the continent and, with 
a roster of live acts most nights, the Opera-Catedral bar in the artsy Bellas 
Artes neighbourhood is the perfect spot for a sonic adventure. A popular cafe 
by day, this resto-bar kicks into full gear after dark when the lights dim 
flatteringly low and Chile’s top talent in everything from indie folk to 
electropop takes to the stage. Piscolas (pisco and Coca-Cola, £3.45) are a 
band-night favourite, but more adventurous drinkers will enjoy intriguing 
cocktails, such as De Rosa los Petalos (£3.80), an infusion of pisco, lemon and 
rose petals, or Espumante Tropical (£3.50), local sparkling wine topped with a
maceration <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maceration_(wine)> of lemon and mint. 
Above the bar is an atmospheric rooftop terrace. Expect a cover of £7 to enter 
on Friday and Saturday nights.

You can’t leave Santiago without trying Chile’s most patriotic drink, and what 
better place to tackle aterremoto than one of the city’s oldest and most beloved
picás (dive bars): La Piojera. Typically reserved for Independence Day 
celebrations, a terremoto is a sort of wine shake that is more dessert than 
drink with pineapple ice-cream, pipeño (a sweet white wine), and fernet (a 
bitter). Terremoto translates to earthquake in Spanish, and the 
love-it-or-hate-it mouth-freezer may very well leave you shaking. This 
ketchup-and-mustard-coloured adobe bar may have sticky tables and the odour of 
a frat house on a Sunday morning, but trying a terremoto here (for just £2) is 
something of a rite of passage.
