This summer a rocky, potentially Earth-like planet called Proxima b 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/24/earth-like-planet-found-orbiting-our-suns-nearest-star-raises-hopes-for-life-proxima-b>
 was found orbiting the nearest star to our sun at a distance where liquid 
water could exist on its surface. Some have mooted it might be habitable. What 
do you think?
I’d say we need to know a little bit more about nearby planets, like Mars, and 
some nearby moons within our solar system, like Europa around Jupiter or 
[Saturn’s] Enceladus. These have tantalising properties that could support life 
as we know it, but in its extremes – extreme cold, extreme dehydration or 
extreme radiation. And if we find life in our solar system, that bodes very 
well for life being ubiquitous. Then practically any planet we find that has 
been around long enough, we’d go there expecting to find life rather than 
simply wondering if it is there.

Obama says we will put a man on Mars under a president yet to be determined 
with a budget not yet established

President Obama has reiterated the goal of sending humans to Mars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/11/obama-mars-mission-nasa-habitats-space-travel-2030>
 by the 2030s and to bring them back. That seems ambitious, to say the least…
I am critical of it in a different way. Obama is saying we will put a man on 
Mars in 2030, under the leadership of a president yet to be determined, on a 
budget line not yet established. I like that somebody is dreaming that way, but 
I don’t know the cost to him of making that promise. So I have my scepticism 
that it would actually come to pass.

Should we go back to the moon first?
I think we should remind ourselves how to go to the moon, but I think Mars is 
vastly more interesting, biologically, because it has evidence of liquid, 
running water – it’s had water for billions of years. I’ve always wanted to keep
Mars <https://www.theguardian.com/science/mars> in our sights, even if we do 
choose to go back to the moon.

Would you go to Mars?
I would, but only after the person who made the spaceship had sent their 
mother first! I am not an early adopter of stuff that has never been done 
before, but I am glad we have bold people who live and walk among us who do 
take those risks. We would never have left the cave were it not for folks such 
as that.

Who is going to get to Mars first: Musk? Bezos? Nasa? Boeing? China?
By my read of history, the only thing that will get to Mars first is a 
government-driven space programme, such as Nasa. And why? Because it has never 
been done before, not with people – it is expensive and it has unquantified 
risks. When all three of those are operating there is no business model that 
you can establish. I think what is much more likely to unfold is the government 
wants to go to Mars,SpaceX  
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/the-guardian-view-on-space-exploration-the-final-frontier>
and other companies want to build the spaceship and Nasa pays them for it. 
Their business model is selling to the government.

There is some debate around what life might look like elsewhere in the 
universe; there might be intelligent life in the form of artificial 
intelligence or microbes. What’s your bet?
I like it all. If Earth is any kind of example at all, then most life you’ll 
find would be microbial. But consider also that if you can make a robot that 
knows how to make a robot from natural resources and you sent this robot off to 
a planet and it lands and makes three more of itself and they want to go to 
three other planets, you could populate the entire galaxy in a relatively short 
amount of time.

 have voiced concerns about AI. How about you?
I am completely relaxed. I would claim that AI will rise up, solving bits of 
challenges that we have put in our way and those bits in total would be a sort 
of stunning application of computers in the service of human need. Is a 
self-driving car going to stand up, wield a weapon and shoot you? No!

Given how we have managed to damage the Earth, should we be looking for other 
places to live?
If you want to ship a billion people to Mars and have them live there as they 
are living on Earth, you’ll have to terraform Mars – and that means turning 
Mars into an oasis of some kind. If you had the power of geoengineering to 
terraform Mars into Earth, then you have the power of geoengineering to turn 
Earth back into Earth. So the argument that if we trash Earth we need another 
planet doesn’t work. I am not convinced that escaping Earth and leaving others 
behind to die is the most sensible solution out there.

With politics, the only way you can undo what people think is true, but isn't, 
is to vote them out of office

With the Paris agreement 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/24/new-era-of-climate-change-reality-as-emissions-hit-symbolic-threshold>
, have climate change sceptics finally been overcome? Are we all on the same 
page?
I tweeted a couple of weeks ago something that seemed to resonate with people. 
It was something like: “Personal truths are established by faith, objective 
truths are established by evidence and political truths are established by 
incessant repetition.” So you can make anything true that you want, as long as 
you repeat it all the time. So Trump keeps calling her“Crooked Hillary” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/25/donald-trump-crooked-hillary-clinton-nickname-ignore-fight>
. That’s just part of her new name now – the first bit is Crooked, her second 
name is Hillary. You repeat this often enough and then you go interview Trump 
supporters and they say: “Well, she’s crooked.” A new political truth has 
arisen simply by repetition. With politics, the only way you can undo what 
people think is true, but isn’t, is to vote them out of office.

What do you think of the candidates?
Again I have a slightly different view. You’ll never see me complaining about 
someone who is running for office. Never. The issue is not who is running, or 
even what their thoughts are. The issue is that your fellow citizens are 
thinking one way versus another in the elections. So if you don’t like Trump, 
your gripe is not with Trump – he’s just a person. Your gripe is with the 40% 
of the electorate that wants to vote for him. That’s who you should be talking 
to. If people think they are voting in their own interests – but are not – then 
they need to be trained how to think about claims made by politicians.

You roasted rapper BoB 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/27/bob-stephen-neil-degrasse-tyson-flat-to-fact-flatline-rap-beef>
 over his claims about a flat Earth on Twitter...
There are too many people out there to waste that kind of energy on, so why 
was he different? Because he has millions of Twitter followers and he invoked 
physics to show the Earth was flat. Well, those are fighting words, so then I 
looked at the tweets where he said he’d got physics and then I posted my tweets 
saying you need some more physics. And then I showed people how to calculate it 
all and where he went wrong. But I would rather train people to think straight 
in the first place than fix them later, when it is sometimes too late.

You’ve said you are “simultaneously flattered and disturbed when, after 
posting various tweets, people tweet back wondering if I’m on drugs”. Is that 
just because your tweets reflect mind-bending thoughts about the universe?
The thoughts I have every day are the kind of thoughts others might only have 
in a bar, in a pub after a couple of beers when they are contemplating their 
existence, but we do this all the time in astrophysics.

In the UK, in the wake of Brexit, there has been a lot of talk of being in a 
“post-truth” environment. How do you feel about that?
If that is how you feel, then that is the beginning of the end of an informed 
democracy. Watch other countries rise up as you not only lag but regress. All 
the growth economies will be elsewhere because innovation and science and 
technology and investments in what are objectively truths are the foundations 
of tomorrow’s economies. If you reject it then you will be forfeiting 
everything that such a great nation has worked so hard to obtain. My point is 
that if you do not embrace objective truths, just move back to the caves, that 
is where you’re going to be eventually.
