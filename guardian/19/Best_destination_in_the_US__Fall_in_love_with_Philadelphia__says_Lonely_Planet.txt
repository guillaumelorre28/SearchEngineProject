Philadelphia <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia> has been named 
this year’s top destination to visit in the US by travel guide publisher Lonely 
Planet.

The east coast city, in Pennsylvania, tops the annual list, in which it was 
praised for the way its urban core has been transformed while still retaining 
its “deep American history and uniquely gritty flavour”.

Philadelphia is likely to become a place of pilgrimage for Rocky fans this 
year, as theOscar-winning boxing movie series will be celebrating its 40th 
anniversary

. Meanwhile, eyes will be drawn to the city in July, when it hosts the 
Democratic National Convention.

1 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – “Hands up to the sky, Rocky fans.”
Recently recognised as the US’s first and only world heritage city and visited 
by the pope in 2015, Philly’s on a roll right now.

2 Natchez, Mississippi – “Natchez will be rolling on the river in 2016.”
Hitting its 300th anniversary this year – making it two years older than New 
Orleans – this charming city on the Mississippi will be hosting hundreds of 
events throughout the year, from its annual hot air balloon races to historical 
celebrations.

3 Yellowstone national park – “Where better to celebrate than where it all 
began?”
This is the world’s first national park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/oct/30/walking-with-wolves-yellowstone-park>
, established 144 years ago. Yellowstone’s biggest draw, the Old Faithful 
geyser, just got a new boardwalk and gateway towns like Gardiner, Montana and 
Cody, Wyoming, are all gearing up to accommodate the millions of visitors 
expected this year.


4 Birmingham, Alabama – “Could Birmingham be the coolest city in the South?”
The once industrial Avondale neighbourhood has been reinvigorated with a surge 
of pubs, breweries and good eats, and the Civil Rights District is notable for 
theCivil Rights Institute <http://www.bcri.org/index.html>, the 16th St Baptist 
Church and theAlabama Jazz Hall of Fame <http://www.jazzhall.com/>.

5 Alaska – “Hey Americans: have you crossed the Arctic Circle in your own 
country?”
Last year, President Obama became the first sitting president to visit the 
Arctic in Alaska and it’s time to follow, especially to experience the newly 
renamed Denali (formerly Mt McKinley), America’s tallest peak at 6,190 metres, 
which can be reached on foot for the adventurous, or by train or bus.

6 Somerville, Massachusetts – “Boston’s hippest ’hood has moved a few stops up 
the Orange Line.”
Boston’s most exciting new neighbourhood has cutting-edge restaurants, craft 
breweries and offbeat attractions like the hugely popularMuseum of Bad Art 
<http://www.museumofbadart.org/>, the Tiny Museum <http://tinymuseum.org/>, the 
Fluff Festival and HONK!, a festival of socially conscious music-making.

7 Northwest Arkansas – “Give the Rockies a run for their money.”
With wide open spaces, mountains and crystal blue lakes and rivers, this 
region also has cultural flair, with towns that are distinctly unique from one 
another, like Fayetteville – an artsy university city with a vibrant literary 
scene – and Eureka Springs, which has access to some of the best hiking in the 
Ozarks.

8 San Antonio, Texas – “Take a hearty stew of Mexican culture, add a dash of 
Austin weird and a big dollop of pure Texas ’tude.”
The popular River Walk <http://www.thesanantonioriverwalk.com/> has expanded 
from three to 15 miles and the Pearl Brewery District continues to evolve with 
top-notch restaurants, a cooking school and outdoor events throughout the year, 
helping to make San Antonio the Lone Star State’s most compelling, culturally 
eclectic city right now.

9 Southern New Mexico – “If it’s Southwestern wilderness you’re after, head 
toward the border.”
Santa Fe and Taos usually get the spotlight, but go south to truly experience 
the wild west by visiting the recently establishedOrgan Mountains-Desert Peaks 
National Monument 
<http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/content/nm/en/prog/NLCS/OMDP_NM.html> and Carlsbad 
Cavern <http://www.nps.gov/cave/index.htm>, a place far more alien than 
anything in nearby Roswell.

10 Milwaukee, Wisconsin – “The city’s beery side still bubbles strong.”
Chicago may cast a big shadow, but the city is enjoying its moment in the sun, 
with attractions such as beer-tasting tours at household name brands and new 
craft breweries, the stunningQuadracci Pavilion 
<https://mam.org/info/details/quadracci.php> and the Milwaukee Art Museum 
<http://mam.org/>.
