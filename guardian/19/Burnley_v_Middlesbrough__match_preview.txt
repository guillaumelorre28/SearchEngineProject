This may be a defining period for Burnley, who have lost five in six but tend 
to let opponents know they have been in a game. Back-to-back wins over
Middlesbrough <https://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough> and 
Sunderland cannot be discounted given their impressive home form, and might 
also help Sean Dyche attract the right January reinforcements. Their first 
festive test sees a rematch with last season’s Championship rivals Boro, with 
whom they shared a draw at Turf Moor in April. Aitor Karanka’s side, who cut 
loose all of a sudden in overwhelming Swansea, would consider a repeat of that 
a reasonable enough return this time too.Nick Ames
