The earth’s natural satellite <https://www.theguardian.com/science/moon> is 
coming closer to Earth than is usual 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/13/supermoon-brightest-display-for-68-years>
 on its orbit on Monday, and the side facing us will be fully illuminated by 
the sun. The result will be the best “super perigee full moon” in 68 years.

If you’re blessed with clear skies where you are tonight, we’d love to see 
your photos

arguably super moon.
