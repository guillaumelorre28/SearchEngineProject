Sesame seeds might seem a very small ingredient to tie together three such 
different recipes (you get between 250 and 300 seeds in every gram, after all) 
but they punch well above their little weight.

Whole sesame seeds come in a range of colours, from black or violet at one end 
of the spectrum to beige (if they are unhulled) or off-white (if they are 
hulled) at the other. The black seeds have slightly more flavour, but whichever 
I’m using, I always give them a gentle toast first, to draw out that nuttiness. 
(I’ve found it’s more reliable to do this in a 150C/300F/gas mark 2 oven for 
five minutes, because, when you toast them in a dry pan on the stovetop, some 
always seem to burn before the others have a chance to tan.)

Sesame oil, too, comes in a range of colours: darker oils are made with 
toasted brown seeds, and have a more pronounced flavour than lighter oils, 
which are made with untoasted white seeds and are used mostly as a seasoning, 
rather than as a cooking oil. Both keep very well, so stock up now and sow the 
seeds later.

Apple, kohlrabi and cucumber slaw

If I’m sprinkling sesame seeds on a salad, which I do often, I like to use a 
mixture of black and white, because that looks better, but if all you have is 
white, that’s fine. Allow this salad to sit dressed for an hour before serving, 
but without the herbs (add those just before serving). The vegetables will 
soften slightly and absorb the dressing; they’ll release some liquid into the 
bowl – just tip this out before adding the herbs. Serves six.

2 pink lady apples, cut into 2mm-thick half-moons (250g)
1 kohlrabi, peeled and julienned
1 cucumber, cut in half lengthways, deseeded, then flesh julienned 
1 spring onion, trimmed and julienned
2 tsp sesame seeds
½ tsp Aleppo (or regular) chilli flakes
20g Thai basil leaves, torn (or coriander leaves)
15g mint leaves, torn

For the dressing
100g white miso
3cm piece ginger, peeled and grated 
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
2 tbsp mirin
60ml rice vinegar
1½ tbsp light soy sauce
2 tsp sesame oil

About an hour before you want to eat, whisk the dressing ingredients in a 
large bowl, add the apple, kohlrabi, cucumber and spring onion, toss to coat, 
then set aside.

Meanwhile, gently toast the sesame seeds for four minutes, in a dry pan or a 
low oven, until golden-brown, then mix with the chilli.

Just before serving, mix the herbs into the salad, then pile the salad high on 
a platter, sprinkle with the sesame and chilli mix, and take to the table.

Sushi rice cakes with miso and ginger sauce

Makes 12 cakes, to serve six.

300g sushi rice
1 small 5g piece kombu 
60ml rice vinegar
2 tbsp caster sugar
Salt
1 tsp sesame oil
1 tbsp cornflour
60ml groundnut oil
4cm piece ginger, peeled and julienned 
25g dried shrimps
80g fresh shiitake mushrooms, trimmed and sliced 1-2mm thick
2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
6 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced
1 sheet nori, cut into 4 strips, then cut again widthways into 2- to 3mm-wide 
strips (scissors are by far the best tool)

For the miso and ginger sauce
3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated
1½ tbsp light soy sauce
30g light miso
3 tbsp mirin

Put the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan with two tablespoons of water, 
and cook on a medium heat for two to three minutes, until the miso dissolves 
and the sauce thickens.

Put the rice in a large bowl of cold water and stir with your hands for 10 
seconds, to help release the starch. Drain into a large sieve and run cold 
water over it for a few seconds. Return to the bowl, cover again with cold 
water, and repeat the process four or five times more, until the water in the 
bowl is almost clear. Put the rice back in the bowl, cover again with fresh 
water and leave to soak for 30 minutes. Drain a final time, then tip into a 
medium saucepan for which you have a lid. Add the kombu and 360ml water, cover 
and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, resisting 
the urge to lift the lid or stir. Take off the heat and leave, still covered, 
for 10 minutes.

Put the vinegar in a small saucepan with the sugar and three-quarters of a 
teaspoon of salt, heat gently until the sugar dissolves, then take off the 
heat. Remove the lid from the rice – it should be soft and sticky – and discard 
the kombu. Pour the syrup and sesame oil all over the rice, and sprinkle over 
the cornflour. Using a spatula, carefully stir the rice so it’s all coated, 
cover again and leave for 15 minutes, to steam some more.

Meanwhile, heat a tablespoon of groundnut oil in a large frying pan on a 
medium-high flame. Once hot, fry the ginger and shrimp for two minutes, until 
the ginger starts to brown, then add the shiitake and fry, stirring often, for 
two to three minutes. Tip into a bowl and add the rice, sesame seeds, spring 
onions and nori. Mix well, then, with wet hands, divide the rice into 7cm-round 
patties that are 2-3cm thick.

Wipe clean the frying pan, heat a tablespoon and a half of oil, then fry half 
the patties for three to four minutes, turning them halfway, until golden-brown 
on both sides. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and repeat with the 
remaining rice cakes and oil. Serve hot with the miso and ginger sauce for 
dipping.

Serve this sweet, sticky pudding with lightly whipped double cream or cold 
pouring double cream. Serves six to eight.

50g tahini paste
75ml orange juice
8 Medjool dates, pitted and quartered
½ peeled banana, thinly sliced 
120g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 10g extra to grease
150g caster sugar
2 eggs
200g self-raising flour
Salt
3 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted

For the caramel sauce
70g caster sugar
20g liquid glucose
2 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
200ml double cream

Whisk the tahini and orange juice in a medium bowl, then stir in the dates and 
banana, and leave for 30 minutes.

Grease a one-litre pudding bowl (11cm at the base and 16cm at the rim) with 
butter and line the base with a circle of greaseproof paper.

For the sauce, put the sugar and liquid glucose in a small saucepan and warm 
on a medium-high heat for five to six minutes, gently swirling the pan and 
resisting the urge to stir. Once the sugar has melted and turned a dark golden 
brown, add the sesame seeds and cream, and stir for about a minute, until the 
caramel melts into the cream and the sauce thickens. Take off the heat, pour 
three tablespoons into the pudding bowl and put the rest to one side.

Put the butter and sugar in a food mixer with a paddle attachment. Whisk for 
two to three minutes, until light and fluffy, then add the eggs one at a time. 
Once combined, incorporate the flour and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt bit by 
bit, then whisk on a low speed to combine. Gently fold in the tahini and fruit 
mix and the sesame seeds, then spoon into the bowl on top of the sauce.

Cover the bowl with a sheet of parchment paper large enough generously to 
cover the top, leaving room for the pudding to expand, then cover again with a 
sheet of tin foil. Tightly tie on the sheets with string or an elastic band, 
taking it around the edge of the basin a few times, so the pudding is well and 
truly sealed in. Trim the paper and tin foil to leave only a 2cm overhang.

Put an upturned saucer or small plate in a large saucepan, half-fill the pan 
with water and bring to a boil. Carefully lower the pudding basin on top of the 
saucer (the water should come halfway up the sides), cover the pan with a 
tight-fitting lid, turn down the heat and leave to simmer gently for two hours 
(top up with boiling water, if need be).

Carefully lift the pudding from the water, let it sit for five minutes, then 
remove the parchment and foil, and invert on to a large plate. Spoon over three 
tablespoons of the reserved sauce (you may need to warm it up again, so it’s 
loose and runs down the sides) and serve with the rest of the sauce and some 
cream.
