The Federal Reserve could wait until at least next summer before raising 
interest rates again, according to Wall Street economistssurveyed by the

 would be followed by three more next year were played down by the 31 
economists surveyed, who predicted only two rises were likely.

The New York Dow Jones index soared last week to within 160 points of a record 
20,000 amid forecasts that a huge stimulus package in the first year of Donald 
Trump’s presidency would trigger an economic boom.

While Trump has promised to cut taxes affecting middle-income earners and pump 
funds into major infrastructure projects, many economists are wary that 
Congress could delay or block the moves, fearing a steep rise in the 
government’s budget deficit.


“Global growth will improve next year but remain under its long-term trend,” 
Gregory Daco, an economist with OxfordEconomics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics>, told the newspaper. “Trump’s 
policies, and the expectation of them, will be pivotal to global developments.”

The strengthening of the dollar is also likely to hit exports and increase the 
price of imports, increasing the US balance of payments deficit.
