Favourite phenomenon

Texans outside Austin consider Austinites quite batty. A centre of counter 
culture (read: hippies) in the state, Austin is also home to all the crazy 
politicians the citizenry of the state has sent to the State Capitol to 
represent them. Maybe it's the rest of Texas that's bats. The real centre of 
batty activity in Austin is theCongress Avenue Bridge, 10 blocks south of the 
Capitol, and home to about a million actual bats. Every evening a giant cloud 
of these boogers swoops out from under the bridge to feed on insects, and every 
evening hundreds of people come out to watch them. If only the bats would 
develop a taste for politicians.

Favourite Mexican restaurant

One of the city's oldest and best is El Patio, just north of the University Of 
Texas campus, where Elvis Presley once scarfed the enchiladas, and pictures of 
football legends grace the oh-so-20th-century wood-panelled walls. Founded and 
owned by my Lebanese friends, the Joseph family, it's a must-stop pre-game, 
post-game or even mid-game, when [college football team] the Longhorns are in 
town. I consider the Kinkster and the Joseph family to be our greatest hopes 
for peace in the Middle East.

Favourite dance hall

Hands down the best in Austin (or anywhere, for that matter) is the legendary 
Broken Spoke, owned by the equally legendary James White. James likes to have 
his picture taken. There are two entire rooms filled with pictures of James 
with everyone from Dolly Parton to Willie Nelson, and of course, the Kinkster, 
but the real action is on the dance floor, where ancient floorboards squeak in 
rhythm with the boot scooters sashaying across it. One bit of advice: you may 
not want to use the word "sashay" at the Broken Spoke.

Favourite rock'n'roll joint
 Photograph: Mal Ojo/flickr 
In a city filled with the hip and the cool, one of the coolest joints for 
sipping a brew and taking in the best in old-school roots music is the
Continental Club. A focal point in the SoCo district [South Congress Avenue], 
the Continental has been around in one incarnation or another since the 1950s. 
You can tell this by the classic cars all nosed up to the entrance.

Favourite burger

One cannot visit Austin without hitting Dirty Martin's Kum Bak Hamburgers at 
the north end of the Drag [Guadalupe Street], which runs past the entrance to 
the university. Dirty's has been serving handmade burgers since 1926, and the 
people serving them have all been there for just about that long. Up until a 
dozen or so years ago, they had carhops. Not the ones you would imagine – young 
women on roller skates – but really cool older guys, who always seemed to know 
exactly what you wanted with that perfectly greasy burger. The carhops are 
gone, but the burgers are still hand-patted and perfectly greasy. I usually 
eschew the Sissy Burger in favour of the Big Sissy Burger. Big is always better 
in Texas.

Favourite motel

The Austin Motel, across the street from the Continental Club, is my favourite 
motel just about anywhere. It, too, is right in the middle of SoCo, which is 
about the hottest area in South Austin these days. When I check in, they always 
ask if I have a room preference. I always say, "surprise me" – and they do. 
Every room is different, and they are constantly redecorating. On at least one 
occasion, I was pretty sure they redecorated my room while I was out. Of 
course, that could have been the Guinness talking.

Favourite event

One of the few events the Kinkster regularly attends is the Texas Book Festival
. Founded by my good friend Laura Bush, it caters for what the state of Texas 
probably needs more than anything – readers. Unlike rock festivals, which also 
abound in Austin, the Texas Book Festival truly is for all ages. It does 
provide music, and sometimes that music is me. I really enjoy these 
performances, as they are often in front of my core fan base, 
three-to-six-year-olds.

Favourite Austin music

Like all Texans, I could easily say Willie Nelson is the Austin musician who 
most moves me, but technically Willie does not live in Austin. He lives on a 
bus, with a mailing address apparently known only to the border patrol and
federales. So my money is on a band called Greezy Wheels. They are either an 
Austin institution or they should be institutionalised, because decades after 
their turn as darlings of the Austin music scene, they're still turnin' it 
loose with the best of them. The fiddler, Sweet Mary, was in my band in New 
York City, and she is still a regular Shostakovich with a bow. I find myself 
humming along in a fine castrato every time I hear her play.

Favourite homestyle restaurant
 Photograph: atmtx/flickr 
There are quite a few homestyle restaurants in Austin. Down-home cooking is a 
natural part of the Texas environment, much like football andBilly Joe Shaver 
<http://www.billyjoeshaver.com/>, so there are many good ones, like Threadgill's
 <http://www.threadgills.com/> and Hoover's Cooking <http://hooverscooking.com/>
. For my pesos, the best of the best isThe Frisco Shop, the last bastion of 
Harry Akin's Night Hawk restaurant chain. It was my late Dad's favourite, too. 
Tom knew every waitress, and they all knew Tom. They also knew not to seat Tom 
at the wrong table. ("Why don't you just put us IN the kitchen?"). Place your 
bet on the sirloin strip and the chili cheese fries. It's the only bet I never 
lose.

Favourite political haunt
 Photograph: Paul Lowry/flickr 
Believe me, the best place to find out what's going on in our state government 
is not the back hallways of the Capitol. It'sCisco's Bakery 
<http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/ciscos-restaurant-bakery-and-bar-austin>, where for 
decades folks like Lyndon Johnson, Kris Kristofferson, legendary Texas football 
coach Darrell Royal, and yours truly have sucked down Bloody Marys andhuevos 
rancheros as we've talked up what's to be done to make Texas even bigger and 
better. Some of the best political ploys of the past 60 years have been hatched 
over Cisco's biscuits, although I'm still not getting much traction for my 
proposal, the annexation of Cuba.
