The chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup> has warned that 
banks could pull operations out of Britain unless Theresa May draws up 
transitional arrangements for the country’s exit from the EU.

Sir Howard Davies said it would be damaging if there was no transitional plan 
and that banks would have to make decisions based on uncertainty.

Speaking to ITV’s Peston On Sunday programme, he said the US and Japanese 
banks were concerned by the prospect of a hard Brexit and were drawing up 
contingency plans.

“I think it is damaging if we don’t get a transitional deal because I think 
you will then see banks and financial institutions making decisions on the 
basis of uncertainty.

“They will not wait because they have to make a decision which will allow them 
to be, to continue to function in the event of a hard Brexit if that’s a 
possibility.

“So they will not sit back, they are currently making contingency plans and 
once you’ve got a contingency plan – hey, there is a risk you might implement 
it one day.”

Davis said the government did not need to reveal its full negotiating 
position, but needed to reassure the City so Britain did not encounter a “jerky 
and sudden” departure from the EU.

His comments come as a group of financiers and lawyers based in Milan draw up 
proposals for a post-Brexit financial services centre for Europe hinged around 
London and the Italian city.

The aim of Select Milano, an independent organisation endorsed by the Italian 
government, is not to steal business from London but to help financial services 
thrive in Europe after the UK leaves the EU.

Its chief executive, Bepi Pezzulli, said one idea that was being drawn up was 
Dublin as satellite because the Irish legal system was closest to the 
principles of English law that financiers were accustomed to.

“I don’t think destroying or fragmenting the City of London is a good way 
forward,” said Pezzulli. “Destroying a cluster is not good. We should instead 
enlarge the cluster and make London and Milan the head of a new cluster.”

The cluster is a reference to the varied businesses that are based in London, 
such as banking, fund management and private equity, and the services that 
build up around them, such as accountancy and legal services.

As a result of Brexit, financial services firms operating out of London are 
expected to have to shift business – and jobs – to other parts of the EU to 
enable them to keep access to the “passport” which allows them to sell products 
across the EU with ease.

Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and Madrid are among the cities keen to benefit from 
any exodus from London. There have been warnings, though, including from a Bank 
of England deputy governor, that New York could end up being the main 
beneficiary from any loss of business from London.

The Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe

 saidthis month  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/all-of-europe-will-suffer-if-london-loses-financial-clout-says-bank-deputy>
that while it was possible that some activities currently carried out in London 
would need to move elsewhere in Europe, it would take time for any one 
financial centre to acquire the “cluster” effect of the UK capital.

Select Milano is targeting one of the largest aspects of London-based 
business: euro-dominated clearing. Although the UK does not use the euro, 
London is the centre of €570bn of trading in financial products in Europe’s 
single currency.


Much of this business passes through the London Clearing House, partly owned 
by the London Stock Exchange, which is in the throes of a merger with 
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Börse

. The LSE also has links in Milan, owning the stock exchange and operating the 
Italian clearing house.

Pezzulli, a lawyer, said: “We are not joining a queue to steal business from 
London.” He suggested setting up a European economic interest group (EEIG), of 
legal entities able to operate inside and outside the EU.
