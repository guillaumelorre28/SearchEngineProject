When is a snowflake not a snowflake? Answer: when it has fourfold symmetry, 
like the graphic used with your article (Poor little snowflake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/28/snowflake-insult-disdain-young-people>
, G2, 29 October). How could you make such a mistake? If you are determined to 
include a snowflake graphic, please get it right. Your snowflakes appear to be 
made of cubic ice, a metastable polymorph not seen in blizzards or snowballs. 
An interesting idea but sadly a fantasy. Regular bog-standard ice comprises a 
hexagonal array of water molecules, so snowflakes likewise have sixfold 
symmetry. You silly snowflakes!

• Young people’s need for “safe spaces” is completely understandable. I’m 
quite old now but still need mine: it’s my bedroom, usually with a favourite 
book and a cat. But speakers’ platforms and debating chambers are intended as 
verbal battlegrounds and have no business being anybody’s safe space.

• Here’s a revolutionary idea from Jeremy Hunt (Apprentice nurses without 
degrees to learn job on wards 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/30/apprentice-nurses-could-treat-hospital-patients-in-bid-to-tackle-shortages>
, 30 November). Roll back 50 years and that’s what student nurses were doing, I 
was one of them. It would be interesting to know if patients’ mortality rate 
improved when this practice was replaced by insisting nurses get a degree first.

• The Brexit aide’s notes mention having cake, eating it and “French likely to 
be most difficult” (Caught on camera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/29/brexit-leak-downing-street-papers-caught-on-camera>
, G2, 30 November). Understandable really, they’ve got history with cake.

• I was encouraged to read that scientists reported that playing tennis can 
result in a 47% reduced risk of death (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/29/health-racquet-tennis-is-ace-at-reducing-risk-of-death-study-suggests>
, 30 November). I had always worried that it was 100% – new balls please!

• Apparently the new fivers are 20% pony and 1% monkey (Petition calls for end
