And that, ladies and gentlemen, is your lot, on a day which saw the shock 
departure of two major names. Simona Halep was sent packing by the qualifier 
Zhang Shuai 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/19/simona-halep-out-australian-open-zhang-shuai>
, while Fernando Verdasco overcame a wilting Rafael Nadal. There was an 
emotional victory for Lleyton Hewitt, as he embarks on his valedictory campaign 
as a professional, and a stunning comeback by Viktor Troicki in a battle where 
10 match points were shared. If the rest of the 2016 Australian Open lives up 
to this, we’ll be in for a cracker.

Azarenka wraps up her double bagel: 6-0, 6-0. Poor Alison van Uytvanck. It’s 
safe to say she’ll have better days. But she was up against a double champion 
who missed next to nothing today, and allows herself a wry smile as the pair 
shake hands at the net. A 52-minute rout has been completed without fuss, and 
that’s a statement victory. The rest of the field will take note.

The crowd on Rod Laver erupt as Van Uytvanck stays in a long rally and forces 
a rare error from Azarenka. She nets, and it’s deuce. The Belgian hits a brave 
deep second serve to shock Azarenka into hitting long. There’s the sort of 
cheer that usually meets the winning of a set. She hasn’t even won the game! 
And sure enough it’s still not enough. Two blistering cross-court winners earns 
another break point for Azarenka. Van Uytvanck hits a big first-serve out wide. 
Azarenka can only hoick it back into the middle. Van Uytvank, at the net, can’t 
get it over, smashing lamely down towards her own feet. The crowd fall silent. 
The scoreline is embarrassing enough; mistakes like that, utterly 
understandable in the circumstances, are hard to watch.

A point for Van Uytvanck: Azarenka’s second double fault of the match. 
Otherwise, it’s 4-0.

Azarenka is relentless. She opens the second set with another break, holds on 
to her own serve effortlessly, then breaks again to love. Poor Uytvanck has no 
answers. We’ll be done here very soon.

Troicki goes 40-0 up. But de la Nava isn’t giving up, and a couple of deep 
forehands save match points six and seven! But it’s eighth time lucky for the 
Serb, who has completed a stunning comeback here. Munoz de la Nava was two sets 
up, had two match points of his own in set four, but still hasn’t tasted 
victory at a major championship. Heartbreak for him, but what a match. The 21st 
seed avoids the fate of Nadal and Halep. This has been a marvellous day of 
tennis all right.

Viktor Troicki goes very, very, very, very, very close to completing his 
stunning comeback over Daniel Munoz de la Nava. He’s a break up, 5-2, in the 
fifth. He’s 0-40 up on de la Nava’s serve. But the Spaniard saves all three of 
those match points, then another two. And finally holds his serve! The Spaniard 
had two match points in the fourth set for his first-ever victory at a slam, 
but couldn’t convert. Now the Serb has given up five of his own! He’ll still be 
serving for the match, though.

After 24 minutes of embarrassingly one-sided play, Azarenka closes out the 
first set 6-0.Van Uytvanck raised her game towards the end of the set, but the 
damage had already been done, with Azarenka totally in the groove.

Azarenka holds her serve to move 4-0 up, but then Van Uytvanck finally begins 
to compete.She moves 40-0 up on her own serve. Azarenka drags her back to 
deuce. The Belgian youngster earns another game point with an exquisite lob 
over a net-charging opponent, but she’s unable to convert, and a golden chance 
to get on the board slips by. She’s 5-0 down and this match may not eat up too 
much of our time.

The fastest of fast starts for the two-time champion. Azarenka powers her way 
to an early double break, and before ten minutes are on the clock, she’s 3-0 
up. Meanwhile it’s going with serve on Show Court 2 between Munoz de la Nava 
and Troicki. It’s 2-2. That’s fast turning into an epic of Cecil B DeMille 
proportions.

How will Daniel Munoz de la Nava be feeling now? He had a match point over 
Viktor Troicki not so long ago, but has just lost the fourth-set tie-break 7-4. 
It’s two sets apiece, the Serbian coming from two down, and the No21 seed must 
now be hot favourite with all the momentum against a player who has never 
tasted victory on the biggest stages. It doesn’t look as though Troicki will be 
joining Nadal and Halep on today’s scrapheap. So there’s just the one big game 
left today: 14th seed Victoria Azarenka, the winner here in 2012 and 2013, 
takes on Alison Van Uytvanck. That’s coming up soon. But right now - and I’ll 
be back in a few minutes - it’s time for:

Wawrinka wraps up the second set, 6-3, to move two sets up. But what a 
terrible shame: Tursunov has withdrawn injured, the fourth seed through without 
needing to complete his match. It wasn’t so long ago the big Russian was a 
point away from the first set. But it’s all unravelled pretty quickly for him.

Hewitt wraps up the win! Duckworth stiffs a forehand wide left of the 
sideline, and he faces three match points. The first is saved, but he can do 
nothing with the second, Hewitt drawing his man to the net, then lobbing him 
exquisitely. What a way to win! Hewitt records a 7-6, 6-2, 6-4 victory, and 
sets up a second-round clash with David Ferrer. He’ll not be retiring until 
Thursday at the very earliest. A warm embrace between the two players at the 
net, mutual respect the top note. “It’s not like the last round of a football 
season when you know after that match at the end. Playing Ducks, who I’ve tried 
to help over the last few years, that was really awkward. Once I got into the 
match, it was OK. The crowd ... it doesn’t get any better. This is what I’m 
going to miss the most.”

Over on Show Court 2, Munoz de la Nava had a match point on Troicki’s serve. 
He couldn’t take it, and they’re still on serve, 5-5 in the fourth with the 
unsung Spaniard 2-1 up in sets. Meanwhile back on Laver, Duckworth has quickly 
slipped 0-30 down on his serve. Hewitt is two points from victory!

Hewitt wins a no-fuss game to take the lead in the third set, 5-4. Duckworth 
must hold his serve to stay in the championship. Games have been going to serve 
on Margaret Court: it’s now 5-3 to Wawrinka, who will serve to take the second 
set. And a result on Court 8: Lukas Rosol has beaten Taro Daniel 7-6, 7-5, 5-7, 
6-7, 6-1.

Hewitt retrieves a fine Duckworth drop shot, flipping an exquisite chip over 
his opponent’s head to land the ball on the baseline. Duckworth nearly keeps an 
absurd rally going with a between-the-legs flick, but not quite. A highly 
entertaining point sets Hewitt off on the right track in Duckworth’s service 
game, and upon winning a patient baseline rally - finally mixing it up with a 
drop shot of his own that his opponent can’t chase down - he’s got two break 
points. Duckworth saves the first. But then he doubles rather meekly - I 
suppose there’s no other way to double - and we’re back on serve in this third 
set. Hewitt is suddenly two games from victory at 4-4.

Five deuces in a nine-minute game, and finally Tursunov is on the board in the 
second set.But at what cost? That’ll have taken a lot out of the Russian and 
it’s still 3-1 to Wawrinka, who is winning 86% of points on his first serve. An 
easy hold for Wawrinka, and he’s built up a three-game cushion in the set once 
more. Back on Rod Laver, Duckworth holds, then threatens to break Hewitt again, 
taking the older man to deuce. But Hewitt digs in to keep this third set 
competitive at 4-3. He punches the air, knowing how important that could be.

And so Troicki breaks back. Forget I said anything. Meanwhile Duckworth saves 
a couple of break points in a mini epic of a service game against Hewitt. It’s 
now 3-2 to the younger Australian in that third set on Rod Laver, and he’s a 
break up, but of course is two sets down overall. This has the potential to 
turn into a rather fascinating battle should Duckworth close this set out.

Daniel Munoz de la Nava could have just delivered the fatal blow to Viktor 
Troicki on Show Court 2. The veteran Spanish journeyman, having gone two sets 
up against the No21 seed, appeared to have lost all momentum upon being crushed 
6-1 in the third set. But he’s just broken the Serbian to move 4-2 up in the 
fourth, and is two games away from his first-ever win at a grand slam!

The anti-climatic end to the first-set tie-break on Margaret Court has done 
for Tursunov, it would seem. In double-quick time, he’s fallen 3-0 behind in 
the second set, broken once aleady. Wawrinka, who was a point away from losing 
that first set, is suddenly pulling away from his opponent.

What a rally this is! Hewitt is 15-40 down on his serve. He saves one break 
point, then another, winning a 23-shot rally, the pair trading huge forehands, 
finding corner after corner, until Duckworth attempts a drop shot that’s never 
good enough. Hewitt dispatches it with some vigour, and looks to have saved the 
day. But he nets a simple forehand, then gifts the break to his opponent with a 
miserable double fault. Duckworth, who was letting this game get away from him, 
is suddenly ahead in this set, 2-1 and with his service game to come. Hewitt is 
beyond livid.

Tursunov held onto Wawrinka like a limpet during that first set. But he’s 
simply blown away in the tie-break, the 2014 champion taking it 7-2. That might 
prove a crushing blow to the Russian’s spirit, as he contests his first 
grand-slam match since the 2014 US Open. Meanwhile Troicki is on the comeback 
trail against Munoz de la Nava. He’s run through the third set, 6-1, and 
they’re on serve in the early stages of the fourth. And Hewitt holds his serve 
in the opening game of the third set against Duckworth. His young opponent, the 
tide against him, needs to hold his own, or this match could be over quite 
soon. Despite going 0-15 and 15-30 down, he keeps his nerve and draws level in 
the set.

Trebor’s Wawrinka gets himself out of a self-dug hole. He’s serving to stay in 
the set against Tursunov. At 30-30, he balloons a simple cross-court forehand 
long, and faces set point. But three big serves later, and he’s out of jail. 
It’ll be a tie break.

On Rod Laver, Hewitt wins the second set by breaking Duckworth again. The 
winning point is an astonishing get, Duckworth pushing the ball out to the 
right corner for what looks like a surefire winner, Hewitt stranded on the 
advantage side of his court. But Hewitt scrambles across at speed, staying low 
to hook a full-stretch forehand up the right-hand sideline for the win! He’s 
two sets up, 7-6, 6-2, and doesn’t look to be in any mood to retire quite yet.

Wawrinka is in fancy dress today, having come as a stick of retro 
confectionery. From top to bottom: neon pink, neon orange, neon yellow, neon 
pink, neon yellow, neon pink. Tursunov momentarily feels as sick as a child 
from the 1970s: a Wawrinka mishit from the baseline, off the frame, somehow 
loops over the Russian and in. Break point. Wawrinka can’t convert that one, or 
the next, or the next. His chance has gone, and Tursunov eventually closes out 
a nine-minute game. Wawrinka will have to serve to stay in the set and take us 
to a tie-breaker.

We’re not on serve on Rod Laver any more. Hewitt, already a set to the good 
against Duckworth, looks to take proper control of the match by breaking in the 
fourth game. A solid service game follows, and he leads 4-1, well on the way to 
a two-set lead. Meanwhile it’s still on serve in the first set between Tursunov 
and Wawrinka - the Russian leads 5-4 - though the Swiss had two break points in 
Tursunov’s last service game, but didn’t make any impression with either, a 
particularly lame backhand return spurning one of the chances.

We’re still on serve on Rod Laver. Duckworth holds, then Hewitt makes it 2-1 
in some style, pushing his opponent to the corner, then smashing away a return 
that had come down with snow on it. We’re still on serve on Margaret Court, 
Wawrinka and Tursanov having shared the first six games of the first set. And 
Jack Sock of the USA, the No25 seed, has won a Homeric and rather topsy-turvy 
tussle with his young compatriot Taylor Fritz, 6-4, 3-6, 0-6, 6-3, 6-4.

Another shock is brewing, this time on Show Court 2, where the Spanish 
journeyman Daniel Muñoz De La Nava has just gone two sets up against Viktor 
Troicki, 6-4, 6-4.The No21 seed, who has never got past the third round here, 
has it all to do against a player who has never won a match at a grand-slam 
tournament. After the heroics of Zhang earlier, could another player be ready 
to break their major-championship duck?

In other home-favourite news, and as those following the GBG 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/jan/19/bernard-tomic-vs-denis-istomin-round-one-of-the-australian-open>
 will know, Bernard Tomic beat Denis Istomin 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. On the 
Margaret Court Arena, the 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka is out and about: he 
faces Dmitry Tursunov, and that one’s with serve at the moment, 2-1 to the 
Russian in the very early stages. And back on Rod Laver, Hewitt wins the first 
game of the second set, holding his serve easily enough.

Hewitt nets Duckworth’s weak second serve, a chance spurned. And then another 
lame forehand into the net. It’s 5-4 to Duckworth and the pressure’s on 
Hewitt’s serve now as we reach the business end of the tie-break. It’s not 
looking good for the old chap as he struggles to stay in a long rally, but a 
glorious forehand down the advantage side saves his service point. And then 
Duckworth looks like winning the next rally, but an unlucky net cord does for 
him. Set point to Hewitt, and he takes it, grinding his man down, Duckworth 
eventually netting. Hewitt goes a set up, 7-6, after 55 minutes of honest toil. 
The crowd enjoyed that.

The first mini-break of the tie-break goes to Hewitt. A crashing forehand to 
the corner, followed up at the net, puts too much pressure on Duckworth. The 
next four points go to serve. All the cheers reserved for the old boy Hewitt, 
which is a shame for young Duckworth, but such is life, and this is where we 
are. It’s 3-2 to Hewitt, and he’s serving the next two points. The following 
point is a wonderful rally, Hewitt pushing Duckworth to the corners, Duckworth 
defending brilliantly. But he’s eventually wrong-footed by a lovely whipped 
cross-court winner, and Hewitt screams a COME ON! to the heavens. The crowd 
definitely on his side. But Duckworth finds a corner of his own to earn the 
mini-break back. We’re on serve again, at 4-3 to Hewitt, Duckworth about to 
toss it up.

A couple of standard holds, first by Duckworth, then by Hewitt, and we’re into 
a first-set tie-breaker. Sabine Lisicki made it through to the second round 
without too much drama, by the way. She beat Petra Cetkovska 6-4, 6-4.

Back on Rod Laver, it’s the all-Australian encounter between two-time major 
winner and erstwhile world No1Lleyton Hewitt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lleyton-hewitt>, and James Duckworth. Hewitt 
- who will retire after this championship - was serving for the first set, but 
this has been a hard-fought battle, and Duckworth breaks with a delicious 
forehand through the deuce court. It’s 5-5.

It’s emotional all right on Margaret Court Arena. It’s pointed out to Zhang 
that she’s just won her first match at a grand slam event, and this brilliant 
qualifier breaks down herself. If you’re watching this, and you’re not welling 
up now, oh your stony heart. She’s given all the time she needs to compose 
herself. She’s earned every second. “To win against the top-two player, I’m so 
excited. I’d like to thank my coach and my parents, thank you. Today is the 
best moment in my career. Thank you to Simona, who is a great player. Thank you 
to everybody.” This has been quite a day in Melbourne. Astonishing.

In the second huge shock of the day, the qualifier Zhang Shuai beats second 
seed Simona Halep!It’s an astonishing straight-sets victory by a player who has 
never won a match at a major championship before: 6-4, 6-3. And it was wholly 
deserved! She relentlessly found the corners and the lines, moving the helpless 
Halep around the court at will. For a while, it looked as though the enormity 
of the situation would overwhelm Zhang in that second set, but she bounced back 
stronger than ever. The Margaret Court Arena erupts in honour: this was all 
about Zhang’s brilliance, because Halep didn’t play particularly badly. 
Astonishing scenes. In the crowd, Zhang’s coach is in a state of serene bliss, 
staring straight ahead in shock, tears of joy running down his cheeks. That’s a 
beautiful moment.

Halep isn’t going down without a fight. Now it’s the Romanian’s turn to move 
her opponent around the court, and having pushed Zhang wide, she whips a 
glorious forehand to win the first point. But Zhang pearls a two-handed passing 
shot down the left-hand side of the court. 15-15. Halep then weakly nets twice. 
Zhang has two match points!

Zhang finds a couple of corners, and goes 0-30 up on Halep’s serve. This 
intense pressure is telling on Halep, who flaps at a simple forehand, sending 
it well wide. Three break points. Zhang moves her this way and that. Halep 
nets. Zhang breaks! She’ll be serving to beat the world number two!

And we’re back on serve in the Margaret Court Arena! Three games in a row for 
Zhang! She holds her serve to stay within touching distance in the set, then 
wears Halep down with some patient baseline rallies to break back. A bit of 
old-school serve and volley helps Zhang win her next service game, and she’s 
4-3 up in the second set. It looked as though Zhang had unravelled, but she’s 
pulled it all back together without fuss, and suddenly Halep is in serious 
trouble here.

Andy Murray’s easy first-round win over the young German Alexander Zverev has 
set up a second-round match with home favourite and 67th seed Sam Groth. Cue 
some good-natured banter  patter. Murray’s wife Kim is due to give birth to the 
couple’s first child in mid February, with the player insisting that he’ll be 
off home if she goes into labour early, no matter what stage the Aussie Open’s 
at. “Be nice if his wife went into labour overnight,” Groth joked. “I might be 
just cheering for that one.” Groth beat France’s Adrian Mannarino 7-6, 6-4, 
3-6, 6-3 earlier today, recording 27 aces and the fastest serve at the 
tournament so far (235 kph) along the way. Groth, who has never played Murray, 
is hoping for another boom-boom performance in the second round. “Hopefully I 
will serve well and it doesn’t come back. I’m going to take it to him. It 
doesn’t really change too much. I’m going to serve big and try to get forward 
and play aggressively. But it’s tough. Number two seed and two in the world. 
He’s a quality player. He’s where he is for a reason. I’ve got nothing to lose.”

But suddenly a few doubts flicker across Zhang’s mind. Halep steps up the 
pace, breaks her opponent, then consolidates the lead with an easy service 
game. In double-quick time, it’s 3-1 to the second seed in the second set.

When you’re hot, you’re hot. Zhang, the pedal pressed to the floor, no point 
letting up now, wins the opening game of the second set to love. Easy. Halep 
has some serious thinking to do here. The first ace of the match earns the 
Romanian the second game of the set. No quarter given by either player here. 
Zhang’s had to earn the lead in this fascinating match.

The shock’s back on! You could forgive a 27-year-old qualifier for buckling 
after passing up on set point against the number two seed then losing her 
serve. But two screaming two-handed passes down the line, followed by a 
glorious cross-court winner, and Zhang breaks Halep again to claim the first 
set 6-4! A major upset is on the cards here. Hold on, let me rephrase that: 
another major upset is on the cards here. Oh Rafa, what have you started? A 
long way to go, of course. But Zhang is playing the game of her life here. 
She’s never won a match at a major tournament. Now she’s a set away from glory.

Fernando Verdasco’s fifth-set evisceration of Rafael Nadal, dispatching the 
men’s fifth seed from the tournament, is undoubtedly the story of the day.But 
could another big shock be brewing in the women’s? The second seed Simona Halep 
is a break down in the first set to Chinese qualifier Shuai Zhang. Ah hold on, 
maybe not. Zhang blinked at set point, hitting a simple forehand miles long, 
and Halep’s broken back. They’re on serve again, though Halep has to hold to 
stay in the set. It’s 5-4 to Zhang.

A fairly fuss-free route into the second-round hat for ninth seed Karolina 
Pliskova.She beat Kimberly Birrell 6-4, 6-4. The 15th seed Madison Keys was 
taken to a tie-break in the first set against Zarina Diyas, but won that and 
swatted her opponent aside in the second to register an ultimately easy 7-6, 
6-1 victory. And the number three seed Garbine Muguruza made light work of 
Anett Kontaveit, the 2015 Wimbledon finalist winning 6-0. 6-4 in an hour on Rod

An easy win for David Ferrer. The grinding Spaniard, the Cliff Thorburn of 
tennis, has eased past Peter Gojowczyk 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. And here’s another 
one-sided Spanish affair: Feliciano Lopez has dumped one-time British number 
two Dan Evans out, that one ending in a 6-1 6-0 6-4 thrashing. The 25-year-old 
Evans battled his way through three rounds of qualifying to get to the main 
event, but he was gone within 88 minutes. A tough business.

Other matches are available, of course. And right now, on the Hisense Arena, 
home favourite Bernard Tomic made a meal of serving for the third set against 
Denis Istomin. Quickly 0-40 down, he retrieved the situation with a series of 
big serves followed up by huge forehands into the corner. Some weak 
serve-and-volley nonsense gifted Istomin a fourth break point: saved. A 
flashing cross-court forehand earns Istomin a fifth. But that one’s saved as 
well, and Tomic only needs one set point to convert. He puts it away, wins the 
third set 6-4, and leads 2-1. We’ve got this one Game By Game: like a pint of 
plain, Russell Jackson is your only man.

A momentarily tetchy Nadal slams his rackets back into his bag as he prepares 
to vacate the court, but he doesn’t even have the energy to sustain any anger. 
His head drops, and he mopes off in the throes of misery. Such a shame there 
had to be a loser after a fantastic match, and the departure of a very popular 
star will tug a few heart-strings this morning/afternoon/evening/night. But the 
result was totally right: Verdasco was simply brilliant in those final 
exchanges, blowing his more storied compatriot off the court. Verdasco’s 
interviewed on Rod Laver in the wake of this famous victory, although not 
before munching his way quickly through a banana. “Sorry. I need to eat. If 
not, I’m dead!” Much laughter from the stands. He then explains his victory. “I 
just hit everything. I just started hitting winners. I don’t know how. I closed 
my eyes and everything started dropping in, so I kept doing it! I started 
coming in, started to be aggressive, and I’m so happy. A win against Rafa is an 
unbelievable feeling.”

Nadal is out! Verdasco wins 7-6, 4-6, 3-6, 7-6, 6-2! Nadal ostentatiously 
springs about like Tigger, but nobody’s really convinced. He’s running on 
reserves. But he’s given a helping hand by Verdasco, who fails to put away a 
short and slow second serve. Nadal takes succour and a big serve gives him a 
30-0 lead. Verdasco’s forehand makes it 30-15. And then another cross-court 
stunner! It’s 30-30! Nadal shovels a poor shot out of play on the right, and 
it’s match point to Verdasco. And he takes it first time, blowing his 
compatriot away with a stunning cross-court winner. This is Nadal’s 44th 
appearance in a major tournament, and he’s only previously lost in the first 
round once, against Steve Darcis at Wimbledon in 2013. Nadal was certainly not 
at his best - in fact during that final set he looked totally spent - but in 
fairness nobody could have lived with Verdasco in those final six games, when 
the Spaniard put his foot on the gas and blew his compatriot away with a series 
of blistering cross-court forehands. Wow.

This match has now been going for over four-and-a-half hours. Water! Some 
water over here! Nadal looks utterly spent, knackered and jiggered. He looks 
leggy, and irritated to boot. He doesn’t have the energy to put any pressure on 
Verdasco’s serve, and in quick-smart time it’s 5-2 to Verdasco. That’s five 
games in a row for the underdog. He was a break down in this set! It’s one hell 
of a performance, and he’s got Nadal in all sorts of trouble now. Unless Nadal 
pulls something special out of the bag, he’s about to lose for the first time 
in the opening round at Melbourne.

Nadal looks in serious bother on his own serve at 15-30, Verdasco creaming a 
return down the line, putting his opponent on the back foot.But Nadal scampers 
and digs out a return, then benefits from a fortunate net cord that sends 
Verdasco’s forehand whistling out of play. But he’s making a meal of this. A 
sixth double-fault of the match gifts Verdasco a break point. Nadal saves that 
with a Big Serve to bring the game to deuce. But then another break point, as 
Nadal’s beaten all ends up by a glorious whipped cross-court forehand. 
Advantage Verdasco. This is a huge point! And Verdasco makes it four games in a 
row, breaking Nadal by crashing a return back to the 2009 champ’s feet. Nadal 
can only shank the ball miles out to the left, and it’s 4-2 in this final set 
to Verdasco. He’s serving to take control of this match as we reach the 
business end.Fifth set: Nadal 2-4 Verdasco.

Verdasco earns himself a break point in the fourth game of the final set, 
leaping on a weak Nadal second serve at 30-30 to cream a forehand down the line.
Nadal saves himself with a cross-court winner, but then faces another break 
point as Verdasco whips a second serve to the corner, Nadal with no answer. And 
he breaks back, though in the flukiest of circumstances, hitting one off the 
frame of his racket, the ball flying hysterically off to the right but somehow 
dropping on the right-hand line. All angles seemingly impossible, but there you 
go. Verdasco holds his hands up to apologise, and has the good grace to look 
incredibly sheepish. Still, he earned his luck there. We’re back on serve in 
this dramatic fifth set! And soon enough, it’s three games in a row for 
Verdasco, as a few big boomers earns an easy service game to love.Fifth set: 
Nadal 2-3 Verdasco.

Nicolas Mahut of France has made it through to the next round. He went a set 
down to Marco Cecchinato of Italy, but then slipped into gear, winning the next 
three sets with relative ease, the match finishing in just over two hours: 4-6, 
6-2, 6-2, 6-2. He’ll face his fellow French star Gael Monfils in the second 
round.

Back on Rod Laver, the chances of a big shock are receding fast. Nadal has 
upped the tempo against Verdasco, breaking his compatriot in the first game of 
the fifth set, then quickly making it to 2-0. Verdasco looks good to get on the 
board with his next service game, but a couple of big points from Nadal earns 
another break point. He appears to be wearing Verdasco down. However! Three 
booming aces in a row rescues the situation for Verdasco. He’s still a break 
down, but at least he’s on the board. This match isn’t quite finished yet. 
Nadal leads 2-1.

Let’s step away from the drama on Rod Laver for a minute  while I get my 
bearings to catch up with some other news. And please allow me to cram the 
ill-fitting hat of base jingoism onto my confused noggin. For it’s been a fine 
second day for the Brits. On any normal day, the big news in that respect would 
be the serene progress to the second round of perennial bridesmaid Andy Murray: 
the 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 finalisteased past Alexander Zverev in three 
sets, dropping just six games along the way, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/19/andy-murray-downs-zverev-could-be-a-force-again-in-australian-open>
. But all the plaudits today must go to Britain’s other number-one player, 
Johanna Konta. The 24-year-old has made some debut in Melbourne, seeing off the 
2003 finalist and eighth seed Venus Williams in commanding fashion: 6-4, 6-2. 
Konta’s picked a fine place for this statement victory: she was born in Sydney 
and competed for Australia until 2012. So hats off to her, in more ways than 
one.

It’s 2-2 in sets! Verdasco bangs his two service points away without much 
fuss. He’s 5-2 up in the tie-break. A deep high-kicking Nadal serve makes it 
5-3. And then it’s 5-4, though Verdasco had the chance, meeting a weak second 
serve, to flash a cross-court winner away. Too long. But he’s still got two 
service points of his own to put this set away. Verdasco whips deep to win the 
first. Then booms a huge ace down the middle to secure the set! Verdasco showed 
nerves of steel in that tie-break having fluffed his lines while earlier 
serving for the set. He’s levelled it up against the fifth seed and 2009 champ! 
We’re over the four-hour mark in this match already, and we’re going the 
distance.Nadal v Verdasco: 6-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-7.

Verdasco wins the first pointo to go a mini-break up, returning serve right at 
Nadal’s feet, then finding the corners with metronomic regularity. Nadal’s 
always on the back foot and eventually a Verdasco winner’s crashed away at the 
net. We’re back on serve immediately, Verdasco netting weakly. But then two 
huge booming winners for the underdog on Nadal’s serve, and Verdasco is 
suddenly in control of this tie-break at 3-2 up with his two service points to 
come. He should see this one out. But then again he was serving for the set 
earlier, and look what happened there.

What Happens Here Then dept. Loose play from Verdasco. He falls 0-30 down and 
it looks like his challenge in this set - and this championship - is 
unravelling from a very promising position. But under intense pressure, he 
flashes a cross-court forehand into the corner, and regains a little momentum. 
It’s 6-6 in the fourth set, and we’re going to a tie break.

Good morning, afternoon, evening and night, everyone. Anyone for tennis? Sure 
you are. There’s been plenty of big news already today at Melbourne, but more 
of that anon. For right now Rafael Nadal has got himself in a bit of the old
Tennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Bother. He’s 2-1 up in sets 
on Fernando Verdasco, but found himself a break down in the fourth. Verdasco 
was serving for the set, but flashed a wild forehand out of play to gift Nadal 
the break. Now Nadal’s held his own serve to lead 6-5, but a Verdasco hold will 
take this to a tie-break. Let’s see what happens here, then.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is your lot, on a day which saw the shock 
departure of two major names. Simona Halep was sent packing by the qualifier 
Zhang Shuai

, while Fernando Verdasco overcame a wilting Rafael Nadal. There was an 
emotional victory for Lleyton Hewitt, as he embarks on his valedictory campaign 
as a professional, and a stunning comeback by Viktor Troicki in a battle where 
10 match points were shared. If the rest of the 2016 Australian Open lives up 
to this, we’ll be in for a cracker.

Azarenka wraps up her double bagel: 6-0, 6-0. Poor Alison van Uytvanck. It’s 
safe to say she’ll have better days. But she was up against a double champion 
who missed next to nothing today, and allows herself a wry smile as the pair 
shake hands at the net. A 52-minute rout has been completed without fuss, and 
that’s a statement victory. The rest of the field will take note.

The crowd on Rod Laver erupt as Van Uytvanck stays in a long rally and forces 
a rare error from Azarenka. She nets, and it’s deuce. The Belgian hits a brave 
deep second serve to shock Azarenka into hitting long. There’s the sort of 
cheer that usually meets the winning of a set. She hasn’t even won the game! 
And sure enough it’s still not enough. Two blistering cross-court winners earns 
another break point for Azarenka. Van Uytvanck hits a big first-serve out wide. 
Azarenka can only hoick it back into the middle. Van Uytvank, at the net, can’t 
get it over, smashing lamely down towards her own feet. The crowd fall silent. 
The scoreline is embarrassing enough; mistakes like that, utterly 
understandable in the circumstances, are hard to watch.
 
A point for Van Uytvanck: Azarenka’s second double fault of the match. 
Otherwise, it’s 4-0.
 
Azarenka is relentless. She opens the second set with another break, holds on 
to her own serve effortlessly, then breaks again to love. Poor Uytvanck has no 
answers. We’ll be done here very soon.
 
Troicki goes 40-0 up. But de la Nava isn’t giving up, and a couple of deep 
forehands save match points six and seven! But it’s eighth time lucky for the 
Serb, who has completed a stunning comeback here. Munoz de la Nava was two sets 
up, had two match points of his own in set four, but still hasn’t tasted 
victory at a major championship. Heartbreak for him, but what a match. The 21st 
seed avoids the fate of Nadal and Halep. This has been a marvellous day of 
tennis all right.
 
Viktor Troicki goes very, very, very, very, very close to completing his 
stunning comeback over Daniel Munoz de la Nava. He’s a break up, 5-2, in the 
fifth. He’s 0-40 up on de la Nava’s serve. But the Spaniard saves all three of 
those match points, then another two. And finally holds his serve! The Spaniard 
had two match points in the fourth set for his first-ever victory at a slam, 
but couldn’t convert. Now the Serb has given up five of his own! He’ll still be 
serving for the match, though.
 
After 24 minutes of embarrassingly one-sided play, Azarenka closes out the 
first set 6-0.Van Uytvanck raised her game towards the end of the set, but the 
damage had already been done, with Azarenka totally in the groove.

Azarenka holds her serve to move 4-0 up, but then Van Uytvanck finally begins 
to compete.She moves 40-0 up on her own serve. Azarenka drags her back to 
deuce. The Belgian youngster earns another game point with an exquisite lob 
over a net-charging opponent, but she’s unable to convert, and a golden chance 
to get on the board slips by. She’s 5-0 down and this match may not eat up too 
much of our time.
 
The fastest of fast starts for the two-time champion. Azarenka powers her way 
to an early double break, and before ten minutes are on the clock, she’s 3-0 
up. Meanwhile it’s going with serve on Show Court 2 between Munoz de la Nava 
and Troicki. It’s 2-2. That’s fast turning into an epic of Cecil B DeMille 
proportions.
 
How will Daniel Munoz de la Nava be feeling now? He had a match point over 
Viktor Troicki not so long ago, but has just lost the fourth-set tie-break 7-4. 
It’s two sets apiece, the Serbian coming from two down, and the No21 seed must 
now be hot favourite with all the momentum against a player who has never 
tasted victory on the biggest stages. It doesn’t look as though Troicki will be 
joining Nadal and Halep on today’s scrapheap. So there’s just the one big game 
left today: 14th seed Victoria Azarenka, the winner here in 2012 and 2013, 
takes on Alison Van Uytvanck. That’s coming up soon. But right now - and I’ll 
be back in a few minutes - it’s time for:

Wawrinka wraps up the second set, 6-3, to move two sets up. But what a 
terrible shame: Tursunov has withdrawn injured, the fourth seed through without 
needing to complete his match. It wasn’t so long ago the big Russian was a 
point away from the first set. But it’s all unravelled pretty quickly for him.

Hewitt wraps up the win! Duckworth stiffs a forehand wide left of the 
sideline, and he faces three match points. The first is saved, but he can do 
nothing with the second, Hewitt drawing his man to the net, then lobbing him 
exquisitely. What a way to win! Hewitt records a 7-6, 6-2, 6-4 victory, and 
sets up a second-round clash with David Ferrer. He’ll not be retiring until 
Thursday at the very earliest. A warm embrace between the two players at the 
net, mutual respect the top note. “It’s not like the last round of a football 
season when you know after that match at the end. Playing Ducks, who I’ve tried 
to help over the last few years, that was really awkward. Once I got into the 
match, it was OK. The crowd ... it doesn’t get any better. This is what I’m 
going to miss the most.”

Over on Show Court 2, Munoz de la Nava had a match point on Troicki’s serve. 
He couldn’t take it, and they’re still on serve, 5-5 in the fourth with the 
unsung Spaniard 2-1 up in sets. Meanwhile back on Laver, Duckworth has quickly 
slipped 0-30 down on his serve. Hewitt is two points from victory!
 
Hewitt wins a no-fuss game to take the lead in the third set, 5-4. Duckworth 
must hold his serve to stay in the championship. Games have been going to serve 
on Margaret Court: it’s now 5-3 to Wawrinka, who will serve to take the second 
set. And a result on Court 8: Lukas Rosol has beaten Taro Daniel 7-6, 7-5, 5-7, 
6-7, 6-1.
 
Hewitt retrieves a fine Duckworth drop shot, flipping an exquisite chip over 
his opponent’s head to land the ball on the baseline. Duckworth nearly keeps an 
absurd rally going with a between-the-legs flick, but not quite. A highly 
entertaining point sets Hewitt off on the right track in Duckworth’s service 
game, and upon winning a patient baseline rally - finally mixing it up with a 
drop shot of his own that his opponent can’t chase down - he’s got two break 
points. Duckworth saves the first. But then he doubles rather meekly - I 
suppose there’s no other way to double - and we’re back on serve in this third 
set. Hewitt is suddenly two games from victory at 4-4.
 
Five deuces in a nine-minute game, and finally Tursunov is on the board in the 
second set.But at what cost? That’ll have taken a lot out of the Russian and 
it’s still 3-1 to Wawrinka, who is winning 86% of points on his first serve. An 
easy hold for Wawrinka, and he’s built up a three-game cushion in the set once 
more. Back on Rod Laver, Duckworth holds, then threatens to break Hewitt again, 
taking the older man to deuce. But Hewitt digs in to keep this third set 
competitive at 4-3. He punches the air, knowing how important that could be.

And so Troicki breaks back. Forget I said anything. Meanwhile Duckworth saves 
a couple of break points in a mini epic of a service game against Hewitt. It’s 
now 3-2 to the younger Australian in that third set on Rod Laver, and he’s a 
break up, but of course is two sets down overall. This has the potential to 
turn into a rather fascinating battle should Duckworth close this set out.
 
Daniel Munoz de la Nava could have just delivered the fatal blow to Viktor 
Troicki on Show Court 2. The veteran Spanish journeyman, having gone two sets 
up against the No21 seed, appeared to have lost all momentum upon being crushed 
6-1 in the third set. But he’s just broken the Serbian to move 4-2 up in the 
fourth, and is two games away from his first-ever win at a grand slam!
 
The anti-climatic end to the first-set tie-break on Margaret Court has done 
for Tursunov, it would seem. In double-quick time, he’s fallen 3-0 behind in 
the second set, broken once aleady. Wawrinka, who was a point away from losing 
that first set, is suddenly pulling away from his opponent.
 
What a rally this is! Hewitt is 15-40 down on his serve. He saves one break 
point, then another, winning a 23-shot rally, the pair trading huge forehands, 
finding corner after corner, until Duckworth attempts a drop shot that’s never 
good enough. Hewitt dispatches it with some vigour, and looks to have saved the 
day. But he nets a simple forehand, then gifts the break to his opponent with a 
miserable double fault. Duckworth, who was letting this game get away from him, 
is suddenly ahead in this set, 2-1 and with his service game to come. Hewitt is 
beyond livid.

Tursunov held onto Wawrinka like a limpet during that first set. But he’s 
simply blown away in the tie-break, the 2014 champion taking it 7-2. That might 
prove a crushing blow to the Russian’s spirit, as he contests his first 
grand-slam match since the 2014 US Open. Meanwhile Troicki is on the comeback 
trail against Munoz de la Nava. He’s run through the third set, 6-1, and 
they’re on serve in the early stages of the fourth. And Hewitt holds his serve 
in the opening game of the third set against Duckworth. His young opponent, the 
tide against him, needs to hold his own, or this match could be over quite 
soon. Despite going 0-15 and 15-30 down, he keeps his nerve and draws level in 
the set.
 
Trebor’s Wawrinka gets himself out of a self-dug hole. He’s serving to stay in 
the set against Tursunov. At 30-30, he balloons a simple cross-court forehand 
long, and faces set point. But three big serves later, and he’s out of jail. 
It’ll be a tie break.
 
On Rod Laver, Hewitt wins the second set by breaking Duckworth again. The 
winning point is an astonishing get, Duckworth pushing the ball out to the 
right corner for what looks like a surefire winner, Hewitt stranded on the 
advantage side of his court. But Hewitt scrambles across at speed, staying low 
to hook a full-stretch forehand up the right-hand sideline for the win! He’s 
two sets up, 7-6, 6-2, and doesn’t look to be in any mood to retire quite yet.
 
Wawrinka is in fancy dress today, having come as a stick of retro 
confectionery. From top to bottom: neon pink, neon orange, neon yellow, neon 
pink, neon yellow, neon pink. Tursunov momentarily feels as sick as a child 
from the 1970s: a Wawrinka mishit from the baseline, off the frame, somehow 
loops over the Russian and in. Break point. Wawrinka can’t convert that one, or 
the next, or the next. His chance has gone, and Tursunov eventually closes out 
a nine-minute game. Wawrinka will have to serve to stay in the set and take us 
to a tie-breaker.

We’re not on serve on Rod Laver any more. Hewitt, already a set to the good 
against Duckworth, looks to take proper control of the match by breaking in the 
fourth game. A solid service game follows, and he leads 4-1, well on the way to 
a two-set lead. Meanwhile it’s still on serve in the first set between Tursunov 
and Wawrinka - the Russian leads 5-4 - though the Swiss had two break points in 
Tursunov’s last service game, but didn’t make any impression with either, a 
particularly lame backhand return spurning one of the chances.
 
We’re still on serve on Rod Laver. Duckworth holds, then Hewitt makes it 2-1 
in some style, pushing his opponent to the corner, then smashing away a return 
that had come down with snow on it. We’re still on serve on Margaret Court, 
Wawrinka and Tursanov having shared the first six games of the first set. And 
Jack Sock of the USA, the No25 seed, has won a Homeric and rather topsy-turvy 
tussle with his young compatriot Taylor Fritz, 6-4, 3-6, 0-6, 6-3, 6-4.
 
Another shock is brewing, this time on Show Court 2, where the Spanish 
journeyman Daniel Muñoz De La Nava has just gone two sets up against Viktor 
Troicki, 6-4, 6-4.The No21 seed, who has never got past the third round here, 
has it all to do against a player who has never won a match at a grand-slam 
tournament. After the heroics of Zhang earlier, could another player be ready 
to break their major-championship duck?

In other home-favourite news, and as those following the GBG 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/jan/19/bernard-tomic-vs-denis-istomin-round-one-of-the-australian-open>
 will know, Bernard Tomic beat Denis Istomin 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. On the 
Margaret Court Arena, the 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka is out and about: he 
faces Dmitry Tursunov, and that one’s with serve at the moment, 2-1 to the 
Russian in the very early stages. And back on Rod Laver, Hewitt wins the first 
game of the second set, holding his serve easily enough.

Hewitt nets Duckworth’s weak second serve, a chance spurned. And then another 
lame forehand into the net. It’s 5-4 to Duckworth and the pressure’s on 
Hewitt’s serve now as we reach the business end of the tie-break. It’s not 
looking good for the old chap as he struggles to stay in a long rally, but a 
glorious forehand down the advantage side saves his service point. And then 
Duckworth looks like winning the next rally, but an unlucky net cord does for 
him. Set point to Hewitt, and he takes it, grinding his man down, Duckworth 
eventually netting. Hewitt goes a set up, 7-6, after 55 minutes of honest toil. 
The crowd enjoyed that.

The first mini-break of the tie-break goes to Hewitt. A crashing forehand to 
the corner, followed up at the net, puts too much pressure on Duckworth. The 
next four points go to serve. All the cheers reserved for the old boy Hewitt, 
which is a shame for young Duckworth, but such is life, and this is where we 
are. It’s 3-2 to Hewitt, and he’s serving the next two points. The following 
point is a wonderful rally, Hewitt pushing Duckworth to the corners, Duckworth 
defending brilliantly. But he’s eventually wrong-footed by a lovely whipped 
cross-court winner, and Hewitt screams a COME ON! to the heavens. The crowd 
definitely on his side. But Duckworth finds a corner of his own to earn the 
mini-break back. We’re on serve again, at 4-3 to Hewitt, Duckworth about to 
toss it up.
 
A couple of standard holds, first by Duckworth, then by Hewitt, and we’re into 
a first-set tie-breaker. Sabine Lisicki made it through to the second round 
without too much drama, by the way. She beat Petra Cetkovska 6-4, 6-4.
 
Back on Rod Laver, it’s the all-Australian encounter between two-time major 
winner and erstwhile world No1Lleyton Hewitt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lleyton-hewitt>, and James Duckworth. Hewitt 
- who will retire after this championship - was serving for the first set, but 
this has been a hard-fought battle, and Duckworth breaks with a delicious 
forehand through the deuce court. It’s 5-5.
 
It’s emotional all right on Margaret Court Arena. It’s pointed out to Zhang 
that she’s just won her first match at a grand slam event, and this brilliant 
qualifier breaks down herself. If you’re watching this, and you’re not welling 
up now, oh your stony heart. She’s given all the time she needs to compose 
herself. She’s earned every second. “To win against the top-two player, I’m so 
excited. I’d like to thank my coach and my parents, thank you. Today is the 
best moment in my career. Thank you to Simona, who is a great player. Thank you 
to everybody.” This has been quite a day in Melbourne. Astonishing.
 
In the second huge shock of the day, the qualifier Zhang Shuai beats second 
seed Simona Halep!It’s an astonishing straight-sets victory by a player who has 
never won a match at a major championship before: 6-4, 6-3. And it was wholly 
deserved! She relentlessly found the corners and the lines, moving the helpless 
Halep around the court at will. For a while, it looked as though the enormity 
of the situation would overwhelm Zhang in that second set, but she bounced back 
stronger than ever. The Margaret Court Arena erupts in honour: this was all 
about Zhang’s brilliance, because Halep didn’t play particularly badly. 
Astonishing scenes. In the crowd, Zhang’s coach is in a state of serene bliss, 
staring straight ahead in shock, tears of joy running down his cheeks. That’s a 
beautiful moment.

Khan/AFP/Getty Images  
Halep isn’t going down without a fight. Now it’s the Romanian’s turn to move 
her opponent around the court, and having pushed Zhang wide, she whips a 
glorious forehand to win the first point. But Zhang pearls a two-handed passing 
shot down the left-hand side of the court. 15-15. Halep then weakly nets twice. 
Zhang has two match points!
 
Zhang finds a couple of corners, and goes 0-30 up on Halep’s serve. This 
intense pressure is telling on Halep, who flaps at a simple forehand, sending 
it well wide. Three break points. Zhang moves her this way and that. Halep 
nets. Zhang breaks! She’ll be serving to beat the world number two!
 
And we’re back on serve in the Margaret Court Arena! Three games in a row for 
Zhang! She holds her serve to stay within touching distance in the set, then 
wears Halep down with some patient baseline rallies to break back. A bit of 
old-school serve and volley helps Zhang win her next service game, and she’s 
4-3 up in the second set. It looked as though Zhang had unravelled, but she’s 
pulled it all back together without fuss, and suddenly Halep is in serious 
trouble here.
 
Andy Murray’s easy first-round win over the young German Alexander Zverev has 
set up a second-round match with home favourite and 67th seed Sam Groth. Cue 
some good-natured banter  patter. Murray’s wife Kim is due to give birth to the 
couple’s first child in mid February, with the player insisting that he’ll be 
off home if she goes into labour early, no matter what stage the Aussie Open’s 
at. “Be nice if his wife went into labour overnight,” Groth joked. “I might be 
just cheering for that one.” Groth beat France’s Adrian Mannarino 7-6, 6-4, 
3-6, 6-3 earlier today, recording 27 aces and the fastest serve at the 
tournament so far (235 kph) along the way. Groth, who has never played Murray, 
is hoping for another boom-boom performance in the second round. “Hopefully I 
will serve well and it doesn’t come back. I’m going to take it to him. It 
doesn’t really change too much. I’m going to serve big and try to get forward 
and play aggressively. But it’s tough. Number two seed and two in the world. 
He’s a quality player. He’s where he is for a reason. I’ve got nothing to lose.”

But suddenly a few doubts flicker across Zhang’s mind. Halep steps up the 
pace, breaks her opponent, then consolidates the lead with an easy service 
game. In double-quick time, it’s 3-1 to the second seed in the second set.
 
When you’re hot, you’re hot. Zhang, the pedal pressed to the floor, no point 
letting up now, wins the opening game of the second set to love. Easy. Halep 
has some serious thinking to do here. The first ace of the match earns the 
Romanian the second game of the set. No quarter given by either player here. 
Zhang’s had to earn the lead in this fascinating match.
 
The shock’s back on! You could forgive a 27-year-old qualifier for buckling 
after passing up on set point against the number two seed then losing her 
serve. But two screaming two-handed passes down the line, followed by a 
glorious cross-court winner, and Zhang breaks Halep again to claim the first 
set 6-4! A major upset is on the cards here. Hold on, let me rephrase that: 
another major upset is on the cards here. Oh Rafa, what have you started? A 
long way to go, of course. But Zhang is playing the game of her life here. 
She’s never won a match at a major tournament. Now she’s a set away from glory.
 
Fernando Verdasco’s fifth-set evisceration of Rafael Nadal, dispatching the 
men’s fifth seed from the tournament, is undoubtedly the story of the day.But 
could another big shock be brewing in the women’s? The second seed Simona Halep 
is a break down in the first set to Chinese qualifier Shuai Zhang. Ah hold on, 
maybe not. Zhang blinked at set point, hitting a simple forehand miles long, 
and Halep’s broken back. They’re on serve again, though Halep has to hold to 
stay in the set. It’s 5-4 to Zhang.
 
A fairly fuss-free route into the second-round hat for ninth seed Karolina 
Pliskova.She beat Kimberly Birrell 6-4, 6-4. The 15th seed Madison Keys was 
taken to a tie-break in the first set against Zarina Diyas, but won that and 
swatted her opponent aside in the second to register an ultimately easy 7-6, 
6-1 victory. And the number three seed Garbine Muguruza made light work of 
Anett Kontaveit, the 2015 Wimbledon finalist winning 6-0. 6-4 in an hour on Rod 
Laver.
 
An easy win for David Ferrer. The grinding Spaniard, the Cliff Thorburn of 
tennis, has eased past Peter Gojowczyk 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. And here’s another 
one-sided Spanish affair: Feliciano Lopez has dumped one-time British number 
two Dan Evans out, that one ending in a 6-1 6-0 6-4 thrashing. The 25-year-old 
Evans battled his way through three rounds of qualifying to get to the main 
event, but he was gone within 88 minutes. A tough business.
 
Other matches are available, of course. And right now, on the Hisense Arena, 
home favourite Bernard Tomic made a meal of serving for the third set against 
Denis Istomin. Quickly 0-40 down, he retrieved the situation with a series of 
big serves followed up by huge forehands into the corner. Some weak 
serve-and-volley nonsense gifted Istomin a fourth break point: saved. A 
flashing cross-court forehand earns Istomin a fifth. But that one’s saved as 
well, and Tomic only needs one set point to convert. He puts it away, wins the 
third set 6-4, and leads 2-1. We’ve got this one Game By Game: like a pint of 
plain, Russell Jackson is your only man.

A momentarily tetchy Nadal slams his rackets back into his bag as he prepares 
to vacate the court, but he doesn’t even have the energy to sustain any anger. 
His head drops, and he mopes off in the throes of misery. Such a shame there 
had to be a loser after a fantastic match, and the departure of a very popular 
star will tug a few heart-strings this morning/afternoon/evening/night. But the 
result was totally right: Verdasco was simply brilliant in those final 
exchanges, blowing his more storied compatriot off the court. Verdasco’s 
interviewed on Rod Laver in the wake of this famous victory, although not 
before munching his way quickly through a banana. “Sorry. I need to eat. If 
not, I’m dead!” Much laughter from the stands. He then explains his victory. “I 
just hit everything. I just started hitting winners. I don’t know how. I closed 
my eyes and everything started dropping in, so I kept doing it! I started 
coming in, started to be aggressive, and I’m so happy. A win against Rafa is an 
unbelievable feeling.”

Nadal is out! Verdasco wins 7-6, 4-6, 3-6, 7-6, 6-2! Nadal ostentatiously 
springs about like Tigger, but nobody’s really convinced. He’s running on 
reserves. But he’s given a helping hand by Verdasco, who fails to put away a 
short and slow second serve. Nadal takes succour and a big serve gives him a 
30-0 lead. Verdasco’s forehand makes it 30-15. And then another cross-court 
stunner! It’s 30-30! Nadal shovels a poor shot out of play on the right, and 
it’s match point to Verdasco. And he takes it first time, blowing his 
compatriot away with a stunning cross-court winner. This is Nadal’s 44th 
appearance in a major tournament, and he’s only previously lost in the first 
round once, against Steve Darcis at Wimbledon in 2013. Nadal was certainly not 
at his best - in fact during that final set he looked totally spent - but in 
fairness nobody could have lived with Verdasco in those final six games, when 
the Spaniard put his foot on the gas and blew his compatriot away with a series 
of blistering cross-court forehands. Wow.

This match has now been going for over four-and-a-half hours. Water! Some 
water over here! Nadal looks utterly spent, knackered and jiggered. He looks 
leggy, and irritated to boot. He doesn’t have the energy to put any pressure on 
Verdasco’s serve, and in quick-smart time it’s 5-2 to Verdasco. That’s five 
games in a row for the underdog. He was a break down in this set! It’s one hell 
of a performance, and he’s got Nadal in all sorts of trouble now. Unless Nadal 
pulls something special out of the bag, he’s about to lose for the first time 
in the opening round at Melbourne.
 
Nadal looks in serious bother on his own serve at 15-30, Verdasco creaming a 
return down the line, putting his opponent on the back foot.But Nadal scampers 
and digs out a return, then benefits from a fortunate net cord that sends 
Verdasco’s forehand whistling out of play. But he’s making a meal of this. A 
sixth double-fault of the match gifts Verdasco a break point. Nadal saves that 
with a Big Serve to bring the game to deuce. But then another break point, as 
Nadal’s beaten all ends up by a glorious whipped cross-court forehand. 
Advantage Verdasco. This is a huge point! And Verdasco makes it four games in a 
row, breaking Nadal by crashing a return back to the 2009 champ’s feet. Nadal 
can only shank the ball miles out to the left, and it’s 4-2 in this final set 
to Verdasco. He’s serving to take control of this match as we reach the 
business end.Fifth set: Nadal 2-4 Verdasco.
 
Verdasco earns himself a break point in the fourth game of the final set, 
leaping on a weak Nadal second serve at 30-30 to cream a forehand down the line.
Nadal saves himself with a cross-court winner, but then faces another break 
point as Verdasco whips a second serve to the corner, Nadal with no answer. And 
he breaks back, though in the flukiest of circumstances, hitting one off the 
frame of his racket, the ball flying hysterically off to the right but somehow 
dropping on the right-hand line. All angles seemingly impossible, but there you 
go. Verdasco holds his hands up to apologise, and has the good grace to look 
incredibly sheepish. Still, he earned his luck there. We’re back on serve in 
this dramatic fifth set! And soon enough, it’s three games in a row for 
Verdasco, as a few big boomers earns an easy service game to love.Fifth set: 
Nadal 2-3 Verdasco.
 
Nicolas Mahut of France has made it through to the next round. He went a set 
down to Marco Cecchinato of Italy, but then slipped into gear, winning the next 
three sets with relative ease, the match finishing in just over two hours: 4-6, 
6-2, 6-2, 6-2. He’ll face his fellow French star Gael Monfils in the second 
round.
 
Back on Rod Laver, the chances of a big shock are receding fast. Nadal has 
upped the tempo against Verdasco, breaking his compatriot in the first game of 
the fifth set, then quickly making it to 2-0. Verdasco looks good to get on the 
board with his next service game, but a couple of big points from Nadal earns 
another break point. He appears to be wearing Verdasco down. However! Three 
booming aces in a row rescues the situation for Verdasco. He’s still a break 
down, but at least he’s on the board. This match isn’t quite finished yet. 
Nadal leads 2-1.
 
Let’s step away from the drama on Rod Laver for a minute  while I get my 
bearings to catch up with some other news. And please allow me to cram the 
ill-fitting hat of base jingoism onto my confused noggin. For it’s been a fine 
second day for the Brits. On any normal day, the big news in that respect would 
be the serene progress to the second round of perennial bridesmaid Andy Murray: 
the 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 finalisteased past Alexander Zverev in three 
sets, dropping just six games along the way, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/19/andy-murray-downs-zverev-could-be-a-force-again-in-australian-open>
. But all the plaudits today must go to Britain’s other number-one player, 
Johanna Konta. The 24-year-old has made some debut in Melbourne, seeing off the 
2003 finalist and eighth seed Venus Williams in commanding fashion: 6-4, 6-2. 
Konta’s picked a fine place for this statement victory: she was born in Sydney 
and competed for Australia until 2012. So hats off to her, in more ways than 
one.

It’s 2-2 in sets! Verdasco bangs his two service points away without much 
fuss. He’s 5-2 up in the tie-break. A deep high-kicking Nadal serve makes it 
5-3. And then it’s 5-4, though Verdasco had the chance, meeting a weak second 
serve, to flash a cross-court winner away. Too long. But he’s still got two 
service points of his own to put this set away. Verdasco whips deep to win the 
first. Then booms a huge ace down the middle to secure the set! Verdasco showed 
nerves of steel in that tie-break having fluffed his lines while earlier 
serving for the set. He’s levelled it up against the fifth seed and 2009 champ! 
We’re over the four-hour mark in this match already, and we’re going the 
distance.Nadal v Verdasco: 6-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-7.
 
Verdasco wins the first pointo to go a mini-break up, returning serve right at 
Nadal’s feet, then finding the corners with metronomic regularity. Nadal’s 
always on the back foot and eventually a Verdasco winner’s crashed away at the 
net. We’re back on serve immediately, Verdasco netting weakly. But then two 
huge booming winners for the underdog on Nadal’s serve, and Verdasco is 
suddenly in control of this tie-break at 3-2 up with his two service points to 
come. He should see this one out. But then again he was serving for the set 
earlier, and look what happened there.
 
What Happens Here Then dept. Loose play from Verdasco. He falls 0-30 down and 
it looks like his challenge in this set - and this championship - is 
unravelling from a very promising position. But under intense pressure, he 
flashes a cross-court forehand into the corner, and regains a little momentum. 
It’s 6-6 in the fourth set, and we’re going to a tie break.
 
Good morning, afternoon, evening and night, everyone. Anyone for tennis? Sure 
you are. There’s been plenty of big news already today at Melbourne, but more 
of that anon. For right now Rafael Nadal has got himself in a bit of the old
Tennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Bother. He’s 2-1 up in sets 
on Fernando Verdasco, but found himself a break down in the fourth. Verdasco 
was serving for the set, but flashed a wild forehand out of play to gift Nadal 
the break. Now Nadal’s held his own serve to lead 6-5, but a Verdasco hold will 
take this to a tie-break. Let’s see what happens here, then.
 
Scott will be here shortly. Day one saw Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and 
Serena Williams progress comfortably but are more seeds set to follow Caroline
