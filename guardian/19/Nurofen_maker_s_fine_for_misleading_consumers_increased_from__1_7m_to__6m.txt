The manufacturer of Nurofen has been fined $6m for misleading consumers. The 
federal court increased the penalty from $1.7m to $6m after an appeal by the 
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

In December 2015 the federal court found the British company Reckitt Benckiser 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/reckittbenckiser>, the manufacturer of 
the painkiller, had engaged in “misleading conduct” by representing that its 
Nurofen Specific Pain products targeted a type or area of pain despite being 
identical, and ordered they be removed from supermarket shelves within three 
months.

Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen 
Tension Headache all contain 342mg of ibuprofen lysine, and cost up to twice as 
much as its regular products.

Lawyers for the ACCC had told the federal court hearing in New South Wales 
that the company had profited substantially and should be fined accordingly.


The ACCC challenge to the products, which began in March 2015 last year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/05/accc-sues-reckitt-benckiser-over-false-claims-on-nurofen-packets>
, followed years of criticism by consumer groups. In 2010 the consumer group
Choice gave Nurofen’s pain-specific range a Shonky award 
<http://classic.choice.com.au/shonkyaward/hall-of-shame/shonkys-2010/shonky-2010-nurofen.aspx>
, saying “the shonkiest aspect of this type of marketing is that the 
fast-acting painkillers labelled for specific pain types are more expensive – 
costing almost twice as much in some stores we surveyed.”


Consumer Group Choice welcomed the decision but said consumer laws needed to 
be changed to increase potential penalties for misleading conduct.

“These companies make huge profits when peddling these deceptive and 
misleading claims, but the courts’ hands are tied when it comes to handing down 
an appropriate penalty,” Choice spokesperson, Nicky Breen, said.

“The law needs to be changed so that courts can and will issue penalties that 
give companies a real headache.

“Reckitt Benckiser used this dodgy marketing for years. Choice first called 
the company out for its deceptive claims.”

“While we welcome the court’s decision to impose a higher penalty, it’s pocket 
change compared to the profit Reckitt Benckiser would have made from conning 
consumers into paying top dollar for products that weren’t any more effective 
than cheaper generic pain relief pills.”
