A new concert hall for London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/25/simon-rattle-lso-new-london-concert-hall-row>
 would cost £278m and should be built near St Paul’s Cathedral on the site of 
the Museum of London, a six-month feasibility study has concluded.


The government said it would provide £5.5m to fund a full business case for 
the planned hall, which would be home to the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) 
under the leadership of SirSimon Rattle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/simon-rattle>. The City of London 
Corporation has indicated a willingness in principle to make land available for 
the venue.

The report was commissioned in February by the chancellor, George Osborne, and 
the London mayor, Boris Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/03/new-concert-hall-london-grand-ambition-orchestras-simon-rattle>
, to look into whether a world-class concert hall needed to be built, how much 
might it cost and where it could be located.

It is widely agreed that London’s two main concert halls, at the Barbican 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/barbican> and the Royal Festival Hall, are 
outshone by halls in Birmingham and Gateshead and European venues in Berlin, 
Paris and Vienna.

Metropolitan cultural mafia in concert once more | Letters

The 250-page report agrees and says the London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> halls lack “a brilliance, immediacy, 
depth, richness and warmth”. The capital is “at real risk of falling behind 
other major cities with the proliferation of outstanding new 21st-century halls 
in cities across the world threatening the capital’s current pre-eminence in 
the music industry”, it adds.

The report sets out a cultural, economic and educational case for building a 
1,900-seat main hall and an “informal club venue” to accommodate 200 people for 
late-night performances and lunchtime recitals.

It would be very different from a traditional concert hall with no formal 
front or back-of-house areas, allowing it to “feel inclusive, transparent and 
alive, encouraging interaction between musicians and the members of the 
public”. There would be pods allowing visitors to watch performances and 
rehearsals with digital notes on the music being played.

The report estimates the construction cost at £278m and says £34m would be 
needed to make changes to Barbican Hall so it can replace classical concerts 
with more contemporary, jazz and world music performances. It says a private 
fundraising campaign could bring in £125m. That raises the prospect of nearly 
£200m coming from the public purse and the Corporation of London.

It says there is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a world-class 
venue, the first of its kind in the UK to be built specifically for the digital 
age. In economic terms, the report estimates the benefits to the UK economy 
would be £890m.


There would be an ambitious educational programme offering every young person 
in the UK the opportunity to experience the centre physically or virtually. The 
report adds: “Every household within the M25 should have had at least one 
interaction with the Centre for Music.”

The site would become available when the Museum of London fulfils its ambition 
to move to a bigger site at Smithfield market.

Simon Rattle’s return to LSO marred by squabble over new London concert hall

Rattle, who is joining the LSO in September 2017, has called the orchestra’s 
current homes at the Barbican “a good concert hall but not a great concert 
hall”. He has denied that the prospect of a new hall played a part in his
decision to leave the Berlin Philharmonic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/03/simon-rattle-says-he-was-not-lured-to-the-lso-by-a-new-concert-hall>
.


The report says the arrival of Rattle gives the project “urgency and focus … 
Among leading musicians today, he is the one who can galvanise public support 
and private funding.”

Rattle welcomed the report, saying: “The Centre for Music has the potential to 
be an extraordinary place that will make music central to people’s lives. There 
is still much to do to move this from dream to reality, so this is exciting 
news. I’m delighted to see the project advancing, and look forward to the next 
phase of work.”

The report proposes a timeline which would see the Centre for Music opening in 
September 2023 with the new Barbican Hall reopening a year later.

The report’s authors considered locations outside the City of London, 
including Battersea power station and the Olympic Park, but the option never 
made it to the shortlist. Instead 31 locations within the Square Mile were 
considered, whittled down to three: the museum site, the poultry market in 
Smithfield and Baynard House near Blackfriars.

Sir Nicholas Kenyon, managing director of the Barbican, said the idea was for 
something completely different to a traditional concert hall. “Nobody here yet 
has built a facility of this kind for the 21st century, with all the changes in 
audience taste, audience behaviour and the growth of digital.

“This is a very long-term project with very long-term benefits and we feel it 
is a really good investment for the future of music.”

Johnson said: “It would create a world-class concert hall to compete with 
those in other global cities and help to reshape an increasingly important 
cultural quarter in central London at time when Crossrail will be bringing in 
many more commuters and visitors.

“It would also be investing in the long-term future of culture, creativity and 
tourism, which are of huge importance to the UK economy, as well as music 
education, not just for local youngsters but for young people up and down the 
country.”

Sir Nicholas Hytner <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/nicholas-hytner>, a 
former director of the National Theatre and an external adviser to the study, 
said: “It makes a really comprehensive and convincing case for a new Centre for 
Music in London. As the study shows, investment in this project has the 
potential to be transformative for music and music education in this country, 
and I am delighted that it is now proceeding to the next phase with the support 
of the government and the City of London.”

Mark Pemberton, director of the Association of British Orchestras, said 
London, with its “wealth of world-class symphony and chamber orchestras, 
deserves to have two great concert halls, one for each side of the river”.

He added: “Classical music is a global art form, with London in competition 
with the other great European cities, and a new concert hall has the potential 
to boost cultural tourism to the capital and to add to the depth and richness 
of the UK’s existing network of concert halls.”
