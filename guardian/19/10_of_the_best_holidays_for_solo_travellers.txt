Eternal India

Contiki specialises in holidays for 18 to 35-year-olds and is a popular choice 
for solo travellers: last year 60% of its guests travelled solo and that figure 
is set to rise this year. Though it has been running trips around the world for 
more than four decades, India represents a brand new destination for the 
company, which is launching tours there this December. The 12-day tour ticks 
off India’s most popular historical and cultural destinations – Delhi, Agra, 
Jaipur, Mumbai – as well as heading south for some beach time in Goa. There are 
also opportunities to customise your trip, with added experiences such as 
safaris, cooking classes and yoga.
• From £1,383 for a same-gender twin-share room, including guides, tour

Trips to Asia have proved popular for solo travellers booking through Wendy 
Wu, especially among older female travellers. The company offers a range of 
trips to China – including an epic 28-day trip dubbed “The Big One” – but those 
looking for a shorter holiday to fit into their schedule might prefer the 
10-day “A China Experience”. The tour covers the best known sights, such as the 
Great Wall and the Terracotta Warriors, but also makes time for less-visited 
locations, like the peaceful water town Zhujiajiao. Travellers who want to save 
on the single supplement and are happy to double up in a twin room can opt for 
the “willing to share policy” – even if there isn’t another traveller to match 
you with, you won’t be charged any extra.
• 10 days from £1,890 (single room £280 extra) all-inclusive, including

Another travel company active in the solo traveller market is G Adventures, 
which also offers the chance to share rooms to save on the single supplement. 
Solo travellers account for around a third of those who book. One of its new 
trips this year is a sailing adventure along the Dalmatian coast, a destination 
that is growing in popularity with solo travellers. Starting and ending in 
Dubrovnik, Croatia, the nine-day tour heads south to Montenegro and takes in 
the dramatic Balkan landscape, beautiful beaches and an old fishing village.

For those looking to get a bit more pumped on their travels, the small 
independent travel company Hofnar specialises in sociable holidays for single 
travellers looking for an upbeat chalet experience in the Alps. The company 
runs a chalet in Morzine and 80% of its guests go solo, meaning they can expect 
a crowd of like-minded people to hit the slopes with and, well, make the most 
of the après ski. Trips never have more than 14 people and the laid-back 
approach means travellers are welcome to do as much or as little as they like 
during their stay.
• Seven nights from £315 (based on a triple share), including breakfast, four 
dinners, snacks, unlimited soft drinks, host,hofnar.com <http://www.hofnar.com/>

Overland travel specialist Dragoman estimates 60% of its clients are solo 
travellers. It runs small group adventures, with numbers limited to 22 – large 
enough to have a nice mix and small enough for people to get to know everyone 
else during their trip. It’s a good option for those keen to go off the beaten 
track but would prefer not to travel completely independently. One standout is 
its 21-day trip across West Africa. Starting in Accra, capital of Ghana, 
travellers are driven east to the forests and hills of Togo’s Mont Klouto 
before continuing on to Benin – a trip that will involve some difficult roads 
and some very special wild camps.

More than half of the travellers who book with Intrepid go alone, so 
travellers are unlikely to find themselves surrounded by couples and groups. 
But that hasn’t stopped Intrepid pulling together a trio of solo-only 
departures for three of its most popular trips. One is a coffee lovers’ dream 
holiday, heading into the Colombian highlands to visit plantations and 
roasteries, while staying on a traditional coffee estancia, before heading to

For a me-time break, a yoga retreat is an obvious option. At Suryalila, in the 
Andalucian countryside, you’ll be able to stretch those limbs surrounded by 
beautiful mountains, lakes and fields, and feast on organic vegetarian meals in 
between twice daily yoga classes. Destination Yoga is a popular choice with 
solo travellers – 70% of its clients go alone – and the company will also help 
to match guests with other solo travellers if they want to share a room and 
keep the price down. If you’re after a healthy way to see in the New Year, join 
the 28 December trip (returns 2 January).

Responsible Travel runs lots of great small group holidays that make it easy 
for solo travellers to bond, but one standout trip has to be its two-week tour 
of Japan. The excellent-value trip has no single supplement, and for more than 
half of its duration travellers enjoy their own single room (guests share with 
one other person when staying at traditional inns and smaller accommodations). 
The trip takes in the highlights of the country, from gleaming cities to 
Buddhist temples and traditional mountain towns, finishing in Tokyo for a big 
night out.

December includes touring Ho Chi Minh City on a Vespa, exploring the Mekong 
Delta by bicycle and wandering among the temples of Angkor. Accommodation will
