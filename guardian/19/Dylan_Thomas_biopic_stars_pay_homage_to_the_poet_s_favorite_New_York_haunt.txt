In a back room of Greenwich Village’s White Horse Tavern, the after-work crowd 
mixes with tourists thirsty for Coronas on an unseasonably hot night. In these 
unlikely confines, the actor Celyn Jones is reciting someDylan Thomas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/dylanthomas>. “And death shall have no 
dominion,” he says, affecting the deep, descending timbre that the Welshman was 
known for. “His voice is based on that of a vicar. It sounds so strange because 
this guy is so punk rock yet he doesn’t sound very punk rock.”

On the wall, a life-size portrait of the great Welsh poet looks silently over 
his shoulder at Jones. The actor takes a sip of whiskey – he won’t come close 
to downing the notorious 18 whiskeys that Thomas drank here, sending him to an 
early grave at the age of 39 in 1953. Director Andy Goddard and Elijah Wood, 
who co-stars with Jones in the Thomas bio-pic Set Fire to the Stars, smile 
approvingly while nursing beers.

 Like Thomas, Jones and Goddard have come to America from Wales to expand 
their horizons. In their case, to promote the film, which opened this weekend 
in New York before rolling out nationally. This stop at Thomas’s old haunt is a 
first for Wood, who flew in from Los Angeles, and a second for Goddard, but for 
Jones, it’s a regular pilgrimage since he acted in a play here 11 years ago. 
“The White Horse Tavern goes cheek by jowl with Dylan Thomas,” he says.

Set Fire to the Stars, which Goddard and Jones wrote, portrays a small slice 
of Thomas’s life – the week that he came to the United States in 1950, when he 
was hosted by poet and literary critic, John Malcolm Brinnin, who is played by 
Wood. There’s some irony in them being here, considering the film was shot 
entirely in Wales, where Goddard created a “smoke and mirrors New York,” he 
says, admitting that for him the film’s greatest burden was “the Americanness 
of it” – which included accents.

 As for the movie’s other potential hurdles – a black and white film, and 
Jones playing the legendary Thomas – the filmmakers felt more confident.

 “Celyn was destined to play Dylan,” Wood says. Jones, best known for British 
television parts in Shameless and Grange Hill, has spent his career being told 
he should play the poet. It’s true, there’s a striking resemblance, with his 
curly hair and “squashy” build, as he calls it. (Less so now, since he’s lost 
some weight, cut his hair and put on a beard).

The filmmakers also had a shrewd angle. “It’s John Brinnin’s story, looking 
through his eyes,” says Goddard. “It’s a film about one man’s journey with 
Dylan Thomas. You can show Dylan, the beast, the mad man, the angel and the 
various colors of the man and avoid the pitfalls of telling a biopic.”

“I loved the story they wanted to tell. They were fascinated by the seven days 
at the cabin,” says Wood, referring to the time Brinnin stole Thomas away from 
the city’s temptations. “Dylan eventually left and John left a changed man. It 
starts with a person being one thing and ends with him being something else. 
Trying to encapsulate all of Dylan’s life would have been a mistake.”

“Seeing the world in a grain of sand,” confirms Jones, who, unlike his 
colleagues, has unbuttoned the top few buttons of his shirt. Each talks of New 
York City with reverence and appreciation but theirs is of a temperate flavor. 
Jones relishes the first time he went out in the middle of the night to buy 
juice and food, “just because I could,” he says.

None cop to the sort of hedonism associated with Thomas, although, in his 
work, Wood says he “feels more than analyzes.” Goddard says that between he and 
his writing partner, “Celyn is the bigger feeler. I’m a little bit more 
forensic and clinical.”

Given their film’s tight, 18-day shoot, Goddard put that attribute to work. 
“It was very efficient. We were editing in camera,” says the director, who has 
helmed several Downton Abbey episodes. “But we could feel it was working. We 
knew there was a magic, without sounding romantic about it.”

 “You can sound romantic, buddy,” Jones says, needling him with a goading 
lilt. “You’ve come a long way.”

 A boisterous chorus of laughter comes from a nearby group of tourist guides, 
who often wrap up their tours of the city here.

For the company present, two drinks in, it appears no one will be dancing on 
our table tonight, although Jones charmingly recites a Thomas quote that 
appears on the wall without looking. The three men arrived in a 
tractor-trailer-sized SUV with a team of publicists and producers who sit 
nearby, ready to whisk them to another interview.

 Heads turn and smart phones are raised for Wood, whose role as Brinnin is the 
latest in a diverse range of characters he’s played, including – most famously 
– Frodo in the Lord of the Rings. Goddard and Jones watch the attention Wood 
garners with quiet bemusement.

 “Celyn and I are kindred sprits in terms of career arcs,” says Goddard, , but 
he adds there’s a wider audience that they’re hoping to reach.

 Jones nods, recalling that when he was asked by airport immigration what his 
business in America was, he replied that he was here for a movie.

 “So, is this a big movie or a small movie?” asked the officer. 

 “It’s big for me,” Jones replied.
