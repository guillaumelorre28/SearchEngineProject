Radwanska, seeded three, won 6-4, 6-2 to claim her second win in two attempts 
against Konta. The British No1 fought off a first match point in the seventh 
game of the second set but Radwanska completed victory while serving in the 
next game to win in one hour 35 minutes.

Konta, the 11th seed, had reason to celebrate despite the defeat as she became 
only the fourth British woman to make the world’s top 10 since the WTA rankings 
began in 1975.

The 25-year-old was ranked 146th in the world as recently as June 2015 but she 
climbed into the top 10 by winning her semi-final

. She defeated Madison Keys 7-6, 4-6, 6-4 to become the first British woman 
since Jo Durie in 1984 to make the top 10.

Virginia Wade and Sue Barker are the other British women to have been ranked 
in the world’s top 10. By reaching the China Open final, Konta also moved into 
the top eight of the Road to Singapore – the race to reach the WTA Finals later 
this month.
