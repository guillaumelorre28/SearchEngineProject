“I’ve always loved playing the event and I’m really happy to know that I will 
play at Queen’s for as long as my career lasts,” Murray said.

“My first ATP World Tour match win came at Queen’s in 2005, so for it to 
become by far the most successful tournament of my career is a great feeling. 
Looking at the names that have won the tournament four times – some of the best 
players ever – winning it five times means a lot to me.”

The BBC began broadcasting the tournament in 1979 and last year 3.7m people 
tuned in to watch Murray defeat Milos Raonic in the final.

In 2017 the tournament is expanding its Centre Court capacity by 30%. More 
than 2,000 additional seats will be added to the current 6,942, taking the 
capacity above 9,000.

Stephen Farrow, the Aegon Championships tournament director, said: “To know 
that Andy will play at the Queen’s Club for the rest of his career and that the 
BBC will cover it every step of the way is a huge boost in what is an exciting 
and important year for the Aegon Championships with our stadium capacity 
increasing by 30%.”
