OS Maps

Ordnance Survey maps downloadable to phone or desktop. Plot your own route or 
choose from 500,000 stored. OS Locate works alongside the service, showing a 
grid reference of your location, which you can share in an emergency. But, as 
with all apps, it runs off your phone battery, which in mountains can be a 
problem.
• In a sentence: A good, cheap way to use OS maps. £20 per year;

Garmin Oregon 750


One of the most action-packed units out there, and the only one with Bluetooth 
and Wi-Fi, so you get smartphone notifications on screen and live weather 
updates. It’s robust and jammed with features (such as an 8MP camera), though 
the maps are fairly basic and the OS upgrade will cost more.
• In a sentence: Rugged and pricy but has everything you want. £429.99;
