Tehillim, Part 1& 2 (1981) is one of my favourite pieces from Steve Reich. 
It’s a fusion of drumming material made up of techniques he developed from his 
researches in West Africa, and the Renaissance “Hocket” technique (a bit like 
that really fast interlocking clapping you get in flamenco music). Reich puts 
this percussion material together with the free-flowing vocal writing which is 
a setting of texts from the Psalms. The result is a kind of miracle.

Music for a While (1692) is one of the best-known songs by Henry Purcell, who, 
in spite of strong claims by Lennon and McCartney, Ray Davies and Benjamin 
Britten, is the best composer ever to come from Britain. Like a number of his 
works, it uses a repeating bass line (we’d call it a loop now if it were made 
in the computer-age). The way the vocal line flows across the repeats of the 
bass is very smart and highlights one of the things I love most about Purcell: 
the fusion of brilliant technique with intense emotionality.

Maybe close your eyes to get the most from Beethoven’s Symphony no 7 
(1804-1808). Beethoven was badass in every way, and this piece is as banging as 
it was possible to make at the time: if he had hadan 808 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeZZk2czG1c>, he would have added a kick drum. 
Turn it up.

This, Bach’s Chaconne, Partita No 2 BWV 1004 (1720), is one of the most 
brilliant solo violin compositions in the catalogue. Just to clarify – this is 
a solo violin. One player. One. Hilary Hahn.

Here comes Julia Wolfe and her Fuel IV, V (2007). I love the density and 
physicality of this piece – it is both complex and simple, depending on your 
level of zoom. Its also a real thrash – when you hear it live you think the 
orchestra is going to blow up.
