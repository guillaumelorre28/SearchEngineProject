our economists are failing us 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/10/blunt-heckler-economists-failing-us-booming-britain-gdp-london>
, 10 January), GDP is a crazy measure for prosperity: a country’s GDP equals 
the aggregate income of its inhabitants. Therefore car accidents make us 
richer, because the income of repairers goes up. War contributes significantly 
to global GDP, as arms manufacturers make a mint and destroyed cities need 
rebuilding. And London’s highly paid financial specialists make a “healthy” 
contribution to UK GDP.

• Your recipe for green peppercorn and lemongrass coconut broth (Cook 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/09/green-peppercorn-and-lemongrass-coconut-broth-recipe-anna-jones-the-modern-cook>
, 7 January) really appealed, but in a tour of four supermarkets I could not 
find any green peppercorns. Thank goodness for the oriental supermarket in our 
town. Could recipe writers give advice on where to find these speciality 
ingredients?

• The likely appointment of Jared Kushner (Trump hires his son-in-law for top 
job in White House 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/09/jared-kushner-senior-adviser-donald-trump>

Peter Jay became ambassador to the US under the premiership of his 
father-in-law, James Callaghan.
