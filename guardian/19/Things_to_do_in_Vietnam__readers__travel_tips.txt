Winning tip: Ninh Binh countryside


OK, so the town of Ninh Binh (two hours’ drive south of Hanoi) is no looker, 
but the surrounding countryside will seduce you. Once there I hired a bicycle 
and set out early morning to explore the karst limestone scenery (think Halong 
bay with rice paddies replacing the sea). It was a wonderfully peaceful day of 
exploring villages, and having a picnic by the side of rice fields while 
watching the locals work. After two weeks in Vietnam, it was the first time I 
could really listen to the birds and feel at peace. It can be hard to escape 
the mopeds, but I had found the Vietnam I had hoped for.

Sign up for a free tour with Hanoi Kids, an organisation that pairs travellers 
with students learning English. It’s free and you’ll get a local’s perspective 
on the city, culture and cuisine. They filled us in on Hanoi life, their 
ambitions and the Korean pop stars they like over lunch in their favourite 
cafe. At the memorial to Communist leader Ho Chi Minh, we talked about politics 
and what the place meant to them. You set the pace and they give you tips for 
making the most of your time in the city. The tour is free apart from any 
entrance fees – if you give money to the guide they’ll pass it on to the 
organisation.

Vietnam is a food lover’s paradise, with countless tasty and affordable 
options, but the sheer amount of things and places to eat, especially in the 
big cities, can be overwhelming. Hanoi was the culinary highlight for me and a 
tour with a local guide is the perfect way to sample a wide selection in a 
relatively short amount of time. Our guide took us to six of her favourite 
places in the city and the food she ordered for us was fantastic in all of them.
Bun cha (pork with rice noodles), mi quang (fantastic noodle dish), happy 
pancakes, spring rolls, pho, beautiful steamed fish, sticky rice and egg coffee 
(yes, you read it correctly) were some of the highlights. She also taught us 
how each should be eaten and which sauces go best with each dish and the 
correct dipping order. We gained some great tips on specialities to seek out in 
other regions of Vietnam. This was definitely a stand-out from my time in 
Vietnam and cost just $15 .

Dai Lanh beach, 80km north of Nha Trang, where the lush Annamite mountains 
meet the ocean, is a brilliant place. Once there, I’d suggest you hire a 
scooter and make your way down the 30km-long Hon Gom sandbar. On a scooter you 
can ride past the sand dunes and over the sand-smeared tarmac of a new road 
leading to the Vuon Xoai restaurant in the floating hamlet of Son Dung. Here 
you can dive off the pontoon, go on a tour of the village by boat, and dine and 
sleep under the stars in a hammock. You can get the night bus here from Ho Chi 
Minh City, but it takes about 12 hours.

For a cheap, interesting and easy journey from Hanoi to Da Nang (for Hoi An) 
we booked the overnight sleeper train throughvietnam-railway.com 
<https://vietnam-railway.com/> which delivered tickets to our hotel and were 
efficient and courteous. Hurtling south in the dark our patchy sleep was 
punctuated by the arrival of the beer and noodle trolley and change of 
occupancy of the opposite bunks. A Vietnamese family of three was followed by a 
guard from the train, then more tourists. At daybreak there were glimpses of 
small shops on the edge of the track, views of coastline, water buffalo, 
bananas, more coastline, more beer and noodle trolleys before we glided into Da 
Nang the following morning.

Water puppetry 
<http://www.vietnam-guide.com/ho-chi-minh-city/water-puppet-shows.htm> is a 
Vietnamese tradition and was one of the best cultural activities I did on my 
trip. If your experience of puppet shows consists of Punch and Judy-type 
performances you are in for a surprise. The stage is a large pool of water in 
which the puppets act out tales from Vietnamese folklore with a traditional 
Vietnamese orchestra playing throughout. The puppeteers are extremely skilled 
and great artistry goes into the puppets themselves. Apart from just a handful 
of tourists, the theatre was filled with local families enjoying the show. This 
really is something you can only experience in Vietnam, but is an activity that 
seems to get overlooked by many visitors. I visited the Golden Dragon Water 
Puppet Theatre in Ho Chi Minh (tickets $7.50), but there are also daily shows 
near Hoan Kiem lake in Hanoi at theThang Long Water Puppet Theatre 
<http://thanglongwaterpuppet.org/en/> ($3-$5). I bought my tickets at the box 
office a couple of hours before the show.

We stayed at An Bang Beach for a week, a few miles from Da Nang, right by Hoi 
An. In the tiny village, down a dark side path is the Purple Lantern – a 
fantastic little restaurant in the front yard of the owner’s family’s house (Na 
– she’s an amazing cook, with a dry sense of humour). Her food focuses on daily 
caught seafood. No fuss, all taste. Out of the seven nights we stayed in An 
Bang, we ate there fives times – it really is that good, but Na’s hospitality 
and humour made it all the more special. To top it all, An Bang’s quiet, 
beautiful beaches make Da Nang’s pale in comparison.

For an affordable and comfortable stay in Hoi An, I’d go for the Vinh Hung 3 
hotel (also known as the Vinh Hung Library. It’s a stone’s throw from the old 
town, has a lovely rooftop pool and the friendliest staff. Breakfast was 
wonderful, with tasty treats to suit every palate. Visitors can rent bikes just 
outside the hotel and ride off along rice fields and to the beach. If you want 
to try one of the famous cooking classes in Hoi An, I would recommend theGioan 
cooking school <http://www.gioancookery.com/cookery/cookery-vi> – we learned to 
make several delicacies there that I now often make at home.

By far the most amazing experience I had in Vietnam was in the north, near 
Sapa, and the day spent with the Black Hmong Tribe, arranged throughEthos 
<http://www.ethosspirit.com/simply-hmong.html>. Our host, Ker, met us at our 
hotel in Sapa, and took us shopping for ingredients, which her brother in law 
collected and took back to their village on moped. We then hiked for around 
three hours amid brilliant Hoang Lien national park scenery to the village 
where they lived. On arriving at Ker’s house we met her children, and helped 
prepare spring rolls. Ker’s English was fantastic, and she happily answered our 
questions about her life, children, home, her beliefs and her village. The food 
– shared with the whole family – was fabulous. It was truly magical to see the 
differences and similarities in our lives as women with children, and I will 
forever be grateful to Ker for the insight into her life.

This trip starts as the sun rises over Da Nang and it takes in the Dragon 
bridge and the stunning countryside. Pedalling through villages and mountains 
with a small group and a knowledgeable local guide is a really fun way to see 
this beautiful and historic area. Pathbiker, the company we used for the trip, 
operates several tours from Da Nang – half or full days and some of three to 
four days. Special tip: after the tour, cool down in the amazing rooftop 
infinity pool at the deluxeA La Carte hotel <http://alacarteliving.com/> – you 
don’t have to be a resident.
