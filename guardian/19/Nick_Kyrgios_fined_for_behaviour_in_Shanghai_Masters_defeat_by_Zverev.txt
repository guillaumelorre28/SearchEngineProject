Kyrgios rushed through his 6-3, 6-1 loss to Zverev on Wednesday without 
putting much effort behind his serves or groundstrokes.

 During the match, the 21-year-old walked towards his chair after floating a 
serve across the net without even waiting for Zverev to return it.

The Australian, known for his on-court antics, also argued with a fan who 
questioned his sportsmanship during the match.

Afterwards, Krygios claimed he was tired. “It was just tough. Obviously I 
played a lot of matches in a row. Physically tired, mentally tired,” he said.

“That’s why I’m trying to work on being able to be consistent every week. Just 
took the easy way out tonight and obviously didn’t show up at all. I wasn’t so 
much frustrated. I just tapped out a little bit, I guess.”

Asked about the confrontation with the spectator, Kyrgios said: “I feel like 
if they knew what they were talking about they’d be on the tennis court and 
being successful as well. I can’t really understand it at all. They don’t know 
what I’m going through, so no, I don’t understand it.”
