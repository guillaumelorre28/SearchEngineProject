More than 1,290 people died on Australian roads in 2016, confirming the nation 
has experienced its second spike in road deaths in as many years.

Most states and territories have now released their final road toll figures 
for last year.

In New South Wales 384 people were killed, 291 died in Victoria, 250 in 
Queensland, 193 in Western Australia, 87 inSouth Australia

and 10 in the ACT.

The Northern Territory’s road toll appeared to stand at 45, although the 
territory’s police could not be contacted for confirmation on Monday.


That would give a preliminary road toll of at least 1,298, up from 1,209 last 
year, and the record low of 1,153 in 2014.

The successive rises in the road toll have bucked an otherwise long-term 
downward trend, which has seen the road tollreduce by huge numbers since 1970

The infrastructure and transport minister, Darren Chester, described the 2016 
road toll as a tragedy of national proportions on Sunday.


He suggested that parents should be spending a bit more on helping their 
teenage children buy a newer car.

The remarks drew criticism from Labor, but Chester defended them again on 2UE 
radio on Monday.

“Now, we can’t just keep on doing the same thing and thinking that we are 
going to get a better result, and I think emphasising the need to purchase a 
safer car if you can afford it, the safest car you can afford to buy, is an 
important part of this whole discussion, along with making sure governments 
don’t shirk their responsibility,” Chester said.

Chester also suggested that infrastructure investment should be directed more 
towards road safety.

“We already have a road black-spots program, we have got a roads to recovery 
program with local councils, and we have got a $50bn infrastructure spend under 
the current federal government,” he said.

“So there’s a lot of things going on but we need to pull them all together and 
then accept we have responsibility as drivers. It’s about safer drivers in 
safer cars on safer roads. It’s a combination of factors. We can do better than 
we are doing at the moment.”

Western Australia recorded one of the worst results, up from 161 the previous 
year and the state’s worst for eight years.

The RAC’s general manager of corporate affairs in WA, Will Golsby, said the 
2016 figure was 16 more than the five-year average and higher than the national 
average.
“Every life lost on WA roads is one too many and each has a lasting ripple 
effect in the community,” Golsby said on Monday. “A preliminary count shows 
that 33 more people were killed on West Australian roads in 2016 than the year 
prior.”
Golsby said the increase was largely attributable to more deaths on regional 
roads and motorcyclist fatalities.

Two more people died in Perth on New Year’s Day.

The latest results do nothing to help Australian governments reach their 
shared goal of a 30% reduction in road deaths between 2011 and 2020.

Chester and his state and territory counterparts met late last year to discuss 
the rising road toll, agreeing it was unacceptable and committing to a greater 
emphasis on safety in infrastructure investment.

The ministerial council also agreed to increase drug-driving testing, and 
strengthen public awareness campaigns on distracted driving.

South Australia managed to improve its road toll in 2016, recording its best 
result on record. The 87 deaths on its roads were 15 fewer than 2015, and below 
the previous record of 94 in 2012. The road safety minister, Peter Malinauskas, 
said it still meant too many people were dying on the roads.

“Road crashes have a devastating impact on families. The pain and emotional 
impact on victims and their loved ones, particularly at this time of year, is 
immeasurable,” Malinauskas said.

“As a community, let’s do what we can to ensure that 2017 is another record 
low for fatalities on our roads,” he said.


The national holiday road toll, starting on 23 December, stood at 33 by Monday 
afternoon.

Eight people had died in NSW, nine in Victoria, six in Queensland

Australia, four in South Australia, one in the Northern Territory and none in 
the ACT or Tasmania.
