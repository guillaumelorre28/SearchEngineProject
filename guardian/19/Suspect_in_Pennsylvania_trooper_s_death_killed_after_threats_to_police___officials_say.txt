The suspect in the fatal shooting of a first-year Pennsylvania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania> trooper was shot and killed 
after making threats to police who located him on Saturday morning, authorities 
said.

Trooper Landon Weaver, 23, was killed responding to a domestic complaint on 
Friday evening in a rural area in Huntingdon County, in central Pennsylvania.

An overnight manhunt for the suspect ended the next morning when police found 
32-year-old Jason Robison at an unoccupied mobile home in the area, authorities 
said.

Cpl Adam Reed, a state police spokesman, said Robison refused orders and 
threatened officers on the scene, leading police to shoot him. His death was 
confirmed at about 10.30am.

Weaver was responding to a reported violation of a protection-from-abuse order 
when he was shot. Details of that complaint were not immediately available, and 
Reed did not know who owned the home where Weaver was killed.

The search for the suspect was focused on an area around the home and nearby 
Raystown Lake.

Weaver, originally from East Freedom in Blair County, was assigned to a patrol 
unit with troop G in Huntingdon. He joined the department in December 2015 and 
graduated from the police academy in June. His survivors include his wife, Reed 
said.

Governor Tom Wolf in a statement said Weaver would be remembered for “his 
bravery, his sacrifice, and his willingness to serve”.

Weaver was the 97th member of the Pennsylvania state police to be killed in 
the line of duty.
