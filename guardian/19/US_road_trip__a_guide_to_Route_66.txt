Route 66 is the quintessential American road trip. No other road has captured 
the imagination and the essence of the American spirit. It has inspired 
musicians, filmmakers and writers, from classic literature (John Steinbeck’s 
The Grapes of Wrath) to Pixar movie Cars and video game Grand Theft Auto. The 
highway’s soundtrack, (Get Your Kicks on) Route 66, written in 1946 by Bobby 
Troup and first recorded by Nat King Cole, has been covered by more than 50 
musicians, from Aerosmith to the UK Subs.

Route 66 was the first highway of its kind. In 1926, the 2,448-mile road was 
designed to be the first trans-continental, year-round highway. It connected 
urban and rural America from Chicago to Los Angeles, crossing eight states and 
three time zones. Like an artery, the “mother road” nurtured communities and 
serviced millions of truckers and road trippers for decades. Families who were 
forced to leave their homes during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, with 
few resources and a little hope, motored west on Route 66 in search of a better 
life. This “road of dreams”, symbolising a pathway to easier times, was one of 
the only US highways to be laid out diagonally. It cut across the country like 
a shortcut to freedom.

Route 66 grew in popularity in the 50s, when vacationers loaded up their 
Airstreams and hit the road to see mom-and-pop trading posts, teepee motels and 
reptile farms. But Dwight Eisenhower’s 1956 Federal Highway Act changed 
everything. The bigger, newer and faster four-lane interstate system bypassed 
Route 66 and was the beginning of its demise. Businesses shut, towns suffered 
from loss of tourism and parts of the route were abandoned altogether. By 1985, 
Route 66 was decommissioned and officially ceased to exist.

Only 85% of the road has survived, but its spirit lives on. In the past 
decade, non-profit organisations and the US National Park Service have 
mobilised efforts and provided grants to protect and preserve what is left. 
Life is percolating through Route 66 once again, and people come from all over 
the world to get their “kicks”. Car enthusiasts ship their classic Mustangs, 
Fords and Chevys across oceans to cruise this iconic road and experience a true 
slice of Americana. The cycle of struggle, triumph, survival and nostalgia is 
laid out around every bend. Today, road trippers will see vintage motels, 
old-school diners, restored gas stations and towns that look frozen in time. 
It’s the trip of a lifetime.

Great bars


11 The Green Mill Cocktail Lounge, Chicago
The Green Mill is the place for late-night jazz and cocktails. It has hosted 
jazz greats since 1907. In the 1920s, it was a mob hangout and Al Capone 
preferred the booth near the curve of the bar. With art deco decor, it still 
has that sophisticated speakeasy vibe. It also hosts one of the longest-running 
poetry slams in the country. It is in Chicago’s Uptown neighbourhood (about 20 
minutes from Route 66) and worth the detour. It has a free parking lot reserved 
for customers from 6pm-6am one block west at Lawrence & Magnolia Street.

12 Hotel Monte Vista Cocktail Lounge, Flagstaff, Arizona


This place was built in 1926, the year Route 66 opened. It’s attached to the 
historic Monte Vista hotel, which exists thanks to local residents raising over 
$200,000 to build it. The Lounge was a speakeasy in the 1920s and hosted 
Humphrey Bogart, Carol Lombard, Gary Cooper, John Wayne and Clark Gable. John 
Wayne allegedly got so drunk here he tried to take his horse into the lift. 
It’s also rumoured to be haunted, with moving bar stools and ghosts that dance. 
Good times.

14-year-old Tanya Tucker played her first gig here. It remains an all-American 
cowboy bar, where folks square dance to national and regional acts. Check the 
website.

14 Dollar Bill Bar, Oatman, Arizona
Oatman is a mining town with wild burros (donkeys) roaming the streets and 
shaking down tourists for treats. They are direct descendants of beasts brought 
to the area by gold miners in the 1800s. This restaurant was built in 1902, and 
Carole Lombard and Clark Gable honeymooned in the hotel upstairs. The walls are 
papered with more than 100,000 dollar bills, a legacy of the times when miners 
would stick a dollar on the wall with their name on it as their tab. Today the 
tradition continues, with tourists leaving signed bills wherever they can find 
a spot.

15 Musso & Frank Grill, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California
Sip sublime martinis while you soak in the history at this bar that has been 
serving Hollywood A-listers since 1919. Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Humphrey 
Bogart and Lauren Bacall lounged in these red-leather booths and hobnobbed with 
literary legends, such as F Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner (he mixed his 
own mint juleps behind the mahogany bar). It’s still a place to see and be seen 
today. The cast and crew of Mad Men held their premier party here, and also 
used it to film the Red in the Face episode – the one where Don gets Roger 
drunk on martinis.
