The Scarman Report is an historic act of affirmation. What it affirms is a 
rational and optimistic approach to the difficulties of absorbing the ethnic 
minorities into the mainstream of British life.

The great evil of the public debate about race has been the habit of mind that 
lumps together all the disparate obstacles to racial integration as a single 
intimidating disorder of the social system, and then prescribes or predicts 
some appropriately apocalyptic outcome: repatriation or black insurrection or a 
violent backlash.

Lord Scarman’s Report breathes the pragmatic spirit of British reform. 
Notwithstanding its judicious tone, its criticism of police behaviour and 
policies is radical. Its recommendations are all the more forceful for being 
couched in the language of restraint and civility. Its success requires an 
unequivocal Government response. Even as it was being formally accepted by Home 
Office Ministers and police chiefs on Wednesday, it was possible to discern the 
first muted rumblings of official dissent from several of its most important 
recommendations. They are now being considered by Whitehall at the same time as 
those of the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee report on racial 
disadvantage.

Talking point

California cults are heading for the hills. Fears of nuclear war, economic 
collapse and imminent Armageddon have set doomsday groups, with tens of 
thousands of followers throughout the American West, stockpiling weapons and 
food.
