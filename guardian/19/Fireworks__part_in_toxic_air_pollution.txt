Delhi was this week blanketed with toxic fog after hundreds of thousands of 
people set off fireworks to mark Diwali (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/toxic-smog-covers-delhi-after-diwali>
, 1 November). The pollution levels were up to 42 times the safe limit and even 
exceeded the normal harmful air in the city from traffic. In Britain, firework 
night and the following day are the peak days for hospital admissions for 
asthma and other breathing problems. Fireworks pollute the air with toxic heavy 
metals such as lead, mercury, aluminium, cadmium and radioactive barium, etc. 
Some of these are used to give fireworks their colours. Smoke from fireworks 
consists of fine toxic dusts that can enter the lungs. Work should be done to 
produce fireworks that are less harmful to health and the environment.

• A couple of days before bonfire night and I’ve just picked a small but 
choice bowl of raspberries and eaten them outside in pleasant sunshine. 
November used to be all baked potatoes and roast chestnuts.
