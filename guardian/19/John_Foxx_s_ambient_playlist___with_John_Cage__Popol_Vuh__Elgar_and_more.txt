Brian Eno gave it a name and mapped much of the territory, an early 
recognition that the need was already in the air – a search for some new 
equivalent to classical music, but one more abstract and spacious, as well as 
intimate and modern, capable of providing a tranquil space in an increasingly 
crowded, pressurised world.

Jazz had fallen into its own set of cliches and conventions, classical 
constantly retrod old ground. Pop and dance music both tended to grab you by 
the lapels. There was a need for something that addressed that other part of 
the spectrum – tranquillity.

This is where it all started, for me and many others. I first heard 
Gymnopédies when I was at art school in 1965 – a beautiful June day, avenue of 
trees at Avenham. A girl I knew played it on the old lecture theatre piano. In 
that moment, the promise of art, youth, joyous tranquility and sunlight on the 
green, green leaves of the colonnade, all combined with the most beautiful 
music I’d ever heard. Changed my little life.

 Cage <https://www.theguardian.com/music/john-cage> was living and working 
through his theories of music as organised noise, sound as a spiritual, 
magnetic field, and art as a Zen awakening. His father, an inventor, had taught 
his son: “If someone says ‘can’t’, that shows you what to do.” That son also 
became an inventor – and he reinvented modern music. I love the range of his 
work and all the stories of his life. This piano music illustrates a tranquil, 
contemplative period. I’m a lifelong subscriber.

A seminal band who, almost inadvertently, invented a new and vital aspect of 
music – the hybrid human/electronic chorale.Popol Vuh 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol_Vuh_(band)> are also a perfect example of 
how technology, music, context and ideas can all mate like cats in heat. At the 
end of the 1960s an inventive band in Germany fortuitously gets an instrument 
that is a little like aMellotron <http://www.mellotron.com/>, but sounds 
different and better – it has better engineering and voice loops, for a start. 
The context is that German postwar youth were frantically remaking their 
culture, having no choice after those toxic war years. All film-makers, 
artists, musicians and writers were firmly in cahoots. A positive revolution.

So, a friend gives Popol Vuh a commission to provide some film music. The film 
wasAguirre, the Wrath of God 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/06/aguirre-the-wrath-of-god-review>, 
the friend was Werner Herzog, and the music – well, this is where electronic 
technologies meet Tallis, where the stage forMusic for Airports 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0TGXz9uqHA> is firmly set, and a long, still 
promising stream of music reaches back to evolutionary infinity and forward to 
technologically enabled choirs of unlimited size, in notional cathedral 
architecture of infinite dimensions. It’s all possible now, so it will be done. 
Popol Vuh were there first.

Tallis <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Tallis> was a contemporary 
of Shakespeare and of equal standing, a British man who wrote music easily as 
wonderful as Palestrina’s in Rome. This was an incredible attainment at that 
time, when we had no visual artists of any real merit, for instance, and no 
sculptors and few architects capable of rivalling the Europeans. Tallis 
explored and developed chant, the most ancient form of human music. He worked 
in the way that all art was made in that time, through intellect, calm 
deliberation and a deep philosophical and technical engagement. He created 
luminous harmonic structures that will last as long as our civilisation.

This is a serious documentation of synthesiser evolution, through the playing 
of pieces that demonstrate the sonic textures unique to each instrument, and
Benge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benge_(musician)> also revels in it all. 
It was the revelling I really liked, because he’d also made a piece of calm, 
beautifully textured sound-as-music. Cage would have loved it. Benge was one of 
the first to understand that the world had abandoned analogue synths for new 
digital technology far too early, before their true potential had been properly 
explored. So he adopted discarded instruments and constructed a safe haven 
laboratory in an east London basement. This is the man who rescued an entire 
genre from a skip.

 Each year the album From Gardens Where We Feel Secure gains even more 
potency, like a piece of found Super 8 film. It’s an unaffected and 
affectionate sonic portrait of a lost summer in Oxfordshire, whereVirginia 
<http://www.virginiaastley.com/> and her brother lived in the sunshine and 
fresh air of their family home. They rode bicycles, recorded owls at night, 
birdsong at dawn, and made music on flute, recorder and piano. It’s where I 
would really like to have lived, but I was lost in a grey and filthy London at 
the time. Oh, how I envied them.

The relationship between voice, architecture and space has fascinated me since 
I was in the school choir and came across a few sonic phenomena – and a few 
emotional and psychic responses – that I’m still learning from.

Chant is architectural music. Music that requires some sort of huge, resonant 
architectural space to interact with. The architecture responds by delaying the 
reflections of the voice, just enough for us to begin to harmonise with those 
delayed reflections as they return to us, and so an exciting and challenging 
harmonic loop is created, which can also lead to thrilling adventures with 
resonant frequencies, multiple delays, standing waves – and which causes that 
contemplative state of being completely atomised and gloriously recreated as 
part of something far bigger than our wee selves. Understandably, religions 
often tend to claim this effect as their own, but it is pursued in many 
religions, all around the world. I prefer to take the secular view, because I 
think it’s actually a normal part of human experience.

Whatever the reasons and causes, we continue to explore these effects – now 
using voices extrapolated from our own, in notional spaces of infinite size, 
all allowed by new electronic technologies. This is where technology mercifully 
becomes a bit like swimming and a bit like landscape gardening.

9. Aphex Twin – Ambient Works 2 (1994)

Aphex <https://www.theguardian.com/music/aphex-twin> took up the ambient thing 
a bit late for my generation, but he was actually evolving the music and 
connecting it to the next generations by importing his own analogue acid 
abstractions and lone explorer ethos. He made superbly minimal and emotionally 
adept pieces, occasionally referencing Brian and Roger Eno’s splendidAn Ending 
(Ascent) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It4WxQ6dnn0>. The bass frequencies in 
these recordings are gorgeous and the recordings are rough and beautiful in a 
way that was, at the time, unfamiliar to hi-fi lovers, and has now become an 
inverse mark of “quality”.

Burial is the natural successor to Aphex – another photo-shy rough diamond, 
the restless side of ambience, even though much of his work veers into a 
fiercer cut-up dubstep. Titles such asRough Sleeper 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4_dzevyFK8>, Fostercare 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTs7KXqZRmA> and Stolen Dog 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIAh5tETh1c> update and return to the true 
urban edge of Britlife at this moment. Listen toIn McDonalds 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXRxNkvswSQ>: you enter a world just under the 
skin of worn-out London, of shiny wet streets, fried-chicken shops, traffic. 
Alone and grateful at 3am. A strange calm after the last tube.

I had to mention these two together – they both move in mysteriously similar 
ways, bringing a sort of Banksyism to the music. They prove that the art of 
inventive instrumental music is alive and living under the floorboards 
everywhere.

This – along with Barber’s Adagio for Strings – is both precursor and 
touchstone of this strange, so called ambient thing. The part of the emotional 
spectrum they address is reflection, pleasurable melancholy, recollection in 
tranquillity. The appropriate visual equivalent might be Turner’s majestic 
skies. We Brits like to pretend we are not much good at art, perhaps being too 
self-conscious, but a merciful strain of absolutely transcendental beauty can 
occasionally break out of our restricted souls.
