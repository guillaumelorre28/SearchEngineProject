<https://www.theguardian.com/business/pearson> jumped after the company 
reported that a restructuring plan should deliver profits of £800m by 2018.

The company’s share price rose more than 5% on Friday morning after it posted 
full-year results for 2015 in line with analysts’ expectations, although sales 
and operating profits were down.

Last month the company announced it would cut 4,000 jobs after issuing its 
second profit warning in three months

Pearson, which sold the Financial Times and its stake in the Economist last 
year, said sales declined in 2015 but were expected to stabilise this year 
before starting to grow in 2017.

The drop in sales is due to declines in textbook sales in the US, where 
college enrolments have decreased. The company posted a 2% drop in operating 
profit to £723m for 2015.

“The cyclical and policy challenges we face in our major markets are 
persisting for longer than we expected,” the chief executive, John Fallon, 
said. Sales would start to stabilise by the end of this year and then “start to 
provide a modest tailwind,” he added.

Pearson said last month it would restructure once again to tackle pressures 
hitting markets from North America to South Africa after it shifted its focus 
to educational publishing. It said the poor performance in emerging markets 
would be addressed by the restructuring announced last month.


Pearson said it expected adjusted operating profit to fall again this year, to 
between £580m and £620m, but added the restructured group should deliver profit 
at or above £800m in 2018.

Roddy Davidson, an analyst at Shore Capital, said the results did not appear 
to contain any significant surprises, coming soon after January’s warning of 
sharp profit falls in 2015 and 2016. He was encouraged to see the company 
intensifying its efforts to solve its financial problems.
