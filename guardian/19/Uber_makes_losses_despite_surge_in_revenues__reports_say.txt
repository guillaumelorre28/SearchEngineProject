The San Francisco-based firm was valued at more than $65bn in a $12.5bn 
fundraising effort earlier this year but has remained secretive about its 
financial performance.

People familiar with the matter said Uber had lost $800m in the third quarter 
and $2.2bn in the first nine months of the financial year,according to Bloomberg

(subscription).

The losses came despite its nine-month revenues surging from $3.76bn to 
$5.5bn, the reports said.

Passengers spent $5.4bn in the third quarter on Uber 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber> fees, which the company splits 
with its drivers, up from $5bn in the second quarter and $3.8bn in the first.

The slowdown in the growth rate of fees comes in the same year that Uber 
agreed toabandon its Chinese business 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/01/uber-china-didi-chuxing> in 
exchange for 17.5% of local rival Didi, which invested $1bn in the US firm as 
part of the agreement.

After paying drivers, Uber’s revenue was $1.7bn in the third quarter, up from 
$1.1bn in the previous three-month period.

Reports that Uber is still deep in the red come days after it admitted it was 
facing a safety setback with its plan to roll outself-driving cars 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/self-driving-cars>.

The company said it had discovered a problem with the way the vehicles cross 
bike lanes, raising serious questions about cyclists’ safety.
