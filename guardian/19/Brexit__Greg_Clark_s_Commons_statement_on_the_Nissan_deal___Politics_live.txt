Greg Clark's Commons statement on Nissan - Summary

Here are the key points from Greg Clark’s Commons statement on Nissan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/nissan>.

 * Clark implied that the government would go into Brexit talks with the EU 
aiming to keep the UK in the customs union. Yesterday he told Andrew Marr that 
the government’s intention was to “have continued access to the markets in 
Europe and vice versa without tariffs and bureaucratic impediments”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/nissan-eu-tariff-free-brexit-sunderland>
Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chair of the Commons Treasury committee (and a 
remain voter) asked him if he accepted that being outside the customs union 
would mean exporters having to comply with rules of origin rules what would 
amount to “bureaucratic impediments”. Clark replied: 
It seems to me why would you not aim as a matter of negotiation to avoid 
bureaucratic impediments. That seems to me common sense. And this is what I set 
out.

Nick Herbert, another pro-remain Tory, later put the same point to Clark. 
Clark replied:

What I was able to say is how you would go into a negotiation. That seems to 
me to find common ground.

 * Clark suggested that the government could seek different trading 
arrangements with the EU for different sectors of the economy.He also implied 
there was a regional element to this. In response to a question from the Labour 
chair of the Commons business committee,Iain Wright, Clark said: 
It seems to that the the approach - not only that I intend to take, but that I 
am already taking - with the firms that are in our economy is to take time to 
meet them to understand the different needs of different sectors, so that we 
can be informed by them, as we form our negotiating mandate. It will be 
different from sector to sector. That’s obviously the case.

My commitment, which we will share when we meet in his committee, is through 
our industrial strategy to make sure that we not only have confidence for 
individual sectors, but individual places as well. Because there is a very 
interesting confluence there, and I think the investment in Nissan is good for 
the sector, and good for Sunderland and the North East.

Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, later put it to 
Clark that his reply to Wright implied some sectors of the economy might be 
offered tariff-free trade with the EU while others would not. Clark did not 
deny this, but just said it was not in his power to decide the outcome of the 
talks.

 * Clark gave details of the four assurances he offered to Nissan. (See 
6.10pm.)

 * He claimed there was no need for him to publish the letter he wrote to the 
firm about the support the government was offering.(See 5.29pm.)

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Clark gives details of four assurances given to Nissan

Here is the key extract from Greg Clark’s opening statement, where he set out 
the four assurances given toNissan <https://www.theguardian.com/business/nissan>
. He told MPs:

Through many conversations I, and my colleagues had, here and in Japan, it 
became clear that four reassurances were important to securing the investment 
for Britain.

Three were about the automotive sector generally and one was about Brexit.

These were

1 - That we would continue our successful and longstanding programme of 
support for the competitiveness of the automotive sector, including Nissan.

This support is available to firms for skills and training of the local 
workforce, for research and development and innovation – in line with EU and UK 
government rules.

Since 2010 the government has invested £400m into the UK automotive sector in 
this way and we will continue to invest hundreds of millions more over the 
coming years.

All proposals of course – from any company – must be underpinned by strong 
business cases and tested against published eligibility criteria. All proposals 
are subject to rigorous external scrutiny by the Independent Industrial 
Development Advisory Board and are reported on to parliament.

2 - We would continue our work with the automotive sector, including Nissan at 
Sunderland, to ensure that more of the supply chain can locate in the UK, and 
in close proximity to the major manufacturing sites. In a previous post I 
established the local growth deals and the city deals which working with Local 
Enterprise Partnerships, have provided a way in which local councils, 
businesses and the government can upgrade the sites, especially sites brought 
into use from dereliction, and to provide the infrastructure for small and 
medium-sized businesses that can supply these major companies. This programme I 
can confirm will continue and with vigour

3 - We would maintain a strong commitment to research and development and in 
particular to the take-up of ultra-low emission vehicles. The opportunities 
presented by bringing the energy and climate change department together with 
the business department make us ideally placed to build on Britain’s strengths 
in low carbon energy, the automotive sector, in science and research and many 
other areas

4 - In our negotiations to leave the EU we will emphasise the very strong 
common ground there is especially in the automotive sector between ourselves 
and other EU member states in ensuring that trade between us can be free and 
unencumbered by impediments.

A good deal for the UK can also be a good deal for other member states, and 
that is how we will approach the negotiations. Whatever the outcome we are 
determined to ensure that the UK continues to be one of the most competitive 
locations in the world for automotive and other advanced manufacturing.

Back in the Commons Greg Clark says that the Brexit talks have not started, 
but that the demeanour the government should adopt should be to seek common 
ground and common interests with EU partners.

Mark Carney to stay on as Bank of England governor until 2019

Turning away from Greg Clark <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/greg-clark> 
for a moment, it has just been announced that Mark Carney will stay on as 
governor of the Bank of England until 2019. That is a year longer than 
originally planned, but not the three-year extension that would have led to him 
serving a normal eight-year term.

My colleague Graeme Wearden has all the details on his business live blog.

Labour’s Dame Rosie Winterton says there is a worry this could be an isolated 
deal. She says a firm in Doncaster has laid workers off, citing Brexit as a

Clark says the regions have an important role to play in industrial strategy.

Here are the key points from Greg Clark’s Commons statement on Nissan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/nissan>.

 * Clark implied that the government would go into Brexit talks with the EU 
aiming to keep the UK in the customs union. Yesterday he told Andrew Marr that 
the government’s intention was to “have continued access to the markets in 
Europe and vice versa without tariffs and bureaucratic impediments”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/nissan-eu-tariff-free-brexit-sunderland>
Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chair of the Commons Treasury committee (and a 
remain voter) asked him if he accepted that being outside the customs union 
would mean exporters having to comply with rules of origin rules what would 
amount to “bureaucratic impediments”. Clark replied: 
It seems to me why would you not aim as a matter of negotiation to avoid 
bureaucratic impediments. That seems to me common sense. And this is what I set 
out.

Nick Herbert, another pro-remain Tory, later put the same point to Clark. 
Clark replied:

What I was able to say is how you would go into a negotiation. That seems to 
me to find common ground.

 * Clark suggested that the government could seek different trading 
arrangements with the EU for different sectors of the economy.He also implied 
there was a regional element to this. In response to a question from the Labour 
chair of the Commons business committee,Iain Wright, Clark said: 
It seems to that the the approach - not only that I intend to take, but that I 
am already taking - with the firms that are in our economy is to take time to 
meet them to understand the different needs of different sectors, so that we 
can be informed by them, as we form our negotiating mandate. It will be 
different from sector to sector. That’s obviously the case.

My commitment, which we will share when we meet in his committee, is through 
our industrial strategy to make sure that we not only have confidence for 
individual sectors, but individual places as well. Because there is a very 
interesting confluence there, and I think the investment in Nissan is good for 
the sector, and good for Sunderland and the North East.

Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, later put it to 
Clark that his reply to Wright implied some sectors of the economy might be 
offered tariff-free trade with the EU while others would not. Clark did not 
deny this, but just said it was not in his power to decide the outcome of the 
talks.

 * Clark gave details of the four assurances he offered to Nissan. (See 
6.10pm.) 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/31/nhs-spending-will-fall-on-a-per-head-basis-before-2020-says-health-committee-chair-politics-live?page=with:block-5817886de4b01c528432eb1f#block-5817886de4b01c528432eb1f>
 * He claimed there was no need for him to publish the letter he wrote to the 
firm about the support the government was offering.(See 5.29pm.)

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.
 
The Clark statement is over. I will post a summary soon.
 
Here is the key extract from Greg Clark’s opening statement, where he set out 
the four assurances given toNissan <https://www.theguardian.com/business/nissan>
. He told MPs:

Through many conversations I, and my colleagues had, here and in Japan, it 
became clear that four reassurances were important to securing the investment 
for Britain.

Three were about the automotive sector generally and one was about Brexit.

These were

1 - That we would continue our successful and longstanding programme of 
support for the competitiveness of the automotive sector, including Nissan.

This support is available to firms for skills and training of the local 
workforce, for research and development and innovation – in line with EU and UK 
government rules.

Since 2010 the government has invested £400m into the UK automotive sector in 
this way and we will continue to invest hundreds of millions more over the 
coming years.

All proposals of course – from any company – must be underpinned by strong 
business cases and tested against published eligibility criteria. All proposals 
are subject to rigorous external scrutiny by the Independent Industrial 
Development Advisory Board and are reported on to parliament.

2 - We would continue our work with the automotive sector, including Nissan at 
Sunderland, to ensure that more of the supply chain can locate in the UK, and 
in close proximity to the major manufacturing sites. In a previous post I 
established the local growth deals and the city deals which working with Local 
Enterprise Partnerships, have provided a way in which local councils, 
businesses and the government can upgrade the sites, especially sites brought 
into use from dereliction, and to provide the infrastructure for small and 
medium-sized businesses that can supply these major companies. This programme I 
can confirm will continue and with vigour

3 - We would maintain a strong commitment to research and development and in 
particular to the take-up of ultra-low emission vehicles. The opportunities 
presented by bringing the energy and climate change department together with 
the business department make us ideally placed to build on Britain’s strengths 
in low carbon energy, the automotive sector, in science and research and many 
other areas

4 - In our negotiations to leave the EU we will emphasise the very strong 
common ground there is especially in the automotive sector between ourselves 
and other EU member states in ensuring that trade between us can be free and 
unencumbered by impediments.

A good deal for the UK can also be a good deal for other member states, and 
that is how we will approach the negotiations. Whatever the outcome we are 
determined to ensure that the UK continues to be one of the most competitive 
locations in the world for automotive and other advanced manufacturing.
 
Back in the Commons Greg Clark says that the Brexit talks have not started, 
but that the demeanour the government should adopt should be to seek common 
ground and common interests with EU partners.
 
Turning away from Greg Clark <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/greg-clark> 
for a moment, it has just been announced that Mark Carney will stay on as 
governor of the Bank of England until 2019. That is a year longer than 
originally planned, but not the three-year extension that would have led to him 
serving a normal eight-year term.

My colleague Graeme Wearden has all the details on his business live blog.

The Conservative Philip Hollobone says this announcement shows that remainers 
who have become remoaners should be more positive.

Clark says this is an announcement we all should celebrate.
 
The Sun’s Steve Hawkes thinks MPs are asking the wrong questions.
steve hawkes (@steve_hawkes) 
Keep waiting for an MP to ask Greg Clark if he is saying no cash promises were 
made - we'd get more if he was speaking to@afneil <https://twitter.com/afneil>

<https://twitter.com/steve_hawkes/status/793148239432343552> 
To be fair the SNP’s Callum McCaig did ask about money. See 5.32pm.

Labour’s Dame Rosie Winterton says there is a worry this could be an isolated 
deal. She says a firm in Doncaster has laid workers off, citing Brexit as a 
factor. So does Clark accept the need for regional impact assessment of Brexit.

Clark says the regions have an important role to play in industrial strategy.
 
Clark says the consequences of positive news like this extend to other sectors 
too.
 
Labour’s Tom Blenkinsop says he welcomes Clark’s adoption of “New Labour-style 
industrial activism”.

Clark says that was a backhanded compliment. He says it was a Conservative 
government that broughtNissan <https://www.theguardian.com/business/nissan> to 
the UK.
 
Here is the Sun’s Steve Hawkes on Clark’s performance.
