Here's a secret. It doesn't always rain in Seattle. Between July and October 
there's nothing but sun. Lots of people in Seattle hate the sun. We burn 
easily, break out in hives, draw the blinds … That's why there is music like 
this, for those who run for the shady spot and can't wait for winter. (Lucy)

There used to be a lot of punk rock clubs in Seattle. Now most of them have 
turned into cocktail lounges where you can get small plates. To share. Punk 
rock does not need small plates. (Lucy)

The peacock at the Woodland Park zoo in Seattle is really loud. Its call can 
be heard a mile away. The Fastbacks were loud too. They played a summer show at 
the zoo once. Not really – they played punk rock shows at punk rock clubs. 
Maybe they're afraid of the sun. (Lucy)

Flop is my favourite band from Seattle. I went to see them more than any other 
group and every show was a blast. Hooks, power, emotion and a beer-soaked 
irreverent attitude, they should have been huge. They are to me. (Chris)

Silkworm started in Montana, ended up in Chicago, but did my favourite stuff 
while they were in Seattle in the 1990s. I don't really think of them for 
individual songs but as an entire package. I picked their first single but it 
could have been any of their songs. They were a really polarising band: people 
either loved them or hated them. Seattle was busy praising a bunch of bullshit 
at the time. (Chris)

I was in this band for a couple years and my good friend Dean is the 
mastermind. I didn't play on the album this song is from, their first. I was 
just a hired hand anyway (who didn't get paid). Awesome songs that are under 
two minutes, verse, chorus, done. One of the top live bands in Seattle 
nowadays. (Chris)

Ellensburg is famous for its yearly rodeo and for Screaming Trees. They were 
the first band I ever saw in Seattle, as an east coast transplant in 1987. I 
have a vision of them on stage, Mark Lanegan flanked by the Conner brothers, 
and the incredible energy they exuded. What a memorable welcome to the Pacific 
Northwest. (Matthew)

preferred the songs that Heather [Lewis] sang. (Matthew)

Georgetown is in the south end of Seattle, near Boeing, so there are always 
planes screaming overhead. It's a lot more attractive nowadays, with loads of 
new bars and shops opening up every year. But in the early 1990s, it was still 
dingy and dirty, with only a few watering holes like the old Jules Maes Saloon. 
The kind of place that made you wish you had a switchblade. But the 
neighbourhood was one of the better places in town you could find cheap studio 
space. This song captures for me how moody and bummed out living through the 
endless Seattle winters can make you. But in a way that you actually like it. 
"There's a plane flying over my head I sure do wish I was on it. This winter's 
almost over, I can feel it getting warmer, I guess I might stay here after 
all." (Barrett)

Everybody's heard this song. But it's so awesome, and sometimes reminds me of 
being a paperboy and delivering newspapers to Nancy Wilson's cool Interlaken 
estate. Sadly, I never caught a glimpse of the guitar rock queen. (Barrett)

Hello, it's 1965. Such handsome lads, what college are they in? Oh, here, says 
they are from Tacoma, but this says it's recorded in neighbouring Seattle. 
Let's listen to "Here Are The Sonics". Oh, my ... it's distorted. Was this 
recorded in a garage? (Barrett)
