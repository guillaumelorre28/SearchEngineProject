Your report (28 November 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/28/men-uk-still-paid-vastly-more-women-gender-pay-gap-study>
) tells us yet again that there is a gender pay gap issue, identifies sectors 
and areas with seemingly the biggest disparities, and reminds us that the 
problem is likely to take 60 years to sort out.

Whatever reports are produced, and whatever entreaties are made, the gender 
pay gap will never go away unless and until something is done to change 
matters. Well-researched, thought-through proposals have been put to employers 
and governments. Some good experiments have been conducted, notably the 
women-only training programmes between 2006 and 2010, which on a shoestring 
budget skilled and/or retrained more than 25,000 women across a variety of 
sectors. Schools should separate girls and boys for the Stem suite of subjects, 
allowing girls to study in the ways proven to be more suitable to them. 
Employers should introduce positive action programmes which would identify and 
bring forward women with the capacity and the desire to move on and up.

None of this costs a fortune, but it does require determination and the 
political will to see change now.

• At the elite level of women’s football in England – the Women’s Super League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/womens-super-league> – there are many 
players who would be happy with the equivalent of “$1,000 and $2,000 a month” (

, Sport, 29 November). Some of them almost play for free. Why? Partly the FA’s 
ludicrous funding model (a soft cap on spending of 40% of revenue) and partly 
the extent to which some teams linked to the men’s Premier League receive huge 
financial support. Small teams – for example, newly promoted Yeovil and Bristol 
Academy – receive little funding.

direct our anger away from the Jams (“just about managing”) and the scroungers 
towards the MQNTYs (“managing quite nicely, thank you”), who maintain their 
power while increasing their income.
