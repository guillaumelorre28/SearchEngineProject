Answers in the Chambers Dictionary except for two proper names. From answers 
to each clue the solver must omit one letter wherever it occurs (often more 
than once) before entry in the diagram. Definitions in the clues refer to full 
unmutilated answers; subsidiary indications, such as anagrams etc, refer to 
mutilated forms to be entered in the diagram. Numbers in brackets show the full 
lengths of unmutilated answers. The letters omitted, read in clue order, form 
an appropriate seasonal quotation, not in the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, 
from which two consecutive words have been omitted. These two words, which have 
been treated like all other entries, appear at 20 and 9 (in that order). 20 has 
a clue like the rest. Competitors should submit with their entries a clue to 9 
in the same style.
