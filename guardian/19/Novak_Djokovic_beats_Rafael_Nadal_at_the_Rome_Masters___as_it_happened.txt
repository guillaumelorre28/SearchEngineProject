In an epic that just made Paris way more interesting, Novak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> saves five set points, beats 
Rafael Nadal 7-5, 7-6(4) in the Rome QFs.

That was a great match. Tough on Nadal but he will take more and more belief 
from pushing Novak so hard. Paris could be really interesting

Best court position Rafa has held vs Novak in a long time. Rafa raised his 
level & made Novak lift late in sets. Both should be happy. RG!!

And here’s the winner:

I held my nerves at the clutch moments. I dropped my serves very early in the 
first and second sets and I didn’t hold my composure then, but I managed to 
come back. It’s a straight-sets win, but it feels like we played five sets.

There were many exciting and entertaining points. I think he played 
high-quality tennis, he tried to step in, tried to play aggressive, but towards 
the end I was a bit more fortunate. I must be very pleased with the way I 
handled myself in the important moments today.

Djokovic wins 7-5, 7-6 (7-4)!

The pair go at each other, at each other, at each other with stunning 
intensity, and it’s a fitting final point after two hours and 24 minutes. 
Djokovic prevails. The worrying thing for his rivals is that perhaps he wasn’t 
quite at his best today – he can get even better as he looks to peak at the 
French Open at the end of this month – but he showed again what a competitor he 
is, and what a match it was with the swings in momentum. And how Nadal played 
his part in that. Djokovic takes the applause of the crowd, Nadal takes his 
leave and is left to ponder a seventh successive defeat by the world No1. But 
Djokovic goes on, as he attempts to warm up for Roland Garros with his sixth 
title of the season. He’ll face either Roger Federer’s conqueror Dominic Thiem 
or Kei Nishikori in tomorrow’s semi-finals.

Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 6-6 Nadal (*denotes next server)

The Campo Centrale patrons roar when Nadal wins the first point. Their 
response is perhaps even louder when he takes the second too. He was 30-0 up in 
his previous service game too before being broken. But no danger of that here. 
40-0 turns into game when Djokovic’s forehand flies long. A tie-break will 
settle this second set.

Second set: Djokovic 7-5, 6-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

That previous game just about sums up Djokovic. When he’s on the ropes he 
somehow finds a way to haul himself up. And this game follows much the same 
narrative. He slumps 0-30 down on serve, before dragging himself back to 40-30, 
allowing himself a celebratory fist pump high above his head after an audacious 
half-volley winner from the baseline. And from there he holds to lead for the 
first time in this second set. Suddenly the pressure is very much on Nadal.

Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 5-5 Nadal (*denotes next server)

There’s been very little giving on Nadal’s serve in this set, can he continue 
that trend when it matters? Here he is serving to level this quarter-final. He 
starts well, 15-0. A high-quality point follows, Djokovic’s drop shots haven’t 
been as good as Nadal’s today – Nadal is able to get to this one too – but 
Djokovic then sends a perfect lob sailing over his opponent. 15-all. They’re on 
level terms again at 30-all, but a great one-two punch combination from Nadal 
gives himset point at 40-30. But it goes begging. Nadal gets another set point 
at his advantage, and after being almost faultless with the drop shot today he 
chips one into the net! Deuce.Advantage Nadal, a third set point. Djokovic 
dismisses that one with a smash deep to Nadal’s right wing. Deuce.Advantage 
Nadal once more, this his fourth set point. Djokovic gets a bit lucky with a 
net cord, it’s enough to put off Nadal, who slices into the net. Deuce.Then a 
fifth set point. And another one goes begging. As the game time clock ticks to 
10 minutes, Nadal frames a forehand. And it’sDjokovic’s first break point of 
the set. And a defiant Djokovic takes it! How that must hurt Nadal.

Second set: Djokovic 7-5, 4-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

So Djokovic must hold serve to keep this set going any longer. At 15-all, 
Nadal jerks at his return, 30-15. The crowd sigh. They want a decider. 30-all. 
Uncle Toni looks animated in the players’ box. But Djokovic’s ace probably 
silences him as the world No1 brings up 40-30. Nadal then hits long.

Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 3-5 Nadal (*denotes next server)

Aaah, eerrgh, aaaaaaaaah, eeeeeeeeergh, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, eeeeeeeeeeergh, the 
pair slug it out from the back of the court. Nadal emerges victorious. 15-0. 
30-0. 30-15, as Nadal can’t dig Djokovic’s fizzing return out from his feet. 
But Djokovic’s next return isn’t one to remember. 40-15. Game Mr Nadal.

Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 2-4 Nadal (*denotes next server)

With Djokovic standing well beyond the baseline, Nadal pulls off a Nadal 
special as he runs around his backhand and wallops a forehand cross-court 
winner. 30-15. The Spaniard backs it up with a sweet half-volley, which the 
crowd appreciate. 40-15. Nadal’s got the crowd whistling in delight on the next 
point too. Game.

Second set: Djokovic 7-5, 2-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

“I think you’re right,” says Simon McMahon re the Murray coach debate. “I’ll 
give Ivan a call and save Andy the bother. I’ve got tickets for the Open the 
week after Wimbledon. We can all celebrate together. The Irn Bru’s on me.”

And this email entitled “Pointless comment from Andrew Benton in Beijing”: 
“Just wondering how Djokovic manages to maintain his hairdo (in the photo) 
under the pressure - guess that goes with the sponsorship. In the men’s game, 
Bjorn Borg surely had to be the best at keeping his hair madness under control 
(and I include beards too). Or are there other contenders?”

Djokovic, by the way, holds with ease.

Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 1-3 Nadal (*denotes next server)

Nadal walks a little gingerly on that foot after losing the opening point of 
his service game. Djokovic then sends an inch-perfect winner down the line. 
0-30. Perhaps the brief break has given Djokovic a chance to regroup. But he 
concedes the next point, 15-30, letting out a frustrated “AAAAH”. He doesn’t 
need to say anything after losing the fourth point as his body language says it 
all. And from 0-30 down Nadal charges to 40-30 up. With a gaping hole to aim 
into, Nadal somehow misses down the line. Deuce. Advantage Nadal. Djokovic nets 
a tricky backhand overhead. Game. He’ll be ruing that missed chance at 0-30.

Second set: Djokovic 7-5, 1-2 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic lets out some frustration with a hold to love of his own. And then 
Nadal calls for the trainer. It’s a problem with his left foot. He’s telling 
the trainer he’s experiencing a lot of pain in the upper part, and doesn’t have 
much feeling near the toes. He decides against a medical time-out though.

Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 0-2 Nadal (*denotes next server)

Nadal backs up the break to love. So after losing a first set lasting over an 
hour, he’s already 2-0 up in the second in the blink of an eye. Djokovic will 
be furious with the way he has conceded the initiative.

For those who think high stakes, drama, quality are somehow only reserved for 
best-of-5, I'll point you to this match forever. BO3 = plenty.

Second set: Djokovic 7-5, 0-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

That set took 71 minutes. 71 minutes. It was a great set of tennis from Nadal 
but he still lost it, which shows the scale of the task against the world No1, 
who’s now won his last 14 sets against the world No5. But this makes things a 
bit more interesting:Nadal breaks to 30 at the start of the second set! 
Djokovic chucks his racket on to the court in disgust and gets a warning from 
the umpire for his efforts.

Djokovic wins the first set 7-5!

Nadal looks on course for a comfortable hold at 30-0, but after conceding the 
third point he’s all at sea on the fourth, perhaps distracted by the wind. 
30-all. Big point this. Will it be set point Djokovic or game point Nadal? Game 
point Nadal, but Djokovic gave it a good go. Djokovic screams in frustration. 
Another long rally on the next point and Nadal throws in a tired-looking 
forehand which limps into the net. Deuce. Another forehand from Nadal that 
doesn’t get more than halfway up the net,advantage Djokovic, set point. A 
nerveless Nadal, under such pressure, pulls off the perfect drop shot. Djokovic 
can do no more than net. Deuce No2. Fearsome hitting from Djokovic andset point 
No2. But it’s his turn to get in on some net-bashing with a weak forehand! 
Deuce No3. Nadal attempts to thread a forehand down the line but he goes long.
Set point No3. Djokovic sends his return wide. Deuce No4. Which becomes set 
point No4. Nadal misses with the first serve, gets the second in, a quite 
fantastic point ensues, Nadal is smashing and scampering all over the place, 
and Djokovic finally comes good after some tete-a-tete at the net! The crowd, 
who’ve been with Nadal up until now, give Djokovic a standing ovation. He 
deserves that.

First set: Djokovic 6-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

“Afternoon Katy,” says Simon McMahon. “Great first set this. But anyway, Andy 
Murray. He seems to change coaches as often as the other top men change their 
shirts. Though it’s not stopped him from being one of the most consistent 
players on the tour, winning two grand slams and Olympic gold, winning 
tournaments and making finals on all surfaces, you wonder what more he could 
achieve if he had the right coach with him all year round, every year. You know 
about these things, who should he go for?” I’d say it’s got to be worth giving 
Ivan Lendl a call. He was the only coach who managed to add that extra edge to 
Murray and make him a grand slam champion. There’s talk Lendl would be open to 
working with Murray again, despite his commitments with the USTA. But he 
wouldn’t agree to the 25 weeks a year that Murray usually wants from a coach. 
It would be fascinating to see them working together again, though, wouldn’t it?

Djokovic, meanwhile, holds comfortably, so once again Nadal must hold his 
serve to stay in this opener.

First set: *Djokovic 5-5 Nadal (*denotes next server)

Djokovic, now pouncing on any short balls, whistles away a winner for 15-all. 
Nadal edges to 30-15. That becomes 40-15 when a string goes on Djokovic’s 
racket on the return. The world No1 runs up to his chair to replace the 
offending item before returning to the baseline and attempting to prolong the 
game. But it doesn’t last much longer. Nadal holds to 15.

First set: Djokovic 5-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

Signs in that previous game that Djokovic is stepping into the court a little 
more, taking more of the initiative and taking a little time away from Nadal. 
Whoever can best keep up that tactic should prevail in this quarter-final. 
Djokovic throws in a double fault to fall 15-30 behind on serve. He recovers to 
30-all and doesn’t look back from there: a mistimed forehand from Nadal and a 
brutal backhand winner from Djokovic – who was seemingly on the back foot - 
brings up the game. Djokovic roars with delight. He liked that shot, as he 
should. Breathtaking. Nadal must hold serve to stay in the set.

First set: *Djokovic 4-4 Nadal (*denotes next server)

Djokovic isn’t in the mood to engage in such lengthy hostilities in this game. 
He gets to 0-15, then 0-30, then 0-40, with a wonderfully hoiked forehand pass 
down the line, after some brilliant improvisation on his previous shot.Three 
break points to get back on level terms. Djokovic spins and slides but can’t 
take the first. He doesn’t take the second either, as Nadal sends down an ace. 
And it’s third time unlucky for Djokovic, as he makes the error. Deuce. Nadal 
makes it four points in a row to get to advantage before Djokovic rifles away 
an unstoppable forehand return winner. Deuce No2.Advantage Djokovic, a fourth 
break point.A wayward forehand from Nadal loops beyond the baseline and 
Djokovic breaks back!

First set: Djokovic 3-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

Another inviting drop shot from Djokovic and Nadal pokes it back for the 
winner. Djokovic shrugs a little as if to say: “What am I supposed to do?” but 
hey, it could be worse. It took him nearly 34 minutes to win a game in his 
third-round match yesterday. 0-15 turns into 0-30 and should really become 
15-40 after an all-out assault from Nadal, but the Spaniard misfires and makes 
the error. So instead it’s 30-all. From there, Djokovic takes the game. 
Actually, no he doesn’t! The umpire scurries out of his chair, checks the mark 
on the clay, and Nadal’s effort was in fact in! Five deuces follow. Djokovic 
has the advantage each time but can’t shake Nadal off. Eventually he does when 
Nadal’s forehand flicks off the top of the net and into the tramlines. After 
over 10 minutes, Djokovic holds. And here’s our match report on Murray’s win 
earlier:

First set: *Djokovic 2-4 Nadal (*denotes next server)

So, Nadal has won eight of the past nine points. That becomes nine of the past 
10 when Djokovic nets a backhand volley. It was the right tactic by the world 
No1, but the execution wasn’t there. 15-0. Nadal then absolutely bludgeons a 
backhand cross-court winner – that’s one for the tournament highlights – 30-0. 
Djokovic reduces his arrears to 30-15 but then gets his footwork wrong, 40-15. 
He lets out a little anger and strikes back to 40-30 but he can’t get the 
following return back into play. Nadal backs up the break.

First set: Djokovic 2-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

Nadal, having won in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, is certainly showing signs of 
improvement after his difficult 2015. Will it be enough to re-establish control 
at Roland Garros in a week and a half’s time? He’s certainly got Djokovic 
rattled in this game, with a winner, drop shot and error from Djokovic.15-40, 
two break points. Nadal only needs one, because Djokovic slams into the net. 
Nadal breaks!

Thwack, whack, thwack, whack, thwack, whack, then Nadal thwacks into the net. 
0-15. Djokovic appears to have the initiative in the second point, but Nadal 
quickly turns defence into attack. 15-all. The sun makes another appearance as 
Nadal nudges 30-15 ahead. A return error from Djokovic makes it 40-15. And 
that’ll be the game. Only three points have gone against the server so far.

First set: Djokovic 2-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

A deep, probing cross-court backhand from Djokovic is too much for Nadal to 
handle, who hits a wild forehand out. The next point is a similar story. And 
Djokovic answers with a love game of his own. There’s not much giving here on 
serve.

First set: *Djokovic 1-1 Nadal (*denotes next server)

The wind may not be the only weather factor for the players this afternoon, as 
rain is forecast. But it’s staying away at the moment, and for a fleeting 
moment the court is bathed in sunshine. It’s Djokovic’s turn to get in on the 
drop shot act but Nadal reads it and puts away a winner. 30-0. 40-0. Game. 
Nadal holds to love.

First set: Djokovic 1-0 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

So, ladies and gentlemen, play is under way, as chapter 49 of Djokovic v Nadal 
begins. The pair engage in a lengthy battle on the first point, they go 
backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards – just feeling each other out, 
really, rather than going for it - and eventually it’s first blood Nadal. 0-15. 
The second point plays out much the same, but this time it’s Nadal who blinks 
first with a backhand that he biffs wide. 15-all. A change in tack on the third 
point as Nadal dinks over a drop shot. 15-30. But Djokovic responds with the 
next one, make that two, make that three points. Game Djokovic.

And here they are. Nadal strides on to court first, followed by Djokovic. Not 
the loudest reception for either of them, but the crowd are being drowned out 
rather by the Star Wars theme music. Djokovic, while waiting for Nadal at the 
net, stretches his limbs, not that he probably needs to given how elastic they 
already are. Then Nadal arrives for the coin toss, which Djokovic wins. The 
world No1 will serve first.

And here’s Murray talking to Sky Sports:

The conditions are extremely difficult, the wind is swirling and changing 
direction. Also there’s no clay on the court, a little bit because of the wind. 
It’s like playing on a hard court. It was difficult, challenging and 
frustrating conditions for both of us. Difficult for us to play great tennis.

I always said from the beginning of my career that clay was the surface I 
enjoyed playing on the most because it was so challenging. I’ve put in a lot of 
hard work to improve my game on the surface and it’s finally paying off. I 
haven’t been in the semis of many of the Masters events on the clay and it 
would be nice to reach my first final here.

Murray will face the French lucky loser Lucas Pouille in tomorrow’s 
semi-finals. His thoughts on that?

He goes for it, he hits a big ball. I practised with him a bit in the 
off-season. He’s one of the better players coming through. He’s taken his 
chance [as a lucky loser]. It’ll be a tricky match. I’d expect him to go out 
and go for his shots.

Preamble

Afternoon! This feels familiar. Today’s Rome Masters quarter-final between 
Novak Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> and Rafael 
Nadal is the 49th time these two have met, a record in the Open era. It’s been 
something of a topsy-turvy rivalry: Nadal dominated in the early years before 
Djokovic pulled off seven wins on the spin, culminating in that quite 
ridiculous Australian Open final victory in 2012, all five hours and 53 minutes 
of it. Nadal, despite his injury problems, responded by taking six of the next 
seven contests but Djokovic wrested back control and has prevailed in 10 of 
their past 11, claiming 13 successive sets.

Fancy a couple more stats? Sure you do. Djokovic and Nadal have created 
something of their own empire in Rome, having combined to win the past 11 
titles. And the game’s best two players on clay have also shared this season’s 
top prizes on the red dirt: Nadal won in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, Djokovic in 
Madrid.

And if you’re not already attacked by stats, both men come into this 
quarter-final having survived testing three-setters yesterday: Nadal battled 
past Nick Kyrgios 6-7, 6-2, 6-4, while Djokovic went nearly 34 minutes without 
winning a game against Thomaz Bellucci before advancing 0-6, 6-3, 6-2. It was 
the first time the world No1 had been bagelled in five years. So perhaps Mr 
Invincible isn’t completely invincible after all.

The players will be on court very soon because: Andy Murray has just wrapped 
up a 6-1, 7-5 win over David Goffin, in a repeat of last year’s Davis Cup final 
match.

Rafael Nadal 7-5, 7-6(4) in the Rome QFs.

That was a great match. Tough on Nadal but he will take more and more belief 
from pushing Novak so hard. Paris could be really interesting

Best court position Rafa has held vs Novak in a long time. Rafa raised his 
level & made Novak lift late in sets. Both should be happy. RG!!

<https://twitter.com/darren_cahill/status/731168035181056002>  
And here’s the winner:

I held my nerves at the clutch moments. I dropped my serves very early in the 
first and second sets and I didn’t hold my composure then, but I managed to 
come back. It’s a straight-sets win, but it feels like we played five sets.

There were many exciting and entertaining points. I think he played 
high-quality tennis, he tried to step in, tried to play aggressive, but towards 
the end I was a bit more fortunate. I must be very pleased with the way I 
handled myself in the important moments today.
 
The pair go at each other, at each other, at each other with stunning 
intensity, and it’s a fitting final point after two hours and 24 minutes. 
Djokovic prevails. The worrying thing for his rivals is that perhaps he wasn’t 
quite at his best today – he can get even better as he looks to peak at the 
French Open at the end of this month – but he showed again what a competitor he 
is, and what a match it was with the swings in momentum. And how Nadal played 
his part in that. Djokovic takes the applause of the crowd, Nadal takes his 
leave and is left to ponder a seventh successive defeat by the world No1. But 
Djokovic goes on, as he attempts to warm up for Roland Garros with his sixth 
title of the season. He’ll face either Roger Federer’s conqueror Dominic Thiem 
or Kei Nishikori in tomorrow’s semi-finals.

Second set tie-break: Djokovic 6-4 Nadal*

And again, Djokovic has an answer! A forehand down the line brings up match 
point
 
Second set tie-break: Djokovic 5-4 Nadal*

Again, Nadal gets the mini-break back! 
 
Second set tie-break: *Djokovic 5-3 Nadal

Djokovic, though, still with the mini-break, edges further ahead when Nadal 
misses with the smash

 
Second set tie-break: *Djokovic 4-3 Nadal

The pair change ends before Djokovic sends his return long
 
Second set tie-break: Djokovic 4-2 Nadal*

Not for long, however, as a brutal cross-court exchange ends when Nadal goes 
the other way and makes the mistake
 
Second set tie-break: Djokovic 3-2 Nadal*

Some brilliance from Nadal at the net and we’re back on serve
 
Second set tie-break: *Djokovic 3-1 Nadal

Djokovic charges forward and eventually settles matters despite some 
determined defence from Nadal
 
Second set tie-break: *Djokovic 2-1 Nadal

Djokovic gets the first mini-break when Nadal’s effort skids just wide
 
Second set tie-break: Djokovic 1-1 Nadal*

Nadal bosses the point, forcing Djokovic to net
 
Second set tie-break: Djokovic 1-0 Nadal*

Djokovic darts a forehand winner past a scampering Nadal
 
Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 6-6 Nadal (*denotes next server)

The Campo Centrale patrons roar when Nadal wins the first point. Their 
response is perhaps even louder when he takes the second too. He was 30-0 up in 
his previous service game too before being broken. But no danger of that here. 
40-0 turns into game when Djokovic’s forehand flies long. A tie-break will 
settle this second set.
 
Second set: Djokovic 7-5, 6-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

That previous game just about sums up Djokovic. When he’s on the ropes he 
somehow finds a way to haul himself up. And this game follows much the same 
narrative. He slumps 0-30 down on serve, before dragging himself back to 40-30, 
allowing himself a celebratory fist pump high above his head after an audacious 
half-volley winner from the baseline. And from there he holds to lead for the 
first time in this second set. Suddenly the pressure is very much on Nadal.

Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 5-5 Nadal (*denotes next server)

There’s been very little giving on Nadal’s serve in this set, can he continue 
that trend when it matters? Here he is serving to level this quarter-final. He 
starts well, 15-0. A high-quality point follows, Djokovic’s drop shots haven’t 
been as good as Nadal’s today – Nadal is able to get to this one too – but 
Djokovic then sends a perfect lob sailing over his opponent. 15-all. They’re on 
level terms again at 30-all, but a great one-two punch combination from Nadal 
gives himset point at 40-30. But it goes begging. Nadal gets another set point 
at his advantage, and after being almost faultless with the drop shot today he 
chips one into the net! Deuce.Advantage Nadal, a third set point. Djokovic 
dismisses that one with a smash deep to Nadal’s right wing. Deuce.Advantage 
Nadal once more, this his fourth set point. Djokovic gets a bit lucky with a 
net cord, it’s enough to put off Nadal, who slices into the net. Deuce.Then a 
fifth set point. And another one goes begging. As the game time clock ticks to 
10 minutes, Nadal frames a forehand. And it’sDjokovic’s first break point of 
the set. And a defiant Djokovic takes it! How that must hurt Nadal.
 
Second set: Djokovic 7-5, 4-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

So Djokovic must hold serve to keep this set going any longer. At 15-all, 
Nadal jerks at his return, 30-15. The crowd sigh. They want a decider. 30-all. 
Uncle Toni looks animated in the players’ box. But Djokovic’s ace probably 
silences him as the world No1 brings up 40-30. Nadal then hits long.
 
Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 3-5 Nadal (*denotes next server)

Aaah, eerrgh, aaaaaaaaah, eeeeeeeeergh, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, eeeeeeeeeeergh, the 
pair slug it out from the back of the court. Nadal emerges victorious. 15-0. 
30-0. 30-15, as Nadal can’t dig Djokovic’s fizzing return out from his feet. 
But Djokovic’s next return isn’t one to remember. 40-15. Game Mr Nadal.
 
Second set: Djokovic 7-5, 3-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic holds to 15 too, finishing things off with a two-fisted backhand 
drive volley.
 
Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 2-4 Nadal (*denotes next server)

With Djokovic standing well beyond the baseline, Nadal pulls off a Nadal 
special as he runs around his backhand and wallops a forehand cross-court 
winner. 30-15. The Spaniard backs it up with a sweet half-volley, which the 
crowd appreciate. 40-15. Nadal’s got the crowd whistling in delight on the next 
point too. Game.

Second set: Djokovic 7-5, 2-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

“I think you’re right,” says Simon McMahon re the Murray coach debate. “I’ll 
give Ivan a call and save Andy the bother. I’ve got tickets for the Open the 
week after Wimbledon. We can all celebrate together. The Irn Bru’s on me.”

And this email entitled “Pointless comment from Andrew Benton in Beijing”: 
“Just wondering how Djokovic manages to maintain his hairdo (in the photo) 
under the pressure - guess that goes with the sponsorship. In the men’s game, 
Bjorn Borg surely had to be the best at keeping his hair madness under control 
(and I include beards too). Or are there other contenders?”

Djokovic, by the way, holds with ease.
 
Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 1-3 Nadal (*denotes next server)

Nadal walks a little gingerly on that foot after losing the opening point of 
his service game. Djokovic then sends an inch-perfect winner down the line. 
0-30. Perhaps the brief break has given Djokovic a chance to regroup. But he 
concedes the next point, 15-30, letting out a frustrated “AAAAH”. He doesn’t 
need to say anything after losing the fourth point as his body language says it 
all. And from 0-30 down Nadal charges to 40-30 up. With a gaping hole to aim 
into, Nadal somehow misses down the line. Deuce. Advantage Nadal. Djokovic nets 
a tricky backhand overhead. Game. He’ll be ruing that missed chance at 0-30.

Second set: Djokovic 7-5, 1-2 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic lets out some frustration with a hold to love of his own. And then 
Nadal calls for the trainer. It’s a problem with his left foot. He’s telling 
the trainer he’s experiencing a lot of pain in the upper part, and doesn’t have 
much feeling near the toes. He decides against a medical time-out though.
 
Second set: *Djokovic 7-5, 0-2 Nadal (*denotes next server)

Nadal backs up the break to love. So after losing a first set lasting over an 
hour, he’s already 2-0 up in the second in the blink of an eye. Djokovic will 
be furious with the way he has conceded the initiative.
Ben Rothenberg (@BenRothenberg) 
For those who think high stakes, drama, quality are somehow only reserved for 
best-of-5, I'll point you to this match forever. BO3 = plenty.

<https://twitter.com/BenRothenberg/status/731149744039444480>  
Second set: Djokovic 7-5, 0-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

That set took 71 minutes. 71 minutes. It was a great set of tennis from Nadal 
but he still lost it, which shows the scale of the task against the world No1, 
who’s now won his last 14 sets against the world No5. But this makes things a 
bit more interesting:Nadal breaks to 30 at the start of the second set! 
Djokovic chucks his racket on to the court in disgust and gets a warning from 
the umpire for his efforts.
 
Nadal looks on course for a comfortable hold at 30-0, but after conceding the 
third point he’s all at sea on the fourth, perhaps distracted by the wind. 
30-all. Big point this. Will it be set point Djokovic or game point Nadal? Game 
point Nadal, but Djokovic gave it a good go. Djokovic screams in frustration. 
Another long rally on the next point and Nadal throws in a tired-looking 
forehand which limps into the net. Deuce. Another forehand from Nadal that 
doesn’t get more than halfway up the net,advantage Djokovic, set point. A 
nerveless Nadal, under such pressure, pulls off the perfect drop shot. Djokovic 
can do no more than net. Deuce No2. Fearsome hitting from Djokovic andset point 
No2. But it’s his turn to get in on some net-bashing with a weak forehand! 
Deuce No3. Nadal attempts to thread a forehand down the line but he goes long.
Set point No3. Djokovic sends his return wide. Deuce No4. Which becomes set 
point No4. Nadal misses with the first serve, gets the second in, a quite 
fantastic point ensues, Nadal is smashing and scampering all over the place, 
and Djokovic finally comes good after some tete-a-tete at the net! The crowd, 
who’ve been with Nadal up until now, give Djokovic a standing ovation. He 
deserves that.

First set: Djokovic 6-5 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

“Afternoon Katy,” says Simon McMahon. “Great first set this. But anyway, Andy 
Murray. He seems to change coaches as often as the other top men change their 
shirts. Though it’s not stopped him from being one of the most consistent 
players on the tour, winning two grand slams and Olympic gold, winning 
tournaments and making finals on all surfaces, you wonder what more he could 
achieve if he had the right coach with him all year round, every year. You know 
about these things, who should he go for?” I’d say it’s got to be worth giving 
Ivan Lendl a call. He was the only coach who managed to add that extra edge to 
Murray and make him a grand slam champion. There’s talk Lendl would be open to 
working with Murray again, despite his commitments with the USTA. But he 
wouldn’t agree to the 25 weeks a year that Murray usually wants from a coach. 
It would be fascinating to see them working together again, though, wouldn’t it?

Djokovic, meanwhile, holds comfortably, so once again Nadal must hold his 
serve to stay in this opener.
 
First set: *Djokovic 5-5 Nadal (*denotes next server)

Djokovic, now pouncing on any short balls, whistles away a winner for 15-all. 
Nadal edges to 30-15. That becomes 40-15 when a string goes on Djokovic’s 
racket on the return. The world No1 runs up to his chair to replace the 
offending item before returning to the baseline and attempting to prolong the 
game. But it doesn’t last much longer. Nadal holds to 15.
 
First set: Djokovic 5-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

Signs in that previous game that Djokovic is stepping into the court a little 
more, taking more of the initiative and taking a little time away from Nadal. 
Whoever can best keep up that tactic should prevail in this quarter-final. 
Djokovic throws in a double fault to fall 15-30 behind on serve. He recovers to 
30-all and doesn’t look back from there: a mistimed forehand from Nadal and a 
brutal backhand winner from Djokovic – who was seemingly on the back foot - 
brings up the game. Djokovic roars with delight. He liked that shot, as he 
should. Breathtaking. Nadal must hold serve to stay in the set.
 
First set: *Djokovic 4-4 Nadal (*denotes next server)

Djokovic isn’t in the mood to engage in such lengthy hostilities in this game. 
He gets to 0-15, then 0-30, then 0-40, with a wonderfully hoiked forehand pass 
down the line, after some brilliant improvisation on his previous shot.Three 
break points to get back on level terms. Djokovic spins and slides but can’t 
take the first. He doesn’t take the second either, as Nadal sends down an ace. 
And it’s third time unlucky for Djokovic, as he makes the error. Deuce. Nadal 
makes it four points in a row to get to advantage before Djokovic rifles away 
an unstoppable forehand return winner. Deuce No2.Advantage Djokovic, a fourth 
break point.A wayward forehand from Nadal loops beyond the baseline and 
Djokovic breaks back!
 
First set: Djokovic 3-4 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

Another inviting drop shot from Djokovic and Nadal pokes it back for the 
winner. Djokovic shrugs a little as if to say: “What am I supposed to do?” but 
hey, it could be worse. It took him nearly 34 minutes to win a game in his 
third-round match yesterday. 0-15 turns into 0-30 and should really become 
15-40 after an all-out assault from Nadal, but the Spaniard misfires and makes 
the error. So instead it’s 30-all. From there, Djokovic takes the game. 
Actually, no he doesn’t! The umpire scurries out of his chair, checks the mark 
on the clay, and Nadal’s effort was in fact in! Five deuces follow. Djokovic 
has the advantage each time but can’t shake Nadal off. Eventually he does when 
Nadal’s forehand flicks off the top of the net and into the tramlines. After 
over 10 minutes, Djokovic holds. And here’s our match report on Murray’s win 
earlier:

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/andy-murray-david-goffin-rome-masters> 
First set: *Djokovic 2-4 Nadal (*denotes next server)

So, Nadal has won eight of the past nine points. That becomes nine of the past 
10 when Djokovic nets a backhand volley. It was the right tactic by the world 
No1, but the execution wasn’t there. 15-0. Nadal then absolutely bludgeons a 
backhand cross-court winner – that’s one for the tournament highlights – 30-0. 
Djokovic reduces his arrears to 30-15 but then gets his footwork wrong, 40-15. 
He lets out a little anger and strikes back to 40-30 but he can’t get the 
following return back into play. Nadal backs up the break.

First set: Djokovic 2-3 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

Nadal, having won in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, is certainly showing signs of 
improvement after his difficult 2015. Will it be enough to re-establish control 
at Roland Garros in a week and a half’s time? He’s certainly got Djokovic 
rattled in this game, with a winner, drop shot and error from Djokovic.15-40, 
two break points. Nadal only needs one, because Djokovic slams into the net. 
Nadal breaks!
 
First set: *Djokovic 2-2 Nadal (*denotes next server)

Thwack, whack, thwack, whack, thwack, whack, then Nadal thwacks into the net. 
0-15. Djokovic appears to have the initiative in the second point, but Nadal 
quickly turns defence into attack. 15-all. The sun makes another appearance as 
Nadal nudges 30-15 ahead. A return error from Djokovic makes it 40-15. And 
that’ll be the game. Only three points have gone against the server so far.
 
First set: Djokovic 2-1 Nadal* (*denotes next server)

A deep, probing cross-court backhand from Djokovic is too much for Nadal to 
handle, who hits a wild forehand out. The next point is a similar story. And 
Djokovic answers with a love game of his own. There’s not much giving here on 
serve.

First set: *Djokovic 1-1 Nadal (*denotes next server)

The wind may not be the only weather factor for the players this afternoon, as 
rain is forecast. But it’s staying away at the moment, and for a fleeting 
moment the court is bathed in sunshine. It’s Djokovic’s turn to get in on the 
drop shot act but Nadal reads it and puts away a winner. 30-0. 40-0. Game. 
Nadal holds to love.

So, ladies and gentlemen, play is under way, as chapter 49 of Djokovic v Nadal 
begins. The pair engage in a lengthy battle on the first point, they go 
backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards – just feeling each other out, 
really, rather than going for it - and eventually it’s first blood Nadal. 0-15. 
The second point plays out much the same, but this time it’s Nadal who blinks 
first with a backhand that he biffs wide. 15-all. A change in tack on the third 
point as Nadal dinks over a drop shot. 15-30. But Djokovic responds with the 
next one, make that two, make that three points. Game Djokovic.
 
Tik, tok, tikity, tok, they’re warming up. In the meantime, some thoughts on 
Murray’s progress:

And here they are. Nadal strides on to court first, followed by Djokovic. Not 
the loudest reception for either of them, but the crowd are being drowned out 
rather by the Star Wars theme music. Djokovic, while waiting for Nadal at the 
net, stretches his limbs, not that he probably needs to given how elastic they 
already are. Then Nadal arrives for the coin toss, which Djokovic wins. The 
world No1 will serve first.
 
While we wait for Djokovic and Nadal, hopefully this will get you in the mood

And here’s Murray talking to Sky Sports:

The conditions are extremely difficult, the wind is swirling and changing 
direction. Also there’s no clay on the court, a little bit because of the wind. 
It’s like playing on a hard court. It was difficult, challenging and 
frustrating conditions for both of us. Difficult for us to play great tennis.

I always said from the beginning of my career that clay was the surface I 
enjoyed playing on the most because it was so challenging. I’ve put in a lot of 
hard work to improve my game on the surface and it’s finally paying off. I 
haven’t been in the semis of many of the Masters events on the clay and it 
would be nice to reach my first final here.

Murray will face the French lucky loser Lucas Pouille in tomorrow’s 
semi-finals. His thoughts on that?

He goes for it, he hits a big ball. I practised with him a bit in the 
off-season. He’s one of the better players coming through. He’s taken his 
chance [as a lucky loser]. It’ll be a tricky match. I’d expect him to go out 
and go for his shots.
 
Afternoon! This feels familiar. Today’s Rome Masters quarter-final between 
Novak Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> and Rafael 
Nadal is the 49th time these two have met, a record in the Open era. It’s been 
something of a topsy-turvy rivalry: Nadal dominated in the early years before 
Djokovic pulled off seven wins on the spin, culminating in that quite 
ridiculous Australian Open final victory in 2012, all five hours and 53 minutes 
of it. Nadal, despite his injury problems, responded by taking six of the next 
seven contests but Djokovic wrested back control and has prevailed in 10 of 
their past 11, claiming 13 successive sets.

Fancy a couple more stats? Sure you do. Djokovic and Nadal have created 
something of their own empire in Rome, having combined to win the past 11 
titles. And the game’s best two players on clay have also shared this season’s 
top prizes on the red dirt: Nadal won in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, Djokovic in 
Madrid.

And if you’re not already attacked by stats, both men come into this 
quarter-final having survived testing three-setters yesterday: Nadal battled 
past Nick Kyrgios 6-7, 6-2, 6-4, while Djokovic went nearly 34 minutes without 
winning a game against Thomaz Bellucci before advancing 0-6, 6-3, 6-2. It was 
the first time the world No1 had been bagelled in five years. So perhaps Mr 
Invincible isn’t completely invincible after all.

The players will be on court very soon because: Andy Murray has just wrapped 
up a 6-1, 7-5 win over David Goffin, in a repeat of last year’s Davis Cup final 
match.
