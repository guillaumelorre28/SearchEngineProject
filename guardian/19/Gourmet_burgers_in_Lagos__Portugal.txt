Visitors to Lagos’s buzzing old town, who crave something different from the 
usual Algarve offering of fresh fish served with veg that evokes memories of 
primary school (over-boiled spuds, dissolved broccoli), are in for a treat. A 
top-notch gourmet burger, or maybe a pulled-pork taco, might hit the spot like 
never before. Such treats are nothing new in big cities, of course, but when 
Selmo and Abigail Ribeiro started up Nah Nah Bah in Lagos in 2005 – while they 
were still in their early 20s – such fare was a radical departure in these 
parts.

 Nah Nah Bah, Lagos, Portugal. 
Vibrant plates of food – superb burgers zinging with jalapeño, lime juice and 
a riot of other bright flavours – are accompanied by an upbeat, selective 
soundtrack: Selmo’s personal choice of funk (Renegades Of Jazz), reggae (Black 
Uhuru) and hip hop (Mace) playlists. Fans of melancholy Portuguesefado music 
may quail, but upbeat music and food are invigorating after a day in the surf. 
Meanwhile, the chips, hand cut, lightly fried and tossed in garlic aioli and 
herbs, were so good I laughed.

Selmo hovers around – part-chef, part-waiter, part-DJ, part-PR man. He’s got a 
hostel, too: the, ahem, Rising Cock that seems to be pulling in a young, surfy, 
quite often Aussie crowd. But if he was thinking Nah Nah Bah would attract only 
the bronzed and youthful, he was wrong – I was there, for starters, and Carole 
King, too (well, the dim lighting had played tricks with my eyes as it turned 
out).

The yellow-and-green decor matches the ethos: tropical and energised. There’s 
no outdoor seating so everyone crams together inside. Maximum use is made of 
the space: the open kitchen, with its chefs working in a blur of motion and 
flame, is part of the experience. The place is loud but young kids seem fine 
with it, while their parents play “name that tune”.

Travel website Matador Network 
<http://matadornetwork.com/nights/international-cow-50-of-the-most-amazing-burger-joints-in-the-world/>
 lists Nah Nah Bah as one of its 50 “most amazing burger joints in the world”. 
Do believe the hype.
