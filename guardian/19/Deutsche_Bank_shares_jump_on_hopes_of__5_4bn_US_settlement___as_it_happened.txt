Wall Street closes higher as Deutsche fears fade

The closing bell has rung in New York, signalling the end of the trading day, 
the week, the month and indeed the quarter.

And shares have finished higher, after a wild old day in the markets.

The Dow Jones has finished up 163 points, of 0.9%, at 18,306 points.

Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained 0.8%.

Financial stocks led the rally following those reports that Deutsche could 
receive a fine of just $5.4bn from the DoJ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/30/deutsche-bank-fears-stock-markets-shares-slide-business-live?page=with:block-57ee823be4b0ab00630868d5#block-57ee823be4b0ab00630868d5>
; much less than the opening shot of $14bn.

Deutsche Bank’s US-listed securities closed up around 14%, clawing back all 
yesterday’s losses, and more.

Traders seem to have concluded that the panic that gripped the markets 27 
hours ago, following reports of hedge funds cutting exposure to DB, was 
overdone.

But still, the health of the German banking giant is still the main story; and 
remember, we still don’t have any confirmation that a deal with the DoJ is 
imminent.

As Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York, 
puts it:

“We are very much being driven by headline risks at Deutsche Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank>.”

And that really is for tonight, unless that deal comes soon.....

Nothing momentous to report yet.... but with one hour’s trading to go, 
Deutsche Bank’s US shares are still up a mighty 15% tonight.

That means investors are still clinging to hopes that the bank will secure a 
DoJ fine that doesn’t wipe out its capital base.

The excitable talk about a new Lehman Brothers moment has also calmed down, as 
traders digest the fact that Deutsche has a lot of assets, and plenty of 
liquidity too.

Elsewhere, in a week when Opec looked like it was on track to curb output to 
support oil prices, US drillers continued to bring more rigs on stream.

The weekly Baker Hughes report showed:

US Baker Hughes Rig Count: 522 (prev 511)
- Oil Rigs: +7 to 425 (prev 418)
- Gas Rigs: +4 to 96 (prev 92)

<https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/781901710658707457> 
US oil rigs rose this quarter by the largest amount in two years, according to 
the report.

On that note, and with Deutsche Bank’s US shares now up 14%, it’s time to 
close for the evening, although we’ll try and pop back in to cover any 
momentous events should they occur. Otherwise, thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Turnaround for markets in volatile trading

Investors in Deutsche Bank <https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank> 
must be feeling giddy after the wild gyrations in the bank’s share price in the 
course of just one day.

An early 10% slump followed reports that a number of hedge funds had cut their 
exposure to the bank. But reassurance from Deutsche chief executive John Cryan 
that the bank had strong fundamentals helped limit some of the damage, and the 
shares really surged near the end of the trading day on talk its US fine - the 
cause of much of the recent gloom around the bank - might be reduced from $14bn 
to around $5.4bn.

So Deutsche’s German shares ended up 6.39% on the day at €11.57. The US shares 
are currently up 13%.

The rebound dragged the financial sector and indeed most of Europe’s markets 
into positive territory after their early falls. But the FTSE 100 failed to 
regain all its lost ground. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 fell 20.09 points or 0.29% at 6899.33, although the index is 
up 1.69% on the month and 6% on the quarter 
 * Germany’s Dax added 1.01% to 10511.02 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.1% higher at 4448.26 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.38% to 16401.00 
 * But Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.19% at 8779.4 
 * In Athens, the Greek market dipped 0.48% to 565.53 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 171 points or 
0.9%.

Deutsche Bank shares jump on hopes of US settlement

Another report is doing the rounds suggesting that Deutsche Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank> may only pay $5.4bn in a 
settlement with the US Department of Justice, rather than the $14bn initially 
suggested.

AFP has reported the bank is close to a settlement, and even though the $5.4bn 
figure is the same as ina JP Morgan note for non-US loans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/30/deutsche-bank-fears-stock-markets-shares-slide-business-live?page=with:block-57ee6fcee4b05962fdf49891#block-57ee6fcee4b05962fdf49891>
, the bank’s shares have moved sharply higher.

The Department of Justice is not commenting, but Deutsche Bank chief executive 
John Cryan is still in the US so a deal is not implausible. The bank is also 
not commenting, according to Reuters.

The banks’s US shares are up 13% while the German shares have added 6% after 
their earlier slump.

The closing bell has rung in New York, signalling the end of the trading day, 
the week, the month and indeed the quarter.

And shares have finished higher, after a wild old day in the markets.

The Dow Jones has finished up 163 points, of 0.9%, at 18,306 points.

Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained 0.8%.

Financial stocks led the rally following those reports that Deutsche could 
receive a fine of just $5.4bn from the DoJ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/30/deutsche-bank-fears-stock-markets-shares-slide-business-live?page=with:block-57ee823be4b0ab00630868d5#block-57ee823be4b0ab00630868d5>
; much less than the opening shot of $14bn.

Deutsche Bank’s US-listed securities closed up around 14%, clawing back all 
yesterday’s losses, and more.

Traders seem to have concluded that the panic that gripped the markets 27 
hours ago, following reports of hedge funds cutting exposure to DB, was 
overdone.

But still, the health of the German banking giant is still the main story; and 
remember, we still don’t have any confirmation that a deal with the DoJ is 
imminent.

As Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York, 
puts it:

“We are very much being driven by headline risks at Deutsche Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank>.”

And that really is for tonight, unless that deal comes soon.....

Nothing momentous to report yet.... but with one hour’s trading to go, 
Deutsche Bank’s US shares are still up a mighty 15% tonight.

That means investors are still clinging to hopes that the bank will secure a 
DoJ fine that doesn’t wipe out its capital base.

The excitable talk about a new Lehman Brothers moment has also calmed down, as 
traders digest the fact that Deutsche has a lot of assets, and plenty of 
liquidity too.
 
Elsewhere, in a week when Opec looked like it was on track to curb output to 
support oil prices, US drillers continued to bring more rigs on stream.

The weekly Baker Hughes report showed:

US Baker Hughes Rig Count: 522 (prev 511)
- Oil Rigs: +7 to 425 (prev 418)
- Gas Rigs: +4 to 96 (prev 92)

US oil rigs rose this quarter by the largest amount in two years, according to 
the report.

On that note, and with Deutsche Bank’s US shares now up 14%, it’s time to 
close for the evening, although we’ll try and pop back in to cover any 
momentous events should they occur. Otherwise, thanks for all your comments, 
and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Buying Deutsche Bank shares at 9.30am would have been a lucrative day's work:

Investors in Deutsche Bank <https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank> 
must be feeling giddy after the wild gyrations in the bank’s share price in the 
course of just one day.

An early 10% slump followed reports that a number of hedge funds had cut their 
exposure to the bank. But reassurance from Deutsche chief executive John Cryan 
that the bank had strong fundamentals helped limit some of the damage, and the 
shares really surged near the end of the trading day on talk its US fine - the 
cause of much of the recent gloom around the bank - might be reduced from $14bn 
to around $5.4bn.

So Deutsche’s German shares ended up 6.39% on the day at €11.57. The US shares 
are currently up 13%.

The rebound dragged the financial sector and indeed most of Europe’s markets 
into positive territory after their early falls. But the FTSE 100 failed to 
regain all its lost ground. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 fell 20.09 points or 0.29% at 6899.33, although the index is 
up 1.69% on the month and 6% on the quarter 
 * Germany’s Dax added 1.01% to 10511.02 
 * France’s Cac climbed 0.1% higher at 4448.26 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.38% to 16401.00 
 * But Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.19% at 8779.4 
 * In Athens, the Greek market dipped 0.48% to 565.53 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 171 points or 
0.9%.

Another report is doing the rounds suggesting that Deutsche Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank> may only pay $5.4bn in a 
settlement with the US Department of Justice, rather than the $14bn initially 
suggested.

AFP has reported the bank is close to a settlement, and even though the $5.4bn 
figure is the same as ina JP Morgan note for non-US loans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/30/deutsche-bank-fears-stock-markets-shares-slide-business-live?page=with:block-57ee6fcee4b05962fdf49891#block-57ee6fcee4b05962fdf49891>
, the bank’s shares have moved sharply higher.

The Department of Justice is not commenting, but Deutsche Bank chief executive 
John Cryan is still in the US so a deal is not implausible. The bank is also 
not commenting, according to Reuters.

The banks’s US shares are up 13% while the German shares have added 6% after 
their earlier slump.
