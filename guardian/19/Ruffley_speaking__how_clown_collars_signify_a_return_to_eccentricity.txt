Calling Pennywise of the forthcoming It reboot a style icon feels like a bit 
of a stretch. Not least because he’s a murderous clown, but because there’s 
barely a ruffle in the poster and in your bid to dress like a clown, ruffles 
are the crux.

Clown collars are the latest accoutrement to shift from stage-wear to shop. 
Think of the clown collar as a souped up choker which still feel a bit Y2K 
however you wear it. Some commitment is required. You can go fashion in peach 
J.W. Anderson inspired by Katharine Hepburn in 1935’s Sylvia Scarlett, or cream 
and clustered like Jane Fonda at the Golden Globes who lent towards Susan 
Forristal in Patou. Undercover’s Jun Takahashi went the whole hog showing 
models with ruffles, clown make up and medieval draping. Or you can wear your 
collar round your shoulders, as seen in this Vetements-inspired dress at 
Topshop.

The styling looks laughable on paper, not least because of the silhouette. But 
there could be a dual meaning. That fashion week is, as Suzy Menkes wrote in 
her now seminal New York Timesessay 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/t-magazine/the-circus-of-fashion.html?_r=0>, 
a circus, as the attendees ramp up their attempts to get noticed, be noticed 
and be photographed by wearing increasingly absurd outfits. And that this 
pushed the fashion pack against the “mob rule” and into hyper-minimal 
background dressing – see Celine and Chloe and 3/5 of the fashion world who now 
stick to a uniform monocolour – aka “black crows”. Dressing as a clown feels 
likes it’s winking at the in-joke, that fashion could be reclaiming its 
eccentricity and the clown collar is semaphore for this shift. Or it could be a 
homage to Stephen King’s Pennywise, albeit one we’d rather forget.
