Theresa May has been warned off plans to reform executive pay by leading 
figures from the world of economics and business, days after sheabandoned a 
proposal

 to put workers on company boards.

A report by independent thinktank the Big Innovation Centre urged the prime 
minister to rethink the detail of plans toreform the UK’s corporate governance 
regime

The authors – including Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane and Clare 
Chapman, remuneration chief of B&Q owner Kingfisher – cast doubt on the wisdom 
of binding shareholder votes onexecutive rewards

Workers on boards: the idea is not going away

They also criticised proposals to force firms to publish their pay ratio, 
which reflects the earnings difference between shopfloor workers and executives.

Making investors’ votes on executive remuneration legally binding would be a 
“disproportionate” response that would have “many negative unintended 
consequences,” the report claimed.

It said shareholders would be less likely to vote against pay deals if they 
were binding, in case chief executives were destabilised or discouraged from 
staying in the role.

Instead, they recommend that companies introduce a binding vote only after 25% 
of shareholders vote against the pay report two years in a row.

On pay ratios, the report said that “although well-intentioned, snapshot pay 
ratios by themselves have the potential to create misleading comparisons and 
perverse incentives.”

It pointed out that retailers, which employ a large number of low-paid 
workers, would appear much more unequal than financial services firms, which do 
not.

Ratios would also unduly penalise companies that offer non-cash benefits and 
favour firms that outsource their lowest paid jobs, the report said.

The views run counter to plans unveiled by May to reform boardroom pay 
culture, as she seeks to show that the Conservative government has workers’ 
interests at heart.

The prime minister has already dropped one of her key proposals, telling the 
CBI conference this week thatplans to put workers on company boards

 were no longer on the table.

While the Big Innovation Centre’s report, the first of a series, rejected pay 
ratios and binding votes, it made a series of recommendations to tackle excess 
pay.

These include simpler pay structures that require directors to hold more 
shares, as well as the publication of a fair pay charter outlining the 
company’s ethos on remuneration.

The report also recommends a change in reporting requirements so the increase 
in the chief executive’s wealth is directly compared to company performance.

“Executive pay is a matter of profound and legitimate public interest,” said 
Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, who was paid £195,000 by the Bank 
last year.

“Pay practices can encourage short-term behaviour in ways which harm both 
firms and the economy over the long-term.

“Moving pay practices in non-financial firms towards those in financial firms 
can help in tackling those problems.”

Clare Chapman, who earned £82,000 last year as Kingfisher’s pay committee 
chief, said: “All of us involved in UK business are needing to rethink how we 
achieve growth in the new environment.”

“We support the government’s objectives of rebuilding trust in executive pay, 
ensuring it is linked to long-term performance, and giving shareholders the 
right powers.”

As chair of Kingfisher’s panel that sets executive pay, Chapman signed off on 
chief executive Veronique Laury’s £2m deal last year.

The DIY firm’s chief executive was paid less than a quarter of the £8.6m that 
predecessor Ian Cheshire earned in 2012, when his package was inflated by a 
share award.
