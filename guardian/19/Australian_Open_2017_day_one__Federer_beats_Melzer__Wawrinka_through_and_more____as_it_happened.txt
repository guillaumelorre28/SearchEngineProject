Shuai Peng has completed her victory over Daria Kasatkina in two contrasting 
sets, 6-0, 7-6. So the No23 becomes the fifth seed to get knocked out of the 
women’s singles draw so far. Shelby Rogers is the current holder of the 
shock-of-the-day prize, for her 6-3, 6-1 win over the No4 seed Simona Halep.

Kyrgios’s momentum has been halted, though it’s not Elias doing the halting, 
it’s a blood nose.

Dan Evans update: he’s now two sets up against Bagnis, and a game up (on 
serve) in the third, thus leading 7-6, 6-3, 1-0.

Angelique Kerber has had an awkward start to the year, winning one match in 
two tournaments, losing to Elina Svitolina in Brisbane and Daria Kasatkina in 
Syndey. It’s very early days in this match, but Tsurenko has won her two 
service games quite handsomely, and Kerber struggled a bit to win hers, but 
it’s 2-1, and on serve.

This is going to be brief: Kyrgios is already a break up in set two, leading 
it as he does 2-0.

6-1. Nineteen minutes. 10pts dropped. Hot damn. That was something, Kyrgios...

The first set of Evans v Bagnis has gone to a tie-break. Less close, so far at 
least, is the No23 seed Daria Kasatkina’s match against Shuai Peng. The Chinese 
world No83 won the first set 6-0, though Kasatkina has got on the board in the 
first game of the second set.

Svetlana Kuznetsova, the No8 seed, is safely through to round two, wrapping up 
a 6-0, 6-1 win over the Columbian Mariana Duque-Mariño, straightforward enough 
even if she needed four match points to do it. This was on the Hisense Arena, 
so Nick Kyrgios is up next.

Murray beats Marchenko 7-5, 7-6, 6-2

And with an ace, a fine angled forehand crosscourt winner from deep behind the 
baseline and a service winner that Marchenko optimistically but forlornly 
challenges, Murray sets up match point. Then, a short rally ends with the 
Ukrainian overhitting a forehand, and that’s it!

The American No23 seed Jack Sock is rocking Court 7, winning the second set 
against Pierre-Hugues Herbert on a tie break to go 2-0 up.
 
Kyrgios takes the second set 6-2, and the match has so far taken 45 minutes, 
including a lengthy medical time-out.
 
Tsonga is potentially on the verge of victory on Court No3, where his match 
against Brazil’s Thiago Monteiro has gone to a third-set tie break. The 
Frenchman is already two sets to the good.
 
Shuai Peng has completed her victory over Daria Kasatkina in two contrasting 
sets, 6-0, 7-6. So the No23 becomes the fifth seed to get knocked out of the 
women’s singles draw so far. Shelby Rogers is the current holder of the 
shock-of-the-day prize, for her 6-3, 6-1 win over the No4 seed Simona Halep.
 
As Kyrgios hogs local attention the Hisense Arena is a lot more full than the 
Rod Laver Arena, but at least Rod Laver is there, watching Kerber. Who’s just 
broken to take a 3-2 lead in the first set.
 
Kyrgios resumes, after an eight-minute medical time out.
 
Kerber just held to love, and looks to be getting into her stride.
 
Kyrgios’s momentum has been halted, though it’s not Elias doing the halting, 
it’s a blood nose.
 
Dan Evans update: he’s now two sets up against Bagnis, and a game up (on 
serve) in the third, thus leading 7-6, 6-3, 1-0.
 
Angelique Kerber has had an awkward start to the year, winning one match in 
two tournaments, losing to Elina Svitolina in Brisbane and Daria Kasatkina in 
Syndey. It’s very early days in this match, but Tsurenko has won her two 
service games quite handsomely, and Kerber struggled a bit to win hers, but 
it’s 2-1, and on serve.
 
Then Elias wins the third game of the set to love.
 
This is going to be brief: Kyrgios is already a break up in set two, leading 
it as he does 2-0.
Michael Beattie (@michaeljbeattie) 
6-1. Nineteen minutes. 10pts dropped. Hot damn. That was something, Kyrgios...

2017 <https://twitter.com/michaeljbeattie/status/820907043577942016>  
Hold it, the comeback’s off again: that’s the first set, wrapped up by Kyrgios 
inside 19 minutes, 6-1.
 
Elias has won a game! It’s 5-1 now, and the comeback is on! Um, kind of.
 
It’s taken Kyrgios less than 15 minutes to race into a 5-0 first-set lead. 
It’s the first time he’s ever played Elias, and the Portuguese isn’t enjoying 
it very much.
 
The Hisense Arena looks like the place to be:

Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is also looking strong. He’s won the first two sets against 
Thiago Monteiro of Brazil, 6-1, 6-3, and it’s currently 2-1 on serve in the 
third.
 
Kyrgios has started ominously, racing into a 3-0 lead in the first set.
 
Kyrgios and Elias are now on court, and their match will get under way very 
shortly, in front of an absolutely packed house.
 
Evans has won that first set, despite at one stage needing to save three 
consecutive set points, 10-8 in the tie break.
 
The first set of Evans v Bagnis has gone to a tie-break. Less close, so far at 
least, is the No23 seed Daria Kasatkina’s match against Shuai Peng. The Chinese 
world No83 won the first set 6-0, though Kasatkina has got on the board in the 
first game of the second set.
 
Before that, Marin Cilic has placed his towel on the comeback-of-the-round 
sunlounger with a 4-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 win over Jerzy Janowicz.

 
The evening session on the two main show courts starts in half an hour, with 
Angelique Kerber, the top seed and champion, getting her competition under way 
against Lesia Tsurenko in the Rod Laver Arena, while Stan Wawrinka takes on 
Martin Klizan in the Margaret Court Arena.
 
There is more British interest today: Dan Evans is on Court 14 as I type, 
where he’s playing Argentina’s world No55 Facundo Bagnis. It’s currently 5-5 in 
the first set.

 
Svetlana Kuznetsova, the No8 seed, is safely through to round two, wrapping up 
a 6-0, 6-1 win over the Columbian Mariana Duque-Mariño, straightforward enough 
even if she needed four match points to do it. This was on the Hisense Arena, 
so Nick Kyrgios is up next.
 
Andrey Rublev, the 19-year-old Russian world No156, awaits in round two for 
Murray.
 
And with an ace, a fine angled forehand crosscourt winner from deep behind the 
baseline and a service winner that Marchenko optimistically but forlornly 
challenges, Murray sets up match point. Then, a short rally ends with the 
Ukrainian overhitting a forehand, and that’s it!
 
Murray leads 7-5, 7-6, 5-2, so has two chances to do this, not that it looks 
like he’ll need them both.
 
Hello world!

No time for preambles - you join me with Andy Murray about to serve for 
victory over Illya Marchenko!
