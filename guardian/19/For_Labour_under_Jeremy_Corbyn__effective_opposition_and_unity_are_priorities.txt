Those members of the Labour frontbench who resigned after Jeremy Corbyn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> won the party leadership 
on Saturday epitomise the career politicians who have become so desperately out 
of touch with large sections of the voting population. As a former Labour 
voter, I think it is far more important at the moment that the Labour party 
provides an effective opposition than that it wins the next election.

A growing number of people not only in Britain but in Europe generally are no 
longer prepared to swallow the great lie of “there is no alternative”. Economic 
liberalism benefits a shrinking minority and is deeply destructive. The party 
needs to work with local groups to find bottom-up as opposed to top-down 
solutions to the enormous social problems confronting every country, and it is 
this bottom-up approach that Corbyn stands for. The Tories are behaving as if 
they have a large majority. In fact there are far more people opposed to the 
Tories than for them, and before it wins power alone, theLabour 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party, while preparing its 
policies, should be prepared to lead an alliance of the left. There is little 
point in a party of opposition which just tweaks Tory policies.

• Shame on Tristram Hunt <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tristram-hunt>, 
and other opposition frontbenchers with less well-recognised names, for walking 
away in a self-important huff without even waiting to see what shape Jeremy 
Corbyn’s leadership would take or on what footing he intended to unite the 
Labour party.

Those who jumped ship so precipitately might perhaps have found it necessary 
to refuse a position on the shadow cabinet at a later stage; but they failed 
their party at the one moment when a show of unity and support for the new 
leader was imperative. If, as the pessimists predict, divisions break out in 
the party, they will have to take a large share of the blame.
