“This is my last year of tennis ... that’s why I’m upset [I] didn’t give the 
best here,” Schiavone told reporters after the match.

The 2010 winner at Roland Garros who is a three-time Olympian and reached a 
career-high world No4 ranking in 2011, now sits outside the top 100 and said 
motivation and fitness were behind her decision to retire.

“This year I want to give everything that [I’ve] learned in the last 19 
years,” Schiavone said.

Fett was surprised by her win against a big name in her debut WTA tour main 
draw apperance, just three months after coming back from a lengthy wrist injury.

She now faces Queensland teenager Lizette Cabrera on Tuesday who also caused 
an upset on Sunday, defeating world No40 Misaki Doi to progress to the second 
round.

“My plan was to play Australian Open next week, but we’ll see how that goes 
because if I win next round then I can’t play,” Fett, 20, said of a clash in 
scheduling.

In other day-two action Lucie Safarova from the Czech Republic scored a 6-3, 
6-4 win over Swiss contender Viktorija Golubic.
