now remain top of the pile until the next season begins in January.

Murray’s victory over Novak Djokovic

 at the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) World Tour Finals last Sunday 
made him one of only four players to lead the rankings in the past 12 years. 
The top spot has been dominated by Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in 
the past decade. Federer held the position for a total of five years during 
that time.

This year, Murray exceeded his 2015 score by 46%, topping the table with 
12,685 points. (That wouldn’t have been enough to win in 2015: Djokovic was top 
with 16,585 points.) The numbers also describe the falls of Nadal and Federer: 
both struggled this year, suffering from injuries and missed matches.
