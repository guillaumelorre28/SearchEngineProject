Book: Nairn’s London <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/nairn-s-london.html> by 
Ian Nairn

London is still the city I love most and long ago in the 1960s, when I dropped 
out of school and came up to town, I’d walk every day sometimes for hours 
around the City and the docks clutching a well-thumbed copy ofNairn’s London. 
Ian Nairn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/03/ian-nairn-architecture-critic-against-sprawl-biography>
 was a down-to-earth, beer-drinking journalist who wrote with vivid passion for 
his subject, a detailed and idiosyncratic description of the best buildings in 
London. I was so excited by his vaulting enthusiasms that I eagerly went 
exploring, seeking out the places he wrote about. To my utter delight they’ve 
just recently republishedNairn’s London and it’s as eccentrically convincing as 
ever, still so exciting to read.

Place: Segesta, Sicily 

At Segesta there’s the shell of a perfect Doric Greek temple sitting alone in 
the midst of fields. It’s extraordinary, so powerful and yet peaceful. The 
story goes that centuries ago the city of Segesta expected a Greek invasion, so 
to placate their unwelcome visitors they set about building this temple. 
Suddenly the expected invasion evaporated into thin air and they stopped 
building. As time went on the city of Segesta disappeared entirely, but still 
there in the middle of nowhere is this beautiful temple. There was nothing else 
in Segesta when I went – I hope it’s still so.

Music: Tchaikovsky’s Sleeping Beauty



At Christmas, I somehow have again a child’s need of magic, so this year I 
found myself listening obsessively toSleeping Beauty 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Sb8WCPjPDs>. It’s a score I never tire of, so 
rich that I always find new things. Not just pretty and lyrical, it has 
wonderful darkness and barbaric sonorities in the music for Carabosse, the evil 
fairy. Stravinsky was a devoted admirer, and indeed you can hear the beginnings 
of what becameFirebird and even Rite of Spring.

Dance: Bayadère – The Ninth Life 
<http://www.shobanajeyasingh.co.uk/works/bayadere-the-ninth-life/>

This spring the brilliant Shobana Jeyasingh 
<http://www.shobanajeyasingh.co.uk/works/bayadere-the-ninth-life/> turns her 
astute intelligence and marvellously three-dimensional movement towards 
re-examining the story behind the 19th-century Petipa classicLa Bayadère. I 
can’t wait to see it – Jeyasingh is one of the few choreographers whose agility 
of language and clarity of rhythm can totally engage my attention. Also she has 
a great cast for this project, dancers from such a variety of backgrounds, to 
see them move together should be fascinating.

Exhibition: Rembrandt – The Late Works 
<http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/rembrandt-the-late-works>

This exhibition at the National Gallery is a truly once-in-a-lifetime show. 
It’s worth begging, borrowing or stealing a ticket just to seeThe Batavian 
Conspiracy, a masterpiece in Britain for the very first time. It’s not such a 
large show, but has at least two major late works in each room. HowRembrandt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/rembrandt> managed to express such 
overwhelming humanity in mere paint is a mystery to me and one I’m happy to 
explore again and again. I’ve been twice already and know I need to go again. 
If I can’t get in before it closes I’ll just have to go to Amsterdam in March – 
and I probably will!

Film: The Beat That My Heart Skipped 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2OhGLNvyAg>

This film has haunted me ever since I first saw it. A young Parisian works for 
his gangster father as a violently racist hoodlum. Glimpsing his old piano 
teacher across the street awakens in him an obsessive desire to reconnect with 
his childhood – his dead mother had been a concert pianist. He starts to study 
again but the intolerable tension between the two sides of his life ends in 
tragedy. The power of the film is the brutality of the violence juxtaposed with 
the serenity and purity of the Bach the young man plays. The music is quite 
wonderful and so the imagery of his father’s ruthless tactics is made all the 
more troubling and savage.
