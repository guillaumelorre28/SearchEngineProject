I’m in Chengdu, in China’s Sichuan Province, home of huā jiāo, the famous 
Sichuan pepper. I’m in the city’s Tibetan Quarter, however, where it’s yak on 
the menu.

Chengdu’s Little Lhasa occupies a cluster of streets around Wuhou Temple 
<https://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/sichuan/chengdu/wuhou_temple.htm> 
in the south-west of the city. Here, shops sell traditional arts and crafts, 
longchuba sheepskin coats and organised tours to the plateau. It’s also the 
place to tuck into traditional Tibetan food. Restaurants line the main street, 
Wuhousi Dajie, and the long-haired ruminant found across the Himalayas of 
southern and central Asia features on many of the menus.

Looking more like a temple than somewhere to eat, A’Re restaurant 
<https://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/sichuan/chengdu/wuhou_temple.htm> 
spreads over three storeys and is the street’s biggest and most impressive. On 
its walls are Tibetan artefacts, rugs and paintings. On the heavy wooden 
benches, cushions, printed throws and families are grouped around huge hotpots. 
Even during a muggy Sichuan summer, it feels like Tibet in here.

 A little piece of Tibet in Chengdu … A’Re restaurant 
A’Re’s menu is creative when it comes to using yak. Dumplings arrive looking 
likexiao long bao (the Shanghai soup dumplings) with twisted tops. The dough is 
tough and the meat is chewy and strongly flavoured – although dipping them in 
soy and chilli sauce tempers the flavour slightly. Yak meat also comes in thin 
strips stir-fried with mushrooms and spring onions; in fried dumplings, 
slathered with a tomato sauce; and in a Tibetan pitta.

To drink? A bowl, filled to the brim, of signature yak butter tea poured from 
a huge silver teapot. It’s oily, viscous and tastes unbearably awful – and 
makes me yearn for tongue-numbing Sichuan hotpot.
