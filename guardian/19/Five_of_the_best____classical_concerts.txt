2 The Beethoven 1808 Academy Concert

One of the most famous concerts in history took place in Vienna on 22 December 
1808. It featured the premieres of four of Beethoven’s groundbreaking works, 
the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, Fourth Piano Concerto and the Choral Fantasy. 
Now, Thomas Dausgaard and the BBC Scottish Symphony recreate the whole thing, 
all three-and-a-half hours of it.

3 The Sirens Cycle

The world premiere of Hungarian composer Peter Eötvös’s work for coloratura 
soprano and string quartet, co-commissioned by the Wigmore Hall, should have

debut with the Calder Quartet; Piia Komsi takes her place.

5 Antony And Cleopatra
