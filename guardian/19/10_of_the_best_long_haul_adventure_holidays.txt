Paddle from inn to inn, Belize

The island-rich coast of Belize is home to one of the first guided 
lodge-to-lodge stand-up paddleboarding trips in the world. Guests paddle 
through the South Water Caye Marine Reserve, exploring mangrove channels and 
reefs, watching out for stingrays, manatees and pelicans. Evenings are spent at 
small, family-run inns, where the day ends with snorkelling and watching the 
sun set from a hammock.

This trip from Secret Compass offers not only the chance to join a one-off, 
once in a lifetime expedition, but also the chance to summit two unclimbed 
13,000ft peaks, one of which is still unnamed. The group trip, from 5-19 June, 
takes places in the remote Altai mountains in the Siilkhem national park, near 
the borders with Russia and China. From climbing exposed ridges to tackling 
glaciers and pioneering new routes to summits, this is a demanding trip, but 
will earn the intrepid proper bragging rights.

The Trans-Siberian railway, from Moscow to Vladivostok, celebrates its 100th 
anniversary this year, and there’s a wide variety of holidays along the classic 
route. On one group trip with Steppes passengers travel the train route but use 
other modes of transport (boat, plane, car) to meet locals and see 
little-visited villages and areas, including Lake Baikal and the Ural 
mountains. That trip comes at a luxury price but an independent Trans-Sib trip 
can cost a tenth of that – in second class and booked independently (seeThe Man 
in Seat 61 <http://www.seat61.com/Trans-Siberian.htm#.VpUne2ThCrM> for an 
excellent guide).
• An independent 10-day return on the Moscow-Beijing route costs from £450.

Mixing culture and action, this new trip involves trekking through the 
volcanic landscapes of Indonesia and climbing five major volcanoes on Java, 
Bali and Lombok. Add in some whitewater rafting, a couple of nights’ camping,

travellers will be gagging for the R’n’R at the palm-fringed beach of Sanur at 
the end.

Conflict in the Middle East has meant many travellers have nudged Jordan off 
their wishlists, but there has been very little trouble there and travellers 
have not been affected. To encourage visitors to return the government has 
introduced a tourist pass to allow free access into most sites, making this a 
great year to see the Roman cities of Jerash and Gadara (pictured), the early 
Islamic “desert castles” of the east, fabled Mount Nebo and, of course, the 
rock city of Petra. The roads are good so it’s not super-adventurous to hire a 
car (aninternational driving permit 
<http://www.postoffice.co.uk/international-driving-permit> is needed) and take 
the Desert Highway running north-south.

Working with WWF scientists, Natural Habitat promises nature adventures in the 
world’s remotest places. Its Greenland and Canadian Arctic trip uses a small 
expedition ship to visit Inuit communities and spot wildlife such as polar 
bear, whales, seals and seabirds. In such a remote part of the world, with 
weather and sea conditions unpredictable, no two itineraries are ever identical 
– but that’s half the adventure.

After the devastation caused by 2015’s earthquakes, hotels, restaurants and 
guiding companies are open for business, and the single best thing we 
travellers can do to help is to visit. This trip includes the highlights of the 
classic Annapurna circuit but also veers off track to discover the secret 
trails of Nar Phu. From Koto the guided trek takes in rarely visited villages – 
some only open to visitors in 2003 – such as Meta, Phu and Nar Phedi. It’s wild 
and beautiful, with the Tibetan influence seen in the architecture and 
religious buildings.

This group recce trip is scheduled purposefully for rainy season to offer best 
chance to witness Catatumbo lightning – a Venezuelan phenomenon where multiple 
flashes strike in dramatic succession in a small area over several hours. It 
also includes hiking in the mountains of Merida, wildlife-watching in the 
wetlands of Los Llanos and navigating the Orinoco delta to meet the indigenous 
Warao people. The finale is at Angel Falls – which in the rainy season will be 
churning with water, which guests camp beneath.

The Tapajos is one of the best-preserved rivers in the Amazon basin, although 
controversial plans to build hydroelectric dams could threaten this pristine, 
little-visited world. Who better to explore with than local woman Adhara Luz, 
whose parents run an NGO that works to protect indigenous communities along the 
river? Trekking through the rainforest from the town of Alter do Chão, 
paddleboarding on lakes, sleeping in hammocks, visiting local communities and 
learning about their culture are all part of the new five-day tour.

Running through 14 states from Georgia to Maine, over 2,180 miles, the 
Appalachian Trail is too big an undertaking for most people’s annual leave, but 
this wild 100-mile section of it isn’t. Starting in Monson it passes through 
pristine tunnels of pine trees and over remote mountain summits, alongside 
gushing streams and mirror-flat lakes with the chance to spot moose and brown 
bears en route. It ends in Abol Bridge, where the hardy can continue on to 
summit Katadhin for a glorious finish. You need to be completely 
self-sufficient for at least 8-12 days but the reward is your very own walk in 
the woods...
• For walking route info and maps at Maine Appalachian Trail Club 
<http://www.matc.org/>. Camping shelters en route are free for hikers. Shaw’s 
Hiker Hostel in Monson (shawshikerhostel.com) is great pre- and post- walk, 
they’ll also help if you need to bail out. Flights from the UK to Bangor
