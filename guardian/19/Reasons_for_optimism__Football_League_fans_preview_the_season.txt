The Championship 

Aston Villa

Let’s not get too ambitious – it looks like Roberto Di Matteo will have pretty 
much the same squad of players that took us down last season. However, in Di 
Matteo and Steve Clarke we have two coaches who will get more out of the squad 
than previous ones. And we have a new owner who is thinking big and looking 
long term, which makes a change. I’d be pleased with a late surge to the 
play-offs and building momentum for next season. But as long as we don’t suffer 
a double relegation, we’ll be OK.RKOW85

I think a successful season would be to avoid relegation. Many of our players 
have never played atChampionship 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship> level.At the time of 
writing only two have - Adam Hammill and Lewin Nyatanga. I’m not counting young 
right back James Bree who made a 20 minute substitute appearance the last time 
we were in the second tier.

I firmly believe we could surprise a few teams this season. In the main I 
think we’ve recruited well in the summer, and we have kept together the nucleus 
of the squad that got us promoted. Our transfer policy of recruiting young, 
hungry players served us well last season - in the end! Although we are running 
the risk of losing skipper Conor Hourihane, and last season’s top scorer Sam 
Winnall for nothing in the summer, if their performances earn them a crack with 
a bigger club whilst keeping us in the Championship then that would constitute 
a good season.Chris Lodge

Our hope is to reach the play-offs this season, or at least do better than 
consecutive 10th-place finishes from the last two seasons. Gary Rowett is the 
reason we can dream. Despite financial limitations, Rowett has found players 
capable of fitting his style and we have become very organised over the last 20 
months or so. If we are to surprise people and break the top six, competition 
at left-back and another quality forward are a necessity. I just hope finances 
don’t hold us back too much as the season looms closer.Ryan Deeney

After the departure of Paul Lambert and the underwhelming appointment of Owen 
Coyle, my hopes for the season aren’t high. Though Danny Graham has bagged a 
few in pre-season, he is a huge downgrade from Jordan Rhodes and his goals were 
only enough to keep us safely in mid-table. With Grant Hanley now at Newcastle, 
I fear we’re in for a difficult season of fighting to stay in the Championship.

What I want as a fan will be familiar across the lower leagues: effort, 
application, fortitude and fight. I want to see exciting new signings, such as 
Romaine Sawyers from Walsall, really prove themselves in the Championship, 
while our new youth players get good experience and add to the squad.Brentford 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/brentford> have enjoyed two seasons of 
achievement, despite some boat-rocking changes to management and playing staff. 
Expectations are still high and we all want consistency. I’m looking forward to 
St James’ Park and hope the Bees can beat Newcastle for the first time since 
1948.James Hardcastle 

Brighton


After a fantastic season last year, where we came so close to promotion to the 
promised land, the crippling pessimism has returned. Minds and bodies were 
exhausted last year, for both fans and players alike. Carrying some momentum 
into the new season will be difficult. Fortunately we have one of the best 
English managers in the country and have kept our midfield dynamos, Dale 
Stephens and Beram Kayal. Glenn Murray’s return will provide some guile and 
experience up front. Last year we were under the radar and expectations were 
low. I’m worried the added pressure of those successes will weigh heavy on our 
shoulders. My only hope for this season is that I’m proved wrong.Joe Simmons

I’m hoping for a play-off push but more realistically a top-10 finish would be 
considered an achievement after last year. Any top-half finish will depend on 
keeping striker Jonathan Kodjia and ensuring he gets the right service, while 
trying to tighten an often leaky defence and open midfield.

The signing of Hordur Magnusson may provide some much needed assistance to 
Aden Flint and, along with the loan return of Celtic’s Adam Matthews, we look 
slightly better than last year with a return to four at the back. Gary O’Neill 
has arrived to provide some experience in midfield and hopefully Lee Tomlin 
will be wandering around like a 2016 Gazza, as City fans hope for more big 
things from him. If it all comes together, we could be half decent. If it 
doesn’t, then we’ll be floundering at the bottom again.Adrian Mole

Burton Albion

As summer has progressed, a sense of disbelief has given way to guarded 
excitement. For the Brewers to be competing at Championship level is beyond 
anything I ever thought was possible. What appears to be astute signings have 
been made and our previous record fee paid of £20,000 has been broken twice in 
almost as many days. Manager Nigel Clough and chairman Ben Robinson are well 
known and well liked in the town, with many years of service under their belts. 
We are in the best possible hands to go about tackling the next nine months in 
the correct way.

Clough and Robinson are no mugs and have a very strong pragmatic streak. 
Allied to this is a determination not to be shown up and a quiet belief that we 
can finish outside of the relegation places. Most Albion fans are approaching 
the season with realism and a desire to enjoy the ride whatever happens. I just 
hope this mood prevails if we find ourselves on a long winless run. All will be 
revealed over the next 46 games and, whatever happens, it sure beats kicking 
off the season away at Paget Rangers.Miles Dosher

I’d like to see us show as much passion as Wales did in the Euros. Having been 
a season ticket holder for as long as I can remember, I’ve been to a couple of 
pre-season games. We are playing a Coleman-esque 3-5-2 this season.Freddie Woolf

Derby County

The Rams have found new and innovative ways of avoiding promotion for three 
seasons running now, with the manager arguably culpable on each occasion. 
Surely now, with a hard nut like Nigel Pearson in charge and old-time favourite 
Chris Powell there as well, a squad (over)stocked with talent has enough to 
make it. Will Hughes will surely be in the Premier League one way or the other 
by 2017-18, and if Pearson can make the most of Darren Bent, Chris Martin and 
Tom Ince, there’s goals to be had. Having bizarrely claimed last season that 
promotion wasn’t a priority, it’s surely the only one for the club this time.

I’m positive about manager Slavisa Jokanovic. With a full pre-season under his 
belt, there is more cause for optimism than this time last year. With a couple 
more signings, a tilt at a play-off spot is not beyond us.Tom

Huddersfield Town 

It’s a season of optimism after several campaigns as a selling club who 
bolstered the ranks with emergency loan players. The change in emergency loan 
rules, and head coach David Wagner’s knowledge of the German market, has meant 
we have our most cosmopolitan looking squad ever. Heavily sourced from the 
youth teams and Bundesliga 2 and 3, we have a lot of players who are unknowns 
but that is better than the journeymen we’ve had to scrape around for in the 
bargain bin at the end of previous window.

We could struggle as the players have to get used to each other and to the new 
gegenpressing system, or we could hit the ground running and actually make a 
challenge of the season. The chairman has also subsidised 15,000 season tickets 
so we’re getting a season of football for £179. He’s also invested around 
£500,000 on our training facilities. For one of the smaller teams in the 
division, this is to be applauded. I hope his investment is rewarded with at 
least a stab at glory.Andy

I have very small hopes for the club this season. Having been quite optimistic 
pre-season the previous two years, a combination of dull football, very little 
money being spent and some very able teams around us mean I think we’ll finish 
mid-table at best. I like Mick McCarthy and don’t reckon we’ll get any better, 
but by God the football is dire sometimes and some of the results last year 
were awful.

I’m more interested in seeing how the two big clubs in Aston Villa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa> and Newcastle do. I’m not 
looking forward to playing the little club which came down last year either – 
recent “Old Farm” derby results have been disastrous. In our favour we have 
stability, Mick gets them working for each other and we certainly know this 
league. We’ve been in it for 15 years!Carl

Leeds United

For us it’s always been a case of fighting a battle against ourselves as much 
as any of the other teams in the league. But with Garry Monk at the helm and 
seemingly signing players he rates rather than a bunch of anonymous Italian 
cast-offs courtesy of our chairman, we might just have a chance of pulling 
something off this season. Maybe a good bash at reaching the play-offs? If 
Cellino backs off and lets Monk do his job, it’s there for the taking.Jamie

When us Geordies talk about a 'Rafalution' we don’t just mean in terms of 
results
Graeme Hall - Newcastle United 
Nothing short of promotion, preferably as Championship winners, will do. With 
Rafa Benítez managing a squad that would never have gone down last season had 
they been managed properly, plus some excellent new signings, there can be no 
excuses. When us Geordies talk about a “Rafalution” we don’t just mean in terms 
of results. Since his appointment, Benítez has deconstructed the workings of a 
club that was rotten to the core. The old hierarchy has been swept away and 
replaced with a professional structure and back room staff.

The club is reconnecting with the local community and there’s even talk of the 
hated Wonga sponsorhip deal being discontinued. Above all we seem like a real 
football club again, and the fans have been allowed to dream a little. And 
isn’t that what football is all about? I’ll be holding my breath at the first 
sniff of a Premier League managerial vacancy though.Graeme Hall

Anything less than promotion will be a failure. This is a tall but possible 
task. First and foremost we have Alex Neil - a confident, fiery and fast 
learning young manager. He had the maturity to recognise his own mistakes over 
the course of last season, and more importantly, has already guided both us to 
promotion. He, as well as most of our players, have been here and done this 
before. We also have a strong Championship squad.

The quality of the league improves year on year, but our midfield comprising 
of Robbie Brady, Alexander Tettey, Jonny Howson and the evergreen Wes Hoolahan 
will remain the envy of Neil’s peers. In addition to our personnel, we have 
excellent fans who will continue to fill Carrow Road every game, even if a few 
will go into meltdown if we start poorly. Besides, there’s always that third 
kit to cheer us up.Dan Scales

Nottingham Forest

Am I allowed to say a year of sanity? Supporting Forest is never an easy thing 
and this promising set-up could well be another false dawn. We have a 
Portuguese director of football, a French head coach and have made some 
interesting signings. On the other hand we don’t have a certificate to allow 
fans to go and watch games at the City Ground.

If Britt Assombalonga can stay fit, he can be the difference between mid-table 
mediocrity and a play-off push. Henri Lansbury showed glimpses of why he is as 
good as anyone in the league and Oliver Burke offers fans genuine excitement 
with his raw pace and power. In Matt Mills and Michael Mancienne we have two of 
the best centre-backs in the league. Regardless of the performances on the 
pitch, I worry that off-field antics will be the main source of focus this 
season.Charlie Hannibal

QPR

This is Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink’s first summer window so he’s brought in 
players he wants who will hopefully fit how he wants to play. I like that we’re 
now buying young players with potential instead of old has-beens. I just want 
us to have a normal season for a change and not sack a manager.

I’d be happy with a mid-table finish and allow the team to grow together. As a 
QPR <https://www.theguardian.com/football/qpr> fan seeing a team grow over a 
few years is not something we’re used to. Right now we just need to buy a 
striker who can get at least 15 goals a season and then we’ll do alright.Dean

Reading

This season relies heavily on the hugely unreliable Jaap Staam. Although a 
class player, many have questioned his CV as a manager. It appears he moved 
early in the transfer market to get some quality players such as Dutch 
defensive midfielder Joey van den Berg. Promotion is what I’m hoping for, but 
mid-table wouldn’t be too suprising.Ewan Miller

Sheffield Wednesday 

Promotion, pure and simple. It was Thai seafood magnate Dejphon Chansiri’s 
wish to gain promotion during our 150th anniversary campaign when he took over, 
and we look well placed to launch our bid. Carolos Carvalhal’s first full 
season in charge may have ended with a disappointing but deserved play-off 
final defeat, but we have an attractive style of play and the players are 
accustomed to their roles.

The Championship is a marathon of a league and the faster you build momentum 
the better chance you have. Defensive cover is an issue with captain and 
centre-back Glenn Loovens missing the start of the season. If we add a fast 
winger to our line-up, we can hopefully sit back and wait for new signing 
Steven Fletcher to light up theFootball League

A diligent but limited midfield is unlikely to match the brilliance shown by 
Jimmy Bullard in our last promotion season in the Championship. We will need 
Nick Powell to stop being promising and start being effective, something he 
failed to do on his loan spell at the club two seasons ago.Alan Willis

Wolves

New Chinese owners and big new money means fellow fans are celebrating Wolves 
being fired into the stratosphere and that we’ll be winning the Champions 
League in a couple of seasons. Experience shows that things are never that 
simple. Rich foreign owners aside, Wolves’ endless capacity of snatching defeat 
from the jaws of victory means I’m not celebrating yet.

However, we are better off then we were a week ago, when we were in limbo and 
looking like possible relegation candidates. Play-offs have to be the minimum 
expectation and, if the Jorge Mendes links mean top players from Benfica really 
do start arriving at Molineux, then maybe the sky really is the limit.James

Having won promotion in May via the play-offs, a comfortable mid-table 
position would be a good achievement and entirely plausible. We’ve kept the 
majority of the team together and strengthened in a couple of positions. During 
the second half of last season the team knew their jobs and how to play 
together, and this will likely see us finish above clubs that are a bit more in 
disarray on the pitch.

For off-pitch hopes, it would be great if London Mayor Sadiq Khan waved 
through the plan for the new stadium at Plough Lane. That would give us all 
something to cheer about and set us up for the next thirty years or so.Adam

Following a season of appalling underachievement, with a highly paid squad 
letting both themselves and the fans down, we were relegated with a tarnished 
silver lining being the cancellation of our staggering debts and a takeover, 
which may or may not prove to be a turning point. Anything less than a top-six 
finish would be disastrous for the club and this could be another long, hard 
season. The club needs to divest itself of some of our players who are still on 
Premier League-level contracts and bring in experienced heads who are prepared 
to graft for each other.Bijou Bob

A third successive promotion may be too much to ask for, but consolidating 
would be good. We have re-signed our talismanic striker Matty Taylor and the 
new stadium now looks likely to be delivered, so I’m feeling good that my 
beloved Ragbag Rovers may finally step out of the shadows and begin to fulfill 
the potential that the more enlightened side of Bristol knows has always been 
there. Certainly with our wealthy new owners, and a chairman who seems to fully 
understand the ethos of this great family club, the future looks brighter than 
ever before.

Mid-table would do, but pushing for a play-off place could be achievable. If 
however Darryl Clarke manages to secure yet another promotion, his fifth in six 
seasons as a manager, we might have a real problem hanging onto him. These are 
exciting times for Gasheads and there is an incredible buzz about the place. 
Hopefully next May we will be carrying our chairman shoulder-high down the 
Gloucester Road again and waving atBristol City

Charlton Athletic

For the first time since Roland Duchatelet took over the club, he has 
installed a manager with experience at the level he is working! Russell Slade 
may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but he has a CV that extends beyond the 
Belgian second tier and the Israeli leagues, so that’s good enough for me.

The anguish of losing our most talented players, including wantaway Jordan 
Cousins, thunderclap Johann Berg Gudmundsson and goalkeeper Nick Pope, means it 
will be a fight. But in signings such as Nicky Ajose, Lee Novak and Ricky 
Holmes we are at least buying players who have cut their teeth on wet 
Wednesdays in Cheltenham. Here’s hoping for a play-off place at worst and a 
complete implosion of our corporate overlords at the best.Crezj Sloleybones

Coventry City

Every summer we have an expectation that City can do something different in 
the upcoming season, only to regularly be let down at some point. This season 
most of us don’t even hold that hope. With 11 of the squad released at the end 
of the season, it was not the confident start to the summer we were hoping for. 
Top scorer Adam Armstrong has gone back to Newcastle and, with their 
relegation, is unlikely to return. But the real loss has been in the middle of 
the park, with John Fleck and Romain Vincelot both departing.

Manager Tony Mowbray has said this is a rebuilding campaign and he is looking 
to bring in players that will stay with the club rather than the loans we have 
relied on for the last few years. He has been put in a difficult situation by 
the ongoing farce that is the ownership of the club.

The last time we saw a pre-season with so many departures we were relegated 
from the Championship. This season could be more similar to that than we would 
wish. The last time Coventry finished in the top six in any division was in 
1970. Surely that run has to end at some point? The only problem is, I don’t 
see it coming this year.Ian Henderson

Gillingham 

Last season ended with a whimper. The lowest league position we were in all 
season was ninth. It was only for one day, but it happened to be the final day. 
One of our star players, John Egan, subsequently left for pastures new with 
another, Bradley Dack, expected to follow suit before the end of August. Our 
pre-season programme has also been something of a disaster, having been beaten 
2-0 by both Barnet andLeyton Orient 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leytonorient>, and losing key player 
Aaron Morris and new signing Lee Martin to long-term injuries.

That being said, it’s not all doom and gloom. The acquisitions of Billy Knott 
and Scott Wagstaff in particular appear both shrewd and exciting. A return to 
the free-flowing football of the opening months of last season would not go 
amiss. Last season felt like our first real chance of a return to the 
Championship since 2005. Another stab this year seems unlikely and we will 
probably be flirting with the other end of the table. My hope is to finish at 
the top of top half, my expectation is to finish at the top of the bottom half.

Promotion to the Championship. Anything else could see us getting stuck in 
League One <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball> for years, 
almost making it out yet falling at the last hurdle. A good start to the season 
as well as consistency over time and to keep Neil “Bomber” Harris working for 
us.Elliot

MK Dons


As they’re versed in the rigours of League One, the idealist in me would plug 
for an instant return to the Championship via automatic promotion. But as they 
were so woeful during the latter stages of last season, I’d settle for a 
top-six finish and a chance for manager Karl Robinson to rebuild his team’s 
confidence and potency in front of goal.Sparky TKO

I’m not too optimistic about our chances this season. Having said that, 
stability may be the key and holding on to a decent if unspectacular group of 
players may prove to be key. We’ve put together a good run before and hopefully 
we can replicate it. My heart will say a sneaky play-off place, but in fairness 
I will take anything above 20th again. I don’t fear relegation too much due to 
our great stickability to this division.Patrick McKiernan

Oxford United

I simply hope Michael Appleton stays as the manager and that the departure of 
Kemar Roofe and other key players is adequately addressed. Will they make the 
Championship? That is a pipe dream, but the hope is for a play-off spot. Just 
as long as we avoid relegationGarrett

With a small club comes low expectations, but in the back of your mind lies a 
dream of triumphant glory. With the young talent at the club, I feel reasonably 
optimistic that battles will be won and a young talisman will be produced to 
lead the team to honour and glory amongst a sea of blue and white.Elfin Lovely

I just don’t see where the revenue is going to come from as sponsors are hard

Tom Hughes - Port Vale fan 
Port Vale

I hope that the recent clear-out of our current squad was motivated by 
improving on a season which grew stronger towards the end, rather than by a 
chairman who has mainly been motivated by cutting the budget. Season ticket 
sales have been poor and I don’t see where the revenue is going to come from as 
sponsors are hard to come by in Burslem. Yet this gamble on a foreign legion 
could still pay off, if these guys from some major club reserve teams are gems 
simply waiting for that chance.

Paulo Tavares, the 30-year-old midfielder, looks a great signing given his 
long history in the top Portuguese league. Anton Forester has bags of higher 
level experience and still looks sharp, while some very good players from last 
season in Ben Purkiss, Jak Alnwick and Remie Streete have been retained. If 
player of the last season Anthony Grant fails with his transfer request it 
could be a very good season indeed. We need another striker with a proven rate 
of return, so perhaps if Nathan Tyson or Tom Pope returns, we have every chance 
of improving on last term.Tom Hughes

Pushing for a play-off spot rather than battling against relegation in League 
One would be nice. From a Vancouver-based Canadian fan who visited family in 
Shrewsbury in 1980, I’m thrilled to see a new stadium being built having seen 
the dilapidated state of the Gay Meadow first hand 36 years ago.Mark O’Reilly

Southend United

Another middling position in League One is to be expected after a 
disappointing end to last season from a decent start. We’re used to managing 
expectations in recent years but, after what seemed like a generation out of 
League One, it’s still good to be back here. Uninspiring signings and this 
year’s depressing financial report, alongside a new stadium that’s not even a 
building site yet, means most fans want a change in ownership to see 
improvements on the field. A promotion challenge, no matter how late in the 
day, doesn’t seem impossible. But losing key players in Daniel Bentley and Jack 
Payne further dampens hopes and above all a sense of consistency is what we 
need.Kent State

I hope we manage to bring a few more new faces in and that the supporters 
continue to actively follow the team. There is a very big split in how the 
chairman is perceived and unfortunately last season did not help. I’m hoping 
manager Luke Williams, with a full pre-season behind him, may be able to 
produce something a bit special to live up to the hype, and five year contract, 
given to him by the chairman. Being a realist goes hand in hand with being a 
Swindon Town fan, so I’ll be happy with mid-table, overjoyed with a play-off 
push and content to still be playing in League One the following season.Adz

Third year back in the league and, following the improvements after Sean 
Derry’s appointment last season, I sense that a promotion push is wanted by the 
fans generally. Personally, being a realist and remembering the apocalyptic 
post-2000 free fall all too well, I’d be quite happy with another season of 
slowly-building mid-table obscurity and a cup run. Whatever we want, I think 
we’ll be around the play-offs come May. We’re good, but so are a fair few other 
teams.Karl Handy

Cheltenham Town 

It’s been an indifferent summer after the long party in May. The hangovers 
have finally cleared and there are grounds for optimism on the eve of the new 
campaign, but this time around it will be a far stiffer test. Boss Gary Johnson 
has kept his promise and retained the majority of the players that delivered 
the Conference title to Whaddon Road, many of whom will be making their 
Football League debuts this weekend. But Johnson has been left frustrated after 
some of his side’s performances in pre-season. We have been exposed at times in 
the friendlies, albeit against sides with a greater pedigree, and that will 
concern the manager. But the manager is hugely in credit and has proved time 
and again in Cheltenham that he’s got things covered.

We’re well stocked in attack thanks to the deadly Dans – Holman and Wright – 
who should be well served by the two Jameses – Dayton and Rowe – from the wide 
areas. The midfield also holds no concerns, with Asa Hall and Harry Pell set to 
start in the middle in the absence of Kyle Storer, who senselessly picked up an 
eight-match ban for biting an opponent in the dead rubber against Halifax on 
the final day last term. He’ll have to wait for now to make his Football League 
bow, and could pay a high price for his stupidity if new boy Danny Whitehead 
hits the ground running.


It’s the defence that’s giving the manager a headache with less than a week 
until the curtain-raiser against Leyton Orient. Well-travelled Finnish 
international Daniel O’Shaughnessy has been added to the defence and looks like 
a classy acquisition but there’s room for improvement at the back.

With the feelgood factor back at the now named LCI Rail Stadium, we’re 
entitled to be hopeful of another exciting campaign. Who knows, a top-half 
finish could be on the cards.Murry Toms

League Photograph: Greig Cowie/BPI/REX/Shutterstock 
Grimsby Town

Following the elation of our play-off victory at Wembley in May, we have since 
released 12 players and suffered speculation over other clubs poaching our 
manager Paul Hurst. Life in the Conference was full of victories, huge numbers 
travelling to away games and a lot of soul searching. The 2016-17 season sees 
us returning to our place as a small fish in a big pond.

We hope that Omar Bogle will continue to improve as the pressure to score 
goals will shift to him following Pádraig Amond’s departure. Goalkeeper James 
McKeown, defender Shaun Pearson and club captain Craig Disley have been at the 
club since our second season outside of the Football League. Hopefully their 
bond with the club and supporters will flourish in League Two as well. Most 
Town fans would take staying up and finishing in mid-table this season as we 
look to consolidate our place back among the 92. Anything more would be a bonus.
Thomas Sargent

Leyton Orient

What hopes for the season ahead you ask? 

To keep a manager for an entire season.
To not have the president of the club kick a member of staff up the backside 
while on the field of play.
To not have a national government attempt to extradite the club’s owner.
To have the club’s sponsors write tweets in coherent English.
To make it clear that other players than Jay Simpson are allowed to score.
To finally manage to do the impossible and win a match at the Colosseum that 
is Crawley Town.
To enjoy going to Brisbane Road – it has been a while.
To make sure none of our players get arrested at Harrods again.
To not leave the club’s media officer in the Scunthorpe car park after a 
member of staff left without him.
To not kick the ball straight out from kick-off.
To win enough games to finish in the top three and spare the inevitable 
capitulation in the play-offs.E10 College

Luton Town


Under Nathan Jones there is a vibrancy, energy, commitment, speed and 
enthusiasm in our style of play. It’s the opposite to how we set up for the 
first two thirds of last season, and is better suited to the attributes of our 
players. Combined with a slimmed down squad and a summer to work on intelligent 
recruitment, on and off the pitch with a new Sports Science Coach, this new 
look Luton have so far beaten a strong Brighton side, as well as thrashing 
Bedford Town 9-0 in pre-season. We do have a tough start to our League Two 
campaign, so we’ll need to negotiate this and see where we sit come October.

Mansfield Town

With eight new signings and seven departures, this summer feels like one of 
Mansfield <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mansfield> Town’s quieter 
close-seasons in terms of personnel changes. The Stags surprised many by 
spending most of last season in or close to the League Two play-off places, 
before fading in the spring to finish 12th. That was still a big improvement on 
the previous season though, so the next stage is to build on the progress made 
and sustain a play-off challenge in 2016-17.Colin Perry 

Plymouth Argyle 

After the crushing disappointment of losing in the League Two play-off final, 
having topped the table by a distance at Christmas, Argyle fans will be 
forgiven for not having high hopes for the upcoming season. The club struggled 
to keep hold of key players, such as centre-back Peter Hartley and his 
defensive partner and club captain Curtis Nelson, which has further lowered 
hopes. However, Derek Adams has shown himself to be shrewd in the transfer 
market, signing no fewer than 11 new players including former Blackburn and 
Scotland striker David Goodwillie.

The feeling around the club is that we have a manager who can challenge every 
year and the fans expect another push for promotion. The showings in pre-season 
have been mixed, but Goodwillie in particular has looked sharp. If the Scotsman 
can combine well with player of the year Graham Carey, then Argyle should have 
the firepower to target automatic promotion.Olli Mitchell

Portsmouth 

After everything Portsmouth <https://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth> 
fans have been through, the simple fact that we still have a club to support 
puts a lot of on-field disappointment into perspective. Saying that, we 
probably should have gone up last season. For Paul Cook to turn around our 
worst ever league position to the play-offs in only a season is commendable, 
but his tactical stubbornness, unwillingness to play two up front and attack at 
Fratton Park let us down.

We rose to the occasion for games against clubs in higher leagues and yet 
froze against teams we probably should have beaten – the late-season game at 
relegated York City for example. We were the best footballing side in the 
division but this is League Two and it doesn’t always work. We drew too many 
games and conceded too may last minute goals. If we’d held out in only three of 
those games, the season would have been very very different.

This season we’ve signed some exciting players - Carl Baker and Milan Lalkovic 
are excellent in this league, but we’re still a good goalkeeper short as Alex 
Bass isn’t quite ready yet. we could do with another striker too. The fans want 
to see more of young Conor Chaplin, who absolutely merits a run in the side. I 
have hopes for the season but I just can’t get rid of the feeling that last 
year was our chance and this season will be a bit middling. I’m happy to be 
proven wrong though.Liam Emerson

Stevenage

With the chaos of last season firmly in the rear-view mirror, the relative 
calm of pre-season at the Lamex has been a welcome change of pace. The defence 
that conceded three goals and lost just once in the final eight games of last 
season has been retained as well, with wily midfield orchestrator Michael Tonge 
a welcome addition.

The real excitement comes up front. Since Steve Morison left for Millwall in 
2009, there has been a chronic lack of goals. The addition of Rowan Liburd and 
Matt Godden, who got 30 goals for Ebbsfleet last season and has looked sharp in 
pre-season, threaten genuine excitement for the year ahead. Sprinkle in the 
wing-play of Jobi McAnuff and things are definitely looking up.


League Two is a division of fine margins and, while I’m not going to get 
carried away, Northampton showed that a well organised team playing to their 
potential can go far. I’d be more than happy with a safe midtable finish, but 
wouldn’t rule out a tilt at the play-offs.Mike Haller

Wycombe Wanderers 

With the headline-grabbing signing of Adebayo Akinfenwa, it’s been a good 
off-season for the Chairboys. Stability counts for a lot in football and, with 
Gareth Ainsworth commencing his fourth full season in charge, there is plenty 
of reasons for optimism. Off the field, the sell-on windfall from Jordon Ibe’s 
transfer to Bournemouth means the club is almost debt-free and operating well 
within our means.

Last season was disappointing after the heroics of the previous year, 
particularly as the club fell away in April and May missing out on the 
play-offs. But the side still solid, hard to beat at Adams Park and capable of 
hitting teams on the break when we’re on our travels. The exciting signings of 
Dayle Southwell and Nick Freeman from non-league, plus Paris Cowan Hall, Myles 
Weston and the aforementioned Akinfenwa should result in more creativity and 
goals. If we can just find a keeper, we ought to be in the play-off mix again 
this season.Ben Graham
