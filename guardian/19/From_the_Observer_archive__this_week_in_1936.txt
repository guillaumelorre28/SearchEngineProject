History and geography have both sustained a blow in the destruction of the 
Crystal Palace. It stood for the ideals of an epoch when the perfectionist 
faith had reached its highest peak, and it stood upon a site that made it the 
cynosure of far-flung spaces. Through good and ill fortune it remained a 
memorial of that Albertan Age from whose high seriousness we are not without 
need to borrow. As a Romanesque survival in an ultra-Gothic world, its serenity 
did not suffer from being outmoded. The fierce sublimity of its end has 
quickened imagination and reflection in quarters where those faculties might 
have been thought torpid.

Our thoughts are turned back to a great generation by the destruction of what 
was its last outstanding symbol. The buoyant and purposeful Early Victorians 
were blind to things that press but too heavily upon our later consciousness. 
They were as sure of humanity being saved by science as we are fearful of it 
being destroyed by the same agency.

Their Crystal Palace was an effective piece of self-expression. The 
incomparable vantage-point it occupied is now vacant, and is national property. 
By what embodiment of our own mind and temper are we going to replace it?
