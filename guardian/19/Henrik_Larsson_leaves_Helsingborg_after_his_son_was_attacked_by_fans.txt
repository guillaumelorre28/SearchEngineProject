A statement from the club director Mats-Oka Schulze said Larsson’s departure 
was a joint decision between the former Sweden striker and the club.

“Myself, the board, Henrik Larsson and the rest of the leadership team, 
together with the players, are responsible for the relegation,” Schulze said. 
“I, together with the board, would like to extend our gratitude to Henrik for 
the comprehensive restructuring implemented within the football organisation 
during 2015 and 2016.”

After the club’s relegation from Sweden’s top flight was confirmed by Sunday’s 
2-1 defeat to Halmstad, a group of hooded fans confronted Jordan Larsson and 
forcibly removed his shirt. The 19-year-old forward had scored to put his side 
ahead with eight minutes left against Halmstad, but two late goals from Marcus 
Mathisen condemnedHelsingborg <https://www.theguardian.com/football/helsingborg>
 to relegation after a 3-2 aggregate play-off defeat.

Speaking after the match, the elder Larsson gave no indication of his 
intention to depart, but said: “I live and work here in town. I will look over 
my shoulder a little more and make sure not to walk alone in town. If they 
[hooligans] come, they come. We have many dogs at home.”

The 45-year-old former Feyenoord, Barcelona, Celtic and Manchester United 
striker became head coach of the club in January 2015.
