Paramount Theatre

Denver is a relatively young town with a shortage of truly historic venues, 
but the Paramount Theatre, which opened in 1930 as a grand movie house, is a 
well-preserved art-deco marvel and a legitimate historic site. The 
red-curtained stage regularly hosts national (if often sedate) touring acts, 
stand-up comedians and bestselling authors, as well as the occasional 
theatrical or musical production. The 1,700-capacity space doesn't look much 
from the outside but its vertical neon marquee hides one of the most charming 
rooms in the region.

Gothic Theatre
 Gothic Theatre 
A few minutes south of downtown Denver, this 1920s art-deco theatre has a 
wide, inviting floor, a tiered balcony and excellent views throughout. Adding 
to the backlit cabaret vibe is the recently muscled-up booking and promotion of 
the Gothic, following its takeover by live music promotorAEG Live 
<http://www.aeglive.co.uk/>. Few venues deliver as much atmosphere and comfort 
with such a range of shows.

Swallow Hill Music

It's easy to tap into Denver's storied folk-music heritage with a show here: 
it's a non-profit school and complex that grew out of theDenver Folklore Center 
<http://denverfolklore.com/> to host more than 200 shows annually at on-site 
venues such as Daniels Hall and the Tuft Theatre. Bluegrass banjo jams, Native 
American singer-songwriters and touring artists such asLeon Redbone 
<http://www.leonredbone.com/fr_home.cfm> share rooms with calm, appreciative 
audiences at this all-things-acoustic haven.

Bluebird Theater

Denver has no shortage of mid-size music venues, but the Bluebird Theater, a 
neon-ringed former movie house and rehabbed porn theatre, is arguably the best. 
Excellent sightlines and a chest-rattling sound system complement a mix of 
heavy metal, indie acts and singer-songwriters at this always-busy, 
500-capacity room. Think Art Brut,Kurt Vile <http://kurtvile.com/>, Hank III, 
Apples in Stereo andMason Jennings <http://masonjennings.com/>. Don't let the 
sometimes-surly staff dissuade you from throwing your best devil signs. A small 
but homey balcony offers a darkened spot from which to sip your lager in 
anonymity. Be sure to explore the colourful bars and restaurants along this hip 
stretch of Colfax Avenue before the show.

The Grizzly Rose

Cowboy hats and Levi's are the uniform at this sprawling country-and-western 
nightclub north of downtown. It devotes as much space to mechanical bulls and 
pool tables as line-dancing floors and a live music stage (filled with country 
and hard rock acts six nights a week). Sundays are all-ages, so if you've got a 
little buckaroo looking to hear some twang, it's the ideal place to push the 
limits of their bedtime.

Beta Nightclub
 Beta Nightclub Nightclub, Denver 
Denver's Lower Downtown neighbourhood (LoDo to locals) is packed at weekends, 
but Beta Nightclub is an oasis in the dude-bro desert. The spare, multi-tiered 
space is frequently voted among the best electronic music clubs in the world 
thanks to its top-notch touring DJs and fantastically calibrated sound system. 
Denver boasts a surprisingly robust dance music scene, but Beta has no 
competition when it comes to its live roster and sound quality. Chalk it up to 
the fact that its owner is the co-founder ofBeatport <http://www.beatport.com/>
, the popular website that doubles as iTunes for DJs.
• 1909 Blake Street, +1 303 383 1909, betanightclub.com 
<http://www.betanightclub.com/>. Open Thurs-Sat 9pm-2am

Meadowlark Bar

Before their 2012 Grammy nominations, New York transplants The Lumineers 
<http://thelumineers.com/> honed folk-pop songs like Ho Hey 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCBSSwgtg4> at the Meadowlark's cozy open-mic 
scene. The handsome, subterranean bar has a ground-level patio that looks a bit 
like an exploded garage sale, providing respite from the often 
shoulder-to-shoulder crowds inside. From DJ-led dance parties to standup comedy 
and art rock, Meadowlark shows feel like insider affairs for the lucky few who 
can find it in Denver's rapidly gentrifying warehouse district.

Dazzle Jazz

The purple neon that rings the outside of this Capitol Hill lounge are 
reflected in the windows of the surrounding buildings, and truly, Dazzle is a 
beacon for jazz lovers. A performance and dinner space, it hosts the region's 
best mix of local and national jazz talent, from avant garde to big band and 
solo artists. But the classy, inviting front room (or Dizzy Room) is equally 
popular with its liver-testing martini list and appetizer menus constructed 
from old gatefold LP covers. The Dizzy Room also offers free live jams and 
pop-in artists, so don't be surprised if your happy-hour drinks are suddenly 
soundtracked by a sax solo or torch singer.

Larimer Lounge

The dear departed 15th Street Tavern was one of Denver's go-to places for 
punk, indie and alternative acts, so when co-owner Scott Campbell founded the 
Larimer Lounge a little over a decade ago, all eyes were on the scummy, 
warehouse-district venue. After dozens of clever remodels and barn-burning 
indie rock shows (including Arcade Fire and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club) the 
Larimer has proved itself as a catalyst for the revitalisation of Denver's 
underground music scene, and the entire surrounding warehouse district.

raucous soul side project The Night Sweats – from its tiny wooden stage. Before
