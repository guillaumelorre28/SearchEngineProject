Caballero is Claudio Bravo’s deputy and although the Chilean remains City’s 
No1 if his unreliable form were to continue Guardiola would have to decide 
whether to recruit an understudy or a goalkeeper who could provide direct 
competition.

Caballero joined the club in summer 2014, being signed from Málaga

by the previous manager Manuel Pellegrini, who promised the Argentinian he 
would have a chance to vie with Joe Hart for the No1 jersey.

However, Caballero never established himself under Pellegrini, though he did 
claim a Capital One Cup winners’ medal followingan impressive display in the 
final last year

, saving three penalties in the shootout.

Hart is on loan at Torino and although he will return to City in the summer 
there seems little prospect of him being able to re-establish himself under 
Guardiola. The Catalan’s lack of faith in Hart moved him to sign Bravo from 
Barcelona.
