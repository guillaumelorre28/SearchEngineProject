Based on his form against us, I certainly wouldn’t kick Cavani out of bed, but 
the scarcity of genuine world-class goal poachers is evident in Man Utd’s 
willingness to speculate almost twice the price of Sánchez on the unproven 
talents of Martial. Plenty of Gooners might be pleased to see no further 
spending, since presumably Arsenal will only loosen the purse strings if Wenger 
has committed to his own two-year extension … In an ideal world I’d like to see 
Matuidi or Dortmund’s Weigl in red and white, but Arsène’s not about to concede 
thatXhaka was a £35m ricket 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/16/arsenal-arsene-wenger-30m-midfielder-granit-xhaka>
. As a statement of the club’s intent, the most crucial signings are those of 
Sánchez and Özil on new contracts.

Bournemouth

There are three areas we need to look at. First, a solid, experienced keeper. 
Artur Boruc has played well but back strains are a problem, and Adam Federici 
doesn’t fill the goal as much – so someone like Joe Hart would make a huge 
impact. Second, an attacking midfielder like Wilfried Zaha: a fast, creative 
talent who can change a game. And third, a striker with the energy of Divock 
Origi. Not much to ask?

We’ll be focusing on squad strengthening as much as anything, but I’d 
specifically like to see another central midfielder, and a wide player with a 
bit of pace. We were close to filling both those gaps at the end of August with 
Brighton’s Dale Stephens and Polish winger Kamil Grosicki from Rennes, but the 
deals fell through. It’d be no surprise to see Stephens back on the winter 
shopping list, though: he’s out of contract in the summer – that’ll put 
Brighton under pressure this month.

Chelsea

As things stand, we’re looking great – but you do have to wonder how many 
injuries we are away from a serious problem. The defence is certainly 
vulnerable: we have two war-horses on the bench but they’d struggle to play in 
a three, so Conte has to look for more resources. It’s a shame that Leonardo 
Bonucci signed a new Juventus deal. Elsewhere, and this may not be a popular 
view, but I also think we need to start a search to replace Victor Moses. He’s 
played better than most expected but he has his limitations. I also wonder 
whether we’ll be searching for a striker as Batshuayi didn’t get his chance 
despite Costa being suspended. Conte has stressed that his time will come, but 
will the youngster be willing to wait? And finally, as important as buying new 
options is retaining the talent we have – Cesc Fàbregas specifically. It’s 
difficult to buy that sort of quality these days.

Crystal Palace

We have all sorts of problems but a striker is probably the most urgent given 
Connor Wickham’s long-term injury. As it stands, Fraizer Campbell is the only 
back-up to Benteke, which isn’t a good place to be. The defence needs a proper 
overhaul too, with Pape Souaré out injured and the rest of the backline having 
looked fairly clueless. At a minimum, by the end of January we need to have a 
new attacking left-back ready to go – Kieran Gibbs, Charlie Taylor or Neil 
Taylor? And it seems like Allardyce is also after a midfield enforcer, with the 
club’s scouts busy in Ligue 1.

Everton

The way we faltered after that strong start shows we need to strengthen all 
over the pitch if we’re going to make progress. A new keeper would be an 
obvious place for Ronald Koeman to start: ideally Pickford from Sunderland or 
Heaton from Burnley, but most of the talk at the moment is about outfield 
players, including Charlton’s Ademola Lookman and United’s Morgan Schneiderlin. 
Whatever happens, we need some options to replace Barry and Jagielka: they’ve 
been great servants, but it’s a young man’s game.

There isn’t a single outfield position that doesn’t need improving – but a 
proper right-back and someone to put the ball in the net are key. With his nous 
and obvious threat, Peter Crouch would be useful – and Scott Hogan at Brentford 
is a good finisher who’d be a better long-term investment. Elsewhere, if we’re 
going to continue to play with three centre-halves, we need another one – like 
Sunderland found in Lamine Koné. And all this is assuming we keep hold of 
Snodgrass, Robertson and other players linked with moves. We just can’t go 
through what we went through in the summer again when we lost Mo Diamé, despite 
already being critically short of players.

Leicester City

We desperately need a new centre-back to offer some decent cover in case 
Morgan or Huth get injured. Michael Keane has been touted, and we could do 
worse. Similarly, we need another winger to compensate for Riyad Mahrez’s 
Africa Cup of Nations duties. But most importantly, we need a ball-winning 
midfielder to try to fill the N’Golo Kanté hole – thankfully, it sounds like a 
deal is pretty much done for Wilfred Ndidi from Genk. Hopefully, we’ll have 
time to find a new head of recruitment too.

Even though we’ve been scoring freely we do need a top striker. Coutinho is 
likely to get knocked about and miss games throughout the season, Mané is off 
to the Africa Cup of Nations and we can’t rely on Sturridge. Celtic’s Moussa 
Dembélé has been linked, but not only with us, and there’s talk about PSG’s 
Jesé Rodriguez. We could also do with a defender: Newcastle’s Jamaal Lascelles 
was linked before Christmas – Rafa won’t be happy – and a left-back, with 
Ricardo Rodríguez from Wolfsburg and Cologne’s Jonas Hector mentioned. 
Elsewhere, our keepers have struggled, but Karius is young and can hopefully 
learn and improve. Quickly, with luck.

Manchester City

Our defence is a mess - the problems won’t be solved in one window, but 
signing Virgil van Dijk from Southampton would be a big step in the right 
direction. Meanwhile,Ilkay Gündogan’s injury is a massive blow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/14/manchester-city-watford-premier-league-match-report>
, so a move for another midfielder could be on the cards. It sounds like we’re 
close on Sevilla’s Steven N’Zonzi, but I hope we’re also serious about Mahmoud 
Dahoud. He’s undoubtedly a star in the making and has impressed whenever we’ve 
played Mönchengladbach.

Manchester United

We haven’t been scoring enough. There’s been some encouraging talk about a big 
bid for Antoine Griezmann, who’d be one of the final pieces in José’s jigsaw, 
but that won’t happen this month. So Mourinho may go for another option – 
possibly young Kasper Dolberg from Ajax – given that Martial, Rooney and 
Rashford haven’t been delivering. To do that, though, he’ll probably have to 
offload some fringe players such as Fellaini, Memphis and Schneiderlin – 
particularly if he’s also serious about spending big money on Benfica defender 
Victor Lindelof.

 Could a loan move to Middlesbrough get the best out of Gerard Deulofeu? 
Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images 
We have to try to strengthen in attack and midfield, and focus on bringing in 
experience – we look so vulnerable whenever Ramírez and Negredo are missing. 
We’ve not been shy to add quality players in previous January windows, and I 
think we’ll see a bold survival strategy emerge this month. It has taken us 
seven years to get back to this level and we’ll throw everything we can at 
staying in the top-flight. Rudy Gestede would give us another option, though I 
think most fans would prefer some more dynamic signings. Could we have the 
manager to realise the untapped potential of Everton’s Gerard Deulofeu? We’d 
then have former Barça youth players attacking down both flanks.

Southampton

What do we need this month? A striker who scores goals. Literally any striker 
who scores goals. Spend all the money we have on Daniel Sturridge if he’s 
willing and available. Add a fit and clinical goalscorer to the mix – and keep 
hold of Virgil van Dijk at the back – and we’re a potential top-six side again.
Steve Grant saintsweb.co.uk, @SteveGrant1983

Stoke City

Lee Grant and Bruno Martins Indi should be first in on permanent deals: 
they’ve been instrumental. Beyond those two, we all thought Bony was going to 
be the answer to our scoring issues but that really hasn’t worked out – so 
expect interest in Saido Berahino (again), RB Leipzig’s Davie Selke, or 
Napoli’s Manolo Gabbiadini. Elsewhere, if there’s a player out there who could 
challenge Erik Pieters at left back we should be looking at him. As good as 
Eric is he does suffer from having no competition for his place whatsoever. And 
Jack Butland’s ongoing injury problems mean another keeper, alongside Lee 
Grant, could be on the cards.
Rob Holloway Observer reader

Sunderland

A big month for David Moyes coming up. We’re told there’s a limited budget but 
we need at least two more defenders. Carl Jenkinson has been mentioned, but 
we’ll need another centre-back too as Koné will be missing one way or the other 
– either sold, or off on Africa Cup of Nations duties. Elsewhere we have to do 
whatever it takes to hang on to Jermain Defoe – we could do without Sam 
Allardyce and Slaven Bilic distracting him. Other than that, I guess we’ll be 
checking to see if there are any out-of-contract former Everton players 
knocking around – and it wouldn’t come as a big surprise if Peter Crouch 
pitched up. But not Dimitar Berbatov – far too pricey for a low wage economy 
like ours.

Swansea City

The first half of the season was a disaster; to turn this round the new 
manager has to make multiple changes. Among the most urgent needs are a 
centre-back to replace Ashley Williams, at least one full-back and a winger – 
but we could also do with a decent central midfielder to replace the 
substandard Ki Sung-yueng. Realistically, though, it’s hard to imagine us 
managing to land more than three players this month, given the state we’re in.

very strong, with a tight wage structure. We could use some extra creativity, 
pace and goal threat – but then who couldn’t use those qualities? Wilfried Zaha 
would be interesting – but to improve what we already have is a tall ask with a

We still lack strength in depth and we’re a couple injuries away from relying 
on players who would struggle. There’s been lots of talk about Morgan 
Schneiderlin, but the biggest concern is cover for Salomón Rondón. That’s the 
key area that needs strengthening. We were linked with Rudy Gestede but it 
sounds like he’s off to Boro.

West Ham United

A proven Premier League striker who can remain fit is essential this month – 
Christian Benteke would have done the job, but as it is we’re apparently after 
loan options. Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Michy Batshuayi have all 
been mentioned. We’re also after another right back – Carl Jenkinson from 
Arsenal? – and, if Payet goes, another creator, too. We’d love a fit Santi 
Cazorla in exchange, but Gylfi Sigurdsson of Swansea always strikes me as an 
underrated player.
