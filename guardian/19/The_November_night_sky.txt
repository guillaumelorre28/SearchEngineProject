In the month that sees an unusually close supermoon, the two brightest planets 
are becoming more prominent at dusk and dawn. The Square of Pegasus looms on 
the meridian at our map times as Orion, lord of our winter’s nights, rises 
below Taurus and the Pleiades in the E, and the Summer Triangle sinks in the W.

The full moon on the 14th is classed as a supermoon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/11/in-praise-of-supermoons> 
since it occurs only three hours after the Moon’s slightly variable elliptical 
orbit brings it closer to the Earth (356,509 km) than at any time since 1948. 
As such, it appears some 7% wider than it does on average.

Venus has lingered low in Britain’s evening twilight until now but this month 
its altitude in the SW to SSW 30 minutes after sunset more than doubles from 
around 5° to 11°, and by the 31st it sets almost three hours after the Sun. 
Improving from a brilliant mag –4.0 to –4.1, it shows a small gibbous disc 
through a telescope.

Saturn, much fainter at mag 0.5, lies 5° above-right of Venus and 3° 
below-left of the young Moon on the 2nd but it is sliding into the twilight and 
is soon lost from view. The Moon, in turn, is 8° above Venus on the 3rd and 5° 
above Mars on the 6th. The latter dims from mag 0.4 to 0.6 this month as it 
tracks from Sagittarius to Capricornus and climbs a little higher in the S at 
nightfall, though it is setting in the SW by our map times. Viewed 
telescopically, it shrinks from 7.5 to 6.5 arcsec wide.

Mercury is hiding in the evening twilight but Jupiter is now conspicuous 
before dawn. Rising in the E at about 04:20 at present, and 03:00 at month’s 
end, it climbs higher and higher into the SE before dawn where it stands above 
Spica in Virgo. It brightens a little from mag –1.7 to –1.8 and is 32 arcsec 
wide when it stands 2.5° to the right of the waning earthlit Moon on the 25th.

The Leonids meteor shower 
<http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/earthskys-meteor-shower-guide>, 
active from the 15th to 20th, has a sharp peak which is expected at about 04:00 
on the 17th. It has produced some memorable meteor storms in the past, but the 
last was in 2002 and predictions are for fewer than 20 meteors per hour this 
time. Its super-swift meteors diverge from a radiant point within Leo’s Sickle 
as the constellation climbs from low in the ENE at midnight to stand high in 
the S before dawn. Sadly, bright moonlight will swamp all but the brighter ones 
this year.
