You can have the turkey. Just give me the gravy. And I’ll have the chipolatas 
and bacon rolls too, the cranberry sauce and the stuffing. AtChristmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> dinner, it is the 
accompaniments that interest me as much as, or even more than, the big bird. 
The chewy, scrunchy savoury bits that are traditionally part of the feast can 
be sublime either on the side or served as dish in their own right.

The Christmas accompaniments can be served in the classic manner or can be 
touched by a little imagination – either way, they are my favourite bits. This 
year, instead of chipolatas, I am going for something that could just as easily 
be a meal in itself – a ring of Cumberland sausage wrapped in pancetta and 
sweet date molasses.

Likewise the sprouts, which this year I am roasting, with thyme and garlic. 
But I am concentrating most of my energies on the gravy itself, the essential 
ingredient that brings the entire carnival of a meal together. As well as 
utilising the turkey giblets, I am using a handful of chicken wings to give 
this crucial part of the dinner a silky, glossy finish. And I’m taking my time 
too. Side dishes these may be, but for me, they are what really turns Christmas 
dinner into a feast.

Onion gravy for the turkey

Nothing improves Christmas dinner more than a thoughtfully made gravy. It 
brings the meal together. A good one, deeply favoured, sweet and mellow, takes 
time, so I suggest you make it in advance. It improves overnight.

Enough for a medium-sized turkey
onion 1 large
olive oil 5 tbsp
banana shallots 6
whole chicken wings 14
turkey giblets
carrots 4 small
celery 2 ribs
garlic ½ a small head
bay leaves 4
black peppercorns 12
dried mushrooms 20g
thyme 8 sprigs
water 1 litre
redcurrant jelly 2 heaped tbsp
dry marsala or madeira 3 tbsp

Peel the onion, halve it, then slice each half into thin segments. Warm three 
tablespoons of the olive oil in a deep pan, add the onion, then leave to cook 
over a low heat, stirring regularly. Let the onion cook till it is sweet, 
golden brown and very, very soft. A good 20 minutes.

Peel and halve the shallots. Warm the remaining oil in a shallow pan and fry 
them for five minutes or so till nicely browned. Remove the shallots then add 
the chicken wings to the pan and let them brown, introducing the giblets 
towards the end.

Scrub the carrots and slice them in half. Roughly chop the celery then add to 
the onions together with the shallots, the wings and giblets, the bay, 
peppercorns, dried mushrooms, thyme and water. Bring to the boil then lower the 
heat so the liquid simmers gently, then leave for 2 hours. Check regularly to 
make sure the gravy isn’t boiling.

Strain the gravy through a sieve or colander then bring to the boil in a 
saucepan, stirring in the redcurrant jelly and marsala or madeira. Check the 
seasoning, adding salt as necessary, then serve, piping hot, with your 
Christmas dinner.

It is essential to turn the brussels sprouts over several times in the butter 
and oil as they roast, as you don’t want them to dry out. Should you prefer to 
boil them, do so, then warm the butter with the crushed smoked garlic and thyme 
leaves, stir in the honey then toss with the cooked and drained sprouts.

Serves 6
For the parsnips

parsnips 800g
butter 30g
double cream 6 tbsp
brussels sprouts 450g
olive oil 4 tbsp
butter 25g
smoked garlic 6 cloves
thyme 6 sprigs
honey 2 tsp

Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Peel the parsnips and cook them in boiling, 
lightly salted water for 15-20 minutes or until soft enough to mash. Trim and 
halve the brussels sprouts and put them into a bowl together with the oil, 
butter, the peeled garlic and thyme, toss everything together then tip into a 
roasting tin. Bake for 35 minutes, till golden brown and soft, tossing the 
sprouts once or twice as they roast.

Drain and mash the parsnips, add the butter and cream and beat till smooth. 
Pile onto a serving dish. Remove the sprouts and garlic from the oven, trickle 
over the honey, toss gently then spoon onto the parsnip puree.

Lovekin for the Observer 
Salt not only delivers a deliciously crisp crust, but the smoked salt adds its 
own flavour to the potatoes too. Give me a plate of these this Christmas, and 
the garlicky cheese dip beside them, and I’ll be just fine, thank you.

Serves 4-8
smoked sea salt flakes 5 tbsp
sea salt flakes 5 tbsp
thyme leaves 2 tbsp
thyme 6 whole sprigs
potatoes 8, floury, medium- sized
garlic 6 large cloves

For the dip
goats’ curd 175g
blue cheese 100g

Mix the smoked and natural sea salt flakes then tip them into a roasting tin. 
Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.

Chop the thyme leaves then toss them with the salts. Wash the potatoes 
thoroughly, then, while they are still wet, roll them in the thyme salt, 
pressing down so the salt adheres to their skins. Set them well apart in the 
roasting tin, on the bed of salt.

Tuck the whole thyme sprigs and cloves of garlic, unpeeled, among the potatoes 
and bake in the preheated oven for an hour, till the potatoes are crunchy 
outside, soft and fluffy within.

Warm the goats’ curd in a small saucepan, crumble in the blue cheese. Remove 
the garlic from the oven, slice each clove open and squeeze the soft, sweet 
flesh within into the cheese. As the blue cheese starts to melt give it a quick 
stir, then pour it into a small, warm bowl.

Remove the potatoes from the oven and wipe off most of the salt, it has done 
its job. Split the potatoes open, then serve with the cheese and garlic dip.

 Turkey, lardo and fennel seed stuffing, cranberry orange sauce. Photograph: 
Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer 
Plump balls of stuffing made with minced turkey. You can get lardo, the silky 
white fat that is such a treat served on rough toast with a trickle of olive 
oil and some crumbled rosemary, from a good Italian grocers. Buy it in a block 
so you can grate it. Failing that, buy it in thin slices and chop it finely.

Enough for 8
fennel seeds 2 tsp
minced turkey 500g
dried chilli flakes 1 tbsp
lardo 150g
dried breadcrumbs 60g
olive oil 2 tbsp

For the sauce
cranberry sauce or jelly 3 heaped tbsp
orange juice 50ml
orange zest 2 tsp
cranberries 100g, fresh or frozen

Toast the fennel seeds for a couple of minutes in a dry frying pan, then tip 
them into a large mixing bowl. Put the turkey mince, chilli and breadcrumbs 
into the bowl then coarsely grate in the lardo. Season generously with both 
salt and black pepper then mix thoroughly.

Shape the stuffing mixture into 8 large balls, place them on a tray and 
refrigerate for 25 minutes. Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4.

To make the sauce, put the cranberry jelly or sauce into a small saucepan and 
place over a moderate heat, add the orange juice and zest and the cranberries 
and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat so the mixture simmers gently and 
leave for five or six minutes until the berries have softened a little. You 
should be able to squash them easily between thumb and forefinger. Remove from 
the heat and leave to settle.

Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan, then fry the stuffing balls moving them 
round as each side browns, until they are golden brown all over. Transfer the 
balls to a baking dish, sitting them snugly together, then spoon over the 
cranberry sauce. Bake for 30 minutes.

Sticky, sweet-sour date molasses is available from most large supermarkets and 
any Middle Eastern grocer.


Serves 6
Cumberland sausage 500g
dates 6
pancetta 75g, thinly sliced
bay leaves 6
sage leaves 4
juniper berries 8
date molasses 2 tbsp

Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Place the Cumberland sausage on a baking 
sheet lined with foil or baking parchment. Split the dates in half and remove 
their stones. Wrap the pancetta rashers around the sausage, tucking a couple of 
the bay leaves, sage leaves and most of the halved dates under as you go. Once 
the pancetta is in place, tuck some of the juniper berries underneath. Scatter 
the rest of the bay and juniper berries on top, then bake for 25 minutes till 
nicely browned. Remove from the oven then baste all over with the date molasses 
and return to the oven for a further 20 minutes or until glossy and sizzling.
