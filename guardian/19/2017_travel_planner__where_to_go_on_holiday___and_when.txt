Book now: summer beach favourites
If you fancy a balmy beach holiday this summer, don’t take any chances. Last 
year, with thousands sidestepping Tunisia, Egypt and Turkey in favour of 
“safer” European options, there was a shortage of holidays in Spain, Italy and 
Portugal in July and August, pushing up prices and limiting last-minute deals. 
With Foreign Office advice largely unchanged, it’s likely to be the same this 
year, so take advantage of early booking offers this month. Thomas Cook, for 
example, has£400 discounts on selected family holidays with deposits from £25pp

January and, despite their names, run until 5 February. They’re held during the

February

Book now: Paris money-saver
It’s no secret that August is the best time to go to Paris, when most 
Parisians migrate to the coast, which means shorter queues and cheaper hotels. 
Booking in February means you’ll get there for less too.Eurostar 
<http://www.eurostar.com/uk-en?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=UK-EN-GEO_LON-CB-[E]&utm_term=eurostar&utm_content=Eurostar%20-%20[E]&gclid=COnZtOnJt9ECFZI8cgodZUIGlQ&gclsrc=ds&dclid=CMzIt-nJt9ECFRKF7Qod4MsJUg>

Go now: Czech Valentine break
Avoid being ripped off this Valentine’s Day by going somewhere where it’s not 
so widely celebrated. In the Czech Republic the special day for lovers comes on 
1 May, in honour of its romantic poet Karel Hynek Mácha, and while 14 February 
is now creeping on to the scene in Prague, you won’t see much sign of it in the 
up-and-coming city of Brno. A quick search found Ryanair flights for two from 
Stansted for £180 return (Feb 13-16) and three nights in the city centre

 for £110, about what you’d pay for a meal for two in Paris or Venice.

March

Book now: spring sunshine
A late Easter means there should be more last-minute deals around for an early 
sunshine boost. Cyprus, Morocco or Crete should all be warm enough for a dip. 
Check the latest weather forecasts then go to websites such asTravelzoo 
<http://www.travelzoo.com/uk/>, Holiday Pirates 
<https://www.holidaypirates.com/> and Icelolly <https://www.icelolly.com/> for 
last-minute bargains. Icelolly has seven nights in Marrakech,staying at Riad

 in the Medina, from £259pp B&B.

Go now: Rome
March is the perfect time to sightsee in Rome – warm enough to enjoy a gelato 
but not so hot that your feet swell. A three-night Rome break at thefour-star 
Hotel Quirinale, with Citalia 
<http://www.citalia.com/holidays/italy/lazio/rome/hotels?locationEntry=Rome&q_searchType=productSearch&departureDay=15&departureMonth=3&departureYear=2017&flexibleDateSearch=true&duration=3n&roomCount=1&adultCount=2&childCount=0&childAge=&childAge=&childAge=&childAge=&childAge=&childAge=&childAge=&childAge=&airport=LGW&windowID=90e428c0-54f0-4bca-9af7-dec518cbb1b7>
 from 15 March costs £388pp, including flights from Gatwick, private transfers 
and three nights’ B&B. The same break at Easter costs £575pp.

April

Book now: next year’s holiday
It’s getting earlier and earlier, but April is now the month when the big 
travel companies release their programmes for the following summer, revealing 
new destinations, hotels and flight routes, often with introductory offers. 
Last April, for example, Thomson and First Choice announced the launch of new 
long-haul destinations such as St Lucia and Cuba on their Dreamliner aircraft 
and seats sold quickly, while Thomas Cook gave away 100,000 children’s holidays 
for £1. If you’re planning a special trip for 2018, why wait?

Go now: late skiing
Ski holiday prices dip towards the end of the season when the snow starts to 
thaw, but choose the right resort and you should still get a decent week’s 
skiing for a fraction of the price. Thanks to the late Easter this year (April 
16), even families can take advantage of the lower late-season prices, 
especially with many schools not returning until 24 April. Tignes is a safe bet 
in the Alps, thanks to its high altitude and glacier. A family of four can stay 
at theChalet Caribou with Esprit Ski 
<http://www.espritski.com/ski-chalets/caribou/> from 16 April 
for £2,443 including flights, a mountainous £4,000 saving on the same holiday 
in February half-term.

May
 Becky’s by the Sea guesthouse, Barbados 
Book now: last-minute London break
According to the number crunchers at accommodation website booking.com, the 
average price of a four-star hotel in London was 25% lower last May than in the 
peak summer months. Based on that finding, this should be a good month to find 
last-minute deals in the capital. (Just avoid May bank holidays and Chelsea 
during the flower show).Citizen M’s new hotel in Shoreditch 
<https://www.citizenm.com/destinations/london/london-shoreditch-hotel> costs 
£152 a night in mid-May, compared with £170 in mid-July. It’s also worth 
considering hostels. TheYHA <http://www.yha.org.uk/places-to-stay/london> has 
seven in the capital:YHA London Central 
<http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/london-central>, five minutes from Oxford Street, 
has private rooms for two people from £85 in May.

Go now: Caribbean sunshine
Falling between the driest (ie expensive) months of January to April, and the 
rainy season, which kicks in around June, May is the ideal time to splash out 
on a Caribbean getaway, especially if you avoid half-term week. Saying that, 
even families can jet off to the Caribbean for lower prices in the May school 
holiday than at Christmas, Easter or in the summer holidays. May can cost 40% 
less than the high season.Seven nights B&B <https://eleganthotels.com/tamarind> 
in a pool/garden view room for two adults at Elegant Hotels’ Tamarind in 
Barbados starts at £1,575 in May, a £1,085 saving on the same holiday in the 
peak months. Or DIY it – flights to Barbados on BA cost from £500 in May, and 
beachside guesthouseBeckys by the Sea <http://www.beckysbythesea.com/> (doubles 
from £59 room-only), is renowned for its friendly welcome.

June

Book now: Christmas cottage
It might feel a bit wrong, but June is the time to book that coastal cottage 
for Christmas. Good places to start areDorset Coastal Cottages 
<https://www.dorsetcoastalcottages.com/>, Sawday’s 
<https://www.sawdays.co.uk/find?country=Britain#!display=list> and Baby 
Friendly Boltholes 
<http://www.babyfriendlyboltholes.co.uk/United-Kingdom-GB/self-catering/>. And 
see our online cottage guide 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jan/17/uk-cottages-rental-properties-companies-guide>
 for more leading rental companies.

Go now: Thai islands
Timing is essential when travelling to Asia. While June is the rainy season 
across much of mainland Thailand, go to the south-eastern islands and you may 
not get any at all. And if you do get the odd short shower, it won’t be enough 
to dampen the savings you’ll make. A 13-night holiday for two withPremier 
Holidays <http://www.premierholidays.co.uk/offers/PREM1179> – with stays in Koh 
Phangan, Koh Tao and Koh Samui, costs £1,499pp in June – £500 less than the 
same holiday in January to March (must be booked by 31 January).

July

Book now: boat to Brittany
With ferries, often the earlier you book, the better the price, and the better 
chance you’ll have of getting a cabin for those popular overnight crossings in 
August.Brittany Ferries <http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/holidays/2017-sale> 
issues prices in early July for the year from November to November. It might 
seem too early to book for the following summer, but there’s only a £35 deposit 
to pay and if cancelling at least 46 days before travel, only your deposit is 
lost (though there is a £15 amendment fee). If going no further than Brittany, 
stay atLes Mouettes in Ille-et-Vilaine 
<https://www.sawdays.co.uk/france/brittany/ille-et-vilaine/les-mouettes> (from 
€55 B&B).

Go now: staycation
You’re probably not surprised to hear that the most expensive week to fly last 
year, according to analysis of 10 billion flights by comparison website 
Cheapflights, was 25-31 July, the first week of the school summer holidays. 
Cheapflight’s money saving tip for July 2017? Stay at home. Britain’s beach 
resorts and rural hotspots are expecting a bumper summer as more UK tourists 
opt to holiday at home and overseas tourists are lured by the weak pound. A 10% 
drop in the value of sterling against the euro means that a holiday in a 
eurozone nation will cost a family of four £245 more now than before Britain 
voted to leave the EU. Added to that, there is a raft of new family attractions 
opening, such as theFforest coaster in Betws y Coed 
<https://www.zipworld.co.uk/adventure/detail/alpine-coaster> in north Wales – a 
tobaggan ride on rails; theSill visitor centre at Hadrian’s Wall 
<http://www.thesill.org.uk/about>, which will get people into the landscapes, 
history and heritage of Northumberland; andWilliam’s Den in Brough 
<http://www.williamsden.co.uk/>, East Yorkshire, which promises to bring the 
outdoors inside with sensory play zones – sure to be a banker given the 
unpredictability of the weather. TheLandmark Trust 
<https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/> still has availability for the week 
starting 21 July at Causeway House – the only house in Northumberland still 
thatched in heather (£1,304, sleeps four).

August

Book now: the same again please …
If the holiday is proving a cracker and a return is planned, why not book for 
next summer before you’ve even checked out? Chances are a good price can be 
negotiated, particularly if it’s a small, family-run business and a friendship 
has been struck up with the owners. They’ll be pleased to cut out the 
middlemen, passing on any commission as a discount – or at least charge you the 
same as this year.

Go now: end of August beach holiday
August is when most Europeans flock to the coast, making it the most crowded 
and expensive time to go away, but leaving it until the last week before 
schools go back can bring significant savings. It may be necessary to dip into 
the first few days of September and get back just before the start of term, but 
the savings are worth it.Simpson Travel <http://www.simpsontravel.com/> has 
villas and apartments in Greece, Turkey, Corsica, Italy and Mallorca and most 
drop in price at the end of the month. Seven nights for four in a two-bed 
apartment at theCosta Nera Suites in Corsica 
<http://www.simpsontravel.com/corsica-holidays/porto-vecchio-and-bonifacio/apartments/costa-nera-suites>
, a three-minute walk from the beach, with hire car and BA flights on Sunday 27 
August, costs from £1,017pp, compared with £1,330pp earlier in the month.

September

Book now: half-term fun
Be more relaxed when it comes to booking October half-term, particularly now 
that more schools are staggering term times. If you can afford another holiday 
after the summer, there’s usually plenty of child-friendly holidays available 
until early October.Haven Holidays <https://www.haven.com/> runs good-value 
Halloween-themed breaks at its 37 parks across Britain, with shows and games, 
and indoor pools. A four-night self-catering, half-term holiday at its Devon 
Cliffs caravan park in Exmouth start at just under £350 for a family of six.

Go now: one last blow-out
Ibiza’s summer season is coming to a close, but possibly the best nights are 
yet to come. The White Island’s famous closing parties start from 
mid-September. Daytime temperatures are still in the mid-20s, but the beaches 
are more chilled and evenings cooler. Low-cost airlines serve Ibiza well, 
particularly from regional airports, and this summerJet2 adds daily flights 
from Stansted <http://www.jet2.com/en/cheap-flights/london-stansted/ibiza>. 
Stay mid-September for four nights at theSunset Penthouse, Café del Mar 
<https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/9276219> (sleeps four), right above the 
island’s famous chill-out bar, for £881. In August the price jumps to around 
£1,300.

October

Book now: festive break
The countdown to Christmas has begun and it won’t be long before snowflakes 
and fairy lights start appearing in shop windows. If you’re starting to feel 
the magic, now is the time to book a festive break, but that doesn’t have to 
mean forking out for Lapland or Disney. For December and most of January,
Amsterdam’s Light Festival <https://amsterdamlightfestival.com/> turns the city 
into a magnificent illuminated show. Join a walking tour, or perhaps the best 
way to see them is on an evening cruise, with a mulled wine or hot chocolate, 
or over dinner. Three nights in a funkyone-bedroom apartment on the city centre 
Amstel canal 
<https://www.housetrip.com/search-properties/amsterdam/413445-6859987/> is £434 
for two in December on housetrip.com.

Go now: autumn aurora
Seeing the northern lights in autumn means fewer people, milder weather and 
lower prices.Best Served Scandinavia’s 
<https://www.best-served.co.uk/destinations/iceland/itineraries/icelands-northern-lights-winter-wonders-135967>
 four-night trip to Iceland starts from £790pp including flights in October 
(compared with £915pp in February), taking in Reykjavik, the Golden Circle and 
Jökulsárlón, with an escorted tour to Thingvellir national park, the famous hot 
springs at Geysir and the spectacular crashing water at Gulfoss, plus a few 
glaciers and the blue Lagoon.

November

Book now: party in New Orleans
Tourist numbers – and accommodation costs – soar in New Orleans in February 
when visitors flock to the city for Mardi Gras. But in 2018 there will be 
another reason to party when the Big Easy celebrates its300th anniversary 
<http://2018nola.com/>. Book in November and it should be possible to snap up 
accommodation deals for the French Quarter music festival in April, one of many 
events to mark the tricentennial. Based on data research, hotel search engine 
hotelscombined.co.uk predicts that theWyndham hotel will cost £104 a night in 
April 2018 
<https://www.hotelscombined.co.uk/Hotels/Search?destination=place%3AFrench_Quarter_New_Orleans&checkin=2017-04-18&checkout=2017-04-19&Rooms=1&adults_1=2&childAges_1=0%2C0&languageCode=EN&currencyCode=GBP&triptype=0&HotelID=1092896>
 – less than half what it would cost in February.

Go now: child-free Florida 
The Sunshine State welcomes holidaymakers year-round, but November is arguably 
the best time to go, as long as you’re child free. Temperatures hover around 
the mid-20s and it’s not overly humid or stormy, but with all the kids still in 
the classroom and pre-Christmas rush, it’s still relatively crowd free. Be sure 
to avoid Thanksgiving (23 November) when traffic can get heavy.Travel Trolley 
<http://www.traveltrolley.co.uk/> has a one-week holiday at the Bahama Bay 
Resort in Kissimmee (room-only) with return flights from Heathrow on 7 November 
for £666. The same holiday in August is £1,128.

December

Book now: for reduced 2018 flights
Coming full circle, December is the time to start planning your 2018 holiday, 
as many airlines and tour operators begin flash sales in the third week of 
December. Last year saw British Airways offering discounts on fares to more 
than 100 destinations, including return flights to Boston from £377 and Mumbai 
from £413; Virgin Atlantic had return flights from Heathrow to New York from 
£399 and Gatwick to Havana from £599 (still valid and running until 7 February 
2017); and easyJet had savings of 20% off more than 400,000 seats. On the 
holiday front, Austravel was offering two weeks in Perth and a west coast 
self-drive trip from £795pp including flights in May or July; and Sovereign was 
cutting an extra £100 off its existing sale prices for six days between 26 and 
31 December.

Go now: safari escape
Escape the festive scrum and treat yourself to an African safari. December 
landscapes in Kenya are green and lush and the ideal habitat for migratory 
birds and fluffy newborns. An eight-night Cheetah Safari departing 3 December 
withKuoni <http://www.kuoni.co.uk/kenya/safaris/cheetah-safari> (including 
Emirates flights from Gatwick) costs from £2,648pp, compared with £3,091pp in 
August. It takes in Samburu, the Rift valley and the Maasai Mara, with not a 
mince pie or bauble in sight.
