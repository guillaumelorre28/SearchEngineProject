For most people who go into space it is a dream come true, but for the man set 
to be the UK’s first Muslim astronaut his priority is making the world a better 
place.

Hussain Manawer, 25, from Ilford, Essex, is due to blast off in 2018 after 
seeing off thousands of other entrants from more than 90 countries in a 
competition.

The poet, charity fundraiser and founder of his own creative agency dedicated 
his victory to everyone who has suffered mental health problems, and said he 
had an important mission in life.

“It’s never really been an ambition of mine [to go into space], but I felt I 
wasn’t contributing enough to the world,” he said. “I got to the point where I 
thought we are failing the world so much in so many different ways. When I saw 
the competition I thought: let me go for it, let me see what happens.

“I am using it as a platform to venture into problems, which is how I think it 
should be. What influenced me is you have to be somebody in order for people to 
take you seriously, in order to have an impact.”

Manawer’s pitch for the Kruger Cowne rising star competition 
<http://www.krugercowne.com/risingstar/> was centred on mental health, from his 
entry video to his final speech featuring a poem about depression and 
self-harm, in which he lamented: “I wasn’t meant for this planet.”

 Hussain Manawer’s poem at the Kruger Cowne Rising Star competition 
He plans to release a mixtape featuring his poetry about mental health, and in 
March he will attempt to set a world record for the largest mental health 
lesson, for 1,000 students from 30 schools from all over the country, at 
Hackney Empire inLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>.

Manawer is fully behind a campaign for schoolchildren to be taught about 
mental health 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/25/teach-mental-health-in-primary-schools-says-advisory-group>
, but believes teachers are under enough pressures and so need outside 
assistance.

Even before winning the space travel competition, Manawer had raised thousands 
of pounds for charities and given lessons on cyberbullying in 400 schools. He 
has a successful YouTube channel,Hussain’s House 
<https://www.youtube.com/user/HussainsHouse>, featuring interviews with the 
comedian Kevin Hart, rapper G-Eazy and radio presenter Charlamagne, and was a 
torchbearer in the buildup to the London Olympics.

He said he saw the competition to travel beyond the 100km mark in XCOR 
Aerospace’s Lynx 
<http://aerospace.xcor.com/reusable-launch-vehicles/lynx-spacecraft/> 
spacecraft as a way of taking his campaigning to another level. The contest was 
run in association with One Young World, a platform for 18- to 30-year-olds, 
supported by the likes of Kofi Annan.

“Never did I think I’m going to win it,” Manawer said. “I just thought if I 
can get through a few stages I get to be associated with some good 
humanitarians and they will take my stuff more seriously. There was Bob Geldof 
and Fatima Bhutto, who has done humanitarian work in Pakistan. I want to host 
meetings of global influencers to effect change.”

His public profile has soared since winning the competition. He fronted a 
launch video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbjZksDF4gs> for London’s night 
tube, has rubbed shoulders with political leaders and royals and given talks 
around the world, all squeezed in between his astronaut training.

Manawer has also become a public face of Muslims at a time of increasing 
scrutiny of the faith. In his victory speech he declared: “My name is Hussain 
and I am not a terrorist,” an allusion to the hit 2010 Bollywood film My Name 
is Khan.

“Something triggered in my head and I thought: the world’s watching a Muslim 
person get an award, I want to say something meaningful,” said Manawer. “It’s 
good for people to see the positive side of a religion that gets missed a lot.”

At the same time, he does not want his religion to obscure his overriding 
message. “To me it’s very clear we are failing the world’s mental health,” said 
Manawer. “If we can tackle that, it will solve a lot of problems.”
