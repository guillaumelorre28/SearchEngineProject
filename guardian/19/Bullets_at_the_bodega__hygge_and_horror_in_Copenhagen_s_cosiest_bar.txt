A bullet is embedded in the wall behind the bar at Rosengårdens Bodega, a 
drinking den in central Copenhagen. A member of the Danish resistance movement 
put it there on 20 April 1944 – one of several shots fired during the 
assassination of a Nazi snitch known as the Horse Thief. Landlord Lars 
Matell-Hyllested will show you the bullet if you follow his simple rule: “Buy a 
shot, see the shot.” He’ll then point to a shelf bearing bottles of bitter 
Danish liquor. If you’ve got a bold palate, try Gammel Dansk. It means old 
Danish, perhaps because that’s how it makes you feel. Rosengårdens Bodega also 
serves a wide range of Danish beers.

Pursuing the patriotic theme, you can get three types of Denmark’s iconic open

. Of course, locals call it smørrebrød, which trips off the tongue after a shot 
or two of Gammel Dansk.

Be sure to linger – especially if you think hygge

 is hogwash. More than 125 years old, Rosengårdens Bodega is a prime example of 
a traditional working-class bar. Its decor hasn’t changed in decades: 
wood-panelled walls, monochrome photos of various Danes and a vintage phone 
booth. At night, when candlelight flickers across its nicotine-stained ceiling, 
it’s one of Copenhagen’s cosiest corners. But be prepared for bleary-eyed 
barflies and a literary crowd – writers, journalists, students – all suitably 
enamoured with the bar’s storied past.
