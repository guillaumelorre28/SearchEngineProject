For me, the joy of a Christmas 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> dinner – or indeed any 
roast – are the leftover roots and greens, that can be fried up until deeply 
golden and crisp, then served topped with a fried egg and a spoonful of a 
punchy chutney.

I love a Christmas-dinner sandwich, too: stuffing, greens, roasted squash and 
a slick of cranberry sauce between two slices of bread. It’s a once-a-year 
thing, taking stodginess to the next level, but it’s a mark of the season, and 
I always eat one or two with glee.

Another favourite leftover is Christmas pudding. I find it too rich to eat on 
the day, so it’s something I enjoy on the days after, fried in a bit of butter 
in little portions until the fruit goes sticky, crumbled on top of a batch of 
brownies, sprinkled over ice-cream or torn into an apple crumble.

However, the leftovers that I really want to put to use are the unopened 
packets of things I have bought one too many of – the more obscure vegetables I 
fancied at the greengrocer, or the seasonal ingredient I picked up on a whim of 
festive enthusiasm, but which then sits around redundant.

In my house there are always a few cooked chestnuts left over from the 
stuffing recipe, some packets of greens or brussels sprouts, bundles of herbs – 
parsley, thyme, sage, tarragon or rosemary – and heaving bowls of citrus fruit 
that I have bought by the crateload.

So here are two recipes that use up a few of the things I always seem to have 
in stock between Christmas and the new year.

Greens and brussels sprout caesar slaw

This is a Boxing Day salad to eat with cold cuts and cheeses. Any leftover 
cabbage or greens would work well, but be sure to shred them quite thinly. You 
can also make good use of a few common festive kitchen leftovers: Christmas 
nuts (almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts and pecans all work well), cheese (any blue 
or hard cheese) and any soft herbs you have (a mixture of a couple works best). 
This slaw is better after sitting dressed for a couple of hours, as the 
dressing softens the greens a little, and when the flavours have come together.

Serves 6-8
For the dressing
50g sunflower seeds
50g nuts (I used blanched almonds)
1 garlic clove, peeled
1 tbsp dijon mustard
Juice of ½ a lemon

 For the slaw
350g raw brussels sprouts/cabbage
About 400g greens (I used 2 heads of cavolo nero)
About 150g leftover hard or blue cheese (optional)
A small bunch of leftover soft herbs (parsley, tarragon, chives, dill, chervil)

1 First soak your seeds and nuts in cold water: 15 minutes will do, but you 
could leave them as long as overnight – this will help the dressing become more 
creamy.

2 Once soaked, drain the seeds and nuts and add them to a blender with all the 
other dressing ingredients, then blend until smooth. Add 200ml water and blend 
to a creamy dressing. Keep in the fridge until you are ready to dress the salad.

3 Peel and wash the sprouts, or destem and wash the greens. Slice as finely as 
you can, then put them into a big bowl. Roughly chop the herbs and add these to 
the bowl, then pour over the dressing and mix well. I do this with clean hands 
to make sure that the dressing coats each little bit of green. When you are 
ready to serve, crumble over some leftover cheese.

Chestnut and ricotta pancakes with quick clementine jam

If your house is anything like mine, the fruit bowl heaves with clementines. I 
can’t get enough of them. This quick compote is a good way to use any 
lingerers. I add a pinch of saffron for its sunshine colour and warming 
flavour, but a couple of cardamom pods or a pinch of cinnamon would work as 
well. This is half compote, half marmalade and is wonderful served alongside 
some roughly chopped nuts – or even chestnuts, if you have any left – atop the 
golden ricotta pancakes.

Serves 4 (makes about 8 pancakes)
For the citrus compote
About 300g of any leftover citrus (about 6 clementines, 1 large grapefruit or 
3 small oranges)
2 tbsp honey
A pinch of saffron (optional)

 For the pancakes
250g ricotta cheese
125g flour
1 tbsp baking powder
A good pinch of salt
2 eggs, separated
2 tbsp golden caster sugar
200ml milk (I use almond milk)
100g cooked chestnuts, roughly chopped
Grated zest of 2 lemons
Grated zest of ½ an orange or 1 clementine
Butter or coconut oil, for frying

1 Put the ricotta into a sieve and leave it over a bowl for 10 minutes or so, 
to allow the excess liquid to drain off.

2 Meanwhile, make the citrus compote by peeling the fruits and removing any 
large pieces of pith.

3 Put the flesh into a pan with the honey and the saffron, if you are using 
it. Cook slowly for about 10 minutes until you have a loose, jammy consistency.

4 Mix the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.

5 Whisk the egg yolks with the milk in a jug. Add to the flour mixture a 
little at a time and gently beat until smooth. Fold in the chestnuts then the 
lemon and orange zest.

6 In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until frothy, then add the sugar and 
whisk until you have stiff meringue-like peaks.

7 Using a spatula or metal spoon, gently fold half the egg whites into the 
flour and egg mixture. Now fold in the ricotta, then the rest of the egg 
whites. You should have a light and fluffy batter.

8 Put a large nonstick frying pan on a low heat and add a tiny bit of butter 
or coconut oil. Working in batches, add about half a ladleful of the batter to 
the pan for each pancake. Cook the batter until the bottom is golden and the 
edges are cooked. Once bubbles have risen to the top of the pancake, flip it 
and cook on the other side for a minute. Once each one is done, keep your 
pancakes in a warm oven while you cook the rest.

9 Stack the pancakes high on your plate and serve with the clementine 
marmalade spooned over the top.
