Tuolumne meadows in Yosemite national park, California 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california>, is a rock climber’s dream. 
Renowned for its soaring granite domes this broad expanse of alpine meadow is a 
haven from the park’s tourists in the summer months.

But the flat terrain, surrounded by those vertical, glacially sculpted, rock 
faces, is also a puzzle. The tough rock walls are made from the exactly the 
same type of granite that underlies the meadow. So why did the domes stand 
firm, while glaciers carved out the meadow with ease?

Differing rock types often explain big features in the landscape; harder rocks 
stand proud, softer rocks are eroded away. But at Tuolumne meadows it is the 
cracks in the rock that are key.

Writing in the journal GSA Today 
<http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/24/11/abstract/i1052-5173-24-11-4.htm>
, Richard Becker, from the Wisconsin University and colleagues describe how the 
granite of the domes contains very few fractures, while the granite underlying 
the meadows has a cluster of vertical parallel fractures.

This uneven distribution of fractures appeared about 85m years ago, when a 
volcanic intrusion forced its way through the granite.

The areas where the magma squeezed through became the most fractured. In more 
recent times (the last few tens of thousands years) glaciers etched out this 
climber’s playground.

Ice flowing parallel to fractures carved out deep, straight sided, canyons 
(like the Tenaya canyon), but ice flowing perpendicular to fractures quarried 
large open expanses (Tuolumne meadows), leaving behind steep ridges of less 
fractured rock (Lembert dome).

The hypothesis would have pleased the geologist François Matthes, who came to 
a remarkably similar conclusion 84 years ago.
