Murray speaks

“It was a scrappy match,” says Murray. “The last few days have been pretty 
tough. It’s been a stressful few days. Things have been changing all the time. 
I’ll try to refocus.” On his quarter-final opponent, David Ferrer, he says: “He 
always makes you work hard. It will be a tough match.” Off he trots. That was a 
good workout for Murray but he didn’t really have to do much more than allow 
Tomic to make errors when games became tight. Thanks for reading. Bye.

Murray beats Tomic 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (4)!

Murray has the mini-break at 3-2. Tomic can’t handle the pace of a Murray 
forehand and he drifts a backhand wide. That’s 4-2. Murray aces with a 
scorching 129mph serve down the middle. 5-2. Tomic looks tired as he hits a 
weak backhand into the net. Four match points for Murray. He misses the first. 
He misses the second after Tomic puts huge pressure on Murray, increasing the 
pace on his forehand to make Murray have to try again. But he takes the third 
thanks to an over-juiced Tomic return and wins the tie-break 7-4. Well played.

Third set tie-break: Tomic 1-3 Murray

Murray gets a mini-break, but as is the way in this match, Tomic breaks back 
immediately, using a whipped cross-court forehand to put Murray off balance and 
make him hit a forehand into the net. Tomic then stiffens up with a fantastic 
chance to take a 2-1 lead but hits a forehand volley into the net from mere 
metres. Murray breaks Tomic again. Murray should go on to win this …

Third set: Tomic* 4-6, 4-6, 6-5 Murray (*denotes server)

The net helps Tomic out at 15-0, gathering a backhand volley in and then 
squirting the ball out on Murray’s side of the court. Tomic goes long to bring 
Murray back into it at 30-30. But a brilliantly-placed Tomic forehand gives him 
game point. A not-so-brilliantly placed Tomic forehand brings Murray back up to 
deuce. A big first serve. Advantage Tomic. Deuce. Ace. Advantage Tomic. Deuce. 
And then Murray shows wonderful balance to find the court with a backhand from 
down by his feet to bring up a break point. Tomic shows steel, though. A lovely 
shot and then an ace swings the game back into his favour at advantage. They 
trade deuce again and Tomic rushes into the net to try to finish this game off. 
He does.

Third set: Tomic 4-6, 4-6, 5-5 Murray* (*denotes server)

Murray serving to stay in the set. Ace down the middle. 15-0. Tomic is then 
ever so close with a huge forehand return down the line that is centimetres 
out. Murray’s 17th ace makes it 40-0. And another huge Murray serve puts the 
pressure back on Tomic. Great serving to take the sting out of the Australian’s 
game.

Third set: Tomic* 4-6, 4-6, 5-4 Murray (*denotes server)

Tomic double-faults. A sign of tiredness? He then tests Murray’s lung 
capacity, sending him skittering around court before forcing the Brit to 
overstretch on a forehand and find the net. 30-15. Murray battles back to 30-30 
and then a fine Tomic second serve ace brings up game point. Murray’s having 
none of that. He jumps all over Tomic’s next second serve, nonchalantly zipping 
a backhand across court and home. Deuce. Tomic takes advantage and then shows 
feather fingers to win the game with a backhand half-volley that spins over the 
net and just lands in. Lovely stuff.

Third set: Tomic 4-6, 4-6, 4-4 Murray* (*denotes server)

Tomic brings the best out of Murray with some explosive groundstrokes that 
Murray chases down before dispatching a backhand across Tomic and into the 
corner to make it 15-0. Murray drags Tomic up to the net on the next point 
before lobbing his opponent, who attempts to return between his legs but fails. 
If only Tomic had begun the match like this. Murray’s winning points instead of 
Tomic losing them now. But, still, Murray takes the game.

Third set: Tomic* 4-6, 4-6, 4-3 Murray (*denotes server)

Tomic wins a rally of great variety at 15-0 up, forcing Murray on to the back 
foot before dispatching an overhead to raucous cheers from the crowd. Murray 
has no answer. Tomic finishes on an ace. Perhaps the Australian has embraced 
the ‘nothing to lose’ moment. Murray will have to be resolute on his serve to 
see this match out in the unfussy manner that was expected of him.

Third set: Tomic 4-6, 4-6, 3-3 Murray* (*denotes server)

Tomic tries to slam a weak Murray second serve back across court. He does, but 
it’s too long. 15-0. He’s right up for this now. Murray needs to remain calm 
and put out the fire that’s suddenly appeared in his opponent’s belly. He does, 
watching Tomic miss two returns before comfortably taking the game at 40-0.

Third set: Tomic* 4-6, 4-6, 3-2 Murray (*denotes server)

Suddenly Tomic has a bit more pep in his step. His first serve looks well 
oiled and he races to 40-0 up. And now some sparkling tennis from Tomic. He 
sees the game out with a backhand volley plucked right from the top draw that 
gets the crowd off their feet and leaves Murray looking perplexed. He looked 
like he’d given up the ghost five minutes ago. Not any more. Wonderful stuff.

Third set: Tomic 4-6, 4-6, 2-2 Murray* (*denotes server)

Tomic wins a lengthy rally at the beginning of this game but it’s Murray error 
that gives him the point. 0-15. He steps in to zip a backhand down the line to 
make it 0-30. Hang on, he’s having a go. Murray tries to lob the big man as he 
rushes into the net and it’s 0-40. He suffered last time he rushed around court 
like that. Tomic hits long. 15-40. Suck it in Bernard. This time a return from 
a second serve lands at Murray’s feet. The Brit can’t return it. Tomic breaks.

Third set: Tomic* 4-6, 4-6, 1-2 Murray (*denotes server)

Tomic looks fatigued and beaten here. His body language is awful. He gives 
this game away with some errant backhands. He lets Murray break him without so 
much as looking like he gives a flying one. 40-15. Murray wins.

Third set: Tomic 4-6, 4-6, 1-1 Murray* (*denotes server)

Murray finds the baseline to go 15-0 up. A deep second serve from Murray 
forces an error from Tomic. 30-0. An ace that sends Tomic the wrong way makes 
it 40-0. Big serve Murray. Game Murray. We’re on serve here. Who’d have 
imagined that after the helter-skelter breaks in the first set.

Third set: Tomic* 4-6, 4-6, 1-0 Murray (*denotes server)

Will Tomic, a man who is not known for his physicality, battle back from two 
sets down in a five-setter? Not likely. He’s given a reasonable account of 
himself but the difference in class at the key moments in the match has been 
apparent. Murray has been sure-handed when it has mattered. Tomic hasn’t. 
Murray has taken a toilet break. I should have followed suit. Ah well. I’ll 
hold on. Murray returns to court, changes his top, and off we go. Tomic begins 
with two solid first serves and a stonking forehand from left to right that 
Murray hasn’t a prayer of getting to. 30-0. Murray halts Tomic’s charge and 
brings the game back to 15-30 but Tomic connects perfectly with a forehand down 
the line that gives him game point. From a leading position his forehand lets 
him down again. Deuce. Murray seems to slip during the next rally. He feels for 
his toes as though he overstretched. Advantage Tomic. A brilliant Murray 
return. Deuce. Tomic aces and then booms another big serve down the middle that 
Murray has no answer to. Game Tomic.

Murray to serve for the second set. Crash! Ace down the middle. He means

Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 4-5 Murray (*denotes server)

Tomic’s forehand lets him down at 15-15 and Murray takes a 30-15 lead. Murray 
then swings and misconnects with a Tomic second serve that wasn’t doing much 
more than saying a polite ‘hello’. Murray overhits a forehand to let Tomic off 
the hook. He challenges. Nothing doing. 40-30. And then Tomic, with a great 
chance to win the game, is found wanting on his forehand again. Deuce. Both 
players come into the net with some delicate drop-shots. You’d think Murray 
would win that particular rally wouldn’t you? He doesn’t. Murray finds the net. 
Advantage Tomic. Game Tomic.

Second set: Tomic 4-6, 3-5 Murray* (*denotes server)

Can Tomic put Murray’s serve under pressure here? Murray fails to get his 
first serve in but a second-serve with kick puts Tomic on the back foot and 
allows Murray to come into the net and force his opponent to miss. 15-0. The 
Australian shows class with a flat backhand down the line that Murray can only 
gawp at. 15-15. Tomic can do nothing with a big first-serve from Murray (30-15) 
but he battles back to 30-30. Tomic doesn’t attack a second serve from Murray 
when he has the chance to and the Brit wallops an indie-out forehand home. 
40-30. Some velvet-gloved hands from Murray after coming into the net give him 
the game. Tomic is serving to stay in the second set.

Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 3-4 Murray (*denotes server)

Tomic still appears to be puffing and panting at the beginning of this game 
too. At 15-15 his forehand lets him down and Murray’s in with a sniff of a 
break at 15-30. Tomic recovers, though, and sends a slick forehand down the 
line to come back into it at 30-30 before sending Murray to the back of the 
court with a cross-court backhand before volleying home authoritatively. He 
sees the game out comfortably in the end. He was cool under pressure there.

Second set: Tomic 4-6, 2-4 Murray* (*denotes server)

Tomic gets himself into a long rally with a decent return of serve. He does 
nothing more than hang in there but Murray goes long. 0-15. A splendid rally 
then ensues in which both players trade drop shots. Tomic gallops back and 
forth trying to keep a lid on the rally but can’t keep a desperate forehand in 
as Murray caomes out on top. Tomic is gassed after that. Murray runs away with 
it. That’s why Tomic prefers to be still during rallies I suppose.

Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 2-3 Murray (*denotes server)

Tomic drags Murray around the court with some powerful groundstrokes and 
pushes the Brit into the corner with a delicious backhand that kisses the net 
on the way over. Murray can only reply into the net. Murray digs in and forces 
another error out of Tomic. 15-30. Tomic tries to be cute with a forehand 
drop-shot from mid-court but mishits. 15-40. He saves one break point. And then 
aces wide to save the next. Gutsy. Deuce. Murray bosses the next point and 
disguises a backhand to send his opponent the wrong way to bring up advantage. 
Tomic battles back to deuce but hands the advantage back to Murray by failing 
to get enough purchase on a low Murray forehand and finding the net. Murray 
mishandles his racket and mishits to allow Tomic to get back to deuce. The 
Australian finds a powerful first serve when he needs it. Advantage. A good 
second serve out wide draws Murray into a an overhit backhand. A resilient hold.

Second set: Tomic 4-6, 1-3 Murray* (*denotes server)

Konta has beaten Makarova. Well done Jo. Now can Murray have a comfortable 
service game? Perhaps. He begins with an ace. 15-0. Can he follow it up? Nope. 
Tomic rifles an inside-out forehand right to the corner of the court. Muray 
glances at it. ‘Nope, not chasing that one.’ Murray challenges a backhand of 
his down the line that looked well in to me. It is. Right on the line. Murray 
moves Tomic around the court and comes into the net to take a 30-15 lead. He 
almost blasts Tomic’s racket out of his hand with a serve down the middle 
before acing to win it. That was, indeed, more comfortable.

Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 1-2 Murray (*denotes server)

Murray dictates the tempo like the world No2 he is in this game. He springs on 
to Tomic’s serve to bring up 0-30 and then plays a perfectly weighted backhand 
across court that Tomic can only watch like a static goalkeeper to bring up 
break point. Murray breaks Tomic for a fifth time. Can someone hold their serve 
please?

Second set: Tomic 4-6, 1-1 Murray* (*denotes server)

A game of errors. Murray dithers and allows Tomic to take a 15-0 lead. Tomic 
looks like he has a few too many shots in his head as he wafts a backhand into 
the net. Tomic is slow to the net as he hits a volley on to the net cord and 
watches it land out. He then rallies himself and jumps all over a Murray second 
serve with a ferocious backhand-winner down the line. 30-30. Tomic hangs in the 
next rally with his forehand, Murray arrives late to one and overcooks a 
forehand. Break point. The Brit then gives the game away with a forehand 
drop-shot from way too deep that doesn’t stand a chance of making it over the 
net. All square.

Second set: Tomic* 4-6, 0-1 Murray (*denotes server)

Tomic is lazy with a forehand, hitting a flat one into the net when he looked 
to be a good position and forcing Murray wide. Murray pounces on a weak second 
serve to go 30-15 up before Tomic’s forehand falters again after some 
industrious running from Murray put the Australian under pressure on the 
baseline. Murray goes long with a forehand on the first break point but dashes 
into the net to finish off some good craftsmanship with a backhand volley 
across Tomic and into the corner of the court.

First set: Tomic 4-6 Murray* (*denotes server)

Murray has been a bit up and down in this set. The consistency he has shown so 
far in this tournament hasn’t been evident. Tomic has played well but he’s 
hardly been wonderful. Murray gets a booming first serve in to go 15-0 up but 
Tomic strikes back with a courageous cross-court forehand that Murray attacks 
and hits long. 15-15. Murray raises his game and plays some solid groundstrokes 
behind his first serve to bring up set point. There then ensues a battle of 
sliced backhands that Murray wins thanks to Tomic crumbling in what seemed like 
a game of tennis limbo.First set for Murray!

First set: Tomic* 4-5 Murray (*denotes server)

Tomic bounces into his service game, going 30-0 up before Murray shows great 
dexterity with a backhand volley to leave Tomic staring at it from the back of 
the court. 30-15. The Australian makes an error to let Murray back into it at 
30-30 before firing his second ace wide to bring up game point and forcing 
Murray long with a powerful forehand to see it out. He’s making Murray work for 
this.

First set: Tomic 3-5 Murray* (*denotes server)

Murray has raised his first-serve percentage to 57% and that helped him to 
recover after he let Tomic back into it mid-set. 15-0. Then he misses his first 
serve and drops a weak second serve into mid-court that Tomic dispatches down 
the line with an easy backhand. Ace. 30-15. Tomic keeps his forehand firm after 
a good Murray serve at 30-15 and stys in a rally that he finishes with an 
overhead smash. A fantastic return helps him to bring up a break point. He has 
a sniff. Boom! Murray aces. Sniff gone. Deuce. But Tomic makes Murray move with 
some wonderfully placed shots in a rally in which he almost stands still for 
the duration. Murray serves-volleys aggressively as if to jump all over Tomic’s 
mojo. Back to deuce. Tomic hits a tired backhand into the net. Set point. 
Murray misses his first serve, Tomic slams a backhand return at Murray and the 
Brit finds he net. Deuce. Murray comes into the net and gives Tomic a third 
break point by hitting an errant forehand volley into the net. A brave second 
serve knocks Tomic off balance and it’s back to deuce. But Murray is erratic 
here. He tries to juice a crosscourt backhand but it’s snatched at and lands 
into the net. Tomic breaks after a fantastic return of serve. On we go.

First set: Tomic* 2-5 Murray (*denotes server)

Tomic tries to rally down the middle of the court on too many occasions and 
hang in a game that Murray controls with sliced backhands. His serve isn’t bad 
but Murray is too good, too pumped up for him, to handle. 0-40. Game. Muray 
will serve for the set.

First set: Tomic 2-4 Murray* (*denotes server)

Murray fails to get his first serve in but makes up for it by dragging Tomic 
across court and then hitting a stern backhand down the line to take control. 
15-0. 30-0. An 129mph ace down the middle brings up 40-0 but Tomic returns 
aggressively to halt Murray’s charge. 15-40. Murray finds 129mph again though 
with an ace down the middle. Much easier for Murray that. Shows you what a 
first serve can do for a game.

First set: Tomic* 2-3 Murray (*denotes server)

Murray, presumably with the inner funk on, immediately strikes back. Tomic 
helps him on his way with a dreadful backhand that is hit long when he had the 
time and space to make it land. At 15-30 the match’s most enthralling rally 
takes place. It’s a 20+ stroke marathon that weaves around the court before 
Murray wins it with a phenomenal whipped cross-court forehand that tickles the 
edge of the line when Tomic looked to be in control. Tomic applauds it. Murray 
sees the game out and breaks back.

First set: Tomic 2-2 Murray* (*denotes server)

The crowd aren’t particularly boisterous in support of Tomic here. They 
presumably find him hard to like due to his off-court shenanigans. Murray gives 
Tomic a sniff with two overhit forehands. He’s a little impatient to be honest. 
A rollicking ace, his second of the match, brings it back to 15-30 though. 
Murray tries to be too cute with a drop shot as Tomic steams into the net. It 
hits the lip of the net and drops back to his side of the court. Murray gets 
back to 30-40 with a booming 130mph ace. Tomic then emerges from the match’s 
longest rally as the game’s winner, with Murray slamming a weak forehand into 
the net. He’s back in this.

First set: Tomic* 1-2 Murray (*denotes server)

Tomic carelessly slams a forehand into the net at 15-15 to give Murray another 
opportunity to pile the pressure on. Murray fires one long to bring Tomic back 
into it at 30-30. Tomic than juices a serve wide that Murray attacks but hits 
long. The Brit then finds his groove in a rally that goes all the way around 
the court to bring up deuce. Tomic sends Murray the wrong way after getting the 
upper hand on his serve but then allows Murray back into it but the young 
Australian focuses and plays two incredibly crafted points on his second serve 
to take his first game. Well done.

First set: Tomic 0-2 Murray* (*denotes server)

Murray’s rather erratic as he begins his first service game. A powerful 
opening serve helps bring up 15-0 but is followed by a double fault and then an 
overcooked forehand after Tomic returned right to the line, where Murray 
couldn’t shift his feet. Murray brings up 30-30 and defends well before Tomic 
shows his weakness on his forehand down the line, pushing one wide. 40-30. 
Murray looks in control as a 10+-stroke rally ensues but then carelessly hits a 
forehand into the net. Deuce. Murray grumbles about the big screen showing the 
live match through points instead of the usual highlights. Murray brings up 
advantage thanks to a Tomic error. It’s not the best service game from Murray 
this. He struggles to get his first serve in on a number of occasions. Tomic 
pounces on a second serve to bring up deuce again but Murray fires a 
cross-court bakhand in and then aces to win the game.

First set: Tomic* 0-1 Murray (*denotes server)

First blood Murray. He bends the game his way with a delicious backhand drop 
shot with a great deal of spin at 15-15. Tomic looks weak as he comes into the 
net at 15-30 and gives Murray an easy volley into the centre court to make it 
15-40. Murray wafts a forehand return away to break immediately. Tomic may have 
some tactical thinking to do.

Andy Murray and Bernard Tomic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic>
 have done their backstage stretches and are out on court at Rod Laver Arena. 
Both players have their gamefaces on as they strut out to warm up. The crowd 
appear to be a little more supportive of Tomic than Murray, but not by much. 
The Brit is very popular in Australia.

Greg Rusedski is giving Tomic absolutely no chance in this match. He laughs 
away Tomic’s talk of having learned from Anderson’s defeat of Murray in the US 
Open and just reckons Murray is too strong, too focused and too good to be 
troubled by the Australian. He reckons Tomic’s physicality and forehand need 
work if he’s to push into the world top 10.

While we wait for Andy Murray and Bernard Tomic to make their way to the Rod 
Laver Arena I’ll just give you a quick reminder of some of the results so far 
today. Two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka cruised to an easy 
6-2, 6-4 win against Barbora Strycova. She’ll play Angelique Kerber in the last 
eight after shewent through to the last eight for the first time with a 6-4, 
6-0 victory over fellow German Annika Beck. The zany No23 seedGael Monfils made 
it into the quarter-finalsof the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> for the first time after 
defeating the unseeded Russian Andrey Kuznetsov. He made a ridiculous dive for 
a shot at one stage perhaps forgetting he was playing on a hard court but 
managed to avoid injury. Meanwhile,David Ferrer and John Isner are on serve n 
the first set of their match on the Hisense Arena. The winner faces Murray or 
Tomic.

In the match that has just finished on Rod Laver Arena, the fourth seed, Stan 
Wawrinka, has just been beaten in five sets by Milos Raonic. It’s a superb 
victory for the Canadian 14th seed. He showed great resilience after the 
momentum looked to be with Wawrinka, who had won two sets on the bounce going 
into the final set. It ended 6-4, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-3.

4.50pm GMT 16:50  <> 

Good morning/afternoon/evening. Welcome to coverage of the fourth-round match 
between the second seed, Andy Murray, and the 16th seed,Bernard Tomic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic>. The odds here are stacked 
firmly in favour of Murray, who has beaten Tomic in their last three meetings 
without ever losing a set or being made to feel even a smidgin uncomfortable. 
However, Tomic will have a considerable wind behind him in the form of a 
boisterous crowd on Rod Laver Arena, who will try to give the Australian No1 a 
bit more pep in his step as he attempts to put Murray under pressure.

Tomic, who is no stranger to criticism for a perceived lax attitude, appears 
to be taking this match very seriously indeed and has been thorough in his 
research. He says he will use Kevin Anderson’s defeat of Murray in the last 16 
of the US Open as motivation. “Andy loves playing players that attack. I don’t 
think he likes players like John Isner and Anderson,” Tomic said. “You have to 
take the ball to him, play aggressive, but not too aggressive, and rally at the 
right time.” So, perhaps he’ll try to draw Murray into attacking the game and 
look to exploit mistakes rather than push the tempo of rallies himself. A good 
tactical plan, or would it be folly to give a player of Murray’s quality the 
chance to shape the match? Given, he’s lost every set he’s ever played against 
Murray perhaps he knows better than anyone else what he needs to change. For a 
player as tall as he is, 6ft 5in, he can vary the pace of rallies quite 
skilfully. He may need to do that today if he is to prevent Murray from getting 
into the groove.

Tomic has had time to have a pop at Roger Federer too, which doesn’t seem the 
smartest thing to do. Responding to Federer’s perceived criticism of him in 
Brisbane earlier in the month when he appeared puzzled by Tomic’s lack of 
progress since emerging as a player of rich promise a few years ago, he said: 
“If he believes I’m very far away from the top 10, I also believe my prediction 
that he’s nowhere near Novak’s tennis right now.” I’m sure Federer is stinging.

As for Murray, he’ll be grateful that his father-in-law, Nigel Sears, has been 
released from hospital 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/24/nigel-sears-given-green-light-to-fly-home-after-australian-open-collapse>
 and is well enough to return home to be with Murray’s pregnant wife, Kim. he 
must have been a little shaken in the immediate aftermath of his four-set 
victory over João Sousa. He’ll need to focus again and continue to play with 
the authority that has led to his unruffled progress into the last 16 in 
Melbourne. I’m looking forward to this.

Andy Murray eases past Bernard Tomic in Australian Open fourth round
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/25/andy-murray-bernard-tomic-australian-open> 
“It was a scrappy match,” says Murray. “The last few days have been pretty 
tough. It’s been a stressful few days. Things have been changing all the time. 
I’ll try to refocus.” On his quarter-final opponent, David Ferrer, he says: “He 
always makes you work hard. It will be a tough match.” Off he trots. That was a 
good workout for Murray but he didn’t really have to do much more than allow 
Tomic to make errors when games became tight. Thanks for reading. Bye.
 
Murray has the mini-break at 3-2. Tomic can’t handle the pace of a Murray 
forehand and he drifts a backhand wide. That’s 4-2. Murray aces with a 
scorching 129mph serve down the middle. 5-2. Tomic looks tired as he hits a 
weak backhand into the net. Four match points for Murray. He misses the first. 
He misses the second after Tomic puts huge pressure on Murray, increasing the 
pace on his forehand to make Murray have to try again. But he takes the third 
thanks to an over-juiced Tomic return and wins the tie-break 7-4. Well played.

Murray gets a mini-break, but as is the way in this match, Tomic breaks back 
immediately, using a whipped cross-court forehand to put Murray off balance and 
make him hit a forehand into the net. Tomic then stiffens up with a fantastic 
chance to take a 2-1 lead but hits a forehand volley into the net from mere 
metres. Murray breaks Tomic again. Murray should go on to win this …
 
Murray shows steely resolve as he serves to stay in the set. He stands firm to 
take a 30-0 lead. But Tomic forces Murray out wide and makes him volley into 
the net. 30-15. Murray then drives a second serve into thebody of Tomic. He 
can’t move his hands quickly enough and overhits his backhand. Murray holds. 
Tie break.

The net helps Tomic out at 15-0, gathering a backhand volley in and then 
squirting the ball out on Murray’s side of the court. Tomic goes long to bring 
Murray back into it at 30-30. But a brilliantly-placed Tomic forehand gives him 
game point. A not-so-brilliantly placed Tomic forehand brings Murray back up to 
deuce. A big first serve. Advantage Tomic. Deuce. Ace. Advantage Tomic. Deuce. 
And then Murray shows wonderful balance to find the court with a backhand from 
down by his feet to bring up a break point. Tomic shows steel, though. A lovely 
shot and then an ace swings the game back into his favour at advantage. They 
trade deuce again and Tomic rushes into the net to try to finish this game off. 
He does.
 
Murray serving to stay in the set. Ace down the middle. 15-0. Tomic is then 
ever so close with a huge forehand return down the line that is centimetres 
out. Murray’s 17th ace makes it 40-0. And another huge Murray serve puts the 
pressure back on Tomic. Great serving to take the sting out of the Australian’s 
game.
 
Tomic double-faults. A sign of tiredness? He then tests Murray’s lung 
capacity, sending him skittering around court before forcing the Brit to 
overstretch on a forehand and find the net. 30-15. Murray battles back to 30-30 
and then a fine Tomic second serve ace brings up game point. Murray’s having 
none of that. He jumps all over Tomic’s next second serve, nonchalantly zipping 
a backhand across court and home. Deuce. Tomic takes advantage and then shows 
feather fingers to win the game with a backhand half-volley that spins over the 
net and just lands in. Lovely stuff.

Tomic brings the best out of Murray with some explosive groundstrokes that 
Murray chases down before dispatching a backhand across Tomic and into the 
corner to make it 15-0. Murray drags Tomic up to the net on the next point 
before lobbing his opponent, who attempts to return between his legs but fails. 
If only Tomic had begun the match like this. Murray’s winning points instead of 
Tomic losing them now. But, still, Murray takes the game.
 
Tomic wins a rally of great variety at 15-0 up, forcing Murray on to the back 
foot before dispatching an overhead to raucous cheers from the crowd. Murray 
has no answer. Tomic finishes on an ace. Perhaps the Australian has embraced 
the ‘nothing to lose’ moment. Murray will have to be resolute on his serve to 
see this match out in the unfussy manner that was expected of him.
 
Tomic tries to slam a weak Murray second serve back across court. He does, but 
it’s too long. 15-0. He’s right up for this now. Murray needs to remain calm 
and put out the fire that’s suddenly appeared in his opponent’s belly. He does, 
watching Tomic miss two returns before comfortably taking the game at 40-0.

Suddenly Tomic has a bit more pep in his step. His first serve looks well 
oiled and he races to 40-0 up. And now some sparkling tennis from Tomic. He 
sees the game out with a backhand volley plucked right from the top draw that 
gets the crowd off their feet and leaves Murray looking perplexed. He looked 
like he’d given up the ghost five minutes ago. Not any more. Wonderful stuff.
 
Tomic wins a lengthy rally at the beginning of this game but it’s Murray error 
that gives him the point. 0-15. He steps in to zip a backhand down the line to 
make it 0-30. Hang on, he’s having a go. Murray tries to lob the big man as he 
rushes into the net and it’s 0-40. He suffered last time he rushed around court 
like that. Tomic hits long. 15-40. Suck it in Bernard. This time a return from 
a second serve lands at Murray’s feet. The Brit can’t return it. Tomic breaks.
 
Tomic looks fatigued and beaten here. His body language is awful. He gives 
this game away with some errant backhands. He lets Murray break him without so 
much as looking like he gives a flying one. 40-15. Murray wins.
 
Murray finds the baseline to go 15-0 up. A deep second serve from Murray 
forces an error from Tomic. 30-0. An ace that sends Tomic the wrong way makes 
it 40-0. Big serve Murray. Game Murray. We’re on serve here. Who’d have 
imagined that after the helter-skelter breaks in the first set.
 
Will Tomic, a man who is not known for his physicality, battle back from two 
sets down in a five-setter? Not likely. He’s given a reasonable account of 
himself but the difference in class at the key moments in the match has been 
apparent. Murray has been sure-handed when it has mattered. Tomic hasn’t. 
Murray has taken a toilet break. I should have followed suit. Ah well. I’ll 
hold on. Murray returns to court, changes his top, and off we go. Tomic begins 
with two solid first serves and a stonking forehand from left to right that 
Murray hasn’t a prayer of getting to. 30-0. Murray halts Tomic’s charge and 
brings the game back to 15-30 but Tomic connects perfectly with a forehand down 
the line that gives him game point. From a leading position his forehand lets 
him down again. Deuce. Murray seems to slip during the next rally. He feels for 
his toes as though he overstretched. Advantage Tomic. A brilliant Murray 
return. Deuce. Tomic aces and then booms another big serve down the middle that 
Murray has no answer to. Game Tomic.
 
Murray to serve for the second set. Crash! Ace down the middle. He means 
business. Murray gives Tomic the chance to win the second point with a slightly 
lazy drop-shot. Tomic is on to it but he hits it wide when he should do better. 
Big serve. 40-0. Ace. His twelfth.Second set Murray!

Tomic’s forehand lets him down at 15-15 and Murray takes a 30-15 lead. Murray 
then swings and misconnects with a Tomic second serve that wasn’t doing much 
more than saying a polite ‘hello’. Murray overhits a forehand to let Tomic off 
the hook. He challenges. Nothing doing. 40-30. And then Tomic, with a great 
chance to win the game, is found wanting on his forehand again. Deuce. Both 
players come into the net with some delicate drop-shots. You’d think Murray 
would win that particular rally wouldn’t you? He doesn’t. Murray finds the net. 
Advantage Tomic. Game Tomic.
 
Can Tomic put Murray’s serve under pressure here? Murray fails to get his 
first serve in but a second-serve with kick puts Tomic on the back foot and 
allows Murray to come into the net and force his opponent to miss. 15-0. The 
Australian shows class with a flat backhand down the line that Murray can only 
gawp at. 15-15. Tomic can do nothing with a big first-serve from Murray (30-15) 
but he battles back to 30-30. Tomic doesn’t attack a second serve from Murray 
when he has the chance to and the Brit wallops an indie-out forehand home. 
40-30. Some velvet-gloved hands from Murray after coming into the net give him 
the game. Tomic is serving to stay in the second set.
 
Tomic still appears to be puffing and panting at the beginning of this game 
too. At 15-15 his forehand lets him down and Murray’s in with a sniff of a 
break at 15-30. Tomic recovers, though, and sends a slick forehand down the 
line to come back into it at 30-30 before sending Murray to the back of the 
court with a cross-court backhand before volleying home authoritatively. He 
sees the game out comfortably in the end. He was cool under pressure there.
 
Tomic gets himself into a long rally with a decent return of serve. He does 
nothing more than hang in there but Murray goes long. 0-15. A splendid rally 
then ensues in which both players trade drop shots. Tomic gallops back and 
forth trying to keep a lid on the rally but can’t keep a desperate forehand in 
as Murray caomes out on top. Tomic is gassed after that. Murray runs away with 
it. That’s why Tomic prefers to be still during rallies I suppose.

Tomic drags Murray around the court with some powerful groundstrokes and 
pushes the Brit into the corner with a delicious backhand that kisses the net 
on the way over. Murray can only reply into the net. Murray digs in and forces 
another error out of Tomic. 15-30. Tomic tries to be cute with a forehand 
drop-shot from mid-court but mishits. 15-40. He saves one break point. And then 
aces wide to save the next. Gutsy. Deuce. Murray bosses the next point and 
disguises a backhand to send his opponent the wrong way to bring up advantage. 
Tomic battles back to deuce but hands the advantage back to Murray by failing 
to get enough purchase on a low Murray forehand and finding the net. Murray 
mishandles his racket and mishits to allow Tomic to get back to deuce. The 
Australian finds a powerful first serve when he needs it. Advantage. A good 
second serve out wide draws Murray into a an overhit backhand. A resilient hold.
 
Konta has beaten Makarova. Well done Jo. Now can Murray have a comfortable 
service game? Perhaps. He begins with an ace. 15-0. Can he follow it up? Nope. 
Tomic rifles an inside-out forehand right to the corner of the court. Muray 
glances at it. ‘Nope, not chasing that one.’ Murray challenges a backhand of 
his down the line that looked well in to me. It is. Right on the line. Murray 
moves Tomic around the court and comes into the net to take a 30-15 lead. He 
almost blasts Tomic’s racket out of his hand with a serve down the middle 
before acing to win it. That was, indeed, more comfortable.

Murray dictates the tempo like the world No2 he is in this game. He springs on 
to Tomic’s serve to bring up 0-30 and then plays a perfectly weighted backhand 
across court that Tomic can only watch like a static goalkeeper to bring up 
break point. Murray breaks Tomic for a fifth time. Can someone hold their serve 
please?
 
A game of errors. Murray dithers and allows Tomic to take a 15-0 lead. Tomic 
looks like he has a few too many shots in his head as he wafts a backhand into 
the net. Tomic is slow to the net as he hits a volley on to the net cord and 
watches it land out. He then rallies himself and jumps all over a Murray second 
serve with a ferocious backhand-winner down the line. 30-30. Tomic hangs in the 
next rally with his forehand, Murray arrives late to one and overcooks a 
forehand. Break point. The Brit then gives the game away with a forehand 
drop-shot from way too deep that doesn’t stand a chance of making it over the 
net. All square.
 
Tomic is lazy with a forehand, hitting a flat one into the net when he looked 
to be a good position and forcing Murray wide. Murray pounces on a weak second 
serve to go 30-15 up before Tomic’s forehand falters again after some 
industrious running from Murray put the Australian under pressure on the 
baseline. Murray goes long with a forehand on the first break point but dashes 
into the net to finish off some good craftsmanship with a backhand volley 
across Tomic and into the corner of the court.
 
Murray has been a bit up and down in this set. The consistency he has shown so 
far in this tournament hasn’t been evident. Tomic has played well but he’s 
hardly been wonderful. Murray gets a booming first serve in to go 15-0 up but 
Tomic strikes back with a courageous cross-court forehand that Murray attacks 
and hits long. 15-15. Murray raises his game and plays some solid groundstrokes 
behind his first serve to bring up set point. There then ensues a battle of 
sliced backhands that Murray wins thanks to Tomic crumbling in what seemed like 
a game of tennis limbo.First set for Murray!
 
Tomic bounces into his service game, going 30-0 up before Murray shows great 
dexterity with a backhand volley to leave Tomic staring at it from the back of 
the court. 30-15. The Australian makes an error to let Murray back into it at 
30-30 before firing his second ace wide to bring up game point and forcing 
Murray long with a powerful forehand to see it out. He’s making Murray work for 
this.
 
Murray has raised his first-serve percentage to 57% and that helped him to 
recover after he let Tomic back into it mid-set. 15-0. Then he misses his first 
serve and drops a weak second serve into mid-court that Tomic dispatches down 
the line with an easy backhand. Ace. 30-15. Tomic keeps his forehand firm after 
a good Murray serve at 30-15 and stys in a rally that he finishes with an 
overhead smash. A fantastic return helps him to bring up a break point. He has 
a sniff. Boom! Murray aces. Sniff gone. Deuce. But Tomic makes Murray move with 
some wonderfully placed shots in a rally in which he almost stands still for 
the duration. Murray serves-volleys aggressively as if to jump all over Tomic’s 
mojo. Back to deuce. Tomic hits a tired backhand into the net. Set point. 
Murray misses his first serve, Tomic slams a backhand return at Murray and the 
Brit finds he net. Deuce. Murray comes into the net and gives Tomic a third 
break point by hitting an errant forehand volley into the net. A brave second 
serve knocks Tomic off balance and it’s back to deuce. But Murray is erratic 
here. He tries to juice a crosscourt backhand but it’s snatched at and lands 
into the net. Tomic breaks after a fantastic return of serve. On we go.
 
Tomic tries to rally down the middle of the court on too many occasions and 
hang in a game that Murray controls with sliced backhands. His serve isn’t bad 
but Murray is too good, too pumped up for him, to handle. 0-40. Game. Muray 
will serve for the set.
 
Murray fails to get his first serve in but makes up for it by dragging Tomic 
across court and then hitting a stern backhand down the line to take control. 
15-0. 30-0. An 129mph ace down the middle brings up 40-0 but Tomic returns 
aggressively to halt Murray’s charge. 15-40. Murray finds 129mph again though 
with an ace down the middle. Much easier for Murray that. Shows you what a 
first serve can do for a game.

Murray, presumably with the inner funk on, immediately strikes back. Tomic 
helps him on his way with a dreadful backhand that is hit long when he had the 
time and space to make it land. At 15-30 the match’s most enthralling rally 
takes place. It’s a 20+ stroke marathon that weaves around the court before 
Murray wins it with a phenomenal whipped cross-court forehand that tickles the 
edge of the line when Tomic looked to be in control. Tomic applauds it. Murray 
sees the game out and breaks back.
 
The crowd aren’t particularly boisterous in support of Tomic here. They 
presumably find him hard to like due to his off-court shenanigans. Murray gives 
Tomic a sniff with two overhit forehands. He’s a little impatient to be honest. 
A rollicking ace, his second of the match, brings it back to 15-30 though. 
Murray tries to be too cute with a drop shot as Tomic steams into the net. It 
hits the lip of the net and drops back to his side of the court. Murray gets 
back to 30-40 with a booming 130mph ace. Tomic then emerges from the match’s 
longest rally as the game’s winner, with Murray slamming a weak forehand into 
the net. He’s back in this.
 
Tomic carelessly slams a forehand into the net at 15-15 to give Murray another 
opportunity to pile the pressure on. Murray fires one long to bring Tomic back 
into it at 30-30. Tomic than juices a serve wide that Murray attacks but hits 
long. The Brit then finds his groove in a rally that goes all the way around 
the court to bring up deuce. Tomic sends Murray the wrong way after getting the 
upper hand on his serve but then allows Murray back into it but the young 
Australian focuses and plays two incredibly crafted points on his second serve 
to take his first game. Well done.
 
Murray’s rather erratic as he begins his first service game. A powerful 
opening serve helps bring up 15-0 but is followed by a double fault and then an 
overcooked forehand after Tomic returned right to the line, where Murray 
couldn’t shift his feet. Murray brings up 30-30 and defends well before Tomic 
shows his weakness on his forehand down the line, pushing one wide. 40-30. 
Murray looks in control as a 10+-stroke rally ensues but then carelessly hits a 
forehand into the net. Deuce. Murray grumbles about the big screen showing the 
live match through points instead of the usual highlights. Murray brings up 
advantage thanks to a Tomic error. It’s not the best service game from Murray 
this. He struggles to get his first serve in on a number of occasions. Tomic 
pounces on a second serve to bring up deuce again but Murray fires a 
cross-court bakhand in and then aces to win the game.
 
First blood Murray. He bends the game his way with a delicious backhand drop 
shot with a great deal of spin at 15-15. Tomic looks weak as he comes into the 
net at 15-30 and gives Murray an easy volley into the centre court to make it 
15-40. Murray wafts a forehand return away to break immediately. Tomic may have 
some tactical thinking to do.
 
Tomic paces around out there waiting for Murray to make his way to the 
opposing side of the court. Tomic will serve first. Here we go …
 
Fistbumps with coach done. We’re almost ready to go …

Andy Murray and Bernard Tomic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic>
 have done their backstage stretches and are out on court at Rod Laver Arena. 
Both players have their gamefaces on as they strut out to warm up. The crowd 
appear to be a little more supportive of Tomic than Murray, but not by much. 
The Brit is very popular in Australia.
 
Greg Rusedski is giving Tomic absolutely no chance in this match. He laughs 
away Tomic’s talk of having learned from Anderson’s defeat of Murray in the US 
Open and just reckons Murray is too strong, too focused and too good to be 
troubled by the Australian. He reckons Tomic’s physicality and forehand need 
work if he’s to push into the world top 10.

While we wait for Andy Murray and Bernard Tomic to make their way to the Rod 
Laver Arena I’ll just give you a quick reminder of some of the results so far 
today. Two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka cruised to an easy 
6-2, 6-4 win against Barbora Strycova. She’ll play Angelique Kerber in the last 
eight after shewent through to the last eight for the first time with a 6-4, 
6-0 victory over fellow German Annika Beck. The zany No23 seedGael Monfils made 
it into the quarter-finalsof the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> for the first time after 
defeating the unseeded Russian Andrey Kuznetsov. He made a ridiculous dive for 
a shot at one stage perhaps forgetting he was playing on a hard court but 
managed to avoid injury. Meanwhile,David Ferrer and John Isner are on serve n 
the first set of their match on the Hisense Arena. The winner faces Murray or 
Tomic.
 
The women’s British No1, Johanna Konta, lost the first set of her fourth round 
tie against Katerina Makarova but is a break up and 3-1 up in the second set. 
She’s having a tremendous tournament and is aiming to be the first British 
female player to make it into the quarter-finals of a grand slam since Jo Durie 
at Wimbledon just the 32 years ago.You can follow it live here:

In the match that has just finished on Rod Laver Arena, the fourth seed, Stan 
Wawrinka, has just been beaten in five sets by Milos Raonic. It’s a superb 
victory for the Canadian 14th seed. He showed great resilience after the 
momentum looked to be with Wawrinka, who had won two sets on the bounce going 
into the final set. It ended 6-4, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-3.
 
Good morning/afternoon/evening. Welcome to coverage of the fourth-round match 
between the second seed, Andy Murray, and the 16th seed,Bernard Tomic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic>. The odds here are stacked 
firmly in favour of Murray, who has beaten Tomic in their last three meetings 
without ever losing a set or being made to feel even a smidgin uncomfortable. 
However, Tomic will have a considerable wind behind him in the form of a 
boisterous crowd on Rod Laver Arena, who will try to give the Australian No1 a 
bit more pep in his step as he attempts to put Murray under pressure.

Tomic, who is no stranger to criticism for a perceived lax attitude, appears 
to be taking this match very seriously indeed and has been thorough in his 
research. He says he will use Kevin Anderson’s defeat of Murray in the last 16 
of the US Open as motivation. “Andy loves playing players that attack. I don’t 
think he likes players like John Isner and Anderson,” Tomic said. “You have to 
take the ball to him, play aggressive, but not too aggressive, and rally at the 
right time.” So, perhaps he’ll try to draw Murray into attacking the game and 
look to exploit mistakes rather than push the tempo of rallies himself. A good 
tactical plan, or would it be folly to give a player of Murray’s quality the 
chance to shape the match? Given, he’s lost every set he’s ever played against 
Murray perhaps he knows better than anyone else what he needs to change. For a 
player as tall as he is, 6ft 5in, he can vary the pace of rallies quite 
skilfully. He may need to do that today if he is to prevent Murray from getting 
into the groove.

Tomic has had time to have a pop at Roger Federer too, which doesn’t seem the 
smartest thing to do. Responding to Federer’s perceived criticism of him in 
Brisbane earlier in the month when he appeared puzzled by Tomic’s lack of 
progress since emerging as a player of rich promise a few years ago, he said: 
“If he believes I’m very far away from the top 10, I also believe my prediction 
that he’s nowhere near Novak’s tennis right now.” I’m sure Federer is stinging.

As for Murray, he’ll be grateful that his father-in-law, Nigel Sears, has been 
released from hospital 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/24/nigel-sears-given-green-light-to-fly-home-after-australian-open-collapse>
 and is well enough to return home to be with Murray’s pregnant wife, Kim. he 
must have been a little shaken in the immediate aftermath of his four-set 
victory over João Sousa. He’ll need to focus again and continue to play with 
the authority that has led to his unruffled progress into the last 16 in 
Melbourne. I’m looking forward to this.
