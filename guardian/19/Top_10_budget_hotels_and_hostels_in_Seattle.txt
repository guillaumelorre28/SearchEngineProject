Hotel Deca

The Deca opened as the Edmond Meany Hotel in 1931 as part of a national 
exhibition of art deco architecture. A $2m renovation in 2007 restored it to 
its original grandeur and then some, with a plush, contemporary feel thanks to 
striking furniture (oversized, lime-green leather chairs) and paintings 
depicting the Jazz Age. Onsite restaurant the District Lounge offers a menu of 
Pacific and Mediterranean dishes, including sesame-encrusted prawns and 
homemade tapenades, in a low-lit elegant room with red banquettes, while 
Tully's Coffee in the hotel lobby prides itself on being part of the Pacific 
Northwest tradition of great coffee.

City Hostel Seattle
 City Hostel Seattle 
This cool, art-centric hostel, located in a great spot between the Space 
Needle and Pike Place Market, was voted best hostel in the US at the2012 Hoscar 
awards <>. Each room was decorated by a different local artist, so pop art and 
graffiti-style murals clash with modern takes on classic Indian painting and a 
horror-themed room, complete with ripped curtains and depictions of the living 
dead – even the radiators are painted funky colours. The art theme continues 
with the activities and events organised by the hostel – there are regular 
exhibits, poetry readings, live music events, and indie films are shown in the 
20-seat onsite movie theatre. Guests can also use the theatre and its DVD 
collection for free, as well as the library, computer room, three kitchens and 
a hot tub. Room types range from six bed dorms with shared hall baths, four-bed 
dorms with private baths en suite, family rooms with four beds, and private 
rooms with shared or en suite bathrooms.

Moore Hotel
 The Moore Hotel, Seattle 
A landmark in downtown Seattle, two blocks from Pike Place Market, the Moore 
Hotel was built in 1907 and still features the original marble, tiles and 
decorative moulding. Home to the famous Moore Theatre, the oldest operating 
theatre in Seattle, which has hosted everything from Vaudeville, classical 
concerts and musicals to legendary local artists Nirvana, Soundgarden and Pearl 
Jam, it also has a cocktail bar and diner, the NiteLite lounge. The hotel's 120 
simply decorated rooms each have a queen bed, some with en suite baths and 
others which access bathrooms down the hall. The Moore promotes itself as a 
green hotel – including one major energy-conserving feature: a complete lack of 
air conditioning. This is rarely a problem in Seattle but, if you are booking 
for July or August, it is something to be aware of.
