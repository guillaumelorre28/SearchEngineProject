“One last thing,” Wawrinka says. “There are many more important things than 
tennis matches, I want to remember what happened 15 years ago.”

The nod to 9/11 is warmly received by the New York crowd. And then Wawrinka is 
handed the trophy and lifts it high into the night.

“You were the more courageous player in the decisive moments,” a gracious 
Djokovic says during the trophy ceremony. “He’s a great champion. He deserves 
to win this title, well done.”

He adds that he wasn’t certain he would play the US Open until two weeks 
before and is happy to have made the final.

Wawrinka wins fourth set and US Open championship!

Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-7, 3-6 Wawrinka

Djokovic wins the first two points on Wawrinka’s serve and the crowd is really 
buzzing now! Wawrinka hits a forehand winner for 15-30 then wins another quick 
point for 30-all. Now a Djokovic unforced error gives Wawrinka a championship 
point but he saves it for deuce. Wawrinka hits a forehand volley winner to set 
up another championship point. And this time Djokovic sends a backhand long and 
Wawrinka takes the title!

Lots of chatter over Djokovic’s treatment. Here’s an email from Christine 
Herbert:

Djokovic losing, so its time for a medical time out. Sooooo predictable. Hope 
Stan can hold his rhythm. Shame how often Djoko gets away with this one. Watch 
him flow now.

Wawrinka holds at love against an obviously compromised Djokovic and he’s now 
four points from the title. Now Djokovic calls another medical timeout as the 
trainer is out to inspect the blister once again.

Fourth set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-7, 1-4 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka crushes a 109mph ace down the middle for 30-love. He’s won 10 of 11 
points on his serve this set. Djokovic pulls back for 30-all. And now he will 
after a break-point chance after winning a point at the net. Wawrinka saves it 
with a forehand volley winner – he’s now saved 12 of the 15 break points he’s 
faced today – but Wawrinka puts a backhand long and Djokovic will have another 
chance to break. Wawrinka saves it again, but a forehand winner down the line 
by Djokovic gives him a third chance for a break in this game. And Wawrinka 
saves it again when Djokovic makes an unforced error from the baseline. Then 
Wawinka rattles off two quick points for the marathon hold.

Djokovic has been hobbling for a few games now. Turns out it due to a blister 
on his toe. He speaks to Wawrinka from his char: “Stan, sorry man. I couldn’t 
stand it.” A bit of gamesmanship here? Surely he could have called for the 
trainer during the previous changeover and not right before Wawrinka’s serve, 
interrupting the brilliant rhythm he’d found only three games from the title.

Now the trainer is out to attend to Djokovic with Wawrinka due to serve. It’s 
not a changeover, mind. Wawrinka asking tournament referee Brian Earley to 
explain. “You can see the physio whenever you want?” he says, sarcastically. 
“Oh, it’s new!”

Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-6, 1-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

More pressure on Djokovic’s serve as he makes an unforced error to open the 
game but reponds with a 118mph ace for 15-all. Then he falls behind 15-30 on 
another unforced error, this one from the backhand side, before Wawrinka 
mishits a forehand for 30-all. And now Djokovic double-faults! Another break 
point for Wawrinka, who is six for nine on break chances today. This time 
Djokovic comes to net and ends a nine-stroke rally with an overhand smash 
winner. Deuce. The Djokovic hits a 120mph ace down the middle, but follows it 
with a double fault to return it to deuce. They trade points for a stretch

Wawrinka breaks in second game of fourth set!

Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-6, 0-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Djokovic hits a 107mph ace out wide, his fourth of the match and 
first since the opening set. But he makes an unforced error after an 18-stroke 
rally and then Wawrinka hits a backhand winner for 30-40. Another break-point 
chance for the Swiss and he wins it! Wawrinka has now converted six of nine 
break points compared to three of 14 for Djokovic.

Wawrinka breaks in 12th game and wins third set!

Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-7 Wawrinka

Djokovic follows a 122mph service winner with another point for 30-all, but he 
makes an unforced error and then Wawrinka crushes a backhand winner for 30-all. 
The Swiss is two points from the set. Big serve from Djokovic that Wawrinka 
can’t return, but Wawrinka fights back for deuce. Now Djokovic misses a 
backhand long and Wawrinka has set point! The crowd roars and the chair umpire 
quiets them. Djokovic just misses on a cracking 121mph serve out wide and 
Wawrinka will have a look at his second effort – and he wins the point by 
forcing Djokovic into a backhand error from the baseline! Wawrinka is now one 
set away from taking out the defending champion and capturing a third grand 
slam title in as many years!

Third set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 4-5 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka forced Djokovic into an error then hits a pair of winners for 40-all. 
He mixes in his third double fault of the match and then Djokovic wins another 
point for 40-30. Now Wawrinka makes a forehand error from the baseline for 
deuce, but Djokovic nets a forehand and Wawrinka has game point again. Djokovic 
saves it and they trade points until Wawrinka finally escapes with the hold 
after a 12-point game, which matches the longest of the match.

Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 3-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

A stress-free hold for Djokovic, who’s now won three straight games after 
dropping three in a row. Meanwhile on the world feed, Luke Jensen comments on 
Wawrinka’s forearm tattoo (“Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail 
again. Fail better.”). “It’s very German,” the former American pro says. Samuel 
Beckett weeps.

Djokovic breaks in fifth game of third set!

Third set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 2-3 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

A chance here for Djokovic as he fights back from 30-0 and 40-15 to force 
deuce with a couple of quick points. He nets a forehand from the baseline at 
the end of an 11-shot rally, but a pair of Wawarinka unforced errors off the 
backhand side give him a break-point chance, his fifth of the set. Wawrinka 
wipes it out with a big serve, but Djokovic earns a second opportunity for a 
break when Wawrinka blinks on a 16-stroke exchange. This time Wawrinka nets a 
forehand and Djokovic has broken! Back on level terms in the third set.

Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 1-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

The crowd swells as the players take their positions at the baselines. 
Wawrinka wins two quick points – he’s now won six straight on Djokovic’s serve 
– and the Serb is feeling the heat at love-30 already down a break. An unforced 
error by Wawrinka followed by a Djokovic overhand winner levels it at 30-all. 
Now Djokovic crushes a pair of big serves, neither of which Wawrinka can 
return, to pull out the hold from love-30 down. He’s finally on the board in

Third set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 0-3 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

A fifth straight point for Wawrinka for 15-love, but then Wawrinka 
double-faults and nets a drop shot by the slimmest of margins to fall behind 
15-30. A 121mph ace down the T – Wawrinka’s fifth of the match – levels it at 
30-all but another unforced error gives Djokovic a chance to break right back 
at 30-40. Wawrinka saves it when Djokovic nets a backhand from the baseline, 
but he follows with a forehand winner at the net and a goregeous backhand 
passing shot as Djokovic comes to net at the end of a 17-stroke rally. A hold 
for Wawrinka to move halfway to pocketing the third set.

Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 0-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic quickly moves ahead 30-love on his serve before Wawrinka pulls one 
back with that arresting one-handed backhand. Then Djokovic makes another 
backhand error for 30-all. Now Djokovic comes to net and Wawrinka passes him 
with a forehand for a break-point opportunity. And Djokovic misses on a 
backhand volley at the net! Wawrinka has the break and an early 2-love lead in 
the set!

Third set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 0-1 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

A positive start here for Djokovic as Wawrinka makes a pair of unforced errors 
from 15-all to gift-wrap a pair of break-point chances. Wawrinka saves the 
first with a big serve out wide that Djokovic can’t handle and the second with 
a backhand winner from the baseline that Djokovic challenges unsuccessfully. 
Wawrinka sets up game point with a big second serve that Djokovic can’t return 
but another unforced error returns it to deuce. Now Djokovic hits a forehand 
winner to set up a third break-point opportunity and Wawrinka saves again by 
forcing Djokovic into an error. He wins the next point for a game point then 
closes out the nervy hold with a 131mph ace out wide.

Wawrinka breaks and wins second set!

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6

Djokovic falls behind love-15 and then 15-40 after Wawrinka caps a 20-shot 
rally with a forehand winner up the line that a sprinting Djokovic can’t reach 
in time. Two set points for Wawrinka coming up. Djokovic saves the first with a 
forehand volley winner at the end of a fantastic point, but then Djokovic 
sprays a forehand wide to give Wawrinka the second set in 47 minutes! It’s a 
best-of-three match for the US Open championship!

 Stan Wawrinka is finding his best form on the biggest stage once again.

Djokovic breaks in seventh game of second set!

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, *3-4 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka falls behind love-15 but a pair of Djokovic unforced errors on the 
forehand side make it 30-15. Wawrinka misses a backhand at the end of a 
10-stroke rally for 30-all. Now Djokovic rips a backhand winner that Wawrinka 
challenges unsuccessfully for a break point – and he converts it when Wawrinka 
hits an unforced error on a forehand from the baseline! Seven of Wawrinka’s 
unforced errors in the second set have come off forehands, none off the 
backhand side.

Second set: *Djokovic 7-6, 1-4 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Oh dear! Three quick unforced errors by Wawrinka, the second on a double 
fault, give Djokovic triple break point and a chance to immediately restore the 
set to level terms. But he brushes all three aside with some big serving, 
pounds a 115mph ace out wide for game point and then caps a 19-stroke rally 
with an inside-out forehand winner for the hard-won hold from love-40 down. 
Five straight points engineered that escape and he’s consolidated the break for 
a 4-1 lead.

Djokovic wins first set!

First set tiebreaker: Djokovic 7-1 Wawrinka

The head-to-head does not favor Wawrinka, who has lost 10 of 12 tiebreaks 
against Djokovic. The world No1 serves to start and forces Wawrinka into an 
error. Then Djokovic pounces on a Wawrinka second serve to win the point for a 
mini-break. The Wawrinka outlasts Djokovic on a lengthy rally and finishes it 
with a forehand volley winner that brings the crowd to their feet! Still down 
the mini-break as Djokovic serves at 2-1. Gorgeous backhand winner by Djokovic 
for 3-1 and the capacity crowd roars in approval. This is high-quality stuff. 
Wawrinka misses on a backhand, then makes an unforced error on his serve for 
1-5. He’s down a pair of mini-breaks. Now he makes a 19th unforced error and 
Djokovic will serve at 6-1 with a handful of set points. He needs only one. 
Wawrinka makes another unforced error and Djokovic takes the first set in 58 
minutes.

Wawrinka breaks in ninth game of first set!

First set: Djokovic 5-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

A pair of errors by Djokovic and Wawrinka has his best look at a break so far 
at love-30. Another miss by Djokovic and Wawrinka has three break points here. 
He saves the first with an ace then another when Wawrinka makes another 
unforced error on the backhand, but now Djokovic double-faults and Wawrinka has 
broken back and they’re back on level terms in the opener! Djokovic lost more 
on his serve in this game (four) as he had in the entire set to this point 
(three).

First set: *Djokovic 5-3 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka with a missed backhand volley to fall behind on serve, but responds 
with a forehand volley winner for 15-all. Another unforced error on the 
forehand side for Wawrinka and Djokovic is two points from the set. Djokovic 
continues to attack the Wawrinka forehand and he blinks again for 15-40, giving 
Djokovic a pair of set points. He brushes them both aside by forcing Djokovic 
into a pair of errors for deuce. Wawrinka with a gorgeously struck one-handed 
backhand winner followed by a forehand winner for the hold. Now Djokovic will 
try to serve out the first set.

First set: *Djokovic 4-2 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka falls behind love-30 on his serve but fights back for 30-all. Another 
loose point by Djokovic gives Wawrinka game point. Wawrinka called for a foot 
fault and Djokovic pounces on the second serve with a return up the middle and 
hits a blistering forehand winner that clocks at 91mph off the ground. Another 
unforced error by Wawrinka and Djokovic will have a break-point chance, but 
Wawrinka saves it and lets out a “Come on!” to punctuate the point. Forehand 
winner by Wawrinka followed by a thudding ace and he holds serve. Elsewhere on 
the grounds the US Open boys’ final has just ended: Canada’s Felix 
Auger-Aliassime is your champion after a 6-0, 6-3 win over Serbia’s Miomir 
Kecmanovic.

First set: Djokovic 3-0 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic hits an ace and forehand smash winner before forcing Wawrinka into an 
error, then another ace for the love hold to back up the break. So much for the 
hand-wringing over Djokovic’s serve. He’s off the mark quickly here.

Djokovic breaks in second game of first set!

First set: Djokovic 2-0 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

What a rally on the first point! Wawrinka blinks for love-15, but a Djokovic 
unforced error makes it 15-all. Wawrinka crunches a 129mph ace before another 
unforced error by Djokovic sets up game point for the Swiss. But three straight 
unforced errors by Wawrinka set up the first break-point chance of the 
afternoon followed by a fourth to give Djokovic the break of serve.

First set: Djokovic 1-0 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic to serve first. Gorgeous conditions on court: 83F and 37% humidity. 
Wawrinka loses the opening point on an unforced error from the backhand side 
but pulls one back by forcing Djokovic into a miscue on the forehand side. Now 
Wawrinka wins a point for 15-30 and a hint of pressure for Djokovic in the 
opening game. Another unforced error makes it 30-all, then Wawrinka makes an 
error on a booming 122mph serve for 40-30. An unforced error by Wawrinka gives 
Djokovic the hold.

Djokovic is playing in his sixth US Open final in seven years and seventh 
overall. He’s looking to become the first back-to-back winner at Flushing 
Meadows since Roger Federer won the last of his five straight in 2007 and 2008. 
He can also capture a third grand slam title in one season for the third time 
in his career (after doing it in 2011 and 2015). Only one other player has won 
three majors in a season on three separate occasions: Federer.

It’s been quite a run for the 29-year-old Serb. He’s now made it to 19 of the 
last 25 major finals with an 11-7 record on those matches. But he entered the 
season-ending grand slam with questions surrounding his mental and physical 
fitness, and a run to the today’s final that included three wins by default did 
little to dispel them.

that includes his breakthrough victories at the 2014 Australian Open and the

Because the biggest matches, it’s the end of the tournament. Final, semifinal, 
and I had matches to get confidence to play well match after match.

Yes, I know I have some up and down during the year. I’m not playing my best 
tennis in every tournament, but I’m trying to work as hard as I can to give me 
the chance to play well every time I step on the court.


And in grand slam is where I want to play my best tennis. Is where I want to 
be the better player. Always find a way to find my game and to put everything 
together.

Hello and welcome to Arthur Ashe Stadium for today’s US Open men’s final 
betweenNovak Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> and 
Stan Wawrinka. Anyone who follows the men’s tour knows these two have made for 
one of the most reliably entertaining matchups of this generation. They’ve met 
six times previously in grand slam play with four of those matches extending 
the five-set distance, none more memorable than their five-hour quarter-final 
epic at the 2013 Australian Open, which Djokovic won 12-10 in the fifth.
 Djokovic and Wawrinka went toe to toe in Melbourne three straight years 
including this 2013 epic. 
Now they meet again in Queens with Djokovic trying for a 13th grand slam title 
and Wawrinka going for his third major title in many years.

Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s how the women’s final 
unfolded on Saturday.

Angelique Kerber was on the ropes in the third and deciding set of Saturday’s 
US Open final, having fallen behind a break against the big-serving Czech 
Karolina Pliskova.

But the second-seeded German fought back, showing the finishing kick of a 
champion in winning 24 of the last 34 points, and breaking Pliskova twice to 
seal a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 victory for her first US Open championship and second 
grand slam title of the year.

After Pliskova pounded a forehand long on championship point, Kerber collapsed 
in a heap on the baseline. Then she climbed into the players’ box to embrace 
her coach Torben Beltz as the roars cascaded down from the promenade at the 
world’s largest tennis stadium.

The 28-year-old German, who was already due to supplant Serena Williams as the 
world No1 when ’s rankings are released, backed up that mantle by outlasting 
Pliskova over 2hr 7min at Arthur Ashe Stadium. She will become the oldest 
player to make her debut atop the rankings, besting a mark previously held by 
Jennifer Capriati by three years.

That’s all for now. Thanks as always for following along with us. What a

Stan Wawrinka upsets Novak Djokovic in final to take first US Open title
 Read more  
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/stan-wawrinka-novak-djokovic-us-open-final-2016> 
“One last thing,” Wawrinka says. “There are many more important things than 
tennis matches, I want to remember what happened 15 years ago.”

The nod to 9/11 is warmly received by the New York crowd. And then Wawrinka is 
handed the trophy and lifts it high into the night.
 
“I don’t know what’s happening right now,” says Wawrinka to open his victory 
remarks.He then speaks directly to Djokovic: “You’re a great person. A great 
champion. Because of you I am where am today.”

“I think I played a lot of tennis this week,” he says. “I’m completely empty.” 
 
“You were the more courageous player in the decisive moments,” a gracious 
Djokovic says during the trophy ceremony. “He’s a great champion. He deserves 
to win this title, well done.”

He adds that he wasn’t certain he would play the US Open until two weeks 
before and is happy to have made the final.
 
Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-7, 3-6 Wawrinka

Djokovic wins the first two points on Wawrinka’s serve and the crowd is really 
buzzing now! Wawrinka hits a forehand winner for 15-30 then wins another quick 
point for 30-all. Now a Djokovic unforced error gives Wawrinka a championship 
point but he saves it for deuce. Wawrinka hits a forehand volley winner to set 
up another championship point. And this time Djokovic sends a backhand long and 
Wawrinka takes the title!

 
Fourth set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-7, 3-5 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Djokovic wins the first point on a forehand winner but then double-faults for 
15-all. Then he rattles off three quick points for the hold and Wawrinka will 
serve for the championship.
 
Lots of chatter over Djokovic’s treatment. Here’s an email from Christine 
Herbert:

Djokovic losing, so its time for a medical time out. Sooooo predictable. Hope 
Stan can hold his rhythm. Shame how often Djoko gets away with this one. Watch 
him flow now.

Fourth set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-7, 2-5 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka holds at love against an obviously compromised Djokovic and he’s now 
four points from the title. Now Djokovic calls another medical timeout as the 
trainer is out to inspect the blister once again.
 
Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-7, 2-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

A lightning-quick Djokovic service game as he holds at love. Here’s Kevin 
Mitchell’s look at Djokovic trainer usage, which will no doubt loom as a major 
topic of conversation in the aftermath of today’s final.

Novak Djokovic pushes use of trainer to limit before US Open final

Fourth set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-7, 1-4 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka crushes a 109mph ace down the middle for 30-love. He’s won 10 of 11 
points on his serve this set. Djokovic pulls back for 30-all. And now he will 
after a break-point chance after winning a point at the net. Wawrinka saves it 
with a forehand volley winner – he’s now saved 12 of the 15 break points he’s 
faced today – but Wawrinka puts a backhand long and Djokovic will have another 
chance to break. Wawrinka saves it again, but a forehand winner down the line 
by Djokovic gives him a third chance for a break in this game. And Wawrinka 
saves it again when Djokovic makes an unforced error from the baseline. Then 
Wawinka rattles off two quick points for the marathon hold.
 
Djokovic has been hobbling for a few games now. Turns out it due to a blister 
on his toe. He speaks to Wawrinka from his char: “Stan, sorry man. I couldn’t 
stand it.” A bit of gamesmanship here? Surely he could have called for the 
trainer during the previous changeover and not right before Wawrinka’s serve, 
interrupting the brilliant rhythm he’d found only three games from the title.
 
Now the trainer is out to attend to Djokovic with Wawrinka due to serve. It’s 
not a changeover, mind. Wawrinka asking tournament referee Brian Earley to 
explain. “You can see the physio whenever you want?” he says, sarcastically. 
“Oh, it’s new!”
 
Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-6, 1-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

More pressure on Djokovic’s serve as he makes an unforced error to open the 
game but reponds with a 118mph ace for 15-all. Then he falls behind 15-30 on 
another unforced error, this one from the backhand side, before Wawrinka 
mishits a forehand for 30-all. And now Djokovic double-faults! Another break 
point for Wawrinka, who is six for nine on break chances today. This time 
Djokovic comes to net and ends a nine-stroke rally with an overhand smash 
winner. Deuce. The Djokovic hits a 120mph ace down the middle, but follows it 
with a double fault to return it to deuce. They trade points for a stretch 
before Djokovic finally forces Wawrinka into a backhand error for the hold.
 
Fourth set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-6, 0-3 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka forces Djokovic into an error and then crunches back-to-back aces out 
wide of 92mph and 105mph. From there a forehand winner gives Wawrinka the 
emphatic love hold to back up the break.
 
Fourth set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-6, 0-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Djokovic hits a 107mph ace out wide, his fourth of the match and 
first since the opening set. But he makes an unforced error after an 18-stroke 
rally and then Wawrinka hits a backhand winner for 30-40. Another break-point 
chance for the Swiss and he wins it! Wawrinka has now converted six of nine 
break points compared to three of 14 for Djokovic.

 
Fourth set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-7, 0-1 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka forces Djokovic into a forehand error, then follows with his 12th and 
13th backhand winners of the match for 40-love. Djokovic pulls one back but 
then sends a forehand long and Wawrinka has the comfortable hold.

Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-7 Wawrinka

Djokovic follows a 122mph service winner with another point for 30-all, but he 
makes an unforced error and then Wawrinka crushes a backhand winner for 30-all. 
The Swiss is two points from the set. Big serve from Djokovic that Wawrinka 
can’t return, but Wawrinka fights back for deuce. Now Djokovic misses a 
backhand long and Wawrinka has set point! The crowd roars and the chair umpire 
quiets them. Djokovic just misses on a cracking 121mph serve out wide and 
Wawrinka will have a look at his second effort – and he wins the point by 
forcing Djokovic into a backhand error from the baseline! Wawrinka is now one 
set away from taking out the defending champion and capturing a third grand 
slam title in as many years!
 
Third set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 5-6 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka holds from love-15 and 15-30 down winning three straight points. 
Djokovic now to serve to stay in the third set.

Wawrinka forced Djokovic into an error then hits a pair of winners for 40-all. 
He mixes in his third double fault of the match and then Djokovic wins another 
point for 40-30. Now Wawrinka makes a forehand error from the baseline for 
deuce, but Djokovic nets a forehand and Wawrinka has game point again. Djokovic 
saves it and they trade points until Wawrinka finally escapes with the hold 
after a 12-point game, which matches the longest of the match.
 
Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 4-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

Two quick points for Djokovic followed by a third on a drop-shot winner to cap 
an 11-stroke rally for 40-love. Wawrinka pulls one back on a forehand winner, 
but Djokovic takes the next point and the hold. Wawrinka to serve at 4-all.
 
Third set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 3-4 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

From 30-all, Wawrinka crushes a 110mph ace out wide. He then forces Djokovic 
to mishit a backhand from the baseline to seal the hold.
 
Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 3-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

A stress-free hold for Djokovic, who’s now won three straight games after 
dropping three in a row. Meanwhile on the world feed, Luke Jensen comments on 
Wawrinka’s forearm tattoo (“Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail 
again. Fail better.”). “It’s very German,” the former American pro says. Samuel 
Beckett weeps.

Third set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 2-3 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

A chance here for Djokovic as he fights back from 30-0 and 40-15 to force 
deuce with a couple of quick points. He nets a forehand from the baseline at 
the end of an 11-shot rally, but a pair of Wawarinka unforced errors off the 
backhand side give him a break-point chance, his fifth of the set. Wawrinka 
wipes it out with a big serve, but Djokovic earns a second opportunity for a 
break when Wawrinka blinks on a 16-stroke exchange. This time Wawrinka nets a 
forehand and Djokovic has broken! Back on level terms in the third set.
 
Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 1-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

The crowd swells as the players take their positions at the baselines. 
Wawrinka wins two quick points – he’s now won six straight on Djokovic’s serve 
– and the Serb is feeling the heat at love-30 already down a break. An unforced 
error by Wawrinka followed by a Djokovic overhand winner levels it at 30-all. 
Now Djokovic crushes a pair of big serves, neither of which Wawrinka can 
return, to pull out the hold from love-30 down. He’s finally on the board in 
this third set after 28 minutes.
 
Third set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 0-3 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

A fifth straight point for Wawrinka for 15-love, but then Wawrinka 
double-faults and nets a drop shot by the slimmest of margins to fall behind 
15-30. A 121mph ace down the T – Wawrinka’s fifth of the match – levels it at 
30-all but another unforced error gives Djokovic a chance to break right back 
at 30-40. Wawrinka saves it when Djokovic nets a backhand from the baseline, 
but he follows with a forehand winner at the net and a goregeous backhand 
passing shot as Djokovic comes to net at the end of a 17-stroke rally. A hold 
for Wawrinka to move halfway to pocketing the third set.
 
Third set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 0-2 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic quickly moves ahead 30-love on his serve before Wawrinka pulls one 
back with that arresting one-handed backhand. Then Djokovic makes another 
backhand error for 30-all. Now Djokovic comes to net and Wawrinka passes him 
with a forehand for a break-point opportunity. And Djokovic misses on a 
backhand volley at the net! Wawrinka has the break and an early 2-love lead in 
the set!
 
Third set: *Djokovic 7-6, 4-6, 0-1 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

A positive start here for Djokovic as Wawrinka makes a pair of unforced errors 
from 15-all to gift-wrap a pair of break-point chances. Wawrinka saves the 
first with a big serve out wide that Djokovic can’t handle and the second with 
a backhand winner from the baseline that Djokovic challenges unsuccessfully. 
Wawrinka sets up game point with a big second serve that Djokovic can’t return 
but another unforced error returns it to deuce. Now Djokovic hits a forehand 
winner to set up a third break-point opportunity and Wawrinka saves again by 
forcing Djokovic into an error. He wins the next point for a game point then 
closes out the nervy hold with a 131mph ace out wide.
 
Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-6

Djokovic falls behind love-15 and then 15-40 after Wawrinka caps a 20-shot 
rally with a forehand winner up the line that a sprinting Djokovic can’t reach 
in time. Two set points for Wawrinka coming up. Djokovic saves the first with a 
forehand volley winner at the end of a fantastic point, but then Djokovic 
sprays a forehand wide to give Wawrinka the second set in 47 minutes! It’s a 
best-of-three match for the US Open championship!

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, *4-5 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka settles a 13-shot exchange with a cross-court forehand winner, then 
passes Djokovic with a backhand for 30-love. Wawrinka then hits a pair of 
serves that Djokovic can’t handle to answer the Serb’s love hold with one of 
his own. Djokovic will serve to stay in the second set after the players change 
ends.
 
Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

Comfortable hold at love for Djokovic, who consolidates the break for 4-all.
 
Second set: Djokovic 7-6, *3-4 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka falls behind love-15 but a pair of Djokovic unforced errors on the 
forehand side make it 30-15. Wawrinka misses a backhand at the end of a 
10-stroke rally for 30-all. Now Djokovic rips a backhand winner that Wawrinka 
challenges unsuccessfully for a break point – and he converts it when Wawrinka 
hits an unforced error on a forehand from the baseline! Seven of Wawrinka’s 
unforced errors in the second set have come off forehands, none off the 
backhand side.
 
Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 2-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic not having much luck getting first serves in but he’s grinding away 
on the second, winning the first three points for 40-love all on second serves. 
He then completes the love hold to stay within touching distance of Wawrinka. 
Djokovic has made only six of 18 first serves in the second set (33%) compared 
to 18 of 33 in the first (55%).
 
Second set: *Djokovic 7-6, 1-4 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Oh dear! Three quick unforced errors by Wawrinka, the second on a double 
fault, give Djokovic triple break point and a chance to immediately restore the 
set to level terms. But he brushes all three aside with some big serving, 
pounds a 115mph ace out wide for game point and then caps a 19-stroke rally 
with an inside-out forehand winner for the hard-won hold from love-40 down. 
Five straight points engineered that escape and he’s consolidated the break for 
a 4-1 lead.

 
Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-3 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

Djokovic races out to 40-15 but an unforced error followed by a double fault

break-point chance followed by a picturesque one-handed backhand down the line 
for the break!
 
Second set: *Djokovic 7-6, 1-2 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Wawrinka races out to leads of 30-love then 40-15. Djokovic pulls one back but

in 2009.
 
Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-1 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

two quick points for the hold.
 
Second set: *Djokovic 7-6, 0-1 Wawrinka (*denotes next server)

Djokovic is a lifetime 51-0 in US Open matches when he takes the first set.

laces a backhand winner then outlasts Djokovic in a lengthy rally for the early 
hold.
 
First set tiebreaker: Djokovic 7-1 Wawrinka

The head-to-head does not favor Wawrinka, who has lost 10 of 12 tiebreaks 
against Djokovic. The world No1 serves to start and forces Wawrinka into an 
error. Then Djokovic pounces on a Wawrinka second serve to win the point for a 
mini-break. The Wawrinka outlasts Djokovic on a lengthy rally and finishes it 
with a forehand volley winner that brings the crowd to their feet! Still down 
the mini-break as Djokovic serves at 2-1. Gorgeous backhand winner by Djokovic 
for 3-1 and the capacity crowd roars in approval. This is high-quality stuff. 
Wawrinka misses on a backhand, then makes an unforced error on his serve for 
1-5. He’s down a pair of mini-breaks. Now he makes a 19th unforced error and 
Djokovic will serve at 6-1 with a handful of set points. He needs only one. 
Wawrinka makes another unforced error and Djokovic takes the first set in 58 
minutes.

First set: Djokovic 5-4 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

A pair of errors by Djokovic and Wawrinka has his best look at a break so far 
at love-30. Another miss by Djokovic and Wawrinka has three break points here. 
He saves the first with an ace then another when Wawrinka makes another 
unforced error on the backhand, but now Djokovic double-faults and Wawrinka has 
broken back and they’re back on level terms in the opener! Djokovic lost more 
on his serve in this game (four) as he had in the entire set to this point 
(three).

with a forehand volley winner for 15-all. Another unforced error on the 
forehand side for Wawrinka and Djokovic is two points from the set. Djokovic 
continues to attack the Wawrinka forehand and he blinks again for 15-40, giving 
Djokovic a pair of set points. He brushes them both aside by forcing Djokovic 
into a pair of errors for deuce. Wawrinka with a gorgeously struck one-handed 
backhand winner followed by a forehand winner for the hold. Now Djokovic will 
try to serve out the first set.

loose point by Djokovic gives Wawrinka game point. Wawrinka called for a foot 
fault and Djokovic pounces on the second serve with a return up the middle and 
hits a blistering forehand winner that clocks at 91mph off the ground. Another 
unforced error by Wawrinka and Djokovic will have a break-point chance, but 
Wawrinka saves it and lets out a “Come on!” to punctuate the point. Forehand 
winner by Wawrinka followed by a thudding ace and he holds serve. Elsewhere on 
the grounds the US Open boys’ final has just ended: Canada’s Felix

First set: Djokovic 2-0 Wawrinka* (*denotes next server)

What a rally on the first point! Wawrinka blinks for love-15, but a Djokovic 
unforced error makes it 15-all. Wawrinka crunches a 129mph ace before another

unforced errors by Wawrinka set up the first break-point chance of the 
afternoon followed by a fourth to give Djokovic the break of serve.

but pulls one back by forcing Djokovic into a miscue on the forehand side. Now 
Wawrinka wins a point for 15-30 and a hint of pressure for Djokovic in the 
opening game. Another unforced error makes it 30-all, then Wawrinka makes an 
error on a booming 122mph serve for 40-30. An unforced error by Wawrinka gives

on their paths to today’s final. Djokovic spent eight hours, 58 minutes in

sets.

Wawrinka saved match point in a third-round win over Britain’s Dan Evans. He 
is looking to become the first US Open to have saved a match point sinceNovak 
Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic>, who won the 2011 
title after saving a pair of match points against Roger Federer in a gripping 
five-set semi-final.
 
Djokovic is playing in his sixth US Open final in seven years and seventh 
overall. He’s looking to become the first back-to-back winner at Flushing 
Meadows since Roger Federer won the last of his five straight in 2007 and 2008. 
He can also capture a third grand slam title in one season for the third time 
in his career (after doing it in 2011 and 2015). Only one other player has won 
three majors in a season on three separate occasions: Federer.

It’s been quite a run for the 29-year-old Serb. He’s now made it to 19 of the 
last 25 major finals with an 11-7 record on those matches. But he entered the 
season-ending grand slam with questions surrounding his mental and physical 
fitness, and a run to the today’s final that included three wins by default did 
little to dispel them.
 
Wawrinka is looking extend a 10-match winning streak in finals that’s 
established him as one of the finest big-match players of this era.It’s a run 
that includes his breakthrough victories at the 2014 Australian Open and the 
French Open last year, where he stopped Djokovic’s bid for a career grand slam 
dead in its tracks.

Wawrinka expounded his knack for playing his best on the sport’s biggest 
stages afterFriday’s semi-final win over Kei Nishikori 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/stan-wawrinka-to-face-djokovic-in-us-open-final-after-win-over-kei-nishikori>
:

Because the biggest matches, it’s the end of the tournament. Final, semifinal, 
and I had matches to get confidence to play well match after match.

Yes, I know I have some up and down during the year. I’m not playing my best 
tennis in every tournament, but I’m trying to work as hard as I can to give me 
the chance to play well every time I step on the court.


And in grand slam is where I want to play my best tennis. Is where I want to 
be the better player. Always find a way to find my game and to put everything 
together.

 
Hello and welcome to Arthur Ashe Stadium for today’s US Open men’s final 
betweenNovak Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> and 
Stan Wawrinka. Anyone who follows the men’s tour knows these two have made for 
one of the most reliably entertaining matchups of this generation. They’ve met 
six times previously in grand slam play with four of those matches extending 
the five-set distance, none more memorable than their five-hour quarter-final 
epic at the 2013 Australian Open, which Djokovic won 12-10 in the fifth.
 Djokovic and Wawrinka went toe to toe in Melbourne three straight years 
including this 2013 epic. 
Now they meet again in Queens with Djokovic trying for a 13th grand slam title 
and Wawrinka going for his third major title in many years.
 
Bryan will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s how the women’s final 
unfolded on Saturday.

Angelique Kerber was on the ropes in the third and deciding set of Saturday’s 
US Open final, having fallen behind a break against the big-serving Czech 
Karolina Pliskova.

But the second-seeded German fought back, showing the finishing kick of a 
champion in winning 24 of the last 34 points, and breaking Pliskova twice to 
seal a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 victory for her first US Open championship and second 
grand slam title of the year.

After Pliskova pounded a forehand long on championship point, Kerber collapsed 
in a heap on the baseline. Then she climbed into the players’ box to embrace 
her coach Torben Beltz as the roars cascaded down from the promenade at the 
world’s largest tennis stadium.

The 28-year-old German, who was already due to supplant Serena Williams as the 
world No1 when ’s rankings are released, backed up that mantle by outlasting 
Pliskova over 2hr 7min at Arthur Ashe Stadium. She will become the oldest 
player to make her debut atop the rankings, besting a mark previously held by 
Jennifer Capriati by three years.
