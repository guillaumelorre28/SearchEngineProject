Lantern’s Keep, Midtown West

Opened in the early 1900s, both the Algonquin and the Iroquois hotels exude 
the glamour of times past. Inside, the Algonquin has its famed Round Table 
restaurant, where Dorothy Parker gathered with editors of Vanity Fair and The 
New Yorker. But the Iroquois has a hidden little jewel box of a cocktail bar 
called Lantern’s Keep. There’s no sign for it, but in-the-know imbibers are 
aware that if the lantern affixed to the Iroquois’s facade is lit, they can go 
inside and have a drink. Lantern’s Keep opened in 2011, but you wouldn’t know 
it from the decor, which looks more like a Parisian beaux-arts salon than a New 
York bar. Chic black panelling contrasts with marble tables and Louis XIV 
chairs upholstered in powder blue velvet. Head bartender John Ploeser and his 
team designed the list of 40 cocktails, from the refreshing Regal Business 
(gin, grapefruit, honey, lime) to the boozy Double Barrel (rye, dry vermouth, 
sweet vermouth, angostura and orange bitters). Ploeser has a polite, midwestern 
air that makes him instantly likeable and easy to talk to and he loves the 
social aspect of bartending.

Alphabet City was the first location for Blind Barber, which opened in 2010 
and has since expanded to Williamsburg and Los Angeles. The entrance is a 
working two-seat barbershop. Designed to feel like a retro dentist office, even 
the barber’s tools are on rolling dental trays. The back room bar is hidden 
behind a rolling door, which opens up to a large lounge. And the name? It’s a 
reference to the titles given to speakeasies during prohibition such as Blind 
Tiger and Blind Pig, a message to policemen to turn a blind eye to the 
activities going on behind the scenes. The cocktail menu has a core selection 
of classics, including Strawberry Fields with vodka, lemon juice, honey, 
strawberries and parsley, and the Smoke + Dagger of whiskey, jalapeno-infused 
Combier, lemon juice, cucumber, and ginger. The seasonal cocktails change in 
fall and spring, and pizza is provided until 10pm byGnocco <http://gnocco.com/> 
next door.

Back to the barbershop: the small room takes advantage of the original exposed 
brick of the building and the decor features distressed metal boards, vintage 
Koker barbershop chairs, and wooden auditorium seats. The underlying concept is 
a nod to the barbershops of yore where a community would come together. To that 
end, Blind Barber offers a drink with your shave – anything from spirits to 
beer. Just no cocktails until the bar opens at 6pm.

During the day, the outside of Nublu looks like a shuttered storefront, with 
metal grates perpetually down except for where the slats have broken off. 
Sometime between 2013 and 2014, street art appeared which added a splash of 
colour. At night, the only sign of something happening is the little blue light 
marking the entrance. Inside, however, activity is truly buzzing, as Nublu has 
become a stronghold for musical improvisation across genres. Nublu had humble 
beginnings in 2002 as a simple clubhouse where friends of owner Ilhan Ersahin 
would come and play music. Ersahin, himself a musician, describes its early 
days as more of a rehearsal space. He acquired the wine and beer licence just 
so they could drink during and between jams, as the space was always open to 
the public. It’s a haven for musicians getting their careers started, as well 
as for famous ones such as Moby, Norah Jones and David Byrne, who come to 
perform secret shows or take in the latest sounds. At the bar, expect a wide 
range of sake, along with beers and wine.

The unmarked bar behind the burnt-wood facade of 597 Manhattan Avenue in 
Greenpoint not only lacks a name, it doesn’t even have a phone. “It might sound 
like a cliche, but I wanted to bring back a sense of discovery,” says owner 
Jessica Lee Wertz. The only entrance marker is the antique bronze door knocker 
shaped like a Chinese dragon. Push the door open and you’ll be in a long, 
narrow bar that feels like the Orient Express. Opposite the bar, a series of 
narrow benches with tiny tables are reminiscent of train cars. The space is 
outfitted in reclaimed wood with design elements inspired by China, Japan, and 
Morocco. When Wertz first opened the bar in 2010, she recognised everyone who 
came to drink there. Now, there are always new faces. It’s the kind of place 
where you can order an old fashioned and your friend can have a Budweiser, and 
there’s no judgment either way. Many chefs and servers from the surrounding 
restaurants come in for a nightcap, since No Name is one of the few bars around 
that stays open until 4am every night.

William Barnacle Tavern at 80 St Marks, East Village

Though the William Barnacle Tavern itself is no longer hidden, the bar is one 
of the few authentic speakeasies left over from prohibition, and the building 
itself still holds a rich history of secrets – including intact mafia escape 
tunnels and safes. The entrance to the bar was originally through a butcher 
shop next door, concealed from the street. Behind the bar was a dance hall, 
which later became a jazz club and is now the theatre. The William Barnacle 
Tavern specialises in absinthe — 28 variations of it — and single malt 
whiskies. The bar owner, Lorcan Otway, used to be a shipbuilder, so the 
maritime theme of the bar is a nod to his past, creating a dive-y, non 
self-conscious pub. Unlike many of the trendier prohibition-style bars in New 
York City, the tavern is not only authentic, but every item in the bar also has 
a fascinating history connected to Lorcan and his family. Lorcan himself is 
often behind the bar, too, making 1920s-inspired cocktails or serving absinthe.

The name of this place (“the corner”) would have you think it’s just your 
average tiny taqueria. From the outside, it looks casual, like an old Mexican 
diner, with corrugated tin siding and a neon sign. You could come here and just 
get tacos to go – but then you may get curious about where the people 
disappearing through the door inside the narrow taqueria are going. If you have 
a reservation or are lucky enough to get in without one, the host will open the 
door and you’ll walk downstairs, through the kitchen and into the main 
brasserie. Upstairs, everything is bright, but here it’s dimly lit. Past a row 
of iron bars, the dining room feels a bit like a dungeon, but with better food. 
Candles positioned around the room are dripping in wax. A soundtrack of pop 
music sets a party mood. La Esquina is known for its margaritas and they’re the 
perfect complement to the Mexican street food. There’s the classicelotes 
callejeros (grilled corn on the cob smothered in mayonnaise, cotija cheese, and 
lime juice),ceviche, and queso fundido (melted cheese with pumpkin seeds and 
chile de arbol) that arrives in a cast-iron pan with plantain chips for 
dipping. And there are tacos (around $5 a taco) in all varieties: grilled 
steak, chicken, fish of the day, cheese, veal tongue, carnitas, and 
slow-roasted pulled pork.

Open for almost 20 years, Sakagura is found in the basement of a nondescript 
Midtown office building. Cross the threshold of the restaurant, however, and 
you’ll feel as if you’ve entered a Japanese village. The decor is such that 
diners have the impression they’re sitting outside, with interior facades that 
look like houses, replete with windows, shutters and dormer roofs. Though the 
architecture isn’t an exercise of purist Japanese form, the raised level of the 
sake bar area, a mini Shinto shrine, and rice paper dividers give it a homey 
feel. It’s one of the finest places for Japanese food in the city – and at 
affordable prices. As an appetiser, try the Washu beef self-cooked on hot 
stones, a sea urchin soup with soft boiled egg and salmon roe, theonsen tamago 
(a slow-cooked poached egg in cold soup), thebuta no kakuni (a special stewed 
diced-pork dish), or thechawanmushi egg custard topped with ponzu soup. For 
mains, there is miso stewed beef tongue with shitake mushrooms, spinach, taro 
potato and daikon radish.

Outside, only a neon green G marks the entrance to this spot on the 
northernmost tip of Brooklyn. The building goes back much further than the 
entrance would have you believe, too. When it was a glass factory, from the 
1870s to the 1930s, the workers would cart their wares through the courtyard to 
the back exit, which opens onto Newtown Creek. Now, the factory’s enormous kiln 
door hangs in the courtyard and an original ceramic basin holds plants. As 
owner-developer Sarah Conklin prepared to open she spent months researching the 
building and found antique etchings of the factory’s fixtures – now hanging by 
the entrance — through theCorning Museum of Glass <http://www.cmog.org/> 
upstate. Also, poised around the room are copper pots from Lebanon and Saudi 
Arabia – handed down by Conklin’s mother. To say that it serves purely Lebanese 
or Middle Eastern food would be to oversimplify. The emphasis is on seasonal 
ingredients and honouring the integrity of the flavours. Syrian cheese brushed 
with Za’atar might be served with heirloom tomatoes in the summer and pickled 
beets in the winter. The wine list emphasises obscure wines from the 
Mediterranean, Slovenia, and Croatia.

Mexico 2000 is a hole-in-the-wall bodega in south Williamsburg under the 
elevated J-M-Z train tracks that gave Jay-Z his name – and got its own name 
because it opened in 2000. It made its mark on the NYC culinary map in 2012 
when Alex Stupak of Empellón made a dish inspired by thechilaquiles from the 
bodega. But fans of Mexico 2000 had been going there for years, picking up 
basics such as plantain chips, sweet breads, lotto tickets, toilet paper, and 
canned foods from rickety shelves, while grabbing cheap, authentic Mexican 
food. Besides the famouschilaquiles, there are tacos, burritos, chimichangas, 
tortas, huaraches, sopes, enchiladas, tostadas, and more, along with soups and 
stews. There are actually two locations of Mexico 2000 on the same block now. 
The success of the tiny bodega led to an expansion two doors down into a formal 
restaurant, but the taqueria in the tiny bodega remains active despite the 
growth.

India. The Ganesh Temple, as it’s colloquially known, opened in 1970 (with the 
current building dating from 1977). Its official name is the Hindu Temple 
Society of North America, because when founded in 1970 it was the first and 
only traditional Hindu temple in the country. Downstairs is a canteen serving
dosas, masalas, and mango lassi so good it warranted a visit from Anthony 
Bourdain. There are 17 variations ofdosas, and an additional four varieties 
available only on weekends. The all-vegetarian canteen is open seven days a 
week from morning until night with Ganesha in gold overseeing the basement 
dining space. Afterwards, grab desserts at the sweet shop in the Swaminarayan 
Hindu temple just down the street.
