If the Big Bad Wolf or the Wicked Queen aren’t frightening enough for your 
bedtime reading, then a nightmarish picture book from the imagination ofStephen 
King <https://www.theguardian.com/books/stephenking> might be the answer.

Charlie the Choo-Choo, by one Beryl Evans, makes its first (fictional) 
appearance in King’sDark Tower fantasy series 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/dec/13/stephen-king-the-gunslinger>
, when it is spotted in a display of children’s books by the story’s child 
hero, Jake. “On the bright green cover was an anthropomorphic locomotive 
puffing its way up a hill ... its headlight was a cheerful eye which seemed to 
invite Jake Chambers to come inside and read all about it,” writes King.

 “As he looked down at the cover, Jake found that he did not trust the smile 
on Charlie the Choo-Choo’s face. You look happy, but I think that’s just the 
mask you wear, he thought. I don’t think you’re happy at all. And I don’t think 
Charlie’s your real name, either.”

Now, King has written a real-life version of Charlie the Choo-Choo: out on 22 
November from Simon & Schuster, under the pseudonym Beryl Evans, and 
illustrated by Ned Dameron.

“Engineer Bob has a secret: his train engine, Charlie the Choo-Choo, is alive! 
Jump on board and join the railroad journey in this compelling picture book 
about friendship and loyalty,” promises the publisher, before unveiling a 
series of creepy pages from the picture book depicting the kind of train that 
would give Thomas the Tank Engine nightmares.

The picture book also carries a quote from King on the front – “If I were ever 
to write a children’s book, it would be just like this!” – possibly to warn off 
parents browsing for the latest story from the realms of Sodor, rather than a 
dark fantasy from the master of horror.

It isn’t the first time King has explored the methods of children’s 
publishing. He brought out a pop-up version of his storyThe Girl Who Loved Tom 
Gordon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/mar/07/the-girl-who-loved-tom-gordon-stephen-king-review>
 in 2004.

The film adaptation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/01/actors-stephen-king-the-dark-tower-film-project>
 of the first novel in the fantasy western Dark Tower series, The Gunslinger, 
starring Idris Elba as titular hero Roland Deschain and Matthew McConaughey as 
the Man in Black, is out in February.
