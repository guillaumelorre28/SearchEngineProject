Arsène Wenger believes Arsenal can approach the knockout phase of the 
Champions League <https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> free of 
guilt after seeing his side capitalise ruthlessly on Paris Saint-Germain’s slip 
to claim Group A with an emphatic victory on the banks of the Rhine.

 since he moved to the Premier League side in the summer, as Wenger’s decision 
to field a strong lineup paid off handsomely.

The fine victory, combined with PSG’s wasteful draw at home to Ludogorets

 at the Parc des Princes, ensured Arsenal topped their group for only the 
second time in seven seasons and means they will definitely avoid Barcelona, 
Napoli, Atlético Madrid and Monaco in the last 16.

There remains the possibility of a collision with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid 
or Borussia Dortmund, but Wenger took heart from ending as section winners. “We 
can still have a difficult draw, so it will still be difficult, but you go 
forward with less guilt when you finish first,” said theArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> manager.

“You feel you’ve done the job and you know you will play the second leg [in 
the last 16] at home. So we have achieved that. But the draw is not much 
different [in terms of the potential opponent], certainly at the moment. Let’s 
see what happens in the draw.”

His team excelled here, with some of their approach play untouchable. There 
were 33 passes in the buildup to Pérez’s second goal, the most mustered for 
reward in the competition to date this season, with the decision to begin with 
Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez clearly justified. “I feel we had a good start, 
we were quite mobile and technically very agile as well, and quick,” said 
Wenger, who will discover who awaits in the last 16 in Monday’s draw in Nyon. 
“Overall the speed of our start surprisedBasel

“Since the start of the season our squad system has worked well, but this was 
still a convincing performance tonight. I’ve had bad nights in football and 
tonight was a good night. Overall we came here wanting to do the job, wanting 
to play well. On top of that we were lucky with the result in Paris 
Saint-Germain, so it was a positive night.

“I thought Ludogorets were a good side when we played them, and they made a 
great result that helps us top the group, which was what we wanted. But, 
overall, we did our own job in a convincing way, we were mobile and overall had 
a committed performance.”

The Frenchman paid special tribute to Pérez, whose only previous goals since 
his £17.1m summer move from Deportivo la Coruna had come in aLeague Cup tie at 
Nottingham Forest 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/nottingham-forest-arsenal-efl-cup-third-round-match-report>
. The Spaniard, now free of niggling injury, duly scored the club’s sixth 
Champions League hat-trick – and second this season, after Özil’s against 
Ludogorets – to help capitalise on Arsenal’s overall dominance.

“The first two looked easy goals and were created by the team to make, what 
you call in England, ‘tap ins’,” added Wenger. “But he’s there to score them. 
You have to be there. The third was a real striker’s goal. He scored over 20 
goals in Spain last year, and showed tonight why. He has a good eye and makes 
good movement in the box, and that’s why he scores. He is a goalscorer, you 
know, he has shown tonight he has a good smell for the goal.”
