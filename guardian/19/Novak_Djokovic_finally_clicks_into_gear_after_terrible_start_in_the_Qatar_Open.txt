.

The early signs were far from positive for the defending champion

, who looked very rusty as world No63 won the opening four games. The German 
twice served for the first set but from 1-5, Djokovic won five games in a row 
and from then on was in control as he recorded a 7-6, 6-3 victory.

The Serb, who next faces Horacio Zeballos, said on atpworldtour.com: “It’s 
[the] first match of the year. You never know how you’re going to start.

“As well as you have trained in the preparation period and the days prior to 
the tournament, [it] really is different when it’s competitive play, when you 
start the official match and the crowd is there.

“It changes things mentally. I was a bit flat on my feet, but I stayed 
composed because I knew, I believed that I could find the rhythm, start reading 
his serve better, and that’s what happened. I know that I can’t be at my top 
the very first match, but I believe that the process is right.”

The No4 seed David Goffin is also through after a 7-6, 6-2 win over Robin 
Haase, but the No8 seed Marcos Baghdatis lost against Radek Stepanek.
