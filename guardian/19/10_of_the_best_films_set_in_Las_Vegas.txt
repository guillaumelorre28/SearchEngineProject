"One for all – and all for KICKS!" The original Rat Pack 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Pack> movie: Frank, Dino, Sammy, Joey and 
their finger-poppin', all-drinking, all-smoking coconspirators are present and 
politically incorrect, alongside a Dames' auxiliary comprised, swooningly, of 
Shirley MacLaine and Angie Dickinson. Eleven former paratroopers assemble to 
rob five Vegas casinos in a single night, carrying the loot away in garbage 
trucks. The cast filmed all day and schticked it up onstage at theSands 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sands_Hotel> hotel nightly, so the movie has a 
tired, hungover feel to it, but the vanished Vegas of 1960 – the old Sahara and 
Riviera Hotels, and Bugsy Siegel's own Flamingo – shines forever on celluloid. 
And the 2001 Soderbergh remake is a hundred times more fun.

Once upon a time the God of Vegas was its visionary mobster-founder Bugsy 
Siegel <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugsy_Siegel>, but by the time Elvis 
Presley died in 1977, he – more specifically, "Fat Elvis" – had displaced 
Siegel as the official deity of post-Sinatra Sin City. Not only does he sing 
Las Vegas's anthem in this movie, for the final years of his career Elvis made 
Vegas his second home. In this weightless slice of gossamer and cheese, he's in 
town to race the city's first grand prix, but is waylaid by Ann-Margret in her 
Bye Bye Birdie prime. Camp and dated as hell, but so very, very Vegas! The 
Little Church of The West, the Strip's oldest building, features in the final 
scene.

Most of the casino interiors were shot at Pinewood studios, but Hamilton got 
in some fine on location shooting too . The Las Vegas International Hotel 
stands in for "The Whyte House", headquarters of Willard Whyte, a Howard 
Hughes-style reclusive millionaire sought by James Bond. Oddly, Howard Hughes 
himself, then at the height of his notoriety, and probably the most famous 
citizen of Las Vegas, partly helped get the movie made. He persuaded city 
officials to close down the Strip for the Mustang car chase, and opening up his 
hotels and casinos to the crew. Third-rate Bond, first-rate '71 Vegas.

Parts of Bugsy were shot in Las Vegas, but I can't tell you which or where, 
perhaps because in a metropolis dedicated to the obliteration of time, memory 
and guilt, any place where mobster Bugsy Siegel originally went about building 
his dream city has since been paved over multiple times. Not that it matters; 
if you sit in the garden of the current, giganticFlamingo Hotel 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamingo_Las_Vegas>, you are essentially on the 
site of its smaller predecessor, built by Siegel in 1946 to exploit Nevada's 
opportunities in legalised gambling, and whose last original parts were pulled 
down in the redevelopment orgy of the mid-1990s. One wonders if Siegel would 
approve of what became of his vision. Was he ever that tacky?

Shot mainly at the louche Riviera <http://www.rivierahotel.com/>, Casino is 
the anti-Bugsy: the Paradise Lost to Bugsy's Creation Myth. A gambler, a 
mobster and a hooker are given Las Vegas on a plate – a gangster's paradise: 
"It's a morality carwash for wiseguys" – and proceed to throw it all away in an 
orgy of cocaine and homicide. Scorsese fetishises the look and feel of the 
corrupt and decadent Vegas of the 1970s and his most poignant shot is of the 
old casinos being dynamited and replaced by Disney-style toy castles teeming 
with America's baroque peasantry. Vegas has always been garish, so imagine how 
Vegas and the 1970s collided – and see it here: livid, sparkling, nauseating, 
beautiful.

Hunter S Thompson's savagely toxic portrait of Vegas, and its explosive 
illustrations by Ralph Steadman, dovetail beautifully with the 
madness-as-method approach of director Terry Gilliam and a full-tilt HST 
impersonation by Johnny Depp. Thompson is nimbly adapted, but Vegas takes a 
psychedelic pasting, filled as it is with hallucinatory grotesques and 
rightwing bogey figures, mindless gamblers and idiot middle-American 
thrillseekers and squares. You either love Vegas or you hate Vegas: this movie 
hates it. Favourite trivia: the rear-screen projection footage in the exterior 
driving scenes is culled from the 1978-1981 hit TV showVega$

A procession of moronic gargoyles and grotesques (yes, here even the beautiful 
are ugly) contend for dubious accolades in the hotly contested field of 
"power-stripping," using sex, drugs, violence and, most of all, each other in 
their struggle to become Sin City's premier bump'n'grinder. Over the top and 
deeply jaundiced, Paul Verhoeven's drama excoriates the trashiness of 
contemporary American aspirations, and the Vegas setting: boiling neon, 
stripclub-lighting, few exteriors, is vital to the director's contemptuous 
vision of a greedy, heedless nation gone to hell. He seems to be saying to the 
audience: "Here is the stinking garbage of your dreams – eat it up!"

Wander out of any casino on the Strip and soon enough you'll spot the 
benighted and broken of Las Vegas, a city where many things – dreams, fortunes, 
people – come simply to die. Minatory hookers, mad junkies, flat-busted 
gamblers, beggars … all of them come out at night. Leaving Las Vegas takes a 
Vegas transient (Nicolas Cage, in town to drink himself to death) and a Vegas 
lifer (prostitute Elisabeth Shue) and watches them in a steadily widening gyre 
through alcoholism, rape and total immiseration in the Seven Circles of Vegas 
Hell. The Nevada Tourist Authority probably hates this movie, but it gets at 
the Vegas all the other Vegas movies miss.

Welcome to the Vegas of now: gigantic, zillion-room hotels, hookers on tap, 
booze and narcotics likewise, gambling submerged by family attractions (Blue 
Man Group and Cirque du Soleil have long since displaced The Chairman of the 
Board (Sinatra) and The King), and the city's official ad campaign, which 
emphasises, nudge-nudge, that "what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas". This 
quartet of bachelors wallow in the direst possibilities available to young men 
of money and means in the Jewel of the Desert: tigers in the bathroom, missing 
Holocaust rings, a vanishing groom and an insanely volatile Korean gangster. 
This movie is now the blueprint for a top-notch Vegas bad-boy weekend. The 
city's motto should be: "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."

"Vegas, baby!" Although Swingers is technically an LA movie (number 14 on the 
Los Angeles Times's 25 Best Movies About LA 
<http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-25lafilms-2008-pg,0,6862963.photogallery>
 list in 2008), it also features a memorable spur-of-the-moment midnight detour 
to Vegas, where budding actors and Rat Pack-revivalists Mike and Trent (Jon 
Favreau and Vince Vaughn, when they were still skinny) imbibe deeply the 
wayward retro-essence of Frank and Dino. Trent scores, Mike flames out, and 
it's back to LA with his tail between his legs. For a moment, however, it seems 
possible that some special magic conferred upon him simply by being in Vegas 
may transmit to hangdog Mike the requisite degree of "money-ness" to score like 
a Rat Packer. It doesn't.
