When the International Monetary Fund warned earlier this month that pensions 
systems across the developed world were on the brink of collapse 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/low-interest-rates-pose-solvency-risk-to-insurers-and-pension-funds>
, MPs were stung into action.

Trillions of pounds in savings were failing to meet even the basic needs of 
workers as they neared retirement, the IMF said, following a series of 
forecasts that the Brexit vote would lead tolow global growth and rock-bottom 
interest rates for years to come 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/low-interest-rates-pose-solvency-risk-to-insurers-and-pension-funds>
.

MPs on the work and pensions committee demanded the Bank of England appear 
before them to defend its policies – which are based on a mix of low interest 
rates and massive injections of financial stimulus – from the charge that they 
have played a major part in tarnishing what was once a jewel in Britain’s 
welfare system.

On Monday, Bank deputy governor Ben Broadbent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/bank-of-england-too-pessimistic-brexit-vote-deputy-governor-ben-broadbent>
 will tell them to look elsewhere for someone to blame for wrecking the 
finances of Britain’s occupational retirement schemes. Without the central 
bank’s multibillion-pound quantitative easing (QE) programme, the economy was 
almost certain to tip back into recession, hurting the pensions industry far 
more by depressing the value of the assets in their funds.

But MPs on the work and pensions committee are not so sure. The spillover 
effects of Threadneedle Street’s £435bn QE scheme have come under intense 
scrutiny since the vote to leave the EU, which spooked global markets and 
triggered another cut in interest rates.

Critics, including the former pensions minister Ros Altmann, have argued that 
lowinterest rates and QE are the root cause of the ballooning deficits in the 
UK’s £1.5tn final salary pension plans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/12/bank-of-england-attacked-50-pension-contributions>
. They have also depressed the payouts from defined contribution schemes, which 
have replaced final salary schemes in most companies and now account for around 
£600bn of occupational pension scheme saving.

MPs will know the situation is getting worse, not better, after figures from 
the consultancy Hymans Robertson showed the deficit in occupational pension 
schemes soaring to £1tn after 23 June.

Frank Field, the committee’s chair, is concerned about the pensions crisis, 
but not only for its impact on savers. He is worried about a knock-on effect 
for companies,having witnessed the destruction of high street retailer BHS 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/28/frank-field-accuses-sir-philip-green-of-asset-stripping-bhs>
 and the hollowing-out of its pension scheme. And he is also concerned about 
the longer-term effect on pay should companies find themselves shovelling their 
funds into final salary schemes, leaving only a fraction left for wage rises.

BT has a deficit estimated at 21% of its total value on the stock market. It 
is still able to pay workers a 2.5% wage rise and declare its intention to 
invest £6bn in the telecoms network. Defence manufacturer BAE Systems is in a 
worse position: it has seen the gap between the assets and liabilities in its 
pension fund grow to 40% of the company’s value.

Earlier this month, Tesco said its pension deficit had ballooned from £3.2bn 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/tesco-supermarket-sales-rise-profits-tumble>
 in February to £5.9bn, with much of the fall due to the panic after Britain 
voted to leave the EU. Tesco has denied that the need to divert cash to fill 
this huge black hole will lead to cuts to the dividend or the wage bill. 
Nonetheless, the pressure to take drastic action is building.

The City, unsurprisingly, is focused on the lack of money left in the 
corporate kitty to pay shareholder dividends and for profit-enhancing 
investment. Investors fear the Yorkshire-based plastics maker Carclo could be a 
harbinger of doom, after it became one of the first groups to warn that its 
growing pension deficit might prevent the board from not just cutting the 
dividend, but from giving any payouts at all to shareholders.

This referendum fallout mimics the problems faced by companies in the 
aftermath of the Great Crash. Then, in 2010, BT’s pension deficit was £9bn. It 
subsequently improved to nearer £6bn. Now it is £9.9bn.

Trade unions have attacked employers that, in the first instance, closed final 
salary schemes to new members and then later reduced the benefits to make 
payouts more affordable.

From the employers’ point of view, both moves came to resemble sticking 
plasters as the deficits carried on increasing. ThePensions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/pensions> Regulator tightened the screw, 
forcing them to increase contributions, often to above 50% of each worker’s 
salary.

Members of the Unite union at the UK’s Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) are 
due to hold a ballot on Monday over strike action to prevent the closure of 
their pension scheme to new and existing members. This shutdown of the entire 
scheme means employers need only honour existing pensions contracts. No more 
rights can be accrued.

Royal Mail 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/unions-threaten-battle-with-royal-mail-over-pension-scheme-change>
 and Post Office workers are battling a similar move, which will result in 
40-year-olds who might have expected a retirement income of £38,000 a year 
getting nearer £18,000, some of it from the defined contribution scheme that 
they will pay into for the rest of their working lives.

The Communication Workers Union has already held a one-day strike of Post 
Office workers against the move and last week asked the government to 
intervene. But like all other attempts to prevent employers rolling back 50 
years of improving pension rights, the momentum is in the opposite direction, 
thanks to the gap between available assets and the costs of providing a pension.

Increasing life expectancy, especially among men, has dramatically pushed up 
liabilities. Meanwhile, pension pots have struggled to make gains.

The stock market has increased strongly this year and passed its previous 
peak. But that means investors have only just clawed their way back to a level 
reached 16 years ago.

In the meantime, most schemes have shifted their investments into bonds – a 
move driven by regulations that have forced schemes to put their money in less 
risky places. A bond has a greater claim on the assets of a bust company or 
government and is therefore considered safer than stocks and shares.

But since the crash, the safest bonds have become the most coveted investments 
in the world. Not only have pension funds needed to buy them to satisfy 
regulations, but central banks have bought them as part of their own QE 
programmes.

The Bank of England’s QE scheme is dwarfed by the $4tn bought by the US 
Federal Reserve. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have also filled 
their own vaults with government bonds, in effect becoming the biggest single 
lenders to their respective governments.

The aim of QE is to drive down the long-term interest rates that govern the 
charge for borrowing on products like five-year loans and 25-year mortgages.

In the UK, five-year loan rates are not far above mortgage rates and those 
rates are back where they were before the crash, albeit minus the crazy teaser 
offers that help tip several banks over the edge. This bonanza for borrowers 
means the years since 2010 have been lean for savers.

deficits. Photograph: Graham Turner for the Observer 
Baroness Altmann’s argument is that depressing bond yields to reduce interest 
rates, without mitigating the effects on pension schemes, is creating spillover 
effects that harm the economy. As firms put more and more cash aside for people 
in final-salary schemes, there are fewer funds for the defined contribution 
plans they have switched workers into. There is also the suspicion that wages 
have taken a hit, with British companies pegging average rises at half the 
Bank’s predicted 4% for the last three years.

The only group that has assuredly escaped so far are the shareholders. A study 
by the consultancy LCP showed that FTSE 100 companies paid five times more 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/16/top-uk-firms-paid-five-times-more-in-dividends-than-into-pensions>
 in dividends than they did pension contributions in 2015. The £13.3bn paid 
into defined benefit pension schemes was dwarfed by the £71.8bn in payments to 
shareholders.

Broadbent would rightly say that was not the Bank’s decision. But the dilemma 
remains, as Jon Hatchett, a partner at Hymans Robertson, says: “Post Brexit, 
the number of UK workers that won’t be able to retire with an adequate 
income has increased from two-thirds to three-quarters.

“Workers thrown out of final salary schemes into money purchase arrangements 
receive around 10% less than they would have before the referendum.”

The Bank of England’s base-rate cut in the panic after the referendum made 
that situation worse. Given what has happened to sterling since, its threat 
since then to go even lower needs to be questioned.

Questions for Threadneedle Street

Five questions MPs should ask the deputy governor of the Bank of England Ben 
Broadbent

Has the Bank estimated the impact of rising pension deficits on the finances 
of corporate Britain?
Deficits in the UK’s final salary schemes reached £1tn after the Brexit vote, 
according to pensions consultancy Hymans Robertson. The pensions regulator says 
companies must top up ailing funds from their profits. Some companies have been 
given longer than 20 years to do this, but are still struggling to make the 
payments. Cuts in pension payments to retiring workers are widespread. Some 
firms have warned they might be forced to cut dividends.

Does the Bank accept that quantitative easing has boosted the finances of the 
already wealthy and hit those worse off?
The Bank said in a 2012 paper that QE, which involves buying corporate and 
sovereign debt, has boosted property prices and share prices as the proceeds of 
those purchases were invested in the housing markets and stock markets. 
Analysing the effects of QE, the Bank said that the top 5% of households owned 
40% of the assets, which means these people have been the primary beneficiaries 
of the boost in property prices and stock market gains following the financial 
crisis of 2008.

What can the Bank do to help those who are locking into annuities (retirement 
incomes bought from insurance firms) since QE?
Thousands of retirees have purchased annuities, which provide a retirement 
income for life, at low rates. An annuity will buy an income of around £3,500 a 
year for every £100,000 saved, depending on the additional benefits such as 
index linking to inflation. If the Bank raises interest rates, annuity rates 
could rise, but those who have already bought one would be left worse off for 
the rest of their lives.

Wasn’t QE meant to be an emergency measure to stave off an economic depression?
Quantitative easing involves purchasing billions of pounds of government - and 
now company – debt from banks. Initially it helped prevent the banks going bust 
and, according to critics, has already become redundant. The Bank has since 
claimed that extra doses of QE - it reached £435bn in August - can support the 
economy and boost wages. However, wages have yet to rise to a point where the 
Bank feels it can reduce QE or increase interest rates.

Wasn’t QE supposed to push up wage growth to between 3% and 4%?.
Wage growth has remained stuck at around 2%. QE should have tightened the 
labour market – by leading to more people being hired – and then increased 
wages as firms fought over a dwindling pool of available workers. That has not 
happened. The Bank expected that unemployment falling to 5% would trigger 
higher wages, but it has already gone down to 4.9% without the expected boost 
to pay.
