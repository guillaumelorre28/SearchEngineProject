Pop-ups are two-a-penny these days but in Antwerp, Plein Publiek, a new 
venture that combines a restaurant, gallery, work-out space and rave-y 
nightclub is luring party-goers, yogies, art lovers and more – and it’s going 
to be around until at least next May.


Plein Publiek is in a disused block of flats in gentrified Antwerp Zuid, known 
for chaotic antique stores and the Museum of Contemporary Art. The building is 
owned by the city council and is awaiting renovation in 2018. In the meantime, 
Plein Publiek is hosting flea markets, yoga classes and Sunday brunches, and 
there are art exhibitions in some of the vacant flats. Others are available as 
rehearsal rooms.

Later, diners gobble down inventive tapas – vermouth-soaked mussels (€12) or 
aubergine, yoghurt and pomegranate (€8) – as first-daters sip cocktails in a 
sofa-lined bar area. The courtyard conservatory is tastefully decorated with 
hanging pot plants, wood flooring and mismatched furniture.

There’s live music on weeknights, and carousers arrive en masse after 10pm on 
Fridays. The on-tap Belgian beers flow, bright blue spotlights bounce off the 
ghostly stairwells, DJs spin retro pop and everyone gyrates until 3am.
