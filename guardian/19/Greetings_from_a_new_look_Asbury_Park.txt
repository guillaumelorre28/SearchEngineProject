Sabrina the psychic combines compliments with harsh economic lessons. She 
flips over her tarot cards and raises an eyebrow. “You’re independent, 
kind-hearted and loyal,” she whispers. “But you’re impatient. And your 
finances? They’re in trouble.”

Must I be reminded? Stepping out of Madam Marie’s “temple of knowledge”, I 
squint in the Asbury Park sunshine. Just 60 miles south of New York I’ve found 
myself a peachy slice of beachside America; a weekend escape for in-the-know 
New Yorkers wanting a bit of sun, sea and music.

My fortunes may be uncertain, but I’m in good company. Asbury Park, in 
Monmouth County on theNew Jersey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/new-jersey> coast, was developed in 
Victorian times as a playground for glam metropolitan types, but in the 
post-war decades it declined into a barren landscape of empty streets and 
boarded-up windows. Beaten and burned by the 1970 race riots, damned by the 
recession and battered by Hurricane Sandy, Asbury seemed to face a bleak future.

Like the handful of British seaside resorts now basking in reignited stardom, 
this town is changing thanks to a wave of additions, including debut music 
festivals and new restaurants. Next summer, a dilapidated former Salvation Army 
retirement home, one block from the beach, will be transformed into its first 
new hotel in 50 years. Balancing retro beach appeal with independent new 
openings, Asbury Park is plotting what could be one of the most ambitious 
comebacks on the US east coast.

In the 20th century, the town was put on the map by the Garden State’s most 
well-known resident. Not Albert Einstein. Not Frank Sinatra, but a fellow 
member of the New Jersey Hall of Fame:Bruce Springsteen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/springsteen>. Since his 1973 debut album, 
Greetings from Asbury Park, “the Boss” has romantically detailed the town’s 
decline – a place of “stoned-out faces” and hardscrabble lives, where greasers 
“tramp the streets”.

Pony in 1976. Photograph: Richard E Aaron 
Ice-cream in hand, I stroll the sunny boardwalk and find the promenade now 
telling a very different story. Just along from the retro pinball arcade is the 
gleaming exterior ofThe Market At Fifth Avenue 
<http://www.marketatfifthavenue.com/>, a new hub of shops, artists and fashion 
designers – plus a cafe – set up by local entrepreneurs. It’s the first phase 
of development from property company Madison Marquette, which is undertaking a 
£58m revival of the boardwalk’s retail and entertainment space. With this, and 
a multi-billion-dollar redevelopment plan for the rest of the town from another 
property group, iStar, it feels as if a game-changing process is under way.

Where other investment projects have flopped in Asbury Park, Madison, at 
least, may have a chance, thanks to a team cherry-picked to include people who 
will keep the city’s spirit alive. “Everyone who felt marginalised could come 
and live in Asbury,” says Angie Sugrim, the company’s venue marketing director, 
who also plays in a punk band. “The desolate landscape appealed to people with 
initiative. It’s always had a fun live-and-let-live attitude.”

Oh, I’m ready for that. At the end of the boardwalk, I enter the Grand Arcade 
of the Convention Hall, a salt-weathered 1920s structure designed by the folk 
responsible for Manhattan’s Grand Central Station. Originally built as a 
concert venue, it will over the coming months also host tattoo conventions, 
beer festivals and punk rock flea markets. In the summer, its adjoining beach 
bars are adorned with rainbow flags – the gay community has supported Asbury as 
a cheap holiday alternative to Fire Island since the 1950s.

Several decades back, Asbury was known for its bar and music scene – the 
Clash, the Doors and the Stones all played here. Today it’s rocking even 
louder. Swapping my trainers for flip flops (“dude, you look like a Benny,” I’m 
told, “an obvious outsider”), I set about crawling the venues. After 
demolishing the best burger in town at Bond Street Bar (number 208), I head 
round the corner to the Asbury Festhalle & Biergarten (27 Lake Avenue) – a 
warehouse which, after standing empty for three decades, reopened earlier this 
year as a pre-gig beer hall with 31 draught ales. Armed with a Carton Boat – an 
NJ-brewed pale ale – I chat with Emilie and Alina, born-and-raised Monmouth 
County residents. “Twenty years ago, my dad taught me to ride my bike on the 
boardwalk because it was so empty,” Emilie tells me. “Now it’s full of people.” 
Her tattooed mate is on a crusade to defend the shore’s reputation: “Asbury 
isn’t like that TV show Jersey Shore; we don’t have men with pumped-up biceps 
and spiky, gelled hair. Asbury’s way cooler.”

It’s the eclectic music scene that helps to give this place its original 
spirit. One block from the beach, I reach the holy land: theStone Pony 
<http://www.stoneponyonline.com/> (913 Ocean Avenue). The dimly lit, 
sticky-floored venue is a shrine for music pilgrims seeking out rock, reggae 
and the Jersey Shore sound – a rootsy, R&B-infused rock’n’roll. I file in 
behind a group of pony-tailed bikers and gawp at the tiny room. Its walls are 
lined with guitars and faded snaps of sweaty past performers, from Springsteen, 
who underpinned the club’s rise to fame with more than 90 gigs in the 1970s and 
80s, to Kiss in the 90s.

Outside in the sun, crowds are chugging beer by a huge stage. This is the 
setting for Asbury’s new festival, taking place next Saturday (19 September) 
and called Shadow of the City (referring to the way New Jersey can seem 
eclipsed by its massive metropolitan neighbour). It’s the brainchild of Jack 
Antonoff, NJ-born frontman of indie band Bleachers, who is hoping to ramp up 
the state’s musical image with an eight-band, Jersey-strong line-up for 5,000 
festival-goers.

Just a minute away, on the corner of Fifth Avenue, is the Wonder Bar 
<http://wonderbarasburypark.com/index.html>, with a small stage inside 
(Springsteen swung by for a jam a few weeks back). In the beer garden, Yappy 
Hour – a busy social for dogs and owners – is in full cry. “Small dogs only 
Mondays and Fridays,” the doorman says, pointing at Asbury’s fluffiest pooches. 
“And no mounting.” At Convention Hall over the street, the lights flicker 
“Greetings from As–”. Who needs functioning bulbs when there’s a 
psychedelic-red sunset drenching the skeleton buildings of the city’s false 
starts?

It’s all part of the Asbury charm. If all goes to plan, the new hotel will 
share a block with the punk-inspiredAsbury Lanes <http://www.asburylanes.com/> 
(209 Fourth Avenue). This is the most eccentric, fiercely guarded live venue in 
town, and sits uncertainly in the middle of a planned redevelopment zone (the 
adjoining Fast Lane nightclub met its end in 2013). I’m here on the wrong night 
for sex toy bingo, and I’ve missed the burlesque show. Instead, I get to hear 
what this town is all about – guitars. On a stage set amid 16 vintage bowling 
alleys, a local rock band called The Cold Seas are thrashing their hair, while 
“Juicy” Jenn Hampton, the bar’s dazzling manager, doles out doughnuts.

Next morning, I’m craving sea air and carbs. I park myself and my bikini next 
to a new addition to the boardwalk – a collection of food trucks. There are 
tacos and ceviche, but like a wannabe Jersey Girl trying to keep it real, I 
make a beeline for the ominous-sounding NJ staple: pork roll. Joining a table, 
I eat a bun wodged with runny egg, cheese and thick slabs of something fried 
and pink, “a hybrid of bacon and ham, in a sack”, says owner John Varusi, who 
tells me that there was initially some local angst about the trucks’ location. 
“They were worried about the noise. But the seniors in that building,” he 
points to one of the few high-rises, “said they wanted our cheap food. Where 
else would you get senior citizens queuing for breakfast alongside tattooed 
surfers? Only in Asbury.”

It’s about time I join those surfers. On one side of me a group of 60-year-old 
bearded dudes are hurling themselves into the water, while on the other some 
teenagers are jumping the waves. The golden sand is flecked with rainbow 
parasols, lifeguard huts and surf boards, and behind me is the resilient, 
retro-glam promenade. It’s the antithesis of the gleaming, manicured Hamptons.

That peculiar tough-nut faded beauty is at the centre of Asbury’s appeal. Many 
locals are happy with the revival – their boardwalk is now a busy, safe place 
to hang out. But many, understandably, feel protective – this coast now looks 
worryingly ripe for big-bucks investors to plant glossy high-rises and generic 
condos.

That night I meet 30-something Jersey boy Jay Buim, a filmmaker with a bushy 
beard and pigtails who used to skateboard in the circular beaux-arts Carousel 
building after the roundabout was scrapped in 1990. “That place,Porta 
<http://www.pizzaporta.com/>,” he says, pointing to a hip Italian restaurant 
that opened a few years back on Kingsley Street, “it used to be a gnarly-ass 
dump. I’m happy, because Asbury had become a shell of its former self. But it 
must hold on to the things that made it so great in the first place.”

Today the Carousel House is sprayed with new work from Harif Guzman, an 
internationally renowned artist who also used to skateboard here. I follow the 
side of the building round towards the battered, defunct, but still-majestic 
Casino, whose walls are adorned with brightly coloured murals as part of Sea 
Change, a public initiative to add beauty to the town and broaden its 
recognition among artists and audiences.

Next to the casino is the old power plant that helped Asbury Park function as 
the “jewel of the Jersey Shore” in the 1920s. Its crumbling brick chimney 
stretches into the cloudless sky, seagulls circle above the ocean and a busker 
with a keyboard is playing a tune reminiscent of the old amusement rides. 
Across the front of the derelict building a mural exhorts onlookers to “Protect 
her glory”.

Asbury fans would agree with that. “This town will only get better,” my 
fortune teller insists. She was on to something when she called me an impatient 
big spender, so let’s hope she’s also right about this.
