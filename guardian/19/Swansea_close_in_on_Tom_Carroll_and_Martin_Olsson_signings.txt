Carroll, who spent the 2014-15 season on loan at the Liberty Stadium, has 
rarely featured for Tottenham this season having made just three appearances in 
all competitions. He was due for a medical on Monday after agreeing personal 
terms with Swansea, with the product of Spurs’ academy likely to complete his 
move this week and become Paul Clement’s second signing since he took over from 
Bob Bradley.

Having already added the Holland winger Luciano Narsingh

from PSV Eindhoven last week, Clement is looking to improve his squad after the 
4-1 home defeat to Arsenal on Saturday which left his new side bottom of the 
Premier League. The former Derby County manager confirmed last week that the 
addition of Carroll and Olsson were imminent, with the Sweden international 
expected to cost £4m.
