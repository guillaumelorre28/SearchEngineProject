We’re looking for things to see and do in New Orleans

and party around the city. Maybe you know of a fantastic new restaurant, hip 
hotel or great place for a night of live entertainment.

Send us your tip – including as much detail as you can (with websites and 
prices if possible) and why the place is special – and you could win a £200 
hotel voucher. Contribute viaGuardianWitness <https://witness.guardian.co.uk/>.

The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
fromHotels.com <http://www.hotels.com/>, allowing you stay in over 260,000
