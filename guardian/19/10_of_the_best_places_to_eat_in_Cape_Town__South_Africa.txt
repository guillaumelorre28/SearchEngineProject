Neighbourgoods Market, Woodstock


This seething weekend market at the Old Biscuit Mill in the heart of the 
Woodstock neighbourhood is a must for any street food lover. The problem is 
deciding what not to order from the 100-odd stalls. It’s difficult to resist 
the mushroom kebabs from Funki Fungi, farm-fresh raw veggies atSaladLover 
<https://www.facebook.com/saladlover.co.za/>, or chef Shayn Schutte’s smoky 
beef brisket at the newest stand,Pulled & Roasted 
<https://www.facebook.com/Pulled-and-Roasted-398347517042104/>. By lunchtime, 
the lanes between the foodstalls are totally crammed. Everyone sits together on 
long communal tables, entertained by live music, and while traders sell a host 
of artisan ales and organic Cape wines, it is difficult to beat a lethal 
chipotle bloody mary.

 Bastion of the butty … Bacon On Bree. 
Bree Street is one of Cape Town’s hippest food and drink venues, with places 
such asJason Bakery <http://www.jasonbakery.com/>, Culture Club Cheese 
<https://www.cultureclubcheese.co.za/> and Mother’s Ruin 
<http://mothersruin.co.za/>, a gin joint stocked with locally distilled brands 
such as Woodstock, Musgrave and Jorgensen. And the newest bar on the block is 
dedicated to the humble bacon butty, elevated to irresistible gourmet levels by 
chefRichard Bosman <https://richardbosman.me/>, who is what South Africans call 
afleischmeister of charcuterie. The signature bacon sandwich is hearty, rather 
than fancy; thick, juicy rashers served in what looks like doorstop slices of 
Mother’s Pride but are actually baked using a special sourdough recipe. There 
is homemade baconnaise, ketchup and macademia nut butter, while downstairs 
diners laze away in a chill-out lounge, garden and art gallery.

 Asia meets African spices … Biesmiellah. 
The Bo-Kaap neighbourhood, with its brightly painted houses, is becoming one 
of the most fashionable parts of town, and the venerable Biesmiellah, which has 
been serving the community’s traditional Cape Malay cuisine for 40 years, has 
just had a total revamp. Diners sit in a spacious, colourful cafe with huge 
windows looking out across Table Mountain. In keeping with Cape Malay customs, 
the cuisine is halal and no alcohol is served. The surprise about the dishes is 
that signature curries are much milder than recipes from south-east Asia 
because, as the owner, Momeena Osman, explains: “When the Malay slaves arrived 
here, they cooked their home cuisine but with our own subtle spices, which are 
not so fiery.” Don’t miss the specialitydenningvleis, a tender sweet-and-sour 
lamb stew, and the unforgettablebobotie, spiced minced beef baked with 
egg-soaked bread and sultanas.

 Upping the steaks … Woodstock Grill & Tap pairs quality meat with its own 
brews. 
Cape Town has long been a goldmine for craft ale, but in this recently opened 
Woodstock locale, meat and beer lovers can have the best of both worlds. Begin 
with a tour of the state-of-the-art brewery on the ground floor, then walk up 
to the bright, modern dining room and long red-brick bar. On the menu are some 
exceptional IPA, malt and stout, accompanied by juicy giant steaks of dry-aged 
meat that comes straight from its own meat locker. It also proposes a 
beer-pairing menu where four of the brewery’s specialities – Californicator 
IPA, the amber Pot Belge and Hazy Daze, a Belgian-style white beer – are served 
with tapas portions of charcuterie, sirloin bruschettas and spicy meatballs.

 Game changer … Marco’s carpaccio of springbok, kudu, ostrich and impala. 
There are several lively African restaurants in town – Mama Africa, Africa 
Cafe, Gold – but Marco’s is the one that really succeeds in attracting groups 
of foreign visitors alongside locals, so you never feel you’re part of a 
touristy cultural show. Marco himself mixes with the guests but keeps a regular 
eye on the kitchen, where his band of chefs specialise in hearty local dishes, 
such as oxtail curry,umleqwa spicy freerange chicken and a signature smoked 
wild-game carpaccio of springbok, kudu, ostrich and impala. For the brave, try 
a smiley – a boiled sheep head, about which Marco says: “If I didn’t serve 
these every night, I’d lose my local clientele.” The live bands change most 
weeks but expect hot afro-jazz getting everyone dancing until late.

There is no better bar in Cape Town to discover the latest trends in South

Behind the bar, Christie and Jesse enthusiastically uncork the latest bottles 
by independent organic and biodynamic vignerons, and small tasting tumblers of 
five different wines cost just R100 (£6). Open from 4pm till late, Publik 
shares premises with an artisan butcher whose delicious sharing plates of 
charcuterie are offered – don’t miss the unique biltong-cured beef – along with 
a surprising range of cheeses from nearby farms, including a tangy local take 
on gorgonzola.

 Off the scale … The Codfather prices fish by their weight. 
Fashionable Camps Bay is lined with swish, expensive diners with superb views 
of the ocean. But tucked away in a backstreet is The Codfather, a foodie 
institution, where diners choose from a feast of freshly caught, sustainable 
seafood at very reasonable prices. There is no menu, but the friendly waiters, 
who take equal billing with the seafood, take diners over to the cornucopia of 
fish and seafood displayed on a wetbar, and propose a menu according to your 
budget, with the fish priced by its weight. Potatoes or rice and vegetables are 
included in the price. There is sushi, too, but nothing beats a seared tuna 
steak or grilled tiger prawn from Mozambique.

 Rude but right … irreverent signs at Yard. 
This rock’n’roll garage diner has a serious in-your-face attitude – the sign 
at the entrance says “fit in or fuck off” – and when your name is called out to 
collect what is the biggest, meanest burger in Cape Town, be prepared for some 
badass insults from the rowdy waitresses. Three eateries-in-one, Yard morphs 
from Mucky Mary’s, a gritty breakfast bar with stellar barista coffee, to the 
Bitch’s Tits, a lunchtime dinerette serving meaty sandwiches, to The Dog’s 
Bollocks in the evening, nothing less than hamburger heaven. Politically 
correct it isn’t, but the clients love it, and Yard, which literally is the 
driveway and garage of owner Nigel Wood, is packed out from Monday to Saturday. 
The house speciality is an awesome burger smothered with chilli con carne and 
cheese, perfect with its own craftbrew, Dog’s Bollocks pilsner hybrid.

With its spectacular views over Cape Town’s historic harbour and backdrop of

and prices of many of the waterside restaurants are often not as attractive as 
the views, which explains the runaway success of the V&A Food Market since it 
opened three years ago. Housed in a heritage red-brick Pumphouse, the vast 
interior has been filled with 50 enticing, eclectic street food stalls, and the 
place heaves with foodies seven days a week. All tastes are catered for, from 
theHungry Herbivore <http://www.thehungryherbivore.com/>’s gluten-free vegan 
dishes to the challenging menu ofKubu Cuisine <http://www.kubucuisine.co.za/>, 
which runs to zebra, crocodile and warthog. TheExotic Marigold Eatery 
<http://toplocalplaces.com/south-africa/cape-town/food-grocery/exotic-marigold-eatery/1689484987944150>

is cheap, cheerful and self-service, with bars offering smoothies, craft beer, 
wine and cocktails.

 Braai party … Amadoda has the ambiance of ashisa nyama barbecue 
Be prepared for a riotous night of succulent barbecued steaks, pork chops, 
home-cured sausages and crispy chicken wings, accompanied by spicy chakalaka 
sauce, booming African or hip-hop music, and a lot of cold beer at this 
ramshakle venue hidden away in a backstreet parking lot of Woodstock. Amadoda 
has successfully recreated the ambiance of what is known as ashisa nyama, an 
informal barbecue party with meats grilled on an old fashionedbraai, right in 
the heart of town. Expect to eat with your fingers, with a big plastic bowl of 
water on the table to wash sticky fingers.
• Braai meat selection from £6 (extra £6 cover charge if band is playing), 1 
Strand Street, +27 21 447 2133, amadoda.co.za <http://www.amadoda.co.za/>
