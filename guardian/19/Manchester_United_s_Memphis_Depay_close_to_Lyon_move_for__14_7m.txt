Lyon are closing in on the signing of Memphis Depay from Manchester United 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united> for around €17m 
(£14.75m), a fee which would represent nearly a 50% loss on a player who cost 
€34m from PSV Eindhoven in May 2015.

Discussions are understood to be on-going between the clubs regarding the 
final price and structure of the transfer. While it is possible United may hold 
out for a larger fee, Depay is keen on a move to the French club, who are 
currently fourth in Ligue 1.

 by Louis van Gaal, the previous manager who had given him his Holland debut 
when in charge of the national team.

Depay had been the Eredivisie’s top-scorer in 2014-15, the forward’s goals a 
key factor in PSV’s title win. On signing Depay said: “It’s been an exciting 
and hectic period and to have had to choose between so many top clubs doesn’t 
make it any easier. Manchester United is an absolute dream club so I didn’t 
need any convincing about the quality of the guys already there.”

While Liverpool were then among the clubs particularly interested in acquiring 
Depay, United have faced the opposite scenario – finding it a challenge to sell 
a player who has disappointed for an acceptable fee.

In his season and a half at Old Trafford Depay has never established himself, 
making only 16 Premier League starts and scoring twice.
