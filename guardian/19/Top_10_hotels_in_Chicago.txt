Public

Ian Schrager unveiled the first – and so far only – location of Public, his 
affordable, frills-free luxury hotel chain, in Chicago's Gold Coast 
neighbourhood. Previously the historic Ambassador East hotel (with its 
restaurant and celeb haunt the Pump Room), Public epitomises Schrager's new 
brand of pared-down sophistication. A giant cluster of globe lights glow 
against an all-neutral palette (yes, beige, cream and taupe rule here) and a 
mirrored check-in desk is as glitzy as it gets. But the best part: there's no 
velvet rope in sight.

Wicker Park Inn
 Wicker Park Inn, Chicago 
Interiors at this brownstone B&B are straightforward and unfussy – neutral 
colours, floral bedspreads, exposed brick walls – and the location is perfect 
for those who want to hang out in trendy Wicker Park. On a quiet, tree-lined 
block, the inn is steps away from local food and drink favourites such as Big 
Star <> and The Violet Hour <>, as well as Bucktown's shopping district. Room 
options range from standard en suite doubles to the Bucktown apartment, which 
has three bedrooms, a dining room and a kitchen. Guests can expect a 
continental breakfast – fruit, pastries, hard-boiled eggs – and many of the 
rooms have working fireplaces.

Hotel Lincoln 
 Hotel Lincoln, Chicago 
Originally a neighbourhood hotel from the 1920s, and with the likes of Al 
Capone and David Mamet as former guests, this spot recently had a makeover as a 
boutique hotel. Now, the lobby feels less like a glamorous gangster/celeb haunt 
and more like a laidback community space, decked out in plaid and tweed 
fabrics. (Cheeky tip: act like your favourite animal during check-in and snag a 
free room upgrade.) The 184 rooms, many overlookingLincoln Park 
<http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/lincoln-park/>, have a cheery vibe, 
with bright blankets and local artwork.

Longman & Eagle
 Longman and Eagle, Chicago 
In the Logan Square neighbourhood, this art-centric, six-room inn sits above 
the cult restaurant of the same name. Everything from the wood-slat ceiling to 
much of the furniture was designed and built by the owners. Each of the rooms 
has a minibar and is decorated with local art; other creative touches include 
handmade wooden drink coins (for use at the bar downstairs, known for its 
whisky selection), mix tapes, custom wooden speakers, and hanging terrariums 
over the bathroom sinks.

The James
 The James Hotel, Chicago 
The James recently opened sleek, art-focused outposts in SoHo and Miami, but 
Chicago was the original. From the iconic stack of vintage suitcases as art 
installation to the ethereal photo wallpaper of trees along the stairwell, the 
unpretentious lobby is a stimulating spot to hang out. Chicago exec-types might 
flock to David Burke's Primehouse restaurant for steaks dry-aged with Himalayan 
salt, while a hipper crowd will surely rub elbows with hotel guests at the 
soon-to-open Burke's Bacon Bar, an artisanal sandwich shop also by Burke. 
Families can book a spacious one-bedroom apartment, and order Paul Frank 
pyjamas and colouring books for the little ones, as well as rent bikes or 
borrow car seats when heading out.

The Ruby Room
 The Ruby Room, Chicago 
On a particularly bustling commercial stretch of Division Street, in the hip 
Wicker Park neighbourhood, this hotel's spacious guestrooms cut a stark yet 
welcome contrast to the action outside. Nestled above the full-service salon, 
spa and healing sanctuary of the same name, three serene rooms are fitted with 
a king-size bed, antiques and steam showers. Without the distraction of TVs, 
guests can hang out in the secret garden at the back of the building, take a 
yoga class, nurture their chakras, or enjoy complimentary use of a nearby gym.

Old Chicago Inn (Lakeview)
 Old Chicago Inn, Lakeview 
The most obvious lure of the Old Chicago Inn, which is in a hulking and 
historic greystone, is that it's a prime location for sports fans. Four blocks 
fromWrigley Field <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field>, guests will be 
smack in the middle of the action during baseball season. For those more 
interested in history (and a drink), there's a lesser-known appeal: Room 13 is 
the Old Chicago Inn's own 1920s-era speakeasy, tucked into the garden level and 
open only on Friday and Saturday nights. The resident bartender, Ted Carlson, 
who whips up classic American cocktails using prohibition-era recipes, is a 
history buff who regales patrons with stories about the Chicago prohibition and 
gangster scene.

The Talbott Hotel
 Talbot Hotel, Chicago 
One of the few remaining independent, family-owned hotels just off Michigan 
Avenue – better known among shopping-obsessed tourists as theMagnificent Mile 
<http://www.themagnificentmile.com/>. Built in 1927, the hotel was bought by 
current owner Basil Kromelow in the 1960s and is European in style: big on 
beige, carpet, heavy window treatments, and with an iconic awning out front. It 
may lack modern aesthetic flourishes, but it's a solid option for those who 
prefer the character and charms of an old hotel to the clean-lined sterility of 
many of the new ones nearby.

MileNorth
 Mile North, Chicago 
Owned by the hotel group Destination Hotels & Resorts, this 213-room hotel 
offers an edgy boutique vibe, from the minute you walk into the herringbone 
wood-clad lobby, with its Chesterfield sofas and pops of neon yellow. Rooms are 
minimal, and many have vertigo-inducing floor-to-ceiling views of downtown. But 
if you stay at this hotel for one thing, it's the C-View, arguably one of the 
best rooftop terraces in the city. Sit at one of the bright orange loungers or 
a seat at the communal table, and soak in stunning views of the surrounding 
River North and the great blue Lake Michigan yonder.

Hotel Sax Chicago
 Hotel Sax, Chicago 
Formerly the House of Blues Hotel, the luxuriously made-over Hotel Sax stands 
next to the iconic Corn Cob Towers, asMarina City 
<http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=marina+city+chicago&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=GyMCUrDsM-W80QWtu4CIDg&sqi=2&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1664&bih=1047#facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=62S_VtLaYSbmzM%3A%3BBSuP6Sq4JoWH_M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.thecoolist.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2009%252F11%252Fmarina-city_chicago_1.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.thecoolist.com%252Fhousing-design-10-masterpieces-of-urban-community%252F%3B600%3B453>
 is affectionately known. The lobby and 353 guestrooms ooze a decadence seldom 
found in such large hotels: think Italian marble floors, trompe l'oeil 
candelabras and snakeskin wing-backed club chairs, in a setting that's part 
glamorous, part clubby. And the trendy Crimson Lounge – all cushy velvet 
settees, damask wallpaper and gilded mirrors – creates its own signature scent 
(a pomegranate base is accented with patchouli, cardamom, cinnamon and 
sandalwood). The restaurant and wine bar, Bin36, and10pin 
<http://www.10pinchicago.com/#Party> (for bowling) are connected to the hotel.
