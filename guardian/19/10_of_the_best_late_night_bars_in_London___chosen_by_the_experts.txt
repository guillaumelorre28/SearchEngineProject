Dandelyan, Blackfriars

Dandelyan is one of the world’s 50 best bars 
<http://www.worlds50bestbars.com/fifty-best-bars-list/dandelyan/?pid=ranking-2015-1-50>
 and one of my personal favourites. With a menu that explores modern botany, 
this could easily be a pretentious place of moody mixologists. It is not – 
these are bartenders, skilled in the art of hospitality, as well as drinks 
creation. This place has thought about all aspects of the bar experience. The 
decor is plush but not to the point you look yourself up and down before 
entering. Being part of the boutique hotel Mondrian London means there is sense 
of charm and elegance rather than overbearing luxury. The cocktail classes 
flock to see the concoctions of famed drinksmiths Ryan Chetiyawardana and Iain 
Griffiths, but thanks to its location, inside one of London’s coolest hotels, 
and on the South Bank, it attracts a wide range of customers. The modern-botany 
focus narrowed this January to “the effect botany has had on historical 
civilisations”. If you’re of a curious disposition, you’ll be drawn to the 
cocktails with esoteric descriptions. The Pinnacle Point Fizz stands out: 
tequila, mixtamalised blue corn, sloe, ginger bitters, sour pineapple and soda. 
Too safe? How about Heirloom, with whisky, Kamm & Sons, plant haemoglobin and 
exploded raspberry cordial. Up a notch? The 13th Century Boy has gin, palm and 
pine embalming cordial and mummified citrus. Like natural science, somehow the 
elements neatly weave together.

 Whisky being poured into the Black Rock bar’s oak-tree table 
Whisky is more exciting than it’s ever been, yet most whisky bars are still 
stuck in the dark ages: stuffy, intimidating and old-fashioned. But this cool 
little coal hole of a place breaks the mould. It groups its whiskies – 250 of 
them, from around the world – by flavour rather than country, so choosing is 
easy, and most drams, apart from a few rarities, are £7-£11. The 
Japanese-influenced cocktails are excellent too, with beautiful ice, prepared 
by staff who really know their stuff (but don’t indulge in jargon). And the 
table is show-stopping – an 18ft slab of oak tree with channels of whisky 
flowing through it. Black Rock is whisky made fun.

Of all of my favourite London bars, this is the one I can rely on for its 
winning and heady combination of excellent drinks – you can go as stable or as 
far-out as you like – top-notch service and bar snacks, and a feeling that 
you’ve arrived in an illicit-but-classy drinking den. This is the kind of place 
you can come to have a sensible chat with a colleague over a Black Cow vodka 
and tonic at the gold bar; for a sexy date with someone new or someone you love 
(most couples seem to end up snogging on the sofas); for an experimental whisky 
cocktail; or to get sloshed on a round of signature Hix Fixes with some pals. 
Come on a Thursday after 10pm for the regular Mark’s Lates party and you’ll end 
up dancing until 3am (and watching bartenders dancing on the bar). After all 
that, it’s standard practice to come upstairs for air and wonder where the 
hours have gone.

The journey to the Nightjar starts at Old Street roundabout. There’s just this 
kebab shop upstairs then, next to it, there is this well-presented guy on the 
door – there’s nothing else to look at. To go for the first time, especially if 
you’re taking someone who’s never been, is special – but you really should book 
in advance. Walking down the stairs through a long thin corridor and into that 
bar for the first time is amazing. It’s a dark space, with candles everywhere. 
It has this beautiful tin ceiling that reflects light beautifully. Waiters will 
greet you, and they know the menu inside out. The menu changes regularly and 
the drinks are bespoke, but you can’t really go wrong: the waiters push you in 
the direction of how you’re feeling. The Nightjar changed the game a bit, with 
that seated cocktail dining experience with live jazz and swing in the 
background. The atmosphere when the music is peaking is dark and sexy and I 
can’t think of another bar that goes to so much effort in the presentation of 
every single drink in its list. It really is the best in the world at what it 
does.

The first thing that I look for in a bar is the greeting. It’s that moment 
that takes you from being a stranger in a strange place to a welcomed guest, 
waiting for a drink. Even when it’s three deep at 69, there will always be 
someone who works there whose eyes go directly to the door when it opens. 69 is 
a tiny, tucked-away bar lifted out of a Fellini film. Inside, there’s black 
wood, white-jacketed staff – and a relaxed elegance. If I pop in on the early 
side I’m sure to run into a mix of artists and writers, some of the designer 
friends of Tony Conigliaro – its owner – as well as high-end bartenders from 
around the world who make pilgrimages to the bar to experience Tony’s drinks. 
69 has been influential on the cocktail bar scene. It was one of the earlier 
bars to take a chance on stepping up into higher-end cocktailswhen there was 
this change from people looking for the place that gave you the biggest drink 
to the place that gave you the best drink. I loved the Lipstick Cocktail and 
the Fig leaf Martini, where Tony distils fig leaf into the spirit. The Caper 
leaf Martini is also gorgeous. And the Prairie oyster, with the deconstructed 
tomato, is something well worth trying.

Like all our favourite kind of bars, Shrub and Shutter feels like a mate’s 
kitchen – but with its shelves packed full of bottles, books and herbs and a 
seasonally changing menu scribbled in chalk on the blackboard. You never quite 
know what you’re going to get behind that glass door, but it’s all part of the 
fun: live jazz, dinner dates, full-blown parties or one-off Disney nights where 
cocktails come served in a smoking genie lamp. The best seat in the house is up 
at the bar getting up to mischief with the bartenders; these boys not only know 
how to have a good time but they’re the creative geniuses behind the drinks. 
We’re not talking any old Old Fashioned, these are the kind of creations you 
write home about about – and though they’re a little crazy, they all taste 
perfect.

 Heavily stylised photo of a flower-strewn cocktail on the bar top at Trailer 
Happiness, Notting Hill, London 
A fantastic cocktail menu is essential, but I think it’s the people who really 
make a bar. Trailer Happiness attracts an excellent crowd and does the best rum 
cocktails in London. It’s a great bar to visit with a group of friends or even 
when travelling solo. It’s been an institution for many years and is known for 
its adoration for my favourite spirit: rum. That’s not to say itdoesn’t do a 
killer G&T or vodka Martini, but the highlights and more innovative cocktails 
on the menu are usually rum-based. During Notting Hill Carnival, the team can 
be found cooking up jerk chicken and serving it alongside delicious rum 
punches. Trailer Carnival Lockdown is my favourite party, and where I can be 
found with a punch cocktail in hand. My favourite night at Trailer had to be 
after Imbibe Live 2013 (an annual drinks trade show). I had just found out that 
I had been offered the job at OXO Bar and Restaurantand I remember it was an 
extremely hot day. Many faces from the bar trade were at Trailer after the 
Imbibe show and we had an amazing night. The atmosphere, the drinks and the 
people absolutely made the evening. I felt like I was on a Caribbean Island 
with all of my best mates – and it’s where I met my boyfriend. But, honestly, 
no matter what time of year it is, a night in Trailer can transport you to a 
party in Barbados – until closing time anyway.

To me, the most basic thing a bar should be is fun. Nobody goes to a bar to 
have a bad time. Loads of places do it extremely well, but none, in my opinion, 
more so than the Sun Tavern. The owners will probably tell you different, but 
my take on it is that this place is a modern-day version of a pub. The decor is 
tough to pin down to one particular style, but it feels like a pub should feel. 
Homely, welcoming and reliable, along with one of the best-looking back bars in 
London; the days of Fosters on draught and a dusty bottle of Cointreau on the 
back bar are dead. The Sun has a great selection of beers on tap, which change 
regularly, a short, but very well put together list of house cocktails and 
staff as knowledgable on classic cocktails as anywhere else in London. You’ll 
find me working my way through its extensive selection of Irish whiskeys.

I just want to go to a bar and have a nice drink.” Cahoots is very much a 
themed bar, it shouldn’t work, but it does. As soon as you go in, you find 
yourself buying into the whole thing and that’s what great bars do. It’s themed 
around blitz-chic and is designed with a high level of authenticity: down to 
the staff talking in received pronunciation. It’s all been thought through so 
wonderfully; the way the staff dress, talk, the theatre of the entrance – as if 
being ushered into a bomb shelter. Part of the bar is in what used to be the 
Kingly Court tube station, so I think that’s where it got some of its theme 
from. The drink menus come on a kind-of 1940s-style newspaper, but it has 
serious people in charge of its bar programme; there’s been an effort to hire 
people who see making drinks as an artform. Products are chosen carefully, 
there a lot of homemade ingredients and the owners spend time and effort on the 
presentation and garnishing. But really it’s just a lot of fun. It’s the kind 
of place where you could come in sceptical and get won over.

Lurking around the corner from the two Brixton stations, down the end of a 
none-to-pretty road, is the altar to ale that is Craft Beer Co. Significantly 
buzzier than its siblings, it has a huge outside space, which has been rammed 
every time I’ve been in, or gone past. It’s no doubt down to the excellent 
selection of beers, including some exclusive imports. Another bonus about CBC 
Brixton is that it sometimes opens even later when there’s a gig at Brixton 
Academy, meaning (if my last visit is anything to go by) you can drink a decent 
beer before and after your concert instead of just having to spend your evening 
mournfully staring into a plastic glass of the overpriced beer available in the 
venue itself.
