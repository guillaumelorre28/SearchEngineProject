Patrick Bamford is undergoing a medical at Middlesbrough 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough> with a view to signing a 
four-and-a-half-year contract with the Premier League club after Chelsea 
accepted an initial offer of around £5m for the striker. The transfer fee for 
the 23-year-old could rise to as much as £10m depending on appearances and 
various clauses being triggered.

Bamford leaves Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> without 
ever making a senior appearance for the club he joined from Nottingham Forest 
for £1.5m five years ago. He has been loaned out to six clubs, including 
Middlesbrough, where he scored 19 goals during the 2014‑15 season and was named 
Championship player of the year.

His most recent loan spell was with Burnley, where he played for a total of 34 
minutes this season across six substitute appearances. Bamford also saw little 
action in the previous campaign – he never started a league game during a loan 
spell with Crystal Palace that was cut short, and five of his seven league 
appearances for Norwich, during the second half of the 2015-16 season, were 
from the bench.

With 18 months remaining on his contract at Chelsea and no prospect of 
breaking through at Stamford Bridge, Bamford was keen to secure a permanent 
transfer and avoid another loan move. He will hope that a fresh start at 
Middlesbrough helps to reignite the promising career that has stalled since he 
left the Riverside a little under two years ago.
