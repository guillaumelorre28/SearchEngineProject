While considering that it may take Laurence Robertson MP almost a month to 
earn the £5,166 he received in hospitality (Bookies woo MPs amid fears over 
problem gambling 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/gambling-firms-charmed-mps-ahead-of-betting-review-in-2016>
, 2 January), readers might like to consider that an employee of a high street 
bookmaker would need to work for about four months to earn the same amount. 
Like many retail workers, they receive no extra pay for working unsocial hours 
and bank holidays.

• Re plurals (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/30/family-chords-and-discord>,

• After reading Harriet Sherwood’s article 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/31/allow-married-catholic-priests-to-halt-decline-in-ireland-says-clergyman>
 in Saturday’s Guardian on the desperate shortage of priests in the Roman 
Catholic church, I put on my thinking cap to see if I could come up with an 
answer. And then it struck me. Why not offer the job to women as well as to 
men, like all other employers do?

• On Tuesday morning, with the temperature well below zero centigrade, our 
postman was wearing shorts. Could this be an austerity-driven cloth-cutting

• Compared with the sound and fury of social media, the Guardian’s letters 
columns are a superb example of reasoned and moderated debate and discussion. 
Surely there is a case for devoting more space to readers’ letters in 2017. In 
the age of Trump they will be more needed than ever.
