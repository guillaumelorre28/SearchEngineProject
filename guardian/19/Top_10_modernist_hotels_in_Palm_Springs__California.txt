Del Marcos

This quintessential modernist hotel designed by the architect William Cody 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Cody> in 1947 pays homage to the 
organic architecture ofFrank Lloyd Wright <http://www.franklloydwright.org/>. 
It is in the Historic Tennis Club district – founded in 1937 and the oldest 
neighbourhood in Palm Springs – and nestles into the mountainside. The 17-room, 
adults-only property is built of native stone and redwood and benefited from a 
2013 restoration that revealed its fine mid-century bones. The Chi-Chi room 
offers a fun poolside retro romp of the era’s art and furniture, while the 
Errol Flynn suite boasts a high, angled ceiling, full kitchen, and a series of 
wooden shutters that let in light or offer privacy. The Hope/Crosby room offers 
a quiet retreat with views ofAlbert Frey 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Frey_%28architect%29>’s legendary house on 
the hill.

There’s no denying that the Ace remains hipster central – when I was there I 
met a posse of Italian Ducati PRs organising a race up the mountain to launch a 
new bike – but it’s also a pleasant place to stay. The rooms exude a breezy 
mid-1970s nostalgia and many feature private patios; the pool is large and 
inviting and it’s hands down the best place for people watching in South Palm 
Springs. From the macrame-adorned lobby, to the converted Denny’s diner, 
observe LA creatives frolic at the weekend in the Lance O’Donnell-designed 
space, carved out of a mid-century Westward Ho motel. Pop in for a pool party, 
or retreat to the Feel Good Spa.

Designed in 1954 by modernist architect Howard Lapham – famous for his homes 
for Hollywood stars and the Rat Pack-eraChi-Chi nightclub 
<http://www.palmspringslife.com/Palm-Springs-Life/February-2005/Remembering-The-Chi-Chi/>
 – the Desert Star is refreshingly low-key. In the sought-after South Palm 
Springs area, its adults-only rentals offer five studio apartments with 
kitchens (some with the original Formica) surrounding a heated pool and 
sheltered by towering palms. Breathtaking views of the mountain can be had from 
almost every angle, including the private patio spaces with fire-pits. It’s 
walking distance to the Ace hotel where lots of action happens on weekends but 
you may find yourself so enamoured of the laid-back atmosphere here you may 
never emerge from your comfy suite.

This 1947 treasure in the Historic Tennis Club district, was designed by 
Herbert Burns, the pioneer of the Palm Springs “ultra-modern motor court inn”. 
A favourite of renowned architectural photographerJulius Shulman 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Shulman>, it’s next to the majestic San 
Jacinto mountains. Originally called the Town and Desert, its lush lawn and 10 
spacious rooms often appeared in Architectural Record; its late 1940s elegant 
simplicity was revamped in 2002 and still offers retro charm with modern 
amenities. Rooms flanking a large outdoor saltwater pool feature patios, 
kitchenettes and original tile bathrooms. A common area remains perfectly 
preserved in its 1947 chic glory.

A few hundred metres down the road from the Hideaway, Herbrty Burns’s third 
Palm Springs hotel came to life a decade later in 1957. Exuding mid-century, 
space-age optimism, the Orbit In (as in “come in from another galaxy”) also 
features a treasure trove of 1950s collectibles displayed by owners Kevin 
Miller and Jinny Park (who also own the Hideaway). The nine-room property was 
refurbished (by Lance O’Donnell of Ace fame) and reopened in 2001. Kevin and 
Jinny are at the hotel most weekends and can often be found at the daily 
complimentary Orbitini cocktail hour at the hotel’s Boomerang Bar. A perfect 
Palm Springs getaway.

For a bit of a break from mid-century modernist literalism, a stay at Palm 
Springs’ oldest hotel, the Casa Cody, is recommended. Founded in the 1920s by 
Harriet Cody, a cousin to Buffalo Bill, the sprawling 29-room property (more 
urban village than hotel) spans the recent history of Palm Springs. It 
inherited some of its casitas from the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics and housed the 
US military during the second world war – in training for the North African 
campaign. Charlie Chaplin kept a little house here and Julius Shulman used to 
enjoy strolling the amazing grounds and gardens that are dripping with 
flowering shrubs and lemon trees. Most rooms have fireplaces and kitchenettes, 
and there are two swimming pools to choose from; it’s also minutes away fromLe 
Vallauris <http://www.levallauris.com/>, Palm Springs’ best French restaurant.

In uptown Palm Springs – once a movie star playground and now trendy again 
with the design crowd – the Rendezvous continues to delight. Originally built 
in the 1930s as the Mira Loma, and most recently updated in 2008, it’s now 
firmly situated in a 1950s era aesthetic complete with pink and turquoise 
colour scheme and mid-century diner style tables and chairs in the communal 
dining room. A tiled mid-century Bermuda-style roof flanks a courtyard and 
covers 10 retro-themed rooms, including Marilyn Monroe’s favourite, Pretty in 
Pink. Movie-star pedigree aside, lately it’s become famous for its foodie 
flare. Three course breakfasts and a cocktail hour with appies and freshly 
baked goodies in the evenings make this a delicious destination.

Designed by Albert Frey, who studied under Le Corbusier, the 1938 hotel is 
possibly the best example of preservation meets affordable luxury that Palm 
Springs has to offer. Benefiting from a 2008 refresh that saw new finishings 
and furniture in the 16-room property, this hotel carries a considerable 
history and wears it well. The perfectly preserved late 30s Sinatra Suite – one 
of the poolside two-storey townhomes where the crooner stayed while his own 
house was being built on nearby Alejo Drive, also hosted Jim Morrison in the 
late 1960s, who famously dived from the top floor balcony into the seven-foot 
deep pool. Complimentary breakfast, happy hour and an in-hotel spa complete the 
magic.

When Jesse Rhodes, the hotelier responsible for the restoration of San Diego’s 
Hotel del Coronado, found the once fabulous 1955 Skylark, it was in a sorry 
state. An hour away from Warner Brothers’ Studios, the one time playground of 
the stars was a run down flophouse. After a painstaking renovation that saw 
most of the interiors gutted, it was restored to its mid-century glory last 
year – right down to the Danish teak furniture in the rooms and the original 
9ft-deep swimming pool. The 29-room property with mountain views has a young, 
friendly vibe, complete with pool parties and DJs on the weekend, but makes for 
a quiet mid-week getaway. Proximity to the uptown design district is a plus.

Just across the street from the Ace, this 1951 original was designed by 
Herbert Burns (in between work on the Hideaway and the Orbit In). The 11-room 
adults-only boutique hotel has an intimate, friendly feel that makes it popular 
with honeymooning couples and family reunions alike. Communal amenities such as 
a shared kitchen (in addition to individual kitchenettes in each room), an 
outdoor gas double grill, as well as free laundry and bike rooms add to the 
sociable atmosphere. A 2007 refresh saw the kitchens replaced, but the 
mid-century interiors preserved. Details such as the floating wall clocks with 
handmade stainless steel digits designed by Burns himself lend a period feel. 
All day fresh fruit baskets and coffee are on offer, with grocery shops half a 
mile away, and a free vehicle for evening use.
