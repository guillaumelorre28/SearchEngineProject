Britain’s sporting elite has been rewarded in a New Year honours list 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/new-year-honours-list> in which Rio Olympic 
medallists Andy Murray and Mo Farah are made knights and Katherine Grainger and 
Jessica Ennis-Hill become dames.

Olympians and Paralympians make up 10% of the 2017 list, which also includes 
knighthoods for Kinks frontman Ray Davies, 72, comedian Ken Dodd, 89, actor 
Mark Rylance, 56, and a damehood for actor Patricia Routledge, 87.


Murray’s honour caps a remarkable year for the Scot, who claimed a second 
Wimbledon title,

 from Novak Djokovic in an extraordinary run of form. Aged 29, he is among the 
youngest to be awarded a knighthood in modern times and had once said he felt 
too young for such an accolade.

 Mo Farah, 33, said of his knighthood: “I am so happy to be awarded this 
incredible honour from the country that has been my home since I moved here at 
the age of eight. Looking back at the boy who arrived here from Somalia, not 
speaking any English, I could never have imagined where I would be today – it 
is a dream come true.”

Among the 1,197 people honoured, Anna Wintour, 67, editor-in-chief of US Vogue 
becomes a dame in the diplomatic and overseas list for services to fashion and 
journalism. Designer and former pop singer Victoria Beckham, 42, receives an 
OBE for services to the fashion industry, matching the honour given to her 
husband, David, 13 years ago.

ethnic (BAME) background recipients, who make up 9.3% of the successful 
candidates. Awards include a damehood for nursing pioneer Prof Elizabeth 
Anionwu, and a knighthood for Cambridge chemist and DNA expert Prof Shankar 
Balasubramanian.

The honours list is put together by nine independent committees set up by the 
Cabinet Office, and this year there are equal numbers of male and female 
recipients. A small number of honours are in the Queen’s personal gift, and 
included a knighthood for adventurer David Hempleman-Adams, 60, who said he was 
astonished to be made a knight commander of the Victorian order in recognition 
of his services to the Duke of Edinburgh’s award scheme.

In recognising Britain’s historic success at the summer Olympics, sporting 
stars were honoured not just for sporting excellence, but also for their 
contribution to giving back to their sport or community, the length of their 
career achievement and any previous honours.

Glasgow-born Grainger, 41, the first female Olympian to win five medals at 
five games, becomes a dame for services to rowing and charity, said it was 
“such a lovely honour to get”.


 “What is lovely when you hear the titles and the names of the New Year 
honours list, if anything it makes you feel you have to step up again. It is 
something to live up to – it is almost like a new standard,” she said.

“The honour is for sport, but also for charity, and I think that it is lovely 
that a lot of athletes have been able to give a lot back, and it is some of the 
areas I will probably go into when I move into other worlds and be able to do 
more charity work”.

Heptathlete Ennis-Hill, 30, who like Grainger is now a dame and has also now 
retired from competitive sport, added silver at the 2016 games to her gold in 
London, and was already a CBE. Highly decorated Paralympic equestrian Lee 
Pearson, who already had the MBE, OBE and CBE for services to equestrianism and 
to disabled sport, is knighted.

Max Whitlock, 23, from Basildon, who won double gymnastics gold at Rio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/max-whitlock-profile-olympic-gold-gymnastics-rio-2016>
, said receiving an MBE was “an amazing feeling”. “It looks pretty cool to see 
my name with an MBE on the end of it. I’m very proud, and it gives me a lot of 
motivation.” Whitlock, who is getting married in 2017, added: “As an athlete I 
never expected to receive it and to be recognised is amazing”.

Para-swimmer Ellie Robinson, 15, who took both gold and bronze at Rio, said 
she hoped to inspire others asEllie Simmonds 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/ellie-simmonds-british-swimmers-paralympic-gold>
 had inspired her. Of her MBE she said: “If a 15-year-old with a disability can 
do it then anyone can do it. They have so much diversity in the awards now, and 
it just keeps getting better every year.”

, receives a knighthood. He described the honour as a “salute” to the 
Hillsborough families. “It is a great honour but it is obviously tinged with 
sadness because of the enduring sense of loss the families have,” he said.


Acclaimed photojournalist and war photographer Donald McCullin, 81, who worked 
on the Observer and the Sunday Times, said he felt “inwardly warmed” by his 
knighthood. Northumbria’s police and crime commissioner, Vera Baird QC, is made 
a dame for services to women and equality. Justine Roberts, co-founder and CEO 
of Mumsnet, is made a CBE.

The prime minister, Theresa May, is setting new priorities for future honours 
lists. She wants particular focus on services and work with children and young 
people, and those who have encouraged social mobility. She also wants emphasis 
on those who work against all forms of discrimination and for the list to 
reflect the merits and achievements of people from all walks and parts of the 
United Kingdom.


Television presenter and cancer campaigner Lynn Faulds Wood, 68, former face 
of BBC’s Watchdog programme, said she had turned down an MBE, believing the 
honours system to be unfair, and calling for it to be overhauled to “drag the 
country into the 21st century”.

She said she did not know who put her name forward for her work in consumer 
safety, but she felt she would have been a hypocrite to accept it. She objected 
to the word “empire” on the end of it, and “just wouldn’t accept it while we 
still have party donors donating huge amounts of money and getting an honour”.
