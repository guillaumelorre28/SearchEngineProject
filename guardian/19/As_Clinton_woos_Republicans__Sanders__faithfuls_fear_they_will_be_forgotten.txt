On a quiet, tree-lined street in this town with a population of just over 
1,000, a lone yard sign bearing the name ofBernie Sanders 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders> serves as a faint reminder 
of the Vermont senator’s grassroots movement.


It is the home of Missey Bower, a special education professional, who cast her 
vote for Sanders in thePennsylvania 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania> Democratic primary and 
helped the senator carry the working-class Wyoming County in which her modest, 
one-storey home sits across from a public library.

But it was Hillary Clinton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton> who claimed victory in 
the state and ultimately the contest for the Democratic party’s presidential 
nomination. And Bower is precisely the kind of voter Clinton must still 
persuade in her favor with 81 days remaining until election day.

Hours after the former secretary of state rallied with Joe Biden in 
neighboring Scranton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/joe-biden-hillary-clinton-campaigns-rebukes-donald-trump>
, the vice-president’s hometown where Clinton also has roots, Bower said she is 
watching closely as the Democratic nominee campaigns on a progressive agenda 
while simultaneously making direct overtures to the Republicans and 
center-right independents who cannot fathom voting for Donald Trump.

Her concern, like many Sanders supporters, is whether his radical platform 
taking on Wall Street and corporate interests, and offering free college 
tuition, will be discarded as she courtsRepublicans 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans>.

Bower is “terrified” of a Trump presidency but voiced concerns with Clinton’s 
balancing act.

“I think she’s saying what she needs to say to pull people from Trump, which 
is a good thing,” she said, “but I don’t know when she’s being sincere and when 
she’s just doing what she needs to in order to get elected.

“I just feel like she’s been in the system for so long, how could she not be 
part of the system?”

Her campaign has trumpeted endorsements from prominent Republicans, including 
national security officials and prolific donors. Appearing on behalf of his 
wife last week, Bill Clinton fielded a question on how she could be trusted by 
citing her support from former aides to George W Bush and Ronald Reagan.

The rationale is clear: given Trump’s erratic behavior and history of 
offensive rhetoric toward minorities and women, the election is much broader 
than a choice of policies. As framed by Clinton’s campaign, it is a battle for 
the principles upon which America was founded, in which the question facing 
voters is whether they would hand the Oval Office to a candidate deemed by 
members of his own party as fundamentally unfit to lead the nation.

It was precisely this message that Biden and Clinton brought with them to a 
sports facility in Scranton this week, with the vice-president telling more 
than 3,000 supporters Trump was “totally, thoroughly unqualified” to assume the 
role of commander-in-chief.

Down the road, at a local coffee shop often frequented by Sanders supporters, 
a pair of young voters debated whether the anti-Trump missive was enough for 
them to cast their ballots for Clinton.

“One of my issues is she tries to appeal to both left and right at the same 
time, and that’s difficult because it’s so polarized right now,” said Anna 
Salerno, a 20-year-old native of Scranton who attends college in New York.

Seated across from her was Willie Demyan, a 21-year-old college graduate who 
characterized Clinton as embracing “more of a political strategy” that left him 
questioning whether she was committed to a liberal platform.

“That’s what I liked about Bernie, he might seem monotonous,” he said, before 
Salerno completed the sentence for him: “But you knew he wasn’t going to waver 
on it.”

Salerno nonetheless said she planned to vote for Clinton to shut Trump out of 
the White House, while Demyan had yet to be convinced.

While laying out her agenda at the Democratic national convention in 
Philadelphia last month, Clinton vowed to champion many of the issues injected 
into the race by Sanders and his progressive base of supporters.

Clinton: Trump’s campaign shakeup won’t change who he is 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/17/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-campaign-shakeup-video>
From campaign finance reform and raising the minimum wage to providing 
debt-free college and regulating Wall Street, the blueprint she provided while 
accepting the Democratic party’s nomination – and has carried with her to the 
stump – remains very much in line with promises made while tacking left in the 
primary.

If there is any movement toward the center, it appears to be less in substance 
than it is in tone. Trump, put simply by Clinton, is a threat to American 
democracy.

The argument is resonating, with Clinton opening up a double-digit lead in 
several key battleground states in recent weeks. In Pennsylvania, one new poll 
found her holding a 10-point advantage over Trump – undercutting the real 
estate mogul’s efforts to seek out a pathway to the presidency in America’s 
blue-collar rust belt.

Clinton nonetheless implored Democrats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats> at a voter registration event 
in west Philadelphia on Tuesday not to underestimate the stakes ahead.

“Don’t be complacent, my friends,” she warned. 

“Even though we’re doing fine right now, I’m not taking anybody, anywhere, for 
granted.”

Bowers, standing on her porch just in front of her Sanders yard sign, said she 
was monitoring the polls while weighing her own indecision.

“Donald Trump is taking us so far back. I would never, ever, ever support 
him,” she said.

“Right now, I feel like the most important thing is to keep Trump out.”

And even as some liberal groups are maintaining a watchful eye on the 
direction of her campaign, the majority of Sanders supporters have already 
shifted their allegiance to Clinton according to most polling.

On Tuesday, she also received the endorsement of the Working Families party, 
an organization dedicated to advancing progressive policy that previously 
backed Sanders. “The change we need next year starts with electing Secretary 
Clinton, but it doesn’t end there,” Dan Cantor, the group’s national director, 
said.

“We know we won’t always agree, and we’re ready to work hard to press her to 
deliver on the economic, environmental and racial justice promises she made 
during the campaign.”

Sean Cutkelvin, a college student working behind the counter at the Northern 
Lights coffee shop, where Sanders supporters often dwell, said he was confident 
Clinton would pursue progressive priorities. The 21-year-old, who voted for 
Sanders in the Pennsylvania primary, said friends had accused him of selling 
out when they learned he was now supporting Clinton.

“I told them there is no other candidate,” he said. “In the other party, 
there’s fear mongering, there’s hatred.

“There is no alternative. Not for me.”
