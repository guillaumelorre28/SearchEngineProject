Detained Australian Sally Faulkner 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/sally-faulkner> gave away the location of 
her Lebanese safe house when she called her estranged husband to assure him 
their children – only hours ago snatched from a south Beirut street – were safe 
and in her care, a judicial source says.


The call to Ali al-Amin was traced by police who raided the safe house later 
that evening, arresting Faulkner, the journalist Tara Brown, and a television 
crew in the country to report on the “child recovery operation”.

investigator's form

Using the phone was just one more error in an alleged plot Lebanese 
authorities regard as amateurish, reckless and destined to fail, not least 
because Amin had access to his former partner’s Facebook and email accounts and 
followed the initial planning. “He knew what she was doing,” the judicial 
source said.

It might all have been unnecessary, too: Faulkner’s defence lawyer believes an 
Australian court order granting custody to the mother was potentially 
enforceable under Lebanese law.

The operation: ‘Did he think he was Superman?’

The Guardian can reveal new details of the bungled operation to allegedly 
reunite Lahela al-Amin, five, and her three-year-old brother Noah, with their 
Brisbane-based mother. Faulkner had not seen the children since May 2015, when 
their father took them toLebanon <https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon> 
for a holiday and never returned.


The source said investigators believed it was Channel Nine 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel-nine> that introduced Faulkner to 
Adam Whittington, the former Scotland Yard detective turned “child recovery 
agent” who led the operation. Nine covered his $A115,000 fee, the source said.

Whittington arrived in Lebanon by yacht from Cyprus, docking at the Movenpick 
hotel on the Beirut waterfront, apparently telling authorities he and his crew 
– a British-Cypriot named Craig Robert Michael and Romanian accomplice still at 
large – had become lost at sea.

It was aboard the yacht that police arrested the former Australian soldier 
hours after the foiled kidnapping. It is still docked at the hotel, impounded 
and under armed guard.

Faulkner and the media team had meanwhile entered via Beirut’s airport, where 
ithas been reported 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3534938/Channel-Nine-launches-investigation-s-blame-60-Minutes-involvement-bungled-Beirut-abduction.html>
 they were identified by security officials, who tipped off Amin.

On Lebanese soil, Whittington met with and hired two muscular locals, Mohammad 
Hamza and Khaled Barbour, who he tasked with actually grabbing the children as 
they waited at a bus stop with their grandmother and nanny, the source said.

Sometime before his arrest, Whittington also tried to cover his tracks, 
deleting emails from his phone detailing the operation. They were easily 
recovered by Lebanese police.

“He thought he was being smart by deleting the emails, thinking they were gone 
just because he erased them,” another source familiar with the investigation 
said.

Lebanese authorities are said to regard the former Australian soldier, who was 
arrested in Singapore under similar circumstances two years ago, with scorn.

“[He] was asked during the investigation if he thought he was Superman or 
Spiderman or something,” said the judicial source.

On Wednesday Whittington and eight others, including Faulkner, were charged 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/12/suspects-in-alleged-beirut-kidnapping-face-jail-and-hard-labour>
 with armed abduction, purveying threats and physical harm, accusations that 
carry sentences of between seven and 20 years.

The custody dispute: ‘She was the victim ... then he ended up being the victim’

Hours before her arrest, briefly reunited with her children, Faulkner called 
her Lebanese defence lawyer, Ghassan Moghabghab.

The attorney, who had been acting for Faulkner prior to the abduction, told 
the Guardian he had been advising the 29-year-old to pursue custody of her 
children through the Lebanese courts.

He was not aware she had been allegedly approached by Channel Nine to engage 
Whittington’s services until that evening, when she told him she was in 
Lebanon, and in danger.

“She sent me a message on Whatsapp saying I’m in Lebanon and the kids are with 
me, and I said ‘How? What?’” he said.

Moghabghab said he advised her to contact the Australian embassy, who 
reportedly told Faulkner to call back at 8.30am the next morning – by which 
time she was in custody.

The attorney said Faulkner had obtained legal custody of the children in 
Australia, whereas her husband had a Shia religious court’s ordering granting 
him the same rights in Lebanon.

Faulkner, he said, could have attempted to have her order enforced in Lebanon 
– in such a case, precedence would be given to which court order was issued 
first, or based on the nationality of the children, who have Australian 
passports.

Moghabghab said on Thursday that a reconciliation deal was now being 
negotiated that could see Faulkner out on bail as early as Monday.

“It is hopefully to be reached,” he said. “I want to thank the judge who 
pushed in that direction, as his thinking was to understand the suffering of 
the father and the mother.”

“[The father] is accepting of an agreement, and he is definitely in a position 
of strength,” he added. “He doesn’t want to harm her, at least outwardly, but 
he’s benefiting. She gave him a golden opportunity.”

As well as allowing the Brisbane woman to travel between Australia and Lebanon 
for trial dates, a reconciliation agreement could also see a reduced sentence 
if she is found guilty, judicial sources say.

The agreement would also allow Faulkner to visit her children but would leave 
custody in the hands of their father, while giving the children the option of 
deciding, once they reach a certain age, with which parent they want to live.

“In the current situation, [Amin] can say that he wants to keep the children 
with him and she is forced to accept it because she made a mistake,” Moghabghab 
said.

“She was the victim at first, and he ended up being the victim.

“She’s definitely regretting being a part of this story,” he said.

Faulkner, who has a three-month old baby in Australia with her new partner, 
told News Corp 
<http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/60-minutes-sally-faulkner-speaks-from-her-cell-for-first-time/news-story/8fb746290f0712869b2e453cc538d805>
 from the visitor’s room of the Baabda Women’s Jail on Thursday she was “fine”.

“Please tell my mum and dad how well I am and also [her partner] Brendan and 
my in-laws,” she said.

“I would leave Beirut in a heartbeat, but events have to follow their course.”

In Faulkner’s favour at any trial would be a stipulation in the Lebanese 
criminal code that allows courts to take into account the laws in the home 
country of an accused foreigner.

“Child recovery” operations are legal in Australia, Faulkner has legal custody 
of the children, and parental abduction is not a recognised crime under 
Lebanese law; all of which could allow Moghabghab to argue his client committed 
no crime.

“These issues should be taken into account if we get to a trial,” he said. “At 
that point we will use everything to reduce the sentence.”

The TV crew: ‘Child stealing? Is that what we do now?’

Prospects are less hopeful for Faulkner’s cellmate, the award-winning 
Australian journalist Tara Brown, and the Nine Network crew, Benjamin 
Williamson, David Ballment and Stephen Rice. The judicial source said they were 
unlikely to benefit from any deal between Faulkner and Amin.

An Australian diplomatic mission has been in regular contact with them and 
also Faulkner, meeting every day for around an hour, “reassuring them and 
addressing their needs, which improves their morale,” Moghabghab said.

In Sydney, the families of the detained media team have reportedly confronted 
Nine Network bosses over who approved the operation in St Therese, one of 
Beirut’s more secure neighbourhoods.

“Since when is Channel Nine in the business of child stealing? Is that what we 
do now?” a wife of one of the crew members asked Nine’s chief executive, Hugh 
Marks,according to News Corp 
<http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/60-minutes-kidnap-charges-nines-despair-at-tv-crews-ordeal/news-story/847ee2ed1eed92fa535914efcf220136>
.

In a company-wide memo, Marks reportedly told staff: “There are lots of 
questions about how this happened. Questions we will get to the bottom of when 
everyone gets back. It is ­essential that we do whatever we can to help 
facilitate our crew’s fastest possible return to Australia.”

Nine has dispatched its head of news, Darren Wick, to Beirut, where he is 
meeting senior government and legal officials.

Wick has also met the detained Nine employees, who Marks said were “in good 
health, generally good spirits and being well treated by local officials”.

“Our fixer on the ground is doing a great job and we have organised food, 
books and other comforts and necessities,” he said.

The network has refused to comment on allegations it paid Whittington to 
abduct Faulkner’s children or that the news program 60 Minutes introduced 
Whittington to the desperate mother.

Earlier this week the Lebanese foreign minister, Gebran Bassil, met 
Australia’s ambassador to Lebanon, Glenn Miles, and said a joint committee was 
being formed to resolve the custody of the children.

“Australians should respect Lebanese laws and the Lebanese should respect 
Australian laws,” Bassil said after the meeting.

He hoped the incident “would not have an impact on Lebanese-Australian 
relations”.

The case will resume in Beirut on Monday.
