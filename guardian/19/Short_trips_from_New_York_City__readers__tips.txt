WINNING TIP: Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania 

A few hours by bus (from Penn station) or car is Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley. 
Rugged, verdant hills and a river of gentle tranquillity hide an impressive 
industrial past. There’s the town named after athlete Jim Thorpe, a splendid 
museum in one of the great small stately homes of America (Trout Hall in 
Allentown <http://www.lehighvalleyheritagemuseum.org/HistoricSites.htm>), 
excellent food and boutique B&Bs. It’s spectacular in summer and winter, and 
hiking, biking and canoeing are all readily available.

From NYC drive up the Westside highway, cross the Tappan Zee bridge and head 
north to West Point military academy. It’s a beautiful drive of about an hour. 
The views of the Hudson river are breathtaking and West Point is a lovely 
typical Upstate NY town. On the way back, cross the Hudson near West Point on 
the Bear Mountain bridge and take the river road back to NYC, Route 202. You 
will go through many small villages, especially Croton-on-Hudson. All of this 
area has a wonderful history, including the story of Rip Van Winkle.

Breakneck Ridge Trailhead is an hour by train from Grand Central Station on 
the Metro North line. The hike begins at river level and ascends some 1,500 
feet, a mad scramble over big rocks with an incredible view of the Hudson 
Valley. Trains from NYC run only at weekends, and there aren’t many. To save a 
long wait for the 4pm return train from Breakneck Ridge station, walk south a 
few more miles. You end up at the town of Cold Spring (maps available at trail 
start), where there are loads of places to eat and hourly trains back to NYC.

Kate’s Lazy Meadow motel is your spiritual home if you love mid-century 
modern, atomic-themed lamps and place names that could be straight from Mark 
Twain. Owned by Kate Pierson of punk band the B-52s and close to Woodstock in 
the Catskills, this is where lovers of psycho rock come to hook trout, ride the 
river or pose with a perfect martini. There’s the Lazy Shack with its own 
babbling brook on top of a mountain road and a Lazy Lodge with its own streamed 
music – of water from the river and falls nearby. Come night time, switch on 
those atomic lamps and watch bubbles of light swirl around the room, glinting 
off walls scented with cedar and pine.

 Warren Street townhouses in Hudson. Photograph: Alamy 
Take a train from Penn Station and two hours later, up the wide Hudson river, 
you reach the funky town of Hudson. There are glimpses of the out-of-town 
mansions of the rich and famous, and stylishly restored Warren Street is lined 
with antique shops, specialist food and wine emporiums, restaurants, bars and 
not a high-street name in sight. There’s even a theatre. And don’t miss the
Spotty Dog <http://www.thespottydog.com/>, a unique blend of real-ale bar and 
bookshop in a former brewery. This is where New Yorkers come to chill.

Hobofest, Lake Saranac, NY

The Saranac Hobofest takes place every year over Labor Day weekend (early 
September) in this mountain village about three hours’ drive north of NYC. 
Don’t let the name put you off. It’s a long weekend celebrating the 
independent, hobo-roving spirit of the US, with bands, poets and artists 
converging on this pretty lakeside town. All events are free and Manhattan’s 
finest often come out to check out the indie scene – making for a great vibe!

After a few days in the city you can feel like you need a trip to the beach. 
Within an hour you can be amid the tranquillity of the ocean and six miles of 
soft white sand at Jones Beach state park, on Long Island. With lots of free 
concerts during the summer months, you might find yourself dancing the night 
away to Latin music with the locals. And there are four miles of cycle paths, 
so you could hire a bike for a trip along the coast.

About 90 miles north of NYC in the glorious Hudson valley is Hyde Park, former 
home of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. The house and grounds are maintained by 
the US National Parks Service, and the displays and explanations are very 
interesting and informative. You could go for a day (easier by car, but train 
to Poughkeepsie and then taxi is a possibility), but I found a 
bed-and-breakfast almost immediately opposite and a brew pub with great food 
nearby.
