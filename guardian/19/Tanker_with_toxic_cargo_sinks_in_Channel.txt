The Italian tanker carrying chemicals from the Fawley oil refinery in 
Hampshire sank in the Channel off the island of Alderney yesterday - 24 hours 
after sending out distress signals during Monday's gales.

The Levoli Sun's crew of 14 had been winched to safety by helicopter crews the 
previous night but while the 10-year-old ship was under tow to the port of 
Cherbourg she toppled over and sank.

There was astonishment and anger in France that the tanker had been allowed to 
sail from Southampton with a cargo of potentially dangerous chemicals when a 
severe storm was forecast. The tanker had been detained at the Dutch port of 
Moredijk on October 26 because officials were not happy with safety. But she 
was allowed to sail for Fawley to load with chemicals destined for Bar in 
Yugoslavia.

The tanker was carrying 6,000 tonnes of chemicals, including styrene - a 
flammable byproduct of petrol production used to make plastics. Other toxic 
products included isopropyl and methyl ethyl ketone.

Greenpeace warned that the chemicals could cause serious ecological problems 
if they leaked but Shell Chemicals, which chartered the ship, said the styrene 
on board would not damage the environment. In case of spillage, the styrene 
would float to the surface, evaporating in hours.

Boats were sent to survey the area for possible leaks. The French transport 
minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, visited the site, and President Chirac said he 
hoped the EU would quickly adopt French proposals for stricter maritime 
measures.

"This raises the question of the companies' responsibility," Mr Gayssot said. 
"We cannot accept that safety is sacrificed on the altar of profits."

The agriculture ministry is to help combating pollution.
