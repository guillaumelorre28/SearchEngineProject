theChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> manager sees the

Chelsea are interested in securing him on loan or on a permanent basis but are 
aware that they face a struggle to convince Swansea to part company with a 
striker who has scored six goals this season.

The 31-year-old Llorente joined Swansea from Sevilla last summer and the Welsh 
club’s new manager, Paul Clement, only has Borja Bastón – the club record 
signing who has scored only once in 12 games – and the 20-year-old Oliver 
McBurnie to lead the line and is highly unlikely to sanction a sale or a loan 
deal for Llorente unless another striker is signed.

Conte has Michy Batshuayi, who cost Chelsea £33.2m in the summer, available 
but has used him sparingly and, indeed, left him on the bench when Costa was 
suspended for the game against Bournemouth on Boxing Day, to play Eden Hazard 
up front. Chelsea won the game 3-0.

It is understood Chelsea would consider loaning out Batshuayi if they manage 
to sign Llorente.
