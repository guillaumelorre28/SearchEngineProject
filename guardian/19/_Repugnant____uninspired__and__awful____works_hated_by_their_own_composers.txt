Written as a favour to the inventor of the metronome, Johann Nepomuk Mälzel 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Nepomuk_Maelzel>, Beethoven’s dire but 
highly lucrative potboiler noisily celebrated the Battle of Vittoria in the 
Spanish war of liberation. This was the battle that elevated the British 
general Sir Arthur Wellesley to the title Duke of Wellington. Beethoven was 
well aware of its total lack of subtlety, but was nonetheless sensitive to its 
critics: “What I shit is better than anything you could ever think.”

Beethoven’s youthful Septet was a sensational hit with amateur musicians 
<http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/septet-e-flat-op-20-ludwig-van-beethoven>
 of the day and was rearranged for several different instrumental combinations. 
However, its cantankerous composer never forgave it for being more popular than 
some of his more serious works.

Wagner: Rienzi

Composed in the contemporary “grand opera” style before Wagner had fully 
forged his own groundbreaking musical language, Rienzi has been variously 
described as “Meyerbeer’s best opera” (Hans von Bülow), “Meyerbeer’s worst 
opera” (Charles Rosen) and “the greatest musical drama ever composed” (Gustav 
Mahler). Despite its continued success, Wagner later thought it “repugnant”.

Verdi: Alzira

Based on Voltaire’s tragedy Alzire ou Les Américains, Verdi’s opera Alzira is 
set in 16th-century Peru and concerns the fate of an Inca princess. A rare 
Verdi failure, the composer later called it “propria brutta” (really awful), 
though he was probably referring more to its libretto than its music.

Tchaikovsky: 1812 Overture

An heir to Wellington’s Victory, Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture marked the 70th 
anniversary of theBattle of Borodino 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/09/russia-anniversary-battle-borodino>
, when Russia inflicted a severe blow to Napoleon’s invading armies. To mark 
the occasion, Tchaikovsky was commissioned to write this “Overture Solennelle”, 
a piece full of patriotic themes. Tchaikovsky detested the work, claiming it 
“was written without any feeling of love and would therefore probably have 
little artistic merit”. Audiences have begged to differ.

Tchaikovsky: Mazeppa

First performed in 1884 in Moscow, Tchaikovsky’s bloodthirsty, Pushkin-based 
opera concerns Mazeppa’s plot against Peter the Great in 18th-century Ukraine. 
It contains some enjoyable music (try this spirited Cossack Dance 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Zts1OmN8M>), but its famously self-critical 
composer thought it uninspired.

Saint-Saëns: The Carnival of the Animals

Carnival of the Animals began in the exquisite form of the Swan 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F93GtiYmWlw> and ended up as a grand 
zoological fantasy taking in cockerels, elephants, kangaroos and an aquarium. 
Wary that his musical menagerie wouldn’t measure up to the dominant German 
aesthetic of its time, Saint-Saëns forbade it to be performed outside a close 
circle of friends. It was eventually published in 1922, the year after his 
death.

Elgar: Pomp and Circumstance March No 1

“I’ve a got a tune that will knock ’em – knock ’em flat,” wrote Elgar of the 
central melody of his first Pomp and Circumstance March. With words by AC 
Benson and a little tinkering to the tune, it soon became Land of Hope and 
Glory. While something of a cash-cow for Elgar, he came to tire of its jingoism 
and the fact it overshadowed everything else he wrote.

Ravel: Boléro

Its audaciously repetitive nature means that Boléro has always had its 
critics. At its premiere in 1928 there were shouts of “Rubbish!’, whileConstant 
Lambert opined <https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Constant_Lambert>: “There is a 
definite limit to the length of time a composer can go on writing in one dance 
rhythm (this limit is obviously reached by Ravel towards the end of La valse 
and towards the beginning of Boléro).” Such sniping aside, this 15-minute 
crescendo was an instant success and soon became Ravel’s most popular piece. 
Which amazed the composer, who didn’t much like the work and was surprised 
orchestras were prepared to play it.

Shostakovich: Song of the Forest

After the infamous Zhdanov Decree in 1947 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhdanov_Doctrine>, when Shostakovich and other 
creative artists were denounced for their apparent “formalist perversions and 
undemocratic tendencies”, the composer played it safe – publicly at least – by 
producing ideologically correct works with obvious social purpose. One such 
work was his seven-movement oratorio, Song of the Forest, a piece that 
celebrated the forestation of the Russian Steppes after the second world war. 
In its original version, Stalin was lauded as “the great gardener”. 
Shostakovich hated this hastily written work. After its premiere he returned to 
his hotel room and wept.
