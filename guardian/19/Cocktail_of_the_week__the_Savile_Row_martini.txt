This martini, from the new cocktail list at Sartoria in London 
<http://www.sartoria-restaurant.co.uk>, reflects the timeless style of the 
restaurant’s Savile Row home. Rosolio is an old, rose-based aperitivo that’s 
enjoying a bit of a revival – it’s not easy to find, butwhiskyexchange.com 
<https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com> has Italicus’ gorgeous, bergamot-flavoured 
version. Serves one.

50ml Italicus rosolio 
<https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/34609/italicus-rosolio-di-bergamotto>
25ml sherry (I use Tio Pepe)
5ml Luxardo Bitter Bianco 
<http://www.luxardo.it/products/liqueurs/herbal-liqueurs/bitter-bianco.html>
3 dashes orange bitters

Stir everything in a mixing glass with an ice cube, and serve straight up in a 
chilled martini glass. I garnish mine with a pickled radish, but that’s up to 
you.Salute!
