Cardiff may be talked-up as one of the UK’s fastest growing cities 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-30847525> with a global outlook in film and 
TV (the BBC and Pinewood have large bases here), but locals extol Cardiff’s 
sense of camaraderie. Grassroots cultural activity is increasing but often with 
assistance from established arts centres, such as the excellentChapter 
<http://www.chapter.org/>.

“It’s collegiate,” says Kate Wasserberg, artistic director at pub theatre, the 
Other Room <http://www.otherroomtheatre.com/en/>. “There wasn’t an organisation 
in Wales that didn’t lend us something.”

That mutual assistance is particularly important for Cardiff’s music scene, 
which, critics argue, gets little political support. In recent years, the city 
has lost several venues, including the Coal Exchange and the Point, due to a 
familiar mixture of noise complaints, business pressures and redevelopment. The 
1,000-capacityTramshed <http://tramshedcardiff.com/> is a new addition but, 
says John Rostron, creator ofSŵn festival <http://swnfest.com/> (October 21 – 
23), music is still undervalued locally. There is certainly no shortage of 
musical talent or energy. Beyond cult Cardiff exports such as Gwenno and Joanna 
Gruesome, taste-makers flag-up a raft of emerging acts: Junior Bill’s 
indie-ska; singer-songwriter Dan Bettridge; experimental pop crackpots Islet; 
Darkhouse Family and their adventures in bass music. Such creativity is 
supported by a network of small labels (Bubblewrap, Jealous Lovers Club, Flower 
of Phong), festivals such as HUB and Shape Records’ From Now On, and a host of 
DIY promoters from club outfitsBlue Honey 
<https://www.facebook.com/bluehoneycardiff> and City Bass to the Joy 
Collective, which pushes queer/feminist punk and experimental music.

The Joy Collective <http://thejoycollective.co.uk/> is part of a group 
currently fundraising to open a DIY gig and art space, Hotel de Marl. “If we 
band together we can make something tangible,” says member Claire Vaughan. “The 
city keeps growing and big business threatens spaces that two years ago would 
have been affordable.”

That pressure may explain why so much of the best stuff in indie food and 
drink is happening not in the city centre, but out in the suburbs of Canton or 
studenty Cathays. Seek and ye shall find Cardiff’s tight-knit, buoyant 
underground.

Around narrow Womanby Street several pubs and venues trade in the 
complementary palliatives of craft beer and live music. In fact, the Moon (a 
gig space above the equally music-ledFull Moon pub 
<http://www.thefullmooncardiff.com/>), is currently accommodating Waen Brewery’s
Gravity Station bar <http://thegravitystation.com/cardiff/> in its loft. 
Otherwise, says John Rostron, expect raucous gigs in “a black box that, as 
things tend to be at that level, is done more with love than money.”

With a few honourable, relatively upmarket exceptions, such as Bar 44 
<https://www.bar44.co.uk/cardiff> and the Potted Pig 
<http://www.thepottedpig.com/>, discovering the best independent food in 
Cardiff requires a bit of effort. You need to venture into the city’s suburbs 
or seek out special events such as theStreet Food Circus 
<http://streetfoodcircus.co.uk/> and Depot. The former is a multifaceted pop-up 
night market in Bute Park (until end September, Thu–Sun), whileDepot’s Street 
Food Social <http://depotcardiff.com/#_upcoming-events> is a smaller, weekly 
Saturday night shindig, where visitors can eat from five traders with added 
ping-pong and DJs (Construction House, Dumballs Road, 5– 11pm). At both, look 
out forBrother Thai <https://twitter.com/brothaicardiff>, Slow Pig

Such is the demand for Dusty Knuckle’s wood-fired pizzas that no sooner had it

This drinking den works hard to create distinctive cocktails and retain its 
air of mystery. “You book online and arrive at an unmarked door – it looks like 
there’s nothing there,” says the Other Room’s Kate Wasserberg. “Ring the bell

cavern. It’s ridiculously glamorous.”

tap-takeovers and events.”

Located within Porter’s bar, this tiny, intense 47-seat pub theatre is a 
fully-functioning producing house which curates, facilitates, mentors and 
programmes original work from both new and established writers and fringe 
theatre companies. “It’s innovative and Porter’s always has a good vibe,” says 
Rack.

G39

As a concept, G39 is almost 20 years old, but this artist-run warehouse 
gallery has clearly retained its appetite for mischief and challenging work. It 
is currently home to Carl Slater’s multi-faceted installation Miss America’s 
Trip to Technoland, which explores religion, rave culture and mind-melting 
transcendence. Running simultaneously, Does That Include Us? is a programme 
examining issues around disability in the arts. For more contemporary Welsh 
art, visitgallery/ten <http://gallery-ten.co.uk/gallery/home.html>, which 
concentrates on painting, print and sculpture.

This annual festival sees Roath, an area just outside the city centre, come 
alive with art. You will find poetry and public interventions, dance and video 
installations happening in unusual settings. “It animates the whole area,” says

Trading in an explosive amalgam of live art, dance and theatre, Mr & Mrs Clark 
can frequently be seen performing their often politically-charged pieces in 
Cardiff. “Their work, Smash It Up, was a direct response to the destruction of 
Newport’s Chartist mural,” explains Alice Burrows from Chapter (which is 
currently showing the exhibition,Sticky Intimacy 
<https://www.facebook.com/events/961786850586105/>). She describes the duo as 
“two of the most interesting, liberating, generous performers I’ve seen in 
Cardiff.”
