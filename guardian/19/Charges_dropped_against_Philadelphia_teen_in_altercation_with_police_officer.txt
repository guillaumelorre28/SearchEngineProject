Charges have been dropped against a Philadelphia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia> teenager after a viral video 
showed a police officer pummeling her as she lay on the street.

The Internal Affairs Unit is investigating the incident, which took place on 
Monday at around 2.45pm after police were called to a brawl of around 30 
people, involving adults and teenagers, in Kingsessing, Philadelphia.

leave the scene. Pendletonlater said

 she was trying to help her friend’s mother who was being detained.


A police statement claims both the officer and teenager recalled that 
Pendleton slapped the officer in the face and knocked her glasses off, breaking 
them.

The officer then grabbed Pendleton by the hair and pulled her to the ground to 
restrain her, according to the police statement.

“It went from there. She was dragging me by my hair, banging my head on the 
ground, on the car, punching me, sat on top of me and was punching me in my 
face,” said Pendletonin an interview with ABC 6

Footage recorded once the teenager is on the ground shows the officer 
repeatedly punching at Pendleton, while the teenager hits back at the officer.

“It’s just an ugly situation from start to finish,” Philadelphia police 
commissioner Richard Rosstold ABC 6

. “There’s no denying that.”

The officer had bruising around her eye and cheek and Pendleton was sent to 
the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia after neck pain complaints.

The teen was charged with assault on police, disorderly conduct and related 
charges but on Tuesday afternoon the district attorney decided not to pursue 
them.

Police said the Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident and 
staff involved and the office will remain off street duties until the 
investigation is complete.

“I am happy that it was caught on video because if it wasn’t I would have been 
charged and I would’ve been in a youth study center or something,” Pendletonsaid
