WINNING TIP: Strandperle beach bar, Hamburg


A pearl on the beach! That’s Strandperle, a beach bar in the wonderful port 
city of Hamburg. Set on the banks of the river Elbe, it’s a fantastic place to 
sit back in a deckchair and watch huge cruise liners and container ships pass 
by. It’s where the locals hang out and you can easily spend the whole day 
relaxing … or even propose, as I once did! Part of the fun is the journey to 
the bar. Go the Landungsbrucken in the harbour and take the 62 ferry to 
Ovelgonne and then walk along the sandy shores of the Elbe. Strandperle offers 
a good range of cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks such as FritzCola (made in 
Hamburg) or Bionade. The locals will probably be drinking a cool Astra beer 
from a special Standperle glass. Food ranges from light snacks to full meals at 
reasonable prices (about €15). I’d recommend currywurst or fish rolls.

 Brauhaus Webster, Duisburg 
A great brauhaus in the heart of Duisburg, they brew their own beer – blond 
(Pils) and braun (Alt) – on the premises, which go well with the amazing food 
on offer from the varied menu (I recommend the Holstein schnitzel). The 
original copper brew kettles are in the middle of the bar, and the newer, 
modern vats are available to see downstairs. There is a lovely atmosphere 
within the bar, great staff, superb food and beer that is as unique as this 
brauhaus. You can also buy the beer bottled to take home with you.

This beer hall and garden on Lake Jungfernsee is in a former dairy. The owner, 
Jurgen, will show you around the brewery before you settle in for the main 
attraction: enjoying the refreshing, fruity, light beers. Can you taste the 
difference between Dairy Summer Beer and Dairy Hell? Or try something usual: 
Radler with Fanta or Diesel with Coke. The beer garden, overlooking the lake, 
provides spectacular views and a hearty portion of German sausage with 
sauerkraut and mash will prevent hangovers. Oh, and don’t forget to buy some 
beers for the next day.

Opened at the start of June 2016, this new beer garden, formed from a series 
of sea containers, is an extension to the BRLO brewery which is also on site. 
It serves their four types of craft beers on draught and also a selection of 
freshly cooked food. It is in one of Berlin’s newer parks and is only a 
10-minute walk from Potsdamer Platz. For families with young kids there’s 
plenty to keep them busy while you enjoy a cold beer.

 Hotel Adlon Kempinski, Berlin 
When you’ve tired of the trendier drinking options in Berlin, settle yourself 
down in comfort in the bar of the famous Hotel Adlon Kempinski. Yes, drinks are 
on the pricey side, but waiters are welcoming and efficient, even if you are 
staying elsewhere, and the view of the Brandenburg Gate is wonderful, 
particularly in the evening when it is beautifully lit. Relax and think about 
some of the hotel’s famous visitors: Tsar Nicholas II, Josephine Baker, Marlene 
Dietrich, Albert Einstein and, notoriously, Michael Jackson.

This bar, near Kottbusser Tor in Kreuzberg, is a crazy experience, starting 
with the furniture stuck to the ceiling (the premises used to be a furniture 
store) and the fact it’s slap bang in the middle of a housing estate. Although 
gay, and at the scruffier/bearier end of the gay spectrum, it’s open to all. 
The floor-to-ceiling windows make it great for people watching even from 
outside, although it gets so busy you may end up squashed against them. The 
bar’s irreverence is contagious – when the smoking ban came in, they hosted a 
smoker’s party in a tent outside, before people soon went back to smoking 
inside anyway.

We spent a drizzly afternoon visiting the traditional pubs and brewhouses of 
this world heritage town in Bavaria. If you only have time to visit one, make 
it Schlenkerla, in Dominikanerstrasse. Authenticrauchbier (made from smoked 
malt tapped straight from the wooden barrel) is served in this atmospheric 
17th-century building in the shadow of Bamberg’s Romanesque cathedral. Drink it 
with a traditional Bavarian breakfast ofweisswurst (white pudding), pretzels 
and sweet mustard or an afternoon snack of the strangely-namedkaese mit musik. 
The soused onions served with the cheese explains the music that is produced 
later.

If you have ever wondered what the German concept gemütlichkeit means, the 
Weinstube Kachelofen in Stuttgart’s centre will sum it up for you. The interior 
is welcoming and cosy, you feel relaxed as soon as you enter. The traditional 
glazed stove (kachelofen) is the main feature of the room. The Weinstube is 
furnished in gingerbread-house style, with carved wooden chairs and lace 
tablecloths, but there is nothing kitsch about the breezy service and the 
delicious food and drink. Try aschwarzbier (black beer) or red trollinger wine 
withmaultaschensuppe (a soup with ravioli-type pasta) for €5 or käesespätzle 
(Swabian noodles with cheese) for €10.

In the old part of Cologne is an intimate and friendly bar, very atmospheric, 
playing live traditional jazz most nights. Sometimes the crowd spills out into 
the street in front due to its small size, but that just adds to the fun. Wood 
panelled inside, with lots of artifacts hanging on the walls and ceiling, such 
as trumpets, posters, pictures and dummies. Old game machines and automatic 
musical instruments from the 1920s are dotted around. Great beer, good food. 
Service also very good, waitresses serving drinks from traditional wooden trays 
strapped round their neck. It’s in the Buttermarkt, one street from the river.

Capri Bar, Bremen

Better known for its brewery and Grimm Brother’s Town Musicians than its bar 
scene, Bremen still has pockets of nightlife to offer the young bar-goer. 
Tucked a few streets behind the main drag of the trendy Steintor quarter, hides 
an unassuming patch of unusual watering-holes. Begin at theCapri Bar 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Capri-Bar/162360103777001>, with its cavernous 
walls and eye-wateringly cheap happy hour. While sipping cocktails inside a 
cave may be a bit kitsch for some, the sociable beer garden out the front 
offers the chance to hone your German or simply soak up the northern sun. Then 
just as the night seems all but over, venture a few doors down to the tiny (yet 
lively)Heartbreak Hotel 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Heartbreak-Hotel/393256284055513>. Inside the 
graffiti-laden walls is a DJ who will be playing even after the keenest of 
night owls has gone home.
