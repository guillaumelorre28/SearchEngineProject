Millennium Biltmore Hotel

Created by the same architectural firm (Schultze and Weaver) that went on to 
design New York’s Waldorf Astoria, the Biltmore (established in 1923) set the 
grand standard of west-coast hotel glamour for decades. Although refurbished, 
it still offers reliable transportation back to the days when it hosted the 
Oscars (on eight occasions between 1931 and 1942) and prepared the presidential 
suite for actual US presidents. The mashed-up Spanish-conquistador slash 
Roman-mythological design scheme is overblown, to say the least, extending from 
Crystal Ballroom to cavernous Gallery Bar.Black Dahlia 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dahlia> victim Elizabeth Short was 
reportedly seen in the lobby, in January 1947, shortly before she was murdered.

Noir novelist James Ellroy <https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesellroy> was 
born a couple of blocks from this landmark on the fringes of downtown in 1948, 
and it remains one of his favourite restaurants. The 24-hour steakhouse is 
modelled on a train car and has been animated for the best part of a century by 
movie deal-making, city politics and countless shades of subterfuge. Original 
owner Fred Cook was once an understudy to opera legend Enrico Caruso, and 
oversaw things with his wife Grace (aka Lovey) until his death in 1947. The 
place is still under the same family ownership. Mae West was a regular in the 
40s and only a short hop of the imagination is required to dial back the clock 
to the mid-20th century.

Few major Hollywood names have failed to make at least one appearance at 
Musso’s. And we’re not talking just the directors and actors (Chaplin, Bogart, 
Bacall, Monroe), either, but also the writers – who habitually used the excuse 
of its proximity to the long-shutteredStanley Rose Book Shop 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Rose> to slide in for a quick freshener 
or two. Raymond Chandler knew his way around the bar blindfolded, as did F 
Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner, back in the days when glamour, literary 
talent and heavyweight boozing were inseparable. The red-jacketed bartenders 
will recommend a martini in the classic style (with gin rather than vodka), 
while the furnishings glow with original noir-era authenticity.

Downtown Los Angeles has a spectacular concentration of golden age theatres 
and movie palaces, all of them generously dusted with throwback charm, but 
relatively few of them can be seen outside of special tours (arranged by 
organisations such as theLos Angeles Conservancy 
<https://www.laconservancy.org/>). One of the more accessible is the freshly 
restored and retro-fittedUnited Artists Theatre 
<http://www.acehotel.com/losangeles/theatre>, part of the Ace Hotel on 
Broadway. John Barrymore was master of ceremonies on opening night (Boxing Day, 
1927), the pipe organ departed in 1955 but the iridescent 3,000-mirror-disc 
dome remains. Check listings for movie screenings and gigs (includingPatti

Originally a neo-gothic lodge for the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, 
the Park Plaza Hotel near downtown LA has had its ups and downs: the pool was 
used for swimming events during the 1932 Olympics, and since the 60s it has 
been both a YMCA and a retirement hotel. It can currently be hired out for 
weddings, special events and movie shoots (includingBarton Fink 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101410/> and the retro-noir Gangster Squad 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321870/>) and has been well looked after in 
recent years. The best way to enjoy the venue’s glamour is tocheck local 
listings <http://www.latimes.com/>: in 2013, for example, it hosted the 
1940s-themed Golden Stag New Year’s Eve party.

Resplendent with its immaculate fusion of Dutch Colonial, Mission Revival and 
Streamline Moderne (late art deco) architecture, Union station, which opened 
1939, is more than just a transportation hub: it’s an instant passport across 
terracotta tile and travertine marble to a time when all men wore trilbys and 
female passengers were commonly attired in evening wear. Check out Yvonne de 
Carlo in the 1949 noir, Criss Cross. Also seen to great effect inUnion Station 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043090/> (1950, doubling as Chicago’s Union 
Station) andThe Narrow Margin <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044954/> (1952). 
The building – arguably the last great railway station in the US – has an 
excellent bar and restaurant, Traxx.

Tucked away in the residential heart of Koreatown, The Prince may sell itself 
as a brazenly overdressed Olde English theme restaurant specialising in deep 
fried chicken, but nothing can diminish the venue’s star turn as a location in 
Roman Polanski’s 1974 classic,Chinatown 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/chinatown>. Back then it was known as The 
Windsor, but looked no different, doubling as the long-gone Brown Derby where 
detective JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) meets client Evelyn Mulwray (Faye 
Dunaway). The mood of the movie soaks deep into every crimson booth, to which 
Dunaway matched her highly dangerous shade of lipstick. Sip on a signature 
lemon soju and dream up something nefarious.

There is a scene in the 1997 movie adaptation of James Ellroy’s LA Confidential
 <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119488/> in which crusading 50s cop Ed Exley 
(Guy Pearce) strides into a bar, mistakes movie star Lana Turner for a call 
girl, and gets a cocktail to the face for his wayward identification skills. 
That very bar – a West Hollywood landmark since 1925 when former owner Jimmy 
Bernstein, an ex-prizefighter, set up shop in a converted trolley car – remains 
just the way it appears in the movie: a low-lit, deep-red, A-list lush’s

Bogart, Ava Gardner, James Dean and mobster Bugsy Siegel, whose safe remains

Opened as a vaudeville house and movie palace in 1925, and still fronted by 
the 1940 addition of a 100ft-tall neon tower, the Alex offers a great excuse to 
head a little east of Hollywood, into Glendale, in search of prime golden age 
authenticity. A detour via Glendale railway station is recommended, as it’s 
pretty much unchanged since the prominent location’s appearance in the 1944-noir
Double Indemnity <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036775/>. Classic movie 
screenings are organised by the Alex Film Society – in July 2014 it put on a
