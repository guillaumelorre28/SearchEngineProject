One was a famously autocratic Tudor monarch, the other is the Conservative 
prime minister, but who is the more effective leader? We compare Henry VIII and 
Theresa May’s leadership styles.


1. Approach to Europe
Henry effected the original split with Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, ending rule by the church in 
Rome in order to secure a divorce from his wife. May will echo that break when 
she delivers the outcome of the referendum – taking the UK out of the EU – but 
hopefully without the excommunication and sectarian strife.

2. Treatment of enemies
May is a master of the icy public putdown disguised as a joke, with targets 
including the foreign secretary

, Boris Johnson, David Cameron’s former aide Craig Oliver andthe former 
chancellor George Osborne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/theresa-may-wears-hard-hat-spectator-politician-of-the-year>
. Henry preferred public executions.

3. Favourite sport
Jousting, real tennis, archery, double-axe fighting: Henry enjoyed all manner 
of combative Tudor pursuits

. May ismore of a hillwalker

, althoughshe does follow cricket closely 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/geoffrey-boycott-cricket-praises-theresa-may-brexit-integrity>
. While Henry enjoyed hunting deer, the prime minister has previously expressed 
support for repealing the foxhunting ban.

4. Christmas dinner
Popular history says Henry VIII was one of the first people to enjoy a turkey 
at Christmas, stuffed with other birds for a decadent royal feast. May has 
revealed sheprefers to cook a traditional goose 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/05/pms-christmas-poirot-goose-and-church-before-presents>
, saving the fat for roasting potatoes.

5. Clothing style
May has a bold fashion sense, including a penchant for leopard print shoes, 
and wore a£995 pair of gold leather trousers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/theresa-may-sidesteps-question-about-995-pound-leather-trousers>
 to an interview. Henry was more of acrimson and purple velvet ruler 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/19/henry-viii-hat-display-hampton-court>
, from his floppy hats to his ermine-fringed robes.
