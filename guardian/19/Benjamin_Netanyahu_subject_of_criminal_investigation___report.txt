Netanyahu and his family have been subject to a series of allegations over the 
past two decades. In 1997, it was decided that there was not enough evidence to 
charge him over the appointment of an attorney general, though prosecutors said 
they had a “tangible suspicion” about Netanyahu’s role in the scandal.

According to the New York Times, Netanyahu reacted by saying that he had 
“erred in the making of the selection, but I did not commit any crime”. He 
added: “As far as I am concerned, and I think as far as the majority of the 
public inIsrael <https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel> is concerned, this 
affair is behind us.”

There followed a series of allegations about the use of public funds in the 
Netanyahu household. Israeli police recommended in 2000 that Netanyahu – then 
between his stints as prime minister – be charged with corruption over claims 
he and his wife, Sara, benefited from more than £60,000 in state gifts.

The attorney general refused, however, saying there were “difficulties with 
the evidence”, which was not sufficient for a trial.

Netanyahu admitted this year that he had accepted thousands of euros from 
Arnaud Mimran

, who was later convicted of fraud and sentenced to eight years in prison.

And in May it was reported that Sara Netanyahu could face fraud charges over 
the management of the prime minister’s residence.

 The claims reportedly focused on whether the state was defrauded into paying 
for private expenses.

She and her husband’s office have denied any wrongdoing. It has been reported 
that prosecutors are still looking at the case.
