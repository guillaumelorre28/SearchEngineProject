Tuesday’s extension announcement came days after France marked the first 
anniversary of the jihadi attacks that left 130 people dead.

Hollande, who has the lowest popularity ratings of any post-war president, has 
said he will not decide until early December whether to seek re-election.

The election is currently forecast to end in a second-round runoff pitting a 
centre-right candidate – likely to be the former prime minister Alain Juppé – 
against the far-right Front National leader, Marine Le Pen.
