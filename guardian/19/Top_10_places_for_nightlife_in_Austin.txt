Dart Bowl

Take one step into Dart Bowl and you'll be met with the inimitable scent of a 
tried-and-true bowling alley, complete with greasy-spoon cuisine. Cheap 
entertainment, fast service and a variety of ways to pass the time make Dart 
Bowl a go-to spot for anyone with a short attention span. Between bowling 
games, have a go at Dart Bowl's version of laser tag: a laser-lit room that 
you'll be challenged to traverse à la Mission Impossible. Afterwards, go for 
the gold and order a plate of theirmuch blogged-about cheese enchiladas 
<http://www.fedmanwalking.com/content/i-can-eat-50-eggs-dart-bowl-cafe>, 
swimming in chili. They might not stack up to a five-star restaurant but, in 
the context of a bowling alley, they're pretty damn surprising.

lanes cost $18-$22 per hour, depending on the day/time. Open Sun-Thu 9am-11pm,

Alamo Drafthouse – The Ritz
 Photograph: Erich Schlegel/Corbis 
Tim League founded Austin's Alamo Drafthouse in 1997 as a single-screen 
theatre serving food, booze and a lot of attitude. Now with five outposts in 
Austin, the Ritz location stands out because of its home within a historical 
1929-built theatre that's ironically situated in the centre of infamous, 
beer-sodden 6th Street. Management are famous for warning moviegoers that 
they'll "kick your ass out" if you dare talk or text. All Drafthouses boast 
original, inventive programming such as Terror Tuesdays, Action Pack, Girlie 
Night and Fantastic Fest. So settle in for a Guinness Shake and a flick – and 
just remember to keep your trap shut.

Blue Starlite Mini Urban Drive-In
 Blue Starlite Mini Urban Drive-In, Austin, Texas 
This drive-in theatre welcomes guests in cars and on bikes. Founder Josh 
Frank's modern interpretation of an old-school tradition hits all of the 
important, classic marks, with concessions sold out of vintage trailers, 
carhops on rollerskates, and clip-on audio speakers. You shouldn't come here 
for booming surround sound or new releases, but you can anticipate a 
saccharinely sweet experience nodding to the simplicity of yesteryear. Perfect 
for a night out for families, couples and groups of friends, Frank rotates his 
screenings between classics and cult films.

always making a stop, Cap City is where you'll find high-calibre comedy in

First Thursdays

Once a month, the boutiques of South Congress Avenue keep their doors open 
after hours for this extra-large block party. Some businesses book bands, 
others serve drinks and many offer special sales. Friends and families stroll 
from Barton Springs Road south towards Elizabeth Street, popping in and out of 
interesting shops, and having a margarita or two along the way. On these 
evenings, street vendors and musicians proliferate the South Congress stretch, 
contributing to the laid-back community vibe. Once you've had your fill of 
walking, stop at any one of the renowned restaurants that line the Avenue for 
rejuvenation.
• S Congress Ave, firstthursday.info <http://www.firstthursday.info>. First 
Thursday of every month until 10pm (some later)

The Grand Social Club and Billiards Room

On an otherwise desolate stretch of Airport Boulevard, Austin boasts an 
expansive pool hall where you'll meet a mix of characters, depending on the 
theme of the night. The pool tables stretch as far as the eye can see beneath 
retro (of the non-ironic sort) recessed lighting. Monday's rock'n'roll DJ set 
brings out former metal kids turned 30-year-old hipsters who play alongside 
leather-jacket-wearing pool sharks, groups of friends and, in the earlier 
hours, families. The equipment is in good condition, but if pool isn't your 
thing, the bar is expansive enough to be frequented by people who simply want 
to kick back with friends. Expect few frills and very little pretension.

A highly revered arcade for both gaming newbs and experts, Pinballz is a 
13,000 sq ft space featuring more than 200 classic machines and video arcade 
games. You'll have to leave the comfort of downtown to get to Pinballz's North 
Austin location, but there's a point of diversion for even the most motley of 
crews fromskee-ball <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnWkN3KrOY> to whack-a-mole
 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0n8N98mpes> and Guitar Hero

Peter Pan Mini-Golf
 Photograph: Krotpong/flickr 
A giant Peter Pan and well-worn T-Rex statue have made this beloved mini-golf 
course an Austin landmark since 1946. It's a place that works just as well for 
a date as it does a family outing. The staff are laid-back and no one is going 
to rush you through your game, be it on the "hard" or "easy" course (there are, 
in fact, 36 holes). If a cold brewski tends to improve your shot, you're in 
luck – Peter Pan is another of Austin's famed BYOB establishments. With a 
closing time of midnight on weekends, you can spend the bulk of your evening 
beneath the stars before hopping across the street for a nightcap at the 
neighbouringBarton Springs Saloon <http://www.bartonspringssaloon.com>.

Ego's Karaoke

Serenading the boisterous crowd at Ego's 
<http://www.anightinaustin.com/bars/125106/egos-lounge> is not for the faint of 
heart. It's a hard-to-find joint, tucked within a nondescript office building's 
parking garage at the foot of South Congress. Without private rooms to shield 
singers from the embarrassment of missed notes and flubbed lyrics, Ego's divey 
and dark atmosphere is likely to encourage the emergence of never-before-seen 
alter-egos of its patrons. Liquid courage comes cheap and stout from friendly 
bartenders who have seen it all and, before you know it, you could be atop a 
table, leading the bar in a slurred rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody.

Austin Poetry Slam
 Austin Poetry Slam, Texas 
An institution for more than 15 years, the Austin Poetry Slam is home to some 
of the best poets on the slam poetry scene. Every Tuesday, 12 people give 
memorable, boisterous performances to a rapt crowd gathered inside the 
crimson-coloured 29th Street Ballroom. It's not all fun and games – there's 
money (and pride) on the line for the top three artists of the night. To make 
sure people on both sides of the stage are involved, judges are randomly pulled 
from the audience to assign the scores. You can forget quiet reverence at the 
door, APS is where art becomes loud and competitive.
• 2906 Fruth St (29th St Ballroom), austinslam.com <http://austinslam.com>. 
Entry $5. Every Tuesday 8.30pm
