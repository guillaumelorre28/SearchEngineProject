Zhang Xiangchen, China’s deputy international trade representative, also told 
a news conference in Washington on Wednesday that a broad consensus of 
academics, business people and government officials have concluded thatChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> is not manipulating its yuan currency 
to gain an unfair trade advantage, as Trump has charged.

 “I think after Mr Trump takes office, he will be reminded that the United 
States should honour its obligations as a member of the World Trade 
Organisation,” Zhang said through an interpreter. “And as a member of the WTO, 
China also has the right to ensure its rights as a WTO member.”

 Trump has said China is “killing us” on trade and that he would take steps to 
reduce the large US goods trade deficit with China, including labelling Beijing 
as a currency manipulator soon after he takes office and levying duties of up 
to 45% on Chinese goods to level the playing field for US manufacturers.

 Trump said on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/21/donald-trump-100-days-plans-video-trans-pacific-partnership-withdraw>
 he will formally exit the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in 
January. China is not a signatory to the TPP.

 Zhang, who spoke at the closing news conference for a two-day technical 
meeting of US and Chinese trade officials in Washington, was not specific on 
what steps China would take to protect its rights under WTO rules.

 The global trading body prohibits members from unilaterally raising tariffs 
above levels that they have committed to maintain.

 China’s state-run Global Times newspaper last week warned 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/14/china-threatens-to-cut-sales-of-iphones-and-us-cars-if-naive-trump-pursues-trade-war>
 that a 45% Trump tariff would paralyse US-China bilateral trade.

 “China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will 
be replaced by Airbus. US auto and [Apple] iPhone sales in China will suffer a 
setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,” the newspaper warned.

 In the past, economists had widely viewed the yuan as artificially undervalued
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/13/china-devalues-yuan-for-third-straight-day-adding-to-fears-of-currency-war>
, but China during the past year has spent hundreds of billions of dollars in 
foreign currency reserves to keep the yuan from falling further – prompting the 
US Treasury to ease its warnings on Beijing’s currency practices.
