They say that data is the new oil, and if your business has a web presence 
then chances are you’re sitting on vast reserves of potential customer insights 
you may not even know you had.

Far from being just a tool to sell or market your products to potential 
buyers, much of a website’s true value lies beneath the surface.

There’s an array of analytics tools out there that can tell you who is 
visiting your website, what time they’re visiting, where they are visiting 
from, how long they spend on each page (known as bounce rate) and how they got 
there – be it through a Google search or a Facebook link.

 “Dependent on the business objectives, analytics can offer vital data for key 
performance indicators which offer business critical decisions,” says Dr 
Aleksej Heinze, co-director of the Centre for Digital Business atSalford 
University’s business school <http://www.salford.ac.uk/business-school>.

Getting your hands on all this information is relatively easy too – and often 
free.

Arguably the most well known and widely used is Google Analytics. 
<https://www.google.com/analytics/analytics/features/> This free software 
tracks how users interact with your site right down into the smallest detail, 
from which page they click on to how long they stay and displays the 
information in a range of charts and graphs.

If you sell online it can also tell you how many people are buying and – 
crucially – the point in the customer journey where they abandon a purchase, 
allowing you to make changes to your strategy or website. There is also a 
wealth offree training material <https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/> and 
videos available online to help you learn how to use it.

Open Web Analytics <http://www.openwebanalytics.com/> is also free. It offers 
many of the functions provided by Google’s platform as well as the addition of 
heat maps, which keeps tabs on where visitors click on your site, and it can 
also record mouse movements so you can see how many of your visitors follow 
your calls to action.

On the paid-for side, Clicky <https://clicky.com/> is an alternative to Google 
Analytics, which provides real-time information on your website that’s both 
straightforward to access, with a user interface that’s easy to navigate.Church 
Analytics <http://churchanalytics.com/> also provides real-time data. Perfect 
for anyone put off by complex graphs and charts, it has a user-friendly 
interface that could be less daunting for beginners looking to take their first 
steps.

One firm making use of analytics is Hubble <https://hubblehq.com/>, an online 
marketplace for finding and renting spare office space in London.

“We can pinpoint exactly where customers are getting discouraged” says Varun 
Bhanot, head of business development at the firm, “and it might indicate that 
we need to tweak our website messaging, product offering or even something as 
simple as a button to click or photos. For example, we realised that startups 
were more inclined to click on offices in East London, therefore we put 
Shoreditch office options front and centre on our search page.”

Varun says the information gleaned has also been important for attracting 
investors. “It’s meant that when we went to investors to pitch, we had a solid 
set of data showing we really understood our customer and how they behave.

“Investors are bullish on having really granular insights so no doubt it 
helped us seal our seed investment and was critical in our latest round of 
pitching.”

With the majority of people now accessing the web via their smartphone, 
finding out which device someone views your site on can be crucial when 
deciding whether to invest in a website that’s optimised for mobile.

Matt Deighton, managing director at Sofas by Saxon 
<https://www.sofasbysaxon.com/>, a bespoke furniture manufacturer based in 
Manchester, said Google Analytics revealed the company’s desktop site had a 
high bounce rate – customers visiting the site and then leaving quickly – and a 
low proportion of purchasing visitors. The firm realised it was down to its 
site not being optimised for mobile.

“Without a mobile-friendly site we had the key issue of site speed – as it was 
slower than most mobile-friendly sites” says Deighton. “Potential customers 
just weren’t willing to wait for the site to load – hence the high bounce rate. 
And as the site was not designed for mobile initially, call to actions were not 
clear to the user.”

“Now our call to actions stand out and as a result, we have seen the 
percentage of conversions increase as traffic is now flowing through to these 
pages.”

But once you’ve run your software and brought up all the numbers, how do you 
turn that into action?

Caz Nicklin and her business partner Lavinia Smith run two companies, Cyclechic
 <https://www.cyclechic.co.uk/> – which sells accessories to style-conscious 
cyclists – and Faversham-based mobile picture framing websiteNowFrameIt 
<https://nowframeit.com/#/index>. She found the statistics produced by 
analytics packages “overwhelming” at first.

“I am no data expert and there have been times I have stared at Google 
Analytics and [been] none the wiser as to what to do about [the numbers]. What 
I’ve learnt is to have a goal before you start digging into them.

“One example is that a couple of years ago we set the goal to increase sales 
by improving our conversion rate. When we look at the analytics we noticed our 
returning visitors were converting better than our new visitors, so we decided 
to offer our new customers a 10% discount code if they signed up to our 
newsletter. This was very effective and we had a 58% increase in sales from 
2013 to 2014.”

One tried and trusted method of putting analytics’ data into practice is A/B 
testing. Businesses make two versions of a web page, with varying details, and 
use analytics data to see which one has proven to be the most effective. If the 
customer stays longer on one version or – better still – buys something, you’ve 
found your winner.

But despite the wide availability of both packages and training materials, not 
enough businesses are making use of the information at their fingertips, says 
Dr Heinze.

“Unfortunately, the number of businesses using analytics and data in general 
is still very limited. Data is positioned as one of the five key aspects of a 
successful digital marketing strategy [and] basic analytics knowledge is 
relatively easy to gain.”
