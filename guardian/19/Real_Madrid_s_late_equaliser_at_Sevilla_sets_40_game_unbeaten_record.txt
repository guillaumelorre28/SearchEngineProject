Real Madrid set a Spanish record of 40 matches unbeaten in all competitions 
after they came back from two goals behind to snatch a 3-3 draw at Sevilla with 
a last-gasp equaliser from Karim Benzema in theCopa del Rey 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa-del-rey> on Thursday.

Real trailed 3-1 in the 77th minute of their last-16 second leg tie but their 
captain, Sergio Ramos, reduced the arrears from the penalty spot in the 83rd 
minute after Matias Kranevitter had pulled down Casemiro in the area.

With seconds remaining, Marcelo fed Benzema in the area and the Frenchman 
struck a right-footed shot past theSevilla

progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6-3 aggregate win.

Sevilla took the lead when Danilo headed a cross from Pablo Sarabia into his 
own net in the 10th minute, but Marco Asensio equalised with a low near-post 
shot following a terrific run from midfield three minutes after the re-start.

Stevan Jovetic, who joined Sevilla on loan from Inter Milan this week, 
volleyed home right-footed eight minutes after coming on to put the hosts in 
front in the 54th minute before Vicente Iborra pounced on a loose ball to add a 
third.

Real looked to be heading for their first defeat since they lost to Wolfsburg 
last April, but Ramos clawed his team back into the contest with a dinked 
penalty into the middle of the goal before Benzema completed the comeback.

Real had equalled arch-rivals Barcelona’s long unbeaten run with a 5-0 rout of 
Granada on Saturday

.

Sevilla coach Jorge Sampaoli handed Clément Lenglet his debut following his 
move from Nancy last week and the French defender saw his close-range header 
kept out by Kiko Casilla minutes before Benzema’s equaliser.

Real, four points clear of Sevilla at the top of La Liga, face them again at 
the same venue on Sunday.
