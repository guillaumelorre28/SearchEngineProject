Let me offer some assistance to Armando Iannucci in his confusion about 
Brexit. (“Confused by momentous times? Me too. Let’s talk 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/04/brexit-donald-trump-post-truth-confusion-contradiction-political-bubbles>
”, Comment, last week.)

Last night, I watched Lindsay Anderson’s 1982 film Britannia Hospital 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/may/28/jonathancoe> on TV. It reminded 
me of life in the 1970s, with its protest marches, strikes and the violence and 
anger that are absent from the political scene today. The vote to leave has 
enabled the “great unwashed” to annoy the “great and the good” big time, 
without a brick being thrown.

Polls show that it was older people who disproportionately voted to leave. 
These are the same people who went on anti-Vietnam war marches in the 1970s. 
They just don’t go on marches any more because of their arthritic knees. Brexit 
was nothing less than the revenge of the hippies.

There are no shortages of opinions, judgments, convictions or advice from the 
UK media and public about Brexit and the way forward. Youreditorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/04/hard-brexit-risks-britain-theresa-may-eu-divorce-2018-editorial>
 adds to the list.

I’m so stupid that I thought the decision was not in the UK’s gift, but that 
of the EU. I appreciate that the government is doing an excellent job in giving 
the impression that it is clueless about future plans.

Surely your editorial should have been about how we convince the EU that our 
“wish list”, in particular a soft Brexit, is acceptable.

Sadly, Mrs May and confused colleagues do not seem to realise the EU Santa 
Claus will not visit her. Indeed, 20 years of slagging off the EU has probably 
ensured a no-show from Santa. Let’s have a few more editorials explaining 
reality, not fantasy.

Andrew Jukes (Letters, last week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2016/dec/04/observer-letters-nick-cohen-populism-housing-green-belt>
) evades what may be the key issue in the so-called Brexit referendum – the 
fact that a significant proportion of the UK electorate chose not to vote at 
all.

In these critical referendum issues we should seriously consider making voting 
compulsory. This is the case in Australia, where percentage turnout 
consistently reaches the high 90s.

We may reasonably ask: why should an abstaining third of the electorate be 
allowed to create such confusion?

A handful of barely known names panicking is hardly newsworthy (“Hard Brexit 
stance could lose us power, say top Tories 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/03/hard-brexit-lose-tories-next-election-warn-top-mps>
”, News, last week). The Tories did not field a candidate at Richmond and, 
although they were unlikely to win, they did enjoy a 23,000 majority in the 
past under Zac Goldsmith.

By not bothering to field a candidate the seat was won by the Liberal 
Democrats, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/02/lib-dems-unseat-zac-goldsmith-in-richmond-park-byelection>
 putting more resources into one byelection than they have probably ever done 
before, and obtaining a majority of under 2,000. Big deal. I wish people would 
actually consider something larger than their own egos when making these 
foolish appeals. Brexit is an opportunity to make some good changes for this 
country, and this fear-based rhetoric is tiresome.
