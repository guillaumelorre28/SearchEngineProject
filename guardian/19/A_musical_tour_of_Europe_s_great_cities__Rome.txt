One of the contributors I have relied upon most during this series is @abkquan 
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13885567>, and I am a little disturbed 
by his reaction to my choice of Rome as our next musical city. “Tosca, set 
there, has three real Roman locations for its three acts –Sant’ Andrea della 
Valle 
<http://www.paradoxplace.com/Perspectives/Rome%20&%20Central%20Italy/Rome/Rome_Churches/SantAndrea_della_Valle/Images/800/SAndrea-Facade-Apr05-DS0098sAR800.jpg>
,Palazzo Farnese 
<https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/3e/72/85/3e72853355137e8addb0aab30d771cda.jpg>
,Castel Sant’ Angelo 
<https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/63/4b/6e/castel-sant-angelo.jpg>
,” he begins promisingly. “Respighi’s trilogy Pines of Rome, Fountains of Rome 
and Roman Festivals also feature distinctive Roman landmarks, includingVilla 
Borghese 
<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Galleria_borghese_facade.jpg>
, theTrevi 
<http://italiannotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Facts-about-the-Trevi-Fountain-2.jpg?x20879>
 andTriton 
<http://www.romanhomes.com/your_roman_vacation/quarters/Navona-Pantheon-Trevi-Barberini/barberini-triton-distant-h12-m3.jpg>
 fountains, and thePiazza Navona 
<http://www.reidsitaly.com/images/lazio/rome/sights/pz-navona1-long.jpg>.”


So far, so good. “Unfortunately, Tosca has been described as a ‘shabby little 
shocker’, and the Respighi trilogy dismissed as ‘picture postcard’ music. The 
reader will decide for themselves whether the eternal city deserves greater 
musical representations. Arguably, Rome is more successfully represented in 
films.Fellini’s La Dolce Vita <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=The8Xi6fKOE> and 
Roma both have music by Nino Rota.”

 Puccini – Tosca 
Some interesting observations there, worth examining. Many think the dismissal 
of Tosca as a “shabby little shocker” comes from Bernard Shaw (who did indeed 
say something similar), but the phrase was in fact coined by the musicologist
Joseph Kerman 
<http://slippedisc.com/2014/03/the-author-of-a-shabby-little-shocker/> in his 
1950s book Opera as Drama. Kerman seems to have had a rather low opinion of 
Puccini, also predicting that Turandot would fade into obscurity.

He was wrong on both counts, and we should have no reservations about parading 
Tosca’s Roman antecedents, especially if we have the 1953 EMI recording with 
Maria Callas, Giuseppe Di Stefano and Tito Gobbi, one of the greatest of all 
opera recordings. Kerman’s book and the recording appeared within a few years 
of each other, but he never felt the need to revise his opinion of Puccini’s 
great (if melodramatic) opera.

 Ottorino Respighi – Pini di Roma 
I feel less certain in my defence of Respighi, who was professor of 
composition at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in his adopted city of 
Rome. Pines of Rome is undoubtedly exciting, but is it any more than that? The 
earlierFountains of Rome <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwMwaePtEmo> is 
charming, andRoman Festivals <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u1oT7QtQp4> 
exhilarating, but there is no escaping the question of whether there is much 
beneath the surface glitter, and their status as concert-fillers is rather 
offputting. Respighi worked in St Petersburg and took lessons early in his 
career with Rimsky-Korsakov. For better or worse, the influence of that master 
orchestrator stayed with Respighi throughout his career.

 Respighi – Church Windows 
A different side of his musical character, drawing on his interest in the 
music of the 17th and 18th centuries, emerges in his four “symphonic 
impressions”, Church Windows. This piece comes with a warm recommendation from @
thesecretorganist <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15303784>, who says: 
“I managed to destroy the speakers in my old laptop by playing the final 
movement of Church Windows at full volume.” @thesecretorganist 
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15303784> admits Respighi’s music is 
“gloriously kitsch”, but insists it’s kitsch in a good way and reckons his name 
should be added to “our ever-growing list of neglected greats”. Maybe. We 
really need to hear more of his oeuvre and not just the much-played trilogy. The
Brazilian Impressions <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ0rqgWloQU> are 
enticing, but we are getting a long way from Rome.

 Nino Rota – Dolce Vita 
Back in the eternal city, we can certainly agree with @abkquan 
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13885567> that Nino Rota’s 
Oscar-winning score for La Dolce Vita demands inclusion, capturing the sleazy 
chic of the city as it moved from postwar austerity to 60s consumerism, losing 
all the old certainties along the way. Rota scored many films with Roman 
backdrops, includingFellini’s Roma <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKFssF9B1Aw>
, a mordant portrait of the city and a far cry from Respighi’s sparkling tone 
poems.

Berlioz considered Rome 'the most stupid and prosaic city I know'.

As well as being an eternal city, Rome may be an elusive one for artists to 
capture. Georges Bizet, who studied for a couple of years in Rome in the late 
1850s, spent more than a decade working intermittently on hisSymphony No 2, 
entitled “Roma”, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdVpty25oMg> but he was never 
really happy with it despite numerous revisions and it is rarely played today, 
though the scherzo has its fans.

 Hector Berlioz – Roman Carnival Overture 
We are on safer ground with Hector Berlioz 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/21/from-the-classical-archive-1848-review-berlioz-his-mind-is-richly-stored-with-new-and-striking-ideas->
’s Roman Carnival Overture, a wonderfully vivid work, especially when you 
consider that Berlioz, who also studied in Rome, thought it “the most stupid 
and prosaic city I know”. The overture draws on themes from Berlioz’s opera
Benvenuto Cellini <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a82dmk0p5Rc>, though since 
the latter spent most of his remarkably colourful life in Florence and only a 
short time in Rome we have to accept the association is a little tenuous. 
Wonderful music, though, and quite a life (and death) story.

Richard Strauss’s tone poem Aus Italien 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7NZst43iUA> is also not entirely Roman – the 
third and fourth sections are drawn from the composer’s journeys further south 
in 1886. But the first and second are authentic portrayals of the countryside 
around Rome and of the ruins in the city, the remnants of a great culture. It 
seems to me that Strauss was striving to say something profound about a city 
whose true world status was long past, whereas Respighi was content to 
celebrate its surface energy.

Finally, we cannot ignore Rome’s centrality in the Catholic world. The city’s 
story is one of exchanging temporal power for a somewhat shakier spiritual 
sway. Palestrina, as the @thesecretorganist 
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15303784> says, is an inescapable 
influence on church music in the city, and his suggestion ofMissa Papae 
Marcelli (Mass for Pope Marcellus) 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missa_Papae_Marcelli> as a representative work 
is a good one.

 Palestrina – Missa Papae Marcelli 
Pope Marcellus only reigned for three weeks, so was fortunate to be 
immortalised in this masterpiece by Palestrina. It also, in a strange way, gets 
closer to the spirit of Rome than any of the other works, which pick up on 
single facets of the city – sleaze, corruption, chic energy, touristic beauty, 
vanished power. Palestrina captures the majesty of the eternal city, the 
beautiful dream that didn’t quite die when its empire crumbled. I like to think 
so, anyway.

Next time, Vienna. Europe’s classical musical capital and home to its greatest 
composers. I once lay in front ofBeethoven’s grave in the city’s Zentralfriedhof
 <http://www.visitingvienna.com/sights/zentralfriedhof/> listening to his Missa 
Solemnis, and welcome the chance to regale you withthat story
