Donald Trump has continued his criticism of Hillary Clinton’s support  
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/26/hillary-clinton-attorney-jill-stein-wisconsin-recount>
for election recounts in three states,claiming  
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664>he won the 
popular vote “if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally”.


The president-elect, who offered no evidence for his claims, earlier called 
the recount effort a “scam”, while senior adviser Kellyanne Conway called Green 
party candidateJill Stein <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jill-stein> and 
Clinton “a bunch of crybabies and sore losers”.

Marc Elias, general counsel for the Clinton campaign, wrote on Saturday 
<https://medium.com/@marceelias/listening-and-responding-to-calls-for-an-audit-and-recount-2a904717ea39#.s4isjv5r8>
 that the campaign would support Stein’s effort in Wisconsin, where a recount 
will take place. Stein is also pushing for recounts in Pennsylvania and 
Michigan and has raisedmore than $6m 
<https://jillstein.nationbuilder.com/recount> online to fund such efforts.

The decision put the Clinton camp at odds with the Obama White House, which 
has expressed confidence in election results.

On Saturday, Trump attacked Stein, using Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802671162383802368> to say: “The 
Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is 
now being joined by the badly defeated [and] demoralized Dems.”

On Sunday morning, the president-elect fired off a volley of tweets 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802849330176659456>, starting: 
“Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the 
victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change.”

The president-elect then drew attention to a debate remark by Clinton after 
Trump refused to commit to accepting the election result, quoting her as 
saying: “That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works.

“Been around for 240 years. We’ve had free and fair elections. We’ve accepted 
the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected 
of anyone standing on a during a general election.

“I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two 
major parties would take that kind of position.”

Trump was due back in New York on Sunday after spending Thanksgiving at his 
Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where one report said he had been asking visitors
who should be his secretary of state 
<http://nypost.com/2016/11/26/trump-spent-thanksgiving-asking-mitt-or-rudy/>.

In the afternoon, around the time of his scheduled departure for Manhattan, he 
used Twitter to say 
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664>: “In addition 
to winning the electoral college in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you 
deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.”

Trump did not elaborate about what he meant by “people who voted illegally”. 
During the campaign, he and surrogates complained about voter identity fraud 
among communities which usually lean Democratic,without presenting evidence and 
despite regular debunking of such claims by experts 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/donald-trump-fact-check-rigged-election-voter>
.

In subsequent <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802973848022847489> 
tweets <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802975667197386752>, he 
added: “It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote 
than the electoral college in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 states 
instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and 
convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!”

Trump, who trails Clinton by more than 2m ballots in the popular vote, drew 
criticism for his remarks.

Alex Padilla, California’s secretary of state, said they were “unbecoming” for 
a president-elect and seemed to show that Trump was rankled by losing the 
popular vote.

Stein’s recount effort, backed by a coalition of academics and activists, is 
based on fears that election machinery may have been hacked, although no 
evidence has yet been presented.

The White House has distanced itself from the effort. Referring to attempts to 
influence the election that have been officially blamed on Russia, itsaid in a 
statement 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/us/politics/hacking-russia-election-fears-barack-obama-donald-trump.html?_r=0>
 the election results nonetheless “accurately reflect the will of the American 
people”.

In a statement emailed to the Guardian on Sunday, Stein said: “The incredible 
outpouring of support for these recounts – from over 100,000 small donors with 
an average of $45 each – shows that Americans of all parties want a voting 
system they can trust.

“In an election tarnished by allegations and irregularities, Americans of all 
political persuasions deserve to know the truth about what happened in these 
states.”

Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders supported the legal 
right to request a recount but told CNN’s State of the Union: “I don’t think
Hillary Clinton <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton>, who got 
2m more votes than Mr Trump, thinks that it’s going to transform the election.”


Conway countered, telling CNN the decision to back Stein was “pretty 
incredible”.

“I was asked, like, a thousand times, will Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> accept the election results,” 
she said, “and now you have the Democrats and Jill Stein saying they will not 
accept the election results? [Clinton] congratulated him and she conceded to 
him on election night and now we’re going to drag this out? It’s pretty 
incredible.”

She added: “The president-elect has been incredibly gracious and magnanimous 
to Hillary Clinton at a time when, for whatever reason, her folks are saying 
they will join any recount to try to somehow undo the 70-plus electoral votes 
that he beat her by.”


On NBC’s Meet the Press she went further, saying of Clinton and Stein: “Their 
president, Barack Obama, is going to be in office eight more weeks.

“They will have to decide if they’re going to interfere with his business and 
the peaceful transition of power to President-elect Donald Trump or [if] 
they’re going to be a bunch of cry babies and sore losers about an election 
they can’t turn around.”

In his post, Elias detailed the Clinton campaign’s thinking: “We certainly 
understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect Hillary 
Clinton and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every 
vote is properly counted.

“We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and 
Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states ” –Michigan

, where the Republican leads by 10,704 votes with the result expected to be 
certified on Monday – “well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a 
recount.

“But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, 
we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally 
represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to 
monitor the recount process itself.”

Later on Sunday, apparently responding to Trump’s tweets, Elias tweeted to 
defend the campaign’s position.

We are getting attacked for participating in a recount that we didn't ask for
