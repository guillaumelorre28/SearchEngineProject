A successful meme is not much compensation in these weird times, but it’s 
something. Over the past week, the vice-president of the US,Joe Biden 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden>, has emerged as the star of a 
collection of captioned photographs. They depict him as more than a little 
disinclined to ease Donald Trump’s presidential transition. In one, he claims 
to have changed the White House Wi-Fi password to “PssyGrbbr45”. In all of 
them, Obama looks and talks like an exasperated parent.

Biden the comic character – an incompetent, coarse, ungovernable buffoon – has 
emerged by consensus over the years. If it doesn’t bear much resemblance to the 
man himself, it isn’t really meant to. It’s probably more a characterisation of 
the office of vice-president. It’s easy to imagine anyone in that position 
feeling restless, underoccupied, and mischievous. It’s also a role that’s kept 
the outspoken Biden half in shadow for eight years. He is, relatively speaking, 
a blank canvas. Give him any sort of alternative persona and it will stick.

The satirical website the Onion <http://www.theonion.com/> went so far as to 
portray Biden as a lecherous, hard-partying hellraiser 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/business/media/11biden.html> in the habit of 
washing his Pontiac Firebird Trans Am on the White House lawn 
<https://www.amazon.com/President-Vice-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B00B1W7QC6>. The 
caricature was predicated on nothing (Biden is, among other things, teetotal),
but it took hold <http://www.theonion.com/search?q=joe+biden>.

If the real Joe Biden barely figures in all of this, it should be said that he 
is a little gaffe-prone. At a ceremony to mark the launch of Obamacare, a 
microphone caught himtelling the president that this was “a big fucking deal” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2010/mar/23/joe-biden-obama-big-fucking-deal-overheard>
. He’s also almost imperviously good-natured, and reportedly enjoyed the 
Onion’s wide-of-the-mark depiction.

The post-election Joe Biden in these latest memes has been specially updated 
for the occasion. He’s bitter, petty and unable to play along with the 
dignified charade of transition, a class-clown hero. Above all, he appears 
convinced that, in the present circumstances, only pointless, completely 
idiotic gestures will suffice. For a lot of Americans, that captures the mood 
perfectly.
