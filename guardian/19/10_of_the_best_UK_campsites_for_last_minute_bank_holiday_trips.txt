Five miles from Cors Caron national nature reserve 
<http://www.naturalresources.wales/corscaron?lang=en> and just back from the 
river Aeron – a great birdwatching location – Aeron View Campsite is a boon for 
wildlife lovers, not least because of the 30-odd red kites that nest in the 
neighbouring woodland. Feeding time begins at 4pm daily, when the birds of prey 
swoop and swirl around a food station at the bottom of the camping meadow. 
Facilities are excellent, including disabled access and a baby changing room, 
and dogs are welcome. Campfires are not permitted but there are several 
barbecues for use.

Spread across two flat meadows, half an hour from the North Devon coast, Bales 
Ash Campsite is the antithesis of a holiday park. There are few buildings on 
site, aside from the shower block and composting toilets, so campers find fun 
in impromptu football matches, campfire gatherings and stargazing. The owners 
sell cream teas from the summerhouse outside their home and there are several 
pubs within walking distance. The beaches of Westward Ho!, Croyde and 
Woolacombe and the beautiful, wild expanses of Exmoor are half an hour’s drive 
away.

In a hollow at the foot of its eponymous glen, Glendaruel, on the Cowal 
peninsula, is a relatively small caravan park made to feel smaller by the 
flanks of giant trees that shelter each side. Tents are pitched in a large 
meadow, with access to a basic toilet and shower block, a well-equipped 
campers’ kitchen and a dining shelter. A separate field leaves room for kids to 
run wild. ThoughLoch Lomond and The Trossachs national park 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/aug/23/uk-national-parks-history-natural-beauty>
 is just a few miles east, thepeninsula itself offers spectacular walking 
<http://www.visitcowal.co.uk/>, with paths directly from the campsite.

The highest of the 30 grass pitches at this tiered, family-friendly campsite, 
provides excellent views down the Gwaun valley to the Irish Sea. Though 
Fishguard Harbour and the Pembrokeshire Coast Path are less than two miles 
away, the campsite, in the green folds of the Preseli Hills, feels very much 
in-land. Part garden, part campsite, it is dotted with shrubs and flowerbeds – 
reflecting how well maintained (albeit basic) the facilities are – and there’s 
a playground for children. Walk the scenic riverside path to Fishguard where 
children can go crabbing off the sea wall.

In the eastern hills of the South Downs, just outside the cobbled, medieval 
town of Lewes, Spring Barn Farm is a joy for kids, and perfect for campers who 
like a good walk. It’s basic – little more than a field with a nearby loo block 
– but campfires are permitted, the views are fantastic and children love the 
on-site farm animals and maze.Lewes Castle 
<https://sussexpast.co.uk/properties-to-discover/lewes-castle> and Anne of 
Cleves House 
<https://sussexpast.co.uk/properties-to-discover/anne-of-cleves-house> are the 
pamphlet-worthy attractions nearby, but simply exploring the narrow streets of 
town is enough for many. The south coast is 15 minutes away by car.

The secluded woodland setting of Ace Hideaways’ wild camping pitches come 
juxtaposed with the adrenalin-pumping thrills of the campsite’s adventure 
centre next door. In the evenings campfires flicker among the birch and pine 
trees of the forest, while, during the day, white-water rafting on the river 
Findhorn, along with kayaking, canyoning and cliff-jumping are all popular 
activities. Pre-pitched bell tents and a shepherd’s hut are also available, 
each in their own private clearing, while facilities for all are in wooden camp 
shelters. Get your bearings atLogie Steading Visitor Centre

sloping away at one end to provide wonderful views of the chalky Chiltern

make up the crowd here, with ample space for children to play games and make
