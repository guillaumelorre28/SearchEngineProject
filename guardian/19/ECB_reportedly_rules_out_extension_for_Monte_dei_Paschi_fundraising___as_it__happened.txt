Italy’s cabinet has no plans to meet on Saturday to discuss the current 
banking situation, Reuters is reporting, quoting government sources.

But it stands ready to implement an emergency decree on banks if necessary, 
Reuters adds.

European markets end higher despite Italian bank worries

Even though Italy’s Monte dei Paschi fell more than 10% on concerns about its 
refinancing, investors elsewhere remained fairly calm. Ahead of the next big 
economic event - the Federal Reserve’s expected increase in US interest rates 
next week - markets were supported by the European Central Bank’s suggestion it 
would continue acting to help the eurozone economy.

Meanwhile the proposed offer by 21st Century Fox for satellite broadcaster Sky 
helped lift shares in London. Italy unsurprisingly missed out on the gains, 
given the fall in Monet dei Paschi. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 22.66 points or 0.33% at 6954.21 
 * Germany’s Dax edged up 0.22% to 11,203.63 
 * France’s Cac closed 0.6% higher at 4764.07 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 18,292.65 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.26% at 9169.6 
 * In Greece, the Athens market dipped 1.26% to 640.09 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 75 points or 
0.38%, heading for a new closing high.

Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox for £10.75 a share or more than £18bn.

But Sky said the two sides were still in discussions about “certain material 
offer terms” and there was no guarantee an offer would be made.

Sky shares have jumped 31% to £10.42.

Helena Smith

Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has taken creditors aback by 
announcing a Christmas bonus for pensioners surviving on €800 or less. Helena 
Smith reports from Athens:

It was meant to be a goodwill gesture, announced in the wake of anti-austerity 
protests at the end of a crippling 24-hour nationwide strike.

Instead, prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ declaration of a one off bonus payment 
to supplement the pensions of some 1.6 million low-income retirees has 
triggered renewed tensions with the country’s creditors. Under scheme – 
unveiled in a televised address to the nation late on Thursday – around €600m 
will be handed to pensioners living on living on €800 or less a month. Greece 
is under tight stewardship by lenders keeping it afloat. The prospect of 
another round of pension and wage cuts set as the price of emergency bailout 
funding has seen Tsipras’ own popularity and that of his leftist-led coalition 
tumble.

Responding to the news a commission spokeswoman said Brussels had not been 
informed of Tsipras’ surprise spending spree, the details of which it would 
have to study. “The program includes clear commitments to discuss all measures 
related to program objectives with the institutions in advance,” she told 
reporters this afternoon. “The Commission was not made aware of all the details 
of the announcements before they were made.”

Trump victory boosts US consumer confidence

Donald Trump’s surprise election victory has not only boosted the stock 
market, it has also given US consumers more confidence.

The initial reading of December’s University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment 
survey came in at 98, up from a revised 93.8 in November and well above 
expectations of a figure of 94.5. And it was mainly down to Trump.

The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin said:

Consumer confidence surged in early December to just one-tenth of an Index 
point below the 2015 peak—which was the highest level since the start of 2004.

The surge was largely due to consumers’ initial reactions to Trump’s surprise 
victory. When asked what news they had heard of recent economic developments, 
more consumers spontaneously mentioned the expected positive impact of new 
economic policies than ever before recorded in the long history of the surveys.

To be sure, an equal number volunteered negative judgments about prospective 
economic policies, but the frequency of those negative references was less than 
half its prior peak levels whereas positive references were about twice its 
prior peak.

There were a few exceptions to the early December surge in optimism, mainly 
among those with a college degree and among residents of the Northeast [our 
bold italics], although no group has adopted a pessimistic outlook for the 
economy.

The most important implication of the increase in optimism is that it has 
raised expectations for the performance of the economy. President-elect Trump 
must provide early evidence of positive economic growth as well as act to keep 
positive consumer expectations aligned with performance. Either too slow growth 
or too high expectations represent barriers to maintaining high levels of 
consumer confidence. Until specific policies are proposed, there is no reason 
to alter the 2017 forecast of 2.5% for real consumption.

Commenting on International Personal Finance, Numis analysts said:

The [Polish] Ministry of Justice, as opposed to the ministry of finance has, 
as part of a criminal law change and anti-usury measures, suggested that the 
interest rate cap in Poland is reduced. There is a 14 day consultation period 
and the ministry of finance may intervene.

Assuming the cap is enacted as proposed it would materially reduce the revenue 
profile of the Polish business, calling into question the viability of the home 
credit model.

Where under the existing cap IPF would collect £168 from a £100 loan, under 
the new proposal it would only be able to collect £126. We now value IPF 
assuming that there is no value in Poland and that includes the capital that is 
allocated to this division.

Elsewhere International Personal Finance, the emerging markets lender, has 
slumped 30% after it said Polish authorities had published a draft bill cutting 
the costs lenders can charge on consumer loan agreements. It said was 
“reviewing the proposal to assess the extent to which the profitability of its 
Polish business would be affected by the proposed changes.” The proposal 
reduces the flat level cap of 25% of loan value to 10% and an annual cap from 
30% to 10% per annum.

This is not the first time the company has been hit by changes in regulation

Reuters: MONTE DEI PASCHI SUBORDINATED BONDS INCLUDED IN DEBT-TO-EQUITY SWAP 
TRADE DOWN 1000-1500 BPS ON OVER-THE COUNTER PLATFORMS - TRADER
 <https://twitter.com/jmackin2/status/807226827278323716> December 9, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/jmackin2/status/807226827278323716> 
The debt to equity swap was predicated on a cash call going ahead, and that 
now looks in doubt, hence the fall in the bonds which were included in the swap.

Italy’s cabinet has no plans to meet on Saturday to discuss the current 
banking situation, Reuters is reporting, quoting government sources.

But it stands ready to implement an emergency decree on banks if necessary, 
Reuters adds.
 
Even though Italy’s Monte dei Paschi fell more than 10% on concerns about its 
refinancing, investors elsewhere remained fairly calm. Ahead of the next big 
economic event - the Federal Reserve’s expected increase in US interest rates 
next week - markets were supported by the European Central Bank’s suggestion it 
would continue acting to help the eurozone economy.

Meanwhile the proposed offer by 21st Century Fox for satellite broadcaster Sky 
helped lift shares in London. Italy unsurprisingly missed out on the gains, 
given the fall in Monet dei Paschi. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 22.66 points or 0.33% at 6954.21 
 * Germany’s Dax edged up 0.22% to 11,203.63 
 * France’s Cac closed 0.6% higher at 4764.07 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 18,292.65 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.26% at 9169.6 
 * In Greece, the Athens market dipped 1.26% to 640.09 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 75 points or 
0.38%, heading for a new closing high.
 
Ratings agency Moody’s has just downgraded the outlook for seven Italian banks

Spa, Banca IMI Spa, FCA Bank S.p.A., Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro S.P.A., Credito 
Emiliano SpA, Credit Agricole Cariparma S.p.A., and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti

Back to Italy, and Monte dei Paschi has closed down more than 10% after the 
European Central Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank> reportedly refused 
an extension for a potential private sector fundraising. But other Italian bank 
shares were not hit as badly:

Some breaking news: satellite broadcaster Sky has agreed to be taken over by 
Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox for £10.75 a share or more than £18bn.

But Sky said the two sides were still in discussions about “certain material 
offer terms” and there was no guarantee an offer would be made.

Sky shares have jumped 31% to £10.42.
 
Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has taken creditors aback by 
announcing a Christmas bonus for pensioners surviving on €800 or less. Helena 
Smith reports from Athens:

It was meant to be a goodwill gesture, announced in the wake of anti-austerity 
protests at the end of a crippling 24-hour nationwide strike.

Instead, prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ declaration of a one off bonus payment 
to supplement the pensions of some 1.6 million low-income retirees has 
triggered renewed tensions with the country’s creditors. Under scheme – 
unveiled in a televised address to the nation late on Thursday – around €600m 
will be handed to pensioners living on living on €800 or less a month. Greece 
is under tight stewardship by lenders keeping it afloat. The prospect of 
another round of pension and wage cuts set as the price of emergency bailout 
funding has seen Tsipras’ own popularity and that of his leftist-led coalition 
tumble.

Responding to the news a commission spokeswoman said Brussels had not been 
informed of Tsipras’ surprise spending spree, the details of which it would 
have to study. “The program includes clear commitments to discuss all measures 
related to program objectives with the institutions in advance,” she told 
reporters this afternoon. “The Commission was not made aware of all the details 
of the announcements before they were made.”

Donald Trump’s surprise election victory has not only boosted the stock 
market, it has also given US consumers more confidence.

The initial reading of December’s University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment 
survey came in at 98, up from a revised 93.8 in November and well above 
expectations of a figure of 94.5. And it was mainly down to Trump.

The survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin said:

Consumer confidence surged in early December to just one-tenth of an Index 
point below the 2015 peak—which was the highest level since the start of 2004.

The surge was largely due to consumers’ initial reactions to Trump’s surprise 
victory. When asked what news they had heard of recent economic developments, 
more consumers spontaneously mentioned the expected positive impact of new 
economic policies than ever before recorded in the long history of the surveys.

To be sure, an equal number volunteered negative judgments about prospective 
economic policies, but the frequency of those negative references was less than 
half its prior peak levels whereas positive references were about twice its 
prior peak.

There were a few exceptions to the early December surge in optimism, mainly 
among those with a college degree and among residents of the Northeast [our 
bold italics], although no group has adopted a pessimistic outlook for the 
economy.

The most important implication of the increase in optimism is that it has 
raised expectations for the performance of the economy. President-elect Trump 
must provide early evidence of positive economic growth as well as act to keep 
positive consumer expectations aligned with performance. Either too slow growth 
or too high expectations represent barriers to maintaining high levels of 
consumer confidence. Until specific policies are proposed, there is no reason 
to alter the 2017 forecast of 2.5% for real consumption.
 
The worries about Monte dei Paschi may be sending the Italian stock market 
lower - the FTSE MIB is currently down 1.1% - but elsewhere the mood is 
brighter.

On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 30 points at 19,644, 
while Nasdaq composite is up 0.34% to a new peak of 5435.

In Europe, the FTSE 100 is up 0.2% while Germany’s Dax has added 0.18% and 
France’s Cac has climbed 0.57%.
 
Commenting on International Personal Finance, Numis analysts said:

The [Polish] Ministry of Justice, as opposed to the ministry of finance has, 
as part of a criminal law change and anti-usury measures, suggested that the 
interest rate cap in Poland is reduced. There is a 14 day consultation period 
and the ministry of finance may intervene.

Assuming the cap is enacted as proposed it would materially reduce the revenue 
profile of the Polish business, calling into question the viability of the home 
credit model.

Where under the existing cap IPF would collect £168 from a £100 loan, under 
the new proposal it would only be able to collect £126. We now value IPF 
assuming that there is no value in Poland and that includes the capital that is 
allocated to this division.
 
Elsewhere International Personal Finance, the emerging markets lender, has 
slumped 30% after it said Polish authorities had published a draft bill cutting 
the costs lenders can charge on consumer loan agreements. It said was 
“reviewing the proposal to assess the extent to which the profitability of its 
Polish business would be affected by the proposed changes.” The proposal 
reduces the flat level cap of 25% of loan value to 10% and an annual cap from 
30% to 10% per annum.

This is not the first time the company has been hit by changes in regulation

The debt to equity swap was predicated on a cash call going ahead, and that 
now looks in doubt, hence the fall in the bonds which were included in the swap.
 
As part of its latest story on Monte dei Paschi, Italy’s Repubblica is 
suggesting the country may pass a decree this weekend allowing state aid. The
