The painful saga of English National Opera 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/14/english-national-opera-cuts-magic-flute>
, battling harsh Arts Council cuts and internal unrest, continued: the year 
began with a chorus pay dispute and theresignation of music director Mark 
Wigglesworth 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/22/eno-music-director-mark-wigglesworth-quits>
 and ended with an outcry against next year’sCarousel 
<https://www.eno.org/whats-on/rodgers-hammersteins-carousel/>, starring 
Katherine Jenkins and Alfie Boe. A promising new creative team is in place:
Martyn Brabbins as music director 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/21/english-national-opera-appoints-martyn-brabbins-music-director>
 and Daniel Kramer as artistic director. Ears and eyes will be on them. In 
performance, standards have remained consistently high: from Wigglesworth, in 
his short time as music director,Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk
