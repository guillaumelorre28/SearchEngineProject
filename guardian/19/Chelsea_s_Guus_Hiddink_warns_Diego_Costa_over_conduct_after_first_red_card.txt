Guus Hiddink <https://www.theguardian.com/football/guus-hiddink> has spoken to 
Diego Costa about his conduct on the pitch in the wake of his first red card 
for Chelsea, received at Everton last weekend, as the Spain forward commences 
his second suspension of the season.

Costa was dismissed for two bookable offences at Goodison Park, the second of 
which came after a clash with Gareth Barry who made a point post-match of 
stressing the striker had not bitten him in their tête-à-tête six minutes from 
time. The Football Association has since determined the 27-year-old will also 
face no sanction for an alleged gesture directed at home supporters on the 
stroke of half-time, though the governing body hascharged the forward

 with improper conduct relating to his reaction to being shown the red card.

A commission is expected to determine next week whether there should be 
further punishment for that offence on top of the two-match ban Costa will 
begin for the visit of West Ham United to Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

“Of course Diego is not happy because he desperately likes to play, but we’ll 
see if he gets a third game as well,” Hiddink said.

“First, everyone wants to get on his kiss or ‘bite’, and Barry made a very 
good statement by saying what did not happen. Maybe there was a little bit of 
searching for ‘where we can get’ Diego, and he was frustrated with that.

“Of course I’ve spoken to him. We’ve talked many times about him playing on 
the edge and his reactions, and we’re still happy with his performances. But I 
can never guarantee whether or not, bit by bit, he can be provoked. It is a 
matter of temperament and character. But we all would like is that he keeps 
playing as he has been, with a lot of ‘blood’ [and thunder]. He has been 
contributing a lot to the resurrection since December.”

Costa has scored 11 goals in his past 16 appearances for Chelsea, but he has 
been omitted

 from Vicente del Bosque’s Spain squad for their friendlies against Italy and 
Romania on the grounds that he is still enduring discomfort from a tendon 
problem in his hip.

Eden Hazard has also been rested

 by the Belgium manager, Marc Wilmots, for their game against Portugal this 
month with the playmaker expected to be absent for at least a month with his 
own hip problem. There is a belief, with club and country, that he will benefit 
from a break with one eye on the summer’s European Championship.

Hiddink suggested that neither Radamel Falcao nor Alexandre Pato, on loan from 
AS Monaco and Corinthians respectively, would be considered against West Ham as 
they continued to work on match fitness.

Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> have no plans at 
present to cancel the latter’s arrangement, despite the fact that he is yet to 
feature since moving to England at the end of January.
