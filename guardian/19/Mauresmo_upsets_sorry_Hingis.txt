Martina Hingis, still seeking her first title since parting with her mother 
Melanie Molitor as coach, must wrestle for longer with the doubts brought about 
by so profound a change, after failing for the third time since the split.

The 20-year-old lost 6-3 0-6 6-4 to Am√©lie Mauresmo in the semi-finals of the 
German Open here, paying a high price for the loss of control in the second set 
which inex plicably afflicted her. It allowed Mauresmo, whose muscular 
shoulders Hingis cattily commented on a couple of years ago, opportunities to 
unleash the sort of powerful hitting to which the world No 1 has often been 
vulnerable.

It also brought an edge to the contest, and the momentum subsequently 
generated by the French player disconcerted Hingis enough to take a long toilet 
break before the final set. This provided a fierce test of Hingis's newly 
claimed independence. For a while she reacted with a fatalistic look, but in 
the sixth game decided upon trying to retake the initiative, only to over-hit 
and drop serve. Finally, she reverted to attempting a deep and steady length 
only for her serve to be exposed as Mauresmo attacked off every ball.

The result was revenge for a defeat in the Family Circle Cup in Charleston 
last month when Hingis ended Mauresmo's 16-match winning streak.

Jennifer Capriati will be Mauresmo's opponent. The Aussie Open champion - 
whose father, Stefano, had a presence as conspicuous courtside as Melanie 
Molitor's absence - progressed unsatisfactorily against Justine Henin.

The score was 6-2 4-6, with Capriati 2-1 ahead in the decider, when the 
Belgian tumbled going for a wide forehand. Seven minutes' treatment to a 
sprained ankle brought only three more rallies before retirement.
