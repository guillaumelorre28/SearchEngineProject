Crystal Palace <https://www.theguardian.com/football/crystalpalace> are in 
talks with Patrice Evra over a permanent transfer from Juventus after the 
former Manchester United defender asked to leave the Italian champions last 
week.

Evra, 35, was left out of the Juventus 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus> squad for the 3-0 victory over 
Bologna on Sunday, with the France defender initially linked with Valencia and 
a return to Old Trafford as a coach. However, it is understood Palace are in 
negotiations with the player, who spent eight seasons and won the Champions 
League at United as Sam Allardyce seeks to fill the problem left-back position, 
with first choice Pape Souaré still sidelined.

Evra, who won 61 caps for France, will be offered an 18-month contract at 
Selhurst Park in contrast to his deal at Juventus that runs until the end of 
the season but does contain an option to extend it by a further year. That 
appears unlikely given he has played only 247 minutes in Serie A this season. 
The Juventus director Beppe Marotta admitted at the weekend Evra was 
considering his future.

Palace were one of three clubs to have a £7m bid for the Leeds defender 
Charlie Taylor turned down, with Leeds adamant they will not sell him in this 
window. They are also closing in on the signing of Leicester’s Ghana defender 
Jeffrey Schlupp after having a £12m bid accepted on Thursday .
