US adds oil rigs for seventh week

US oil drillers have added rigs for the seventh week in a row, taking the edge 
off crude prices.

Seventeen rigs in total were added last week compared to just one the previous 
week. Of these 15 were oil rigs and 2 gas, the largest weekly rise for more 
than a year.

Following the figures Brent crude is still ahead but has moved from a 1.6% 
rise to a 0.65% increase at $46.34 a barrel.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back next week.

European markets slip after US data

In a quiet day’s trading, the main impetus in the end came from a poor set of 
US data, including retail sales, which suggested weakness in the world’s second 
largest economy and a possible delay to any US rate rise. An early dip on Wall 
Street helped take away any impetus from European markets, despite oil 
continuing to hold firm after its recent gains. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished virtually flat, up just 1.31 points or 0.02% at 
6916.02 although the index was up nearly 2% on the week 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.27% to 10,713.43 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.08% at 4500.19 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB edged up 0.17% to 16,997.83 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.04% at 8716.4 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.66% to 576.12 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 49.41 points 
or 0.27%.

Meanwhile, despite an initial hit to the dollar following the US data, the 
pound failed to hold onto any gains and is currently down 0.3% at $1.2917. 
Against the euro, sterling has fallen 0.59% to €1.1564.

The International Monetary Fund has appointed a new senior representative for 
Greece, replacing an American with a Dutch national specialising in financial 
crises and social security reform (no comment necessary).

Dennis Botman will take over from Wes McGrew who ends his three year 
assignment this month and will return to the IMF’s headquarters. A spokesman 
said:

Mr Botman... previously worked in the Asia and Pacific Department—as the 
deputy chief on Japan as well as the IMF’s Resident Representative in the 
Philippines—the Economic Modeling Division in the Research Department, and the 
Fiscal Affairs Department.

He participated in numerous missions, including in Europe (e.g. Germany, UK), 
and his research covers a variety of topics, including general equilibrium 
modeling, financial crises and speculative attacks, aging and social security 
reform in Europe and Japan, and public finance.

Back in the UK and Aberdeen Asset Management is detecting signs of calm in the 
property market after the post-Brexit slump.

The firm has revised the fair value adjustment of its property fund from -7% 
on 6 July to -5%. Chief executive Martin Gilbert said:

There is further evidence that calm and order are being restored to the UK 
commercial property market. The impact of the vote to leave the EU is being 
felt most in the Central London office market, which the portfolio has little 
exposure to, whereas the retail and logistics markets are holding up relatively 
well along with longer-leased properties and those less dependent upon future 
rental growth. The quality of our holdings has allowed us to re-assess the fair 
value adjustment we are applying in the light of further emerging evidence. Of 
course the situation remains very fragile so we will remain watchful and act 
accordingly in the interests of all our underlying investors.

Stock markets <https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets> and the 
dollar are still in negative territory - just - after the disappointing US 
data. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:

A worrisome afternoon of US data ensured that trading continued at the same 
uninspired pace it did during the morning.

Dipping back under 18600 the Dow Jones was suitably unimpressed with what the 
US economy threw up this Friday. Retail sales were the most alarming figure, an 
upwards revision to 0.8% for June failing to compensate for the 0.0% growth 
managed across July; things get even worse when the automobile sector is 
stripped out, core retail sales plunging by -0.3% against the 0.2% increase 
that had been expected.

 Unsurprisingly given those sales figures the preliminary UoM consumers 
sentiment reading failed to see the recovery forecast, coming in at 90.4 
against 90.0 last month and the 91.5 analysts had estimated. Yet the Dow Jones 
didn’t bear the brunt of the bad news; that honour went to the dollar, which 
immediately began to suffer as its hopes of a 2016 rate hike were dealt a 
significant blow.

Brexit concerns appear to have been replaced by uncertainty ahead of the US 
election, according tothe consumer confidence report. 
<http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/> The survey’s chief economist, Richard Curtin 
said:

Confidence inched upward in early August due to more favorable prospects for 
the overall economy offsetting a small pullback in personal finances. Most of 
the weakness in personal finances was among younger households who cited higher 
expenses than anticipated as well as somewhat smaller expected income gains.

Concerns about Brexit have faded amid rising references to the outcome of the 
presidential election as a source of uncertainty about future economic 
prospects... Overall, the data remains consistent with real personal 
consumption expenditures improving at an annual rate of 2.6% through mid 2017, 
with new and existing home sales also benefitting from low mortgage rates.

US consumer confidence disappoints

More weaker than expected US economic data, and thus more food for thought for 
Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Federal Reserve.

The University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment came in at 90.4 in 
August’s preliminary reading, up from the final figure of 90 for July but below 
the expected level of 91.5.

IMF warns China’s economic transition will be ‘bumpy’

Julia Kollewe

The International Monetary Fund has warned that China’s economic transition to 
more balanced, sustainable growth will be “complex, challenging and potentially 
bumpy”.


In its latest assessment of the Chinese economy, the fund said China’s economy 
slowed to 6.9% growth last year, which is projected to ease to 6.6% this year 
due to slower private investment and weak external demand.

It said: “The economy is advancing on many dimensions of rebalancing, 
particularly switching from industry to services and from investment to 
consumption. But other aspects are lagging, such as strengthening state-owned 
enterprise and financial governance and containing rapid credit growth.”

province. Photograph: AP 
The Washington-based fund welcomed the “impressive progress” on structural 
reforms in many areas, notably interest rate liberalisation, 
internationalisation of the renminbi, and urbanisation; and the 13th five-year 
plan, with its ambitious goals centred on economic rebalancing.

IMF directors “stressed the need for decisive action to tackle rising 
vulnerabilities; reduce the reliance on credit-financed, state-led investment; 
and improve governance, risk pricing, and resource allocation in the 
state-owned enterprise and financial sectors”.

Inflation in China dipped below 1.5% in 2015 and is expected to pick up to 
around 2% this year, reflecting the rebound in commodity prices and the weaker 
renminbi since mid-2015 (the currency has lost some 4.5% of its value).

China’s current account surplus is projected to decline to 2.5% of GDP this 
year, from 3% of GDP in 2015, as imports increase and the services deficit 
widens, with Chinese tourists continuing to head abroad.

The Fed is not likely to raise rates this year, according to economist James 
Knightley of ING Bank:

US retail sales for July are disappointing, coming in flat on the month versus 
expectations of a 0.4% month on month gain. There was a modest upward revision 
(2 tenths of a percentage point) to June’s figure, but it is still a miss. Car 
sales were actually the strong point of the report, rising 1.1%. There had 
certainly been some good volume numbers, but with GM having offered deep 
discounts we thought that the value of auto sales may not be quite so good.

In terms of other categories, there was a 2.7% drop in gasoline station sales, 
due to price falls, but there was also weakness in sporting goods (-2.2%), 
building materials (-0.5%) and food/beverages (-0.6%). Looking at the “control 
group” which excludes volatile items and has a better relationship with overall 
consumer spending growth, it was also flat on the month. This suggests that 
after a pretty disappointing second quarter GDP, the economy isn’t exactly 
roaring ahead at the start of the third quarter.

We have also had some softer than expected producer price inflation numbers, 
with the headline annual rate dropping into negative territory at -0.2% year on 
year, while the core (ex food and energy inflation rate slowed markedly to 0.7% 
year on year from 1.3%.

So with activity being softer than hoped and pipeline inflation pressures 
looking benign it doesn’t offer much support to the view the Fed will be hiking 
rates imminently. We favour the next Fed move higher to come in the first 
quarter of 2017.

The US retail sales figures also showed a 0.3% fall excluding automobiles 
compared with expectations of a 0.2% rise.

The data puts the Federal Reserve is something of a quandary, say analysts. 
Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.xom, said:

Investors had waited with bated breath to see what today’s US retail sales 
numbers would say about the strength of the American economy, but have been 
left disappointed by a result that leaves opinions divided.

Neither particularly strong, nor catastrophic, the slight decline in monthly 
data shows that the world’s largest economy is merely ticking along, which will 
leave Fed chair Janet Yellen with a head-scratcher.

An interest rate rise will remain in the back of her mind, but with no real 
clues as to whether consumers would withstand monetary tightening, the wait 
goes to see if and when she’ll exact one.

Peter Read, co-founder of trading network Pelican, said:

Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be disappointed to not be able to add today’s 
retail sales data to the body of evidence she is building that supports raising 
interest rates later in the year.

The possible intervention on rates received a notable backer in San Francisco 
Fed chief John Williams this week, which comes off the back of a second 
successive better than expected non-farm payroll result last week.

However, Yellen and Co. will know that today’s surprisingly poor data is a 
significant drop from last month’s figures and further global market 
uncertainty, including equally poor Chinese data, may tempt the Fed to exercise 
caution. Next week’s inflation data will give observers further food for 
thought.

US oil drillers have added rigs for the seventh week in a row, taking the edge 
off crude prices.

Seventeen rigs in total were added last week compared to just one the previous 
week. Of these 15 were oil rigs and 2 gas, the largest weekly rise for more 
than a year.

Following the figures Brent crude is still ahead but has moved from a 1.6% 
rise to a 0.65% increase at $46.34 a barrel.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back next week.
 
In a quiet day’s trading, the main impetus in the end came from a poor set of 
US data, including retail sales, which suggested weakness in the world’s second 
largest economy and a possible delay to any US rate rise. An early dip on Wall 
Street helped take away any impetus from European markets, despite oil 
continuing to hold firm after its recent gains. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished virtually flat, up just 1.31 points or 0.02% at 
6916.02 although the index was up nearly 2% on the week 
 * Germany’s Dax dipped 0.27% to 10,713.43 
 * France’s Cac closed down 0.08% at 4500.19 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB edged up 0.17% to 16,997.83 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.04% at 8716.4 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 0.66% to 576.12 
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 49.41 points 
or 0.27%.

Meanwhile, despite an initial hit to the dollar following the US data, the 
pound failed to hold onto any gains and is currently down 0.3% at $1.2917. 
Against the euro, sterling has fallen 0.59% to €1.1564.
 
A Chinese slowdown, the fallout from Brexit and a Trump presidency are among 
the main worries among businesses, according to Oxford Economics:

The International Monetary Fund has appointed a new senior representative for 
Greece, replacing an American with a Dutch national specialising in financial 
crises and social security reform (no comment necessary).

Dennis Botman will take over from Wes McGrew who ends his three year 
assignment this month and will return to the IMF’s headquarters. A spokesman 
said:

Mr Botman... previously worked in the Asia and Pacific Department—as the 
deputy chief on Japan as well as the IMF’s Resident Representative in the 
Philippines—the Economic Modeling Division in the Research Department, and the 
Fiscal Affairs Department.

He participated in numerous missions, including in Europe (e.g. Germany, UK), 
and his research covers a variety of topics, including general equilibrium 
modeling, financial crises and speculative attacks, aging and social security 
reform in Europe and Japan, and public finance.
 
Back in the UK and Aberdeen Asset Management is detecting signs of calm in the 
property market after the post-Brexit slump.

The firm has revised the fair value adjustment of its property fund from -7% 
on 6 July to -5%. Chief executive Martin Gilbert said:

There is further evidence that calm and order are being restored to the UK 
commercial property market. The impact of the vote to leave the EU is being 
felt most in the Central London office market, which the portfolio has little 
exposure to, whereas the retail and logistics markets are holding up relatively 
well along with longer-leased properties and those less dependent upon future 
rental growth. The quality of our holdings has allowed us to re-assess the fair 
value adjustment we are applying in the light of further emerging evidence. Of 
course the situation remains very fragile so we will remain watchful and act 
accordingly in the interests of all our underlying investors.

Stock markets <https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets> and the 
dollar are still in negative territory - just - after the disappointing US 
data. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:

A worrisome afternoon of US data ensured that trading continued at the same 
uninspired pace it did during the morning.

Dipping back under 18600 the Dow Jones was suitably unimpressed with what the 
US economy threw up this Friday. Retail sales were the most alarming figure, an 
upwards revision to 0.8% for June failing to compensate for the 0.0% growth 
managed across July; things get even worse when the automobile sector is 
stripped out, core retail sales plunging by -0.3% against the 0.2% increase 
that had been expected.

 Unsurprisingly given those sales figures the preliminary UoM consumers 
sentiment reading failed to see the recovery forecast, coming in at 90.4 
against 90.0 last month and the 91.5 analysts had estimated. Yet the Dow Jones 
didn’t bear the brunt of the bad news; that honour went to the dollar, which 
immediately began to suffer as its hopes of a 2016 rate hike were dealt a 
significant blow.
 
Brexit concerns appear to have been replaced by uncertainty ahead of the US 
election, according tothe consumer confidence report. 
<http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/> The survey’s chief economist, Richard Curtin 
said:

Confidence inched upward in early August due to more favorable prospects for 
the overall economy offsetting a small pullback in personal finances. Most of 
the weakness in personal finances was among younger households who cited higher 
expenses than anticipated as well as somewhat smaller expected income gains.

Concerns about Brexit have faded amid rising references to the outcome of the 
presidential election as a source of uncertainty about future economic 
prospects... Overall, the data remains consistent with real personal 
consumption expenditures improving at an annual rate of 2.6% through mid 2017, 
with new and existing home sales also benefitting from low mortgage rates.

More weaker than expected US economic data, and thus more food for thought for 
Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Federal Reserve.

The University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment came in at 90.4 in 
August’s preliminary reading, up from the final figure of 90 for July but below 
the expected level of 91.5.
 
Wall Street has reacted to the disappointing US economic data, notably retail 
sales, by coming off the all time highs it hit on Thursday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 41 points or 0.23% lower while 
the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have also opened lower.
 
The International Monetary Fund has warned that China’s economic transition to 
more balanced, sustainable growth will be “complex, challenging and potentially 
bumpy”.


In its latest assessment of the Chinese economy, the fund said China’s economy 
slowed to 6.9% growth last year, which is projected to ease to 6.6% this year 
due to slower private investment and weak external demand.

It said: “The economy is advancing on many dimensions of rebalancing, 
particularly switching from industry to services and from investment to 
consumption. But other aspects are lagging, such as strengthening state-owned 
enterprise and financial governance and containing rapid credit growth.”

province. Photograph: AP 
The Washington-based fund welcomed the “impressive progress” on structural 
reforms in many areas, notably interest rate liberalisation, 
internationalisation of the renminbi, and urbanisation; and the 13th five-year 
plan, with its ambitious goals centred on economic rebalancing.

IMF directors “stressed the need for decisive action to tackle rising 
vulnerabilities; reduce the reliance on credit-financed, state-led investment; 
and improve governance, risk pricing, and resource allocation in the 
state-owned enterprise and financial sectors”.

Inflation in China dipped below 1.5% in 2015 and is expected to pick up to 
around 2% this year, reflecting the rebound in commodity prices and the weaker 
renminbi since mid-2015 (the currency has lost some 4.5% of its value).

China’s current account surplus is projected to decline to 2.5% of GDP this 
year, from 3% of GDP in 2015, as imports increase and the services deficit 
widens, with Chinese tourists continuing to head abroad.
