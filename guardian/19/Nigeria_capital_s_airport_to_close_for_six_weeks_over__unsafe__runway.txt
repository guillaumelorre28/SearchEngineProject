A Nigerian official has said the airport in the capital city of Abuja will 
close for six weeks beginning in March to repair its “dilapidated” and “unsafe” 
runway.


The closure beginning on 8 March will see flights diverted to an airport in 
Kaduna, a city about 180 km (110 miles) to the north, with additional security 
provided for shuttle busses travelling along a highway that has been the scene 
of high-profile kidnappings.

“I was conscious of the sheer size of dilapidation of our critical 
infrastructure in our aviation industry and especially the most critical ones 
such as the runway at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja,” junior 
aviation minister Hadi Sirika said as he announced the closure at a meeting.

Built in 1982 with a planned 20-year life span, Sirika said the “entire 
structure of the runway has failed” and was “unsafe for operation.”

In 2015, a travel website rated the Nigeria’s Port Harcourt International 
Airport the worst in the world, describing it as “the dirtiest and most corrupt 
airport inAfrica <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa>.”

Nigeria’s aviation sector took a beating last year as currency controls made 
it difficult for airlines to obtain sufficient funds to pay suppliers, with 
many curtailing and some suspending operations.
