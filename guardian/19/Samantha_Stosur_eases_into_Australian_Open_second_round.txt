Samantha Stosur continued the hosts’ golden start to the Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open> with an impressive 
straight-sets first-round victory over Monica Niculescu. Stosur outclassed the 
Romanian 6-4, 6-1 in 79 minutes to book a second-round meeting on Thursday 
against veteran Italian Francesca Schiavone or young American Coco Verdeweghe.

The former US Open champion is bidding to progress beyond the fourth round at 
Melbourne Park for the first time in 13 attempts. “Obviously I’ve had my 
struggles,” Stosur said. “There’s obviously a few more nerves here in a grand 
slam but I did alright.”

The 20th seed’s win gives Australia eight players in the second round, with 
four more playing later on Tuesday.

With the pressure on to deliver after early exits – again – in Brisbane and 
Sydney, Stosur made an understandably nervous start, shanking a couple of 
groundstrokes early and having to save a break point in her second service game.

But once she adjusted to Niculescu’s unusual, squash-style forehand slice, she 
was able to dictate proceedings. The one-time world No4 broke the world No48 in 
the ninth game and closed out the opening set with a perfect service game, 
landing four first deliveries to hold to love.

Stosur unleashed a stinging backhand pass and then a forehand winner to snare 
an early break in the second set before racing away with the match.

Australia’s only other seed, Casey Dellacqua, also begins her campaign on 
Tuesday. The 29th seed plays Austria’s world No93 Yvonne Meusburger, while 
Olivia Rogowska takes on the 96th-ranked Nicole Gibbs of the USA.

Lining up for his 19th straight Open, Lleyton Hewitt meets Chinese wildcard 
Zhang Ze in the first night match on Rod Laver Arena before adopted Aussie Ana 
Tomjlanovic plays American qualifier Shelby Rogers.
