A financial institution set up by government to accelerate Britain’s green 
power revolution could end up being sold to private equity firms and fund 
windfarms in Germany.

The Green Investment Bank <http://www.greeninvestmentbank.com> (GIB), hailed 
as a world first for the UK when it was set up, is expected to bring in more 
than £4bn for the Treasury when it is privatised, probably by the end of this 
year. But it may be snapped up by foreign buyers and already has plans to 
expand significantly overseas.

Announcing the sell-off at the lord mayor’s dinner in Mansion House, London, 
on Wednesday night, the business secretary, said a special share structure 
would ensure the company’s green mission continued.

“The Green Investment Bank 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-investment-bank> was a world 
first, and it is a sign of its success that the idea is being copied across the 
world. Having proven the business model works, we now want to make an even 
greater impact,” Sajid Javid said.

“The challenge presented by climate change is clear – it is imperative we 
mobilise more funding for green energy projects. The special share structure 
protects the bank’s green mission meaning the Green Investment Bank will 
continue to do exactly what it says on the tin.”

But critics question whether this can be guaranteed and warn that the bank 
could now switch to funding more lucrative schemes abroad.

Shaun Kingsbury, the GIB’s chief executive, said he had received expressions 
of interest from private equity investors, sovereign wealth funds and large 
foreign investment banks.

He added that the bank wanted to borrow money, rather than just use public 
funds, and to expand overseas and admitted it could in future be funding 
windfarms in Germany and Holland or even renewable power projects in India.

Labour’s energy and climate spokeswoman criticised the sell-off plan. “Selling 
off the Green Investment Bank without protecting its green mandate is a 
reckless act that could jeopardise the crucial private investment in new clean 
power stations that we urgently need to power Britain,” Lisa Nandy said. “The 
sale should be stopped unless the bank’s special status is protected.”

Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace, added: “A Green Investment Bank that 
is privatised needs to have its green credentials written in stone. If it 
becomes just another bank with a good corporate and social responsibility 
officer, then it ceases to drive extra private capital investment into the 
green energy sector and becomes just another private sector competitor for 
green projects. That’s no way to support green schemes and get clean energy 
money into the UK, just when we are crying out for delivery on infrastructure 
investment.”

Lord Smith of Kelvin, chairman of the bank, said attracting new investors was 
vital if the bank was to fund its ambitious plans to double the size of its 
business, and expand into new parts of the UK green economy.

Currently the lending group is focused on British low carbon projects, 
although it is involved in £200m international joint venture with the 
Department ofEnergy <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy> and 
Climate Change.

Kingsbury dismissed fears that the bank would change its focus to “easier” 
projects, saying it has established a strong track record of “being green and 
profitable” that it wanted to capitalise on.

“I am confident that the sale process will provide GIB with good new owners 
who will support GIB’s continued growth and leadership role in the global green 
economy long into the future,” he said.

The government plans to sell between 75% and 100% sale of the GIB , which was 
set up in 2012 to provide lending to green projects that would otherwise find 
it hard to secure finance. Since then it has invested in 66 infrastructure 
projects and seven funds.

The GIB says it has directly committed £2.6bn to the UK’s green economy as 
part of wider transactions worth £10.6bn. Among the projects it has invested in 
are the Galloper windfarm off the coast of Suffolk, the Wick district heating 
network in the north of Scotland plus an energy from waste plant in Belfast.

After the Paris climate change agreement was signed late last year, a report 
by the environmental audit committee 
<http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/news-parliament-2015/green-investment-bank-report-15-16/>
 recommended the British state keep a minority stake to ensure the bank’s 
objectives as well as its long-term strength.


Privatisation could compromise the bank’s green credentials, as well as 
encouraging it to fund easier and more immediately commercial projects rather 
than innovative, more complex ones, warned the committee.

The bank, which has 129 staff at its Edinburgh and London offices, said was 
producing an expected internal rate of return of more than 10%. “The business 
has strong and stable projected cash flow generation and costs are below or in 
line with industry benchmarks for a business of this kind.”
