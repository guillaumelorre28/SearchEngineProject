Deg Thai

Lovers of international cuisine can get an authentic sampling of Asian fusion 
daily from Deg Thai. The Massaman beef with jasmine rice and cucumber sauce is 
a real crowd pleaser: it won the 2013 "Best Hot Nashville" category in the 
annual localFood Truck Awards <https://www.facebook.com/events/640145842695001/>
, but the red and green curries pack more heat for those who really like their 
food with a kick. Wash it down with the Thai tea, for which Deg Thai loyalists 
really go wild. Be sure and check out the new breakfast treats such as 
house-made honey soy milk and Asian dough sticks, offered on Saturdays from 
7am-9am outsideFriedman's Army Navy Store 
<https://www.facebook.com/FriedmansOutdoors?fref=ts>. You'll also find the 
truck parked there for lunch every Saturday from 11am-5pm.

Biscuit Love Truck
 Photograph: 
You can't come to Tennessee without going on a self-guided tour of the best 
biscuits – a deep south staple – and the Biscuit Love Truck should be a stop on 
your itinerary. Menu items such as the East Nasty, with buttermilk-fried 
chicken, cheddar and sausage gravy are always delicious and filling, though 
sweet lovers would be wise to indulge in the Gertie, a biscuit with caramelised 
banana jam, house-ground peanut butter with pretzel crunch and localOlive and 
Sinclair <http://www.oliveandsinclair.com> chocolate gravy. There's a calendar 
on its website but Biscuit Love Truck is atFranklin Farmers Market  
<http://www.franklinfarmersmarket.com/>every Saturday, as well as at White's 
Mercantile <http://www.whitesmercantile.com> – owned by singer-songwriter and 
fashion entrepreneur Holly Williams, daughter of Hank Williams Jr – for a 
festive bluegrass brunch each Sunday.

<http://www.nashvillefoodtruckassociation.com> BJ Lofback and his

Crepe a Diem
 Crepe a Diem, Nashville 
Brittney Blackshear brought her mobile crepe shop to Nashville in the spring 
of 2013 after two years of catering and festivals in Savannah. It was an 
instant hit among Music City's foodies. A stint in southern France, followed by 
an opportunity to study under a Michelin-starred chef from Brittany, lit a fire 
beneath Blackshear to start her own truck dedicated to French street food (the 
only one of its kind in town). The Crepe Complete – an egg sunny side up with 
Black Forest ham, Swiss cheese and baby arugula – is a must, but you can also 
have your crepe with a sweet Nutella-and-banana filling for dessert. You'll 
find Crepe a Diem at the Franklin Farmers Market every Saturday morning, at 
White's Mercantile or the12 South Farmers Market 
<http://www.12southfarmersmarket.com> for dinner Tuesdays (4pm to 8pm) or 
outside theYazoo Brewing Company <http://yazoobrew.com/> on Fridays.

Smokin Thighs

While fried chicken is the pièce de résistance around Nashville, Matthew 
Carney opted to start a food truck centered upon poultry that is smoked, not 
fried. The result is Smokin Thighs, a meat-centric cart that allows you to 
choose your meat (wings, thighs or legs), style (on the bone, in a pile or on 
Texas toast), flavour (how hot or dry you'd like it), and any toppings or other 
accoutrements. Find Smokin Thighs at CHS (7100 Commerce Way, Brentwood) every 
other week, downtown at 150 Deaderick Street each Thursday from 10.30am to 2pm 
and atCorsair Distillery <http://www.corsairartisan.com/> on Tuesday nights.

The Grilled Cheeserie

How many kinds of grilled cheese combinations can there possibly be? Well, 
lots of them, as far as Crystal De Luna-Bogan is concerned. The Le Cordon 
Bleu-trained chef and her husband Joseph whip up a bevy of melts, patties and 
other comfort food, which they serve from their roaming restaurant. From a 
pimento mac and cheese sandwich to the Harvest Melt – brie, kale and pumpkin 
seed pesto with maple roasted butternut squash – you can get your cheese fix at 
the 12 South Farmers Market every week of the season (from May to October) from 
3pm to 6pm.

Smoke Et Al
 Smoke Et Al, New Orleans 
With its perfectly seasoned meat and smattering of other delicious comfort 
food, Smoke Et Al is one of the most popular trucks in town. It's also hard to 
pin down as it often gets booked out for weddings and other special events. 
Still, if you can find it, you'll want to line up for the Fiddler's Biscuits: 
dough baked with sour cream and sage, topped with shredded smoked chicken, 
drizzled with Tennessee wildflower honey and finished off with local green 
onions. Smoke Et Al can frequently be spotted driving around downtown Nashville 
but camps out at Centennial Park for lunch on Thursdays during warmer months 
and at Church Street Park every other Wednesday.

DoughWorks
 DoughWorks, Nashville 
At this create-your-own doughnut shop, you can add sauces, glazes and icings 
to your order, or have each creation tossed in powdered or cinnamon sugar. 
While the truck boasts sweet and savoury, it's the speciality doughnuts piled 
high with sweetness - like the Amazing Monkey (salted banana caramel, fresh 
banana, toasted walnuts) and the Black Cadillac (cocoa cream, crumbled brownie, 
powdered sugar) - that are so over the top, you can't help but crave them. The 
menu rotates regularly so you never quite know what you'll find on any given 
day.

Bacon Nation

From the BLT to a Tennessee Taco served in a bacon shell, Bacon Nation's menu 
is not for the faint of heart but will keep carnivores satiated. And it only 
gets zanier from there, with items like French fries topped with slow-roasted 
ranch chicken and smothered in whitequeso, sour cream, tomatoes and bacon, and 
even a white chocolate-covered bacon dessert. Bacon Nation alternates Tuesday 
lunch service (beginning at 11am) between Airways Plaza (1281 Murfreesboro 
Park) and Grand Avenue between 19th and 20th Streets. The truck is also at the 
TN Tower (737 7th Avenue North) every other Thursday.

Hoss' Loaded Burgers

What's a food round-up without a mention of some of the most sinful burgers in 
town? Hoss cooks up some fantastic and hearty concoctions, such as the 
Jackalope, a slab of beef filled with provolone and topped with Benton's bacon, 
jalapeno honey mustard and avocado. Hoss' Loaded Burgers stops at 4th and 
Deaderick downtown every other Tuesday for lunch.
