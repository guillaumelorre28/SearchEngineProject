The Coast Guard suspended its search Saturday in Biscayne Bay outside Miami 
for a missing sailor who was a member of the 2012 US Olympic sailing team.

Coast Guard officials in Miami say they received a report Thursday evening 
about an unmanned inflatable dinghy adrift in Dinner Key. Items belonging to 
30-year-old Trevor Moore were onboard.

Moore is from Naples and was last seen wearing a dark shirt and swim shorts.

Capt Michael Long of the Coast Guard said in a news release: “Our thoughts and 
prayers go out to the loved ones affected. Despite the tireless search efforts 
by multiple agencies and good Samaritans, we were unable to find Mr Moore.”

The Coast Guard and partner agencies covered more than 510 square nautical 
miles before suspending the three-day search.
