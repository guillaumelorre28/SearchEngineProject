Uncommon Objects

Nestled among the boutique shops and trendy restaurants of South Congress, 
antique and curios emporium Uncommon Objects has been an Austin must-see since 
1991. This treasure wonderland doesn't host your typical hodge-podge of random 
antiques; it's a carefully curated collection of Pinterest-worthy finds. 
Looking for taxidermied baby chickens to adorn your fireplace mantle? How about 
two-feet tall signage letters to splay across your living room wall? 
Letterpress printing blocks, crystal chandeliers, commissioned family portraits 
of random people or your Great Aunt Stella's collection of eye wear, Uncommon 
Objects has the sort of antique selection to get your creative mojo flowing. By 
the time you leave this store, you'll be itching to sign up for the newest 
interior design reality show.

Room Service Vintage

When it comes to plum vintage pickings for a steal, North Loop's Room Service 
Vintage can't be beaten. Filled from floor to ceiling with furniture, apparel, 
jewellery and knick-knacks with an emphasis on mid-century design, Room Service 
takes customers on a nostalgic trip through the 20th century via Nagel 
replicas, 1930s soda dispensers, beaded curtains and Pucci-inspired couches. 
Unlike similar vintage stores, Room Service strives to keep its prices low and, 
if that weren't enough, every month it features a different themed discount, 
such as 20% off all floral print clothing/furniture or barware.

Feathers Boutique
 Feathers Boutique 
Feathers Boutique's atmosphere shouts New York City, but the prices declare 
Texas. With its diverse selection of women's clothing from the 1920s through to 
the 1990s, and altered for the modern-day gal's needs, Feathers has earned its 
spot as one of Austin's premiere vintage boutiques, since it first opened its 
SoCo doors back in 2005. Not only does the boutique feature an apparel 
selection that could make even Zooey Deschanel smile, it also sells clothing 
and jewelry from local designers as well. The expert buyers at Feathers 
purchase new clothing daily, so don't be surprised if a gem you spotted 
yesterday is gone tomorrow.

New Bohemia

South Congress's New Bohemia is known for its hipster-centric selection of 
women's vintage wear, but what makes this store unique is its selection of the 
great anomaly known as vintage men's clothing. Yes, New Bohemia wants to ensure 
that the gents get their fair share on the Austin fashion scene. Boasting one 
of the city's best selection of 70s and 80s concert T-shirts, pearl snap 
button-downs and cowboy boots, this is where the fashion-conscious men (and 
women) go for a little bit of country and a little bit of rock'n'roll without 
the hefty price tag. And if this store isn't testosterone-rich enough for you, 
check out its brother storeNew BROhemia

No, Cheapo isn't the lost frugal Marx Brother. This second-hand music store, 
located in the former building of the world's very first Whole Foods store, 
offers thousands of recycled CDs, records and tapes to appease not only the 
casual listener, but the avid music geek as well. And boy, are there plenty of 
them in Austin. This florescent-lit, 10,000 sq ft open space doesn't pretend to 
be pretty – Cheapo gets down to business with endless aisles of music featuring 
everything from pop/rock, soundtrack, reggae, Cajun, lounge, classical and 
club. And if music isn't your thing, the store also offers an impressive 
selection of used movies. Who needs the internet when you have Cheapo?

Goodwill Blue Hangar
 Goodwill Blue Hanger vintage store, Austin, Texas 
The Austin area has more than 25 Goodwill locations, but none of them compare 
with the legendary Blue Hangar. Located in a south-east Austin warehouse, this 
is where excess clothing from the surrounding Goodwill locations comes to its 
final resting place before being swept away into your arms. The set-up is this: 
mountains of clothing, accessories, home goods and random stuff are stacked in 
bins for patrons to sift through. This is not your typical thrift-going 
experience, so you must be swift in your selection process; no time to try on, 
no time to dilly-dally. This place is for the most hardened of treasure hunters 
or newbie thrill seekers. If you walk away feeling as though you made a bad 
purchase, don't fret, when you're paying only $1.39 PER POUND you really can't 
lose. Blue Hangar tip: be sure to follow Blue Hangar protocol and be polite; 
the atmosphere can get a little hectic.
