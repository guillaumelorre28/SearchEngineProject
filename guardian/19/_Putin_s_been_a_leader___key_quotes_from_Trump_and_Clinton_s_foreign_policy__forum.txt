On Wednesday evening US presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald 
Trump were quizzed – separately and with different, if sometimes overlapping 
questions –on foreign policy and their suitability to be commander-in-chief 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy>
. Here are the key quotes.

On Isis

Clinton: We are not putting ground troops into Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq> ever again.

Clinton: We have to defeat Isis. That is my highest counterterrorism goal. And 
we’ve got to do it with air power. We’ve got to do it with much more support 
for the Arabs and the Kurds who will fight on the ground against Isis. We have 
to squeeze them by continuing to support the Iraqi military. They’vetaken back 
Ramadi

,Fallujah 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/30/iraqi-forces-enter-fallujah-in-attempt-to-drive-out-islamic-state>
. They’ve got to hold them. They’vegot to now get into Mosul

Clinton: US not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again – video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/clinton-us-not-putting-ground-troops-in-iraq-ever-again-video>
We’re going to work to make sure that they have the support – they have 
special forces, as you know, they have enablers, they have surveillance, 
intelligence, reconnaissance help. They are not going to get ground troops. We 
are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again. And we’re not putting 
ground troops into Syria. We’re going to defeat Isis without committing 
American ground troops.

And as part of it, we’re going after Baghdadi, the leader, because it will 
help us focus our attention, just like going after bin Laden helped us focus 
our attention.

 Trump: I have a plan.


This week Trump said he would, if elected, give generals 30 days to come up 
with a plan to defeat Isis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-us-military-spending-sequester-isis>
. Is this the“secret plan” 
<http://www.mediaite.com/tv/donald-trump-i-know-how-to-defeat-isis-but-im-not-gonna-tell-yet/>
 he’s been mooting through the campaign, he was asked?

Trump: No. But when I do come up with a plan that I like and that perhaps 
agrees with mine, or maybe doesn’t – I may love what the generals come back 
with. I will convene … I have a plan. But I want to be – I don’t want to – 
look. I have a very substantial chance of winning. Make America great again. 
We’re going to make America great again. I have a substantial chance of 
winning. If I win, I don’t want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan 
is.

NBC moderator Matt Lauer: But you’re going to convene a panel of generals, and 
you’ve already said you know more about Isis than those generals do.


Trump: Well, they’ll probably be different generals, to be honest with you.

On Russia

Trump: If Putin says great things about me, I’m going to say great things 
about him.

Trump: I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin. And I 
think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia … He does have an 
82% approval rating …

take the compliment, OK?

If he says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him. 
I’ve already said, he is really very much of a leader. I mean, you can say, oh, 
isn’t that a terrible thing – the man has very strong control over a country. 
Now, it’s a very different system, and I don’t happen to like the system. But 
certainly, in that system, he’s been a leader, far more than our president has 
been a leader.

On terrorism

Clinton: We have to finally pass a law prohibiting people on the terrorist 
watch list from being able to buy a gun.

Clinton: I’m not going to, you know, promise something that I think most 
thinking Americans know is going to be a huge challenge, and here’s why … We’ve 
got to get a lot more cooperation out of Europe, out of the Middle East. We 
have to do a better job of not only collecting and analysing the intelligence 
we do have, but distributing it much more quickly down the ladder to state and 
local law enforcement.

We also have to do a better job combating Isis online, where they recruit, 
where they radicalise … We need to work with Silicon Valley … And here at home, 
for goodness sakes, we have to finally pass a law prohibiting people on the 
terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in the United States of 
America.

Going after American Muslims, defaming a Gold Star family, the family of 
Captain Khan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech>
, making it more difficult for us to have a coalition with Muslim majority 
nations … that is not going to help us to succeed in defeating Isis and 
protecting our American homeland.

On Iraq

Clinton: I have taken responsibility for my decision.

Clinton: I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake. And I 
have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my 
perspective, my mistake. I also believe that it is imperative that we learn 
from the mistakes … I think I’m in the best possible position to be able to 
understand that and prevent it.

Now, my opponent was for the war in Iraq 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/19/donald-trump-confronted-with-past-support-for-iraq-war>
. He says he wasn’t. You can go back and look at the record. He supported it. 
He told Howard Stern he supported it. So he supported it before it happened, he 
supported it as it was happening, and he is on record as supporting it after it 
happened. I have taken responsibility for my decision … He refuses to take 
responsibility for his support.

Trump: I always said: take the oil.

Trump: I was totally against the war in Iraq. From a – you can look at Esquire 
magazine from [20]04. You can look at before that …

The – and I think you know, because you’ve been watching me I think for a long 
time – I’ve always said, shouldn’t be there, but if we’re going to get out, 
take the oil … Just we would leave a certain group behind and you would take 
various sections where they have the oil. They have – people don’t know this 
about Iraq, but they have among the largest oil reserves in the world, in the 
entire world.

And we’re the only ones, we go in, we spend $3tn, we lose thousands and 
thousands of lives, and then … what happens is, we get nothing. You know, it 
used to be to the victor belong the spoils. Now, there was no victor there, 
believe me. There was no victor. But I always said: take the oil.

On Libya

Clinton: Taking that action was the right decision.

Clinton: With respect to Libya, again, there’s no difference between my 
opponent and myself. He’s on record extensively supporting intervention in 
Libya … And I think taking that action was the right decision. Not taking it, 
and permitting there to be an ongoing civil war inLibya 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/libya>, would have been as dangerous and 
threatening as what we are now seeing in Syria.

For Clinton, a skirmish with history. From Trump, an ambush of the facts

Trump: They complicated the mistake by having no management.

Trump: She made a terrible mistake on Libya. And the next thing, I mean, not 
only did she make the mistake, but then they complicated the mistake by having 
no management once they bombed you-know-what out of Gaddafi. I mean, she made a 
terrible mistake on Libya. And part of it was the management after-effect. I 
think that we have great management talents, great management skills.

On the qualities needed to be commander-in-chief

Clinton: Temperament and judgment … An absolute rock steadiness, and mixed 
with strength to be able to make the hard decisions … And these are not easy 
decisions. If they were, they wouldn’t get to the president in the first place.

Trump: I’ve built a great company. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve dealt 
with foreign countries … I think the main thing is I have great judgment. I 
have good judgment. I know what’s going on. I’ve called so many of the shots.

On sexual assault in the military

Trump: It is a massive problem. But we have to do something about that 
problem. And the best thing we can do is set up a court system within the 
military. Right now, the court system practically doesn’t exist. It takes too 
long.

On this tweet from 2013? Well, it is – it is – it is a correct tweet. 
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions. What 
did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?

<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288> 
On the treatment of veterans

Clinton: I was outraged by the stories that came out about the VA 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/23/us-veterans-affairs-whistleblower-health-risks-review>
 [Department of Veterans Affairs] … But I will not let the VA be privatised … I 
rolled out my mental health agenda last week, and I have a whole section 
devoted to veterans’ mental health. And we’ve got to remove the stigma. We’ve 
got to help people currently serving not to feel that if they report their 
sense of unease, their depression, that somehow it’s going to be a mark against 
them.

Trump: Under a part of my plan, if they have that long wait, they walk 
outside, they go to the local doctor, they choose the doctor, they choose the 
hospital, whether it’s public or private, they get themselves better. In many 
cases, it’s a minor procedure or a pill or just a prescription. And they end up 
dying because they can’t get to see the doctor. We will pay the bill. They go 
outside, they get a doctor, they get a prescription, they do what they have to 
do, and we pay the bill. That is something that I have been praised – and, by 
the way, I never said take the VA, take the Veterans Administration private. I 
wouldn’t do that. Too much respect for our people. I would never do that.

Question from veteran Rachel Fredericks: I wanted to ask what your plan will 
be to stop 20 veterans a day from killing themselves.

Trump: And actually it’s 22.

Fact check: it is 20.
