Santa Elena and Salinas


Just outside provincial capital Santa Elena is Museo Los Amantes de Sumpa 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Museo-Amantes-de-Sumpa/299960243449944>. Around 
200 skeletons were unearthed at this site in the 1970s, including the “Lovers 
of Sumpa”, a man and a woman found in an 8,000-year-old embrace. There’s no 
bigger contrast between old and new than the nearby resort of Salinas, a 
wannabe Miami Beach for Guayaquil’s rich set. It’s a comparatively expensive 
resort but has two sheltered beaches. The resort has thumping nightlife in the 
high season between December and April.
• Cocos <http://www.cocos-hostal.com/> (doubles from $40) is the best budget 
option on the waterfront of Salinas, or splash out on colourful ecolodge
Hosteria Ecológica el Faro <http://hosteriaelfaroecolodge.com/> (doubles $100 
B&B) with spacious rooms and tropical gardens with resident parrots and monkeys

Ecuador’s biggest city has come a long way in the past 20 years. A 
once-rundown waterfront has been regenerated, winning UN development awards in 
the process. The waterfront Malecón area’s offerings range from historical 
monuments, artisan markets and botanical gardens to a new ferris wheel and 
several museums, notablyGuayaquil en La Historia 
<http://www.guayaquilesmidestino.com/en/museums/simon-bolivar-pier/guayaquil-in-history-miniature-museum>
, which documents the city’s turbulent past. The climb through the artistic 
district of Las Peňas to the lighthouse at the top is another highlight, while 
the harbour and promenade of Puerto Santa Ana is the latest addition to the 
waterfront scene. Don’t miss the Iguana Park, beneath the neo-gothic cathedral, 
where reptiles roam free, and across the river, set in mangroves, caiman, 
monkeys and parakeets can be observed in theParque Histórico 
<http://www.guayaquilesmidestino.com/en/nature/out-of-guayaquil/Historic-Park>.

The closest beach resort to Guayaquil is the vibrant Playas, as unpretentious 
as its name (which means beaches). At weekends in high season, between 
Christmas and Easter, it gets packed with people from the city escaping the 
heat. The main draw is the long beach and rows of beach cafes offering 
sumptuous specialities, such as shrimp ceviche and fried sea bass in garlic. 
The surfing is good here, too; but for a break from sun and sand, head a few 
miles east (half an hour by bus) to Puerto El Morro, where boat trips wind 
through the mangroves with opportunities to watch dolphins in the channel. 
There is also a small colony of frigatebirds and blue-footed boobies.

A Latin American beach party takes some beating so, if you’re looking to dance 
the night away, go to this surfer-friendly village. Those seeking a quieter 
beach break should head further north. For surfers, the rideable breaks reach 
two-to-three metres on good days, while for partygoers it’s busy at weekends, 
particularly between Christmas and Easter. Hola Ola andCaňa Grill 
<https://www.facebook.com/Ca%C3%B1a-Grill-Monta%C3%B1ita-142373109145809/> are

 Blue-footed boobies on Isla de la Plata. Photograph: Getty Images 
This national park <http://visitpuertolopez.com/> is one of the country’s few 
protected coastal regions, and boasts stellar scenery of tropical dry forest 
leading directly onto pristine beaches. Isla de la Plata, 25 miles off the 
coast is rather unfairly tagged “the poor man’s Galápagos” for its populations 
of frigatebirds and blue-footed boobies, as well as a small colony of sea 
lions. From June to September, humpback whales converge on these waters, with 
great opportunities to watch them twirling out of the ocean. The mainland 
national park contains tropical dry forest and cloud forest, and the 
crescent-shaped Playa Los Frailes is arguably the most beautiful beach in the 
country – and often deserted.
• The best budget accommodation is in the village of Puerto Lopez in a cabin 
at Itapoa (hosteriaitapoa.com <http://www.hosteriaitapoa.com/>, doubles from 
$16) in a garden set back from the beach, or try the mid-rangeHosteria Mandala

Locals shout from the rooftops that Panama hats are actually from Ecuador. The 
misconception dates to 1906 when the president, Eloy Alfaro, ordered more than 
200,000 hats to be sent north for toiling workers constructing the canal. US 
president Theodore Roosevelt was pictured in newspapers wearing one during a 
canal visit and the name “Panama hat” stuck. The hats originate from the 
toquilla palm shoots farmed around Montecristi and there’s no better hat to be 
found than the tightly woven superfinos. They are far cheaper here than outside 
Ecuador but top-quality hats still fetch several hundred dollars (standard hats 
are far cheaper at under $50). Montecristi itself does not have a wealth of 
tourist attractions beyond hat shopping but its status as Alfaro’s birthplace, 
a hero of current president, Rafael Correa, has raised the town’s profile. A
museum documenting the life of Alfaro 
<http://www.elcomercio.com/tendencias/eloy-alfaro-museo-montecristi.html> is 
fascinating, together with a spectacular copper sculpture in the mausoleum.
• There are very few good accommodation options in Montecristi so go to the 
fishing village of La Crucita (an hour by bus via Manta), which has an emerging 
kite-surfing scene. Stay at beachfrontHotel Voladores

This small city has a spectacular location on the coast, perched on a sandy 
peninsula reaching from the mouth of the river Chone into the Pacific. It’s 
arguably the most ecologically sound urban area in Ecuador, thanks to a 
well-organised local effort. Around town, the museumMuseo Banco Central

<https://www.lonelyplanet.com/ecuador/bahia-de-caraquez/attractions/mirador-la-cruz/a/poi-sig/1298233/363351>

Although badly hit by the April 2016 earthquake

, this fishing village has recovered and is still one of the most pleasant 
resorts in the country with a small, friendly, expat community. It’s also an 
excellent surfing spot: the 10 miles of beach break with no rocks, riptide or 
reef are good for beginners and advanced surfers, and it’s popular with kite 
surfers later in the year. For a taste of the region’s burgeoning eco-tourism, 
10 miles north of town is theRio Muchacho <http://www.riomuchacho.com/> organic 
farm, which produces fruit, vegetables, jams, coffee and chocolate. The farm 
can be visited on a one-day tour or you can stay for a few days. Ride horses,

A hilltop town in the southern Andean foothills, the pace of life in Zaruma is 
reassuringly slow and best enjoyed over a cup of coffee (the finest in Ecuador, 
it is claimed). It’s worth exploring the town’s mining heritage – the story 
goes that a local miner found a huge chunk of gold here in the 16th century and 
sent it to Spain as a gift for King Felipe II. The king promptly reduced taxes 
from one fifth to a one sixth of income, giving theEl Sexmo mine 
<https://www.lonelyplanet.com/ecuador/zaruma/attractions/la-mina-el-sexmo/a/poi-sig/1504279/1317947>
 its name. It is now a tourist attraction with an accompanying small museum. 
The dramatic hills in the region offer great walking and nearby Bueneventura 
reserve is rich in wildlife, including monkeys and 24 species of hummingbirds.

The largest petrified forest in South America covers about 6,000 acres in the 
south of Ecuador, just five miles from the Peruvian border. Experts believe 
that a volcanic eruption followed by a flood caused the petrification. Follow 
the trails to see fossilised plants, fish and ammonites dating from the 
Cretaceous period embedded in the tree trunks. The surrounding tropical dry 
forest hosts 130 species of birds, and a plunge in a stream is a welcome 
cool-off. Puyango is not very accessible but a couple of buses daily run to and 
from Machala (2.5 hours).
• There is basic accommodation in the nearby village of Alamor but it is 
better to take a bus toGrand Hotel Americano <http://www.hotelesmachala.com/> 
(doubles from $50) in Machala or go to Zaruma
