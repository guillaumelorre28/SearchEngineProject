The result will be of secondary importance to Watford after the death of 
Graham Taylor

. They will, however, hope to arrest a slide that has secured only one point 
from five matches. The loan signing Tom Cleverley could start, while Heurelho 
Gomes and José Holebas return from illness. Middlesbrough will miss Gaston 
Ramírez but the £6m striker Rudy Gestede could make his debut.Paul MacInnes
