During the first game of the fourth set, play was halted as fans called for an 
EpiPen – used to treat life-threatening allergic reactions – after a female 
spectator became ill.

Istomi, the world No59, got off to a fine start producing nine of his 23 aces 
in a first set that also saw him win 88% of points on his first serve. He won 
the tie-break but the momentum began to turn towards Tomic.

In a second set that featured three breaks, it was the Australian who managed 
two to pull in front. From then on, Istomin was unable to do telling damage on 
the Tomic serve, squandering 10 break points, and the home favourite progressed 
to the second round, where he will face Italy’s Simone Bolelli, the world No64.

In response to the frantic calls for treatment for the woman, a fan in the 
upper part of the Hisense Arena in Melbourne tossed an EpiPen to another 
spectator, which started a chain reaction of passes until it finally reached 
its target. Paramedics arrived within minutes of the woman being treated and 
she was helped into a wheelchair and taken from the arena to a huge round of 
applause.

Australia’s Tomic, the No16 seed, and Istomin looked on with concern before 
they were able to resume the match.

Tomic said: “Potentially someone’s dying and we’re not sure what’s going on. 
At one stage I was looking directly at the lady. It was not a good moment to be 
in. At the end of the day, tennis is tennis, sport is sport. But if someone 
passes out or dies on a tennis court, it can be very bad.”
