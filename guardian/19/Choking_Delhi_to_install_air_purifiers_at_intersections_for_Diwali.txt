Delhi’s government will install air purifiers and mist-making devices at major 
road intersections in the Indian capital to curb choking levels of pollution.


Delhi has been shrouded in a toxic soup as residents gear up for the Hindu 
festival of lights,Diwali <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/diwali>, 
which is marked by ear-splitting fireworks that cause days of dark smoke.

Delhi's air pollution is a classic case of environmental injustice

“We are planning to install air purifiers at five major intersections in Delhi 
to reduce pollution levels,” said Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain.

“We also want to try to install a mist fountain at one of these intersections 
… we want to do this at the earliest, maybe within a month or two,” he said, 
adding that the mist would “help pollutants settle”.

India’s state-run air quality authority showed levels of harmful PM 2.5 
particles hovering between “very poor” and “severe” in the past week.

These fine particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter are linked to 
higher rates of chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and heart disease

 as they settle into the lungs and can pass into the bloodstream.

Jain urged residents not to light crackers this Diwali on Sunday, saying 
respiratory problems had sharply spiked in Delhi – rated as one of the world’s 
most polluted cities.

The Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) issued a warning on 
Friday on “the deadly impact” of letting off firecrackers at the onset of 
winter when the air is already saturated.

The government also said it would convert a coal-fired power plant into a 
waste-to-energy plant by December 2017.

New Delhi’s air quality has steadily worsened over the years, a consequence of 
rapid urbanisation that has brought pollution from diesel engines, coal-fired 
power plants and industrial emissions.

It also suffers from atmospheric dust, burning of crop stubble in farms around 
the city and pollution from open fires lit by the urban poor to keep warm in 
winter and cook food.
