Star choreographer Benjamin Millepied 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance-blog/2015/feb/04/benjamin-millepied-paris-opera-sidi-larbi-cherkaoui-royal-ballet-flanders-top-jobs>
 has announced his resignation fromParis Opera Ballet 
<https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/artists/ballet>, little more than a year after 
he arrived with a promise to radically shake up one of the world’s oldest and 
largest dance companies.


In a statement <https://twitter.com/B_Millepied/status/695212371556589568>, 
Millepied said he was leaving “only for personal reasons” and to take more time 
to devote himself “100% to artistic and creative expression”.

Millepied – who is married to Hollywood star Natalie Portman – took over 
France’s most prestigious ballet company 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jan/25/benjamin-millepied-paris-opera-ballet>
 little more than a year ago. He had been due to unveil his new season next 
week, but it was clear that all was not well after he lambasted the ballet’s 
hierarchical structure in a French television documentary.

His shock departure came only a day before the world premiere of his latest 
work at the ballet, ironically titled The Night Ends.

Although Millepied, 38, insisted that “the ties that bind me to this beautiful 
institution mean that I will always be at its side”, his early exit is a major 
blow to both parties.

Millepied and Portman had brought a huge injection of glamour – and 
sponsorship cash – to the venerableParis 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris> institution.

But Millepied’s impatience for change grated with some, even as younger 
members of the company revelled in the opportunities he opened up for them.

“I was much honoured [being ballet director] but what’s important to me is to 
create, to be inspired by the dancers, and today this job, as it exists, is not 
made for me,” Millepied told a packed news conference at the Palais Garnier, 
explaining his decision to quit.

His fairytale return to France in 2014 followed a string of international 
successes after he founded the acclaimedLA Dance Project 
<http://www.ladanceproject.com/#new-page-1> and married Portman, whom he met on 
the set of the film Black Swan. She later won a best actress Oscar for her 
portrayal of a tortured ballerina.

In a behind-the-scenes documentary aired on the Canal+ channel just before 
Christmas, the dancer turned choregrapher, who made his name at the New York 
CityBallet <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ballet>, did not hide his 
unhappiness with the way the Paris company was run.

Millepied claimed that the ballet was hidebound, too hierarchical and obsessed 
with internal competition. Nor was it as “excellent” as it claimed to be, he 
said, and performances sometimes looked like “wallpaper … and were deadly 
boring”.

“Is this no fun?” he cried at one point, appealing to his dancers to “let 
themselves go” in the classical ballet as they did in contemporary dance pieces.

For all the ballet’s faults, he said its troupe could be “perhaps the best 
modern dance group in the world”.

Even as he announced his first season in 2014, Millepied had told AFP that the 
ballet was stuck in the past. “It is no longer 1830, [yet] there are things 
from that period like the hierarchy, the rigid internal competition for 
promotion.”

The high-profile French ballet dancer Aurélie Dupont has replaced him at the 
head of the company. The 43-year-old who started her career at the École de 
Danse de l’Opéra as an 11-year-old and ended it last spring, hinted that under 
her, the company might be more traditional than under Millepied.

“He brought a lot of contemporary choreographers ... and new choreographic 
experiences,” she said. “I will do my best, I promise. I love the dancers, 
deeply. I want to give theétoiles the ballets in which they will shine.”

 She added: “To me the Opera de Paris remains a classical dancers’ company 
open to contemporary dance and it’s not the other way around.”

The director of Paris Opera <https://www.operadeparis.fr/en>, Stéphane 
Lissner, paid tribute to Millepied, saying: “He brought a lot to the ballet. 
Being the ballet director and a much sought-after choreographer was causing him 
trouble … Aurélie will bring a lot of other things [when] she takes up her post 
in September.”
