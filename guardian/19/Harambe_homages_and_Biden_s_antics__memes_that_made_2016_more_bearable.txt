Levity may not be the first thing people think of when they consider the year 
2016. But there was diversion from this year’s most popular internet memes. Not 
all were positive. Or amusing. But here we go!

The mannequin challenge

Finally, a challenge that didn’t involve an obscure Facebook acquaintance 
ordering you to do something you don’t want to do. (See: ice-bucket challenge, 
push-up challenge.)

The Mannequin Challenge was a big viral hit in the latter half of 2016. It 
involves a load of people standing very still – almost as if they were 
mannequins – while another person films them. Hilarity ensues.

A group of high school students in Jacksonville, Florida, reportedly started 
the trend <http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mannequin-challenge>. Some of the most 
popular includethe Pittsburgh Steelers standing still 
<http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/pittsburgh-steelers-mannequin-challenge-internet-video-110416>
 in their dressing room and Mississippi hip-hop duo Rae Sremmurdperforming the 
mannequin challenge mid-show <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv7q1RF8UrU>.

No one was safe from the mannequin challenge. Not even those in prison – a 
group of inmatesundertook the challenge 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvu0QHTgJaw> in an Alabama jail. 

In hindsight the worst mannequin challenge, or at least the most ill-judged, 
may have beenthe one Hillary Clinton and her campaign staff performed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/08/hillary-and-bill-clinton-do-mannequin-challenge-video>
 on election day. She lost the election a few hours later.

Harambe

Who can forget Harambe 
<http://mancunion.com/2016/12/z01/harambe-and-the-magic-of-memes/>, the lovable 
gorillashot to death <http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/30/us/gorilla-shot-harambe/> 
by staff at Cincinnati zoo after a three-year-old boy fell into his enclosure. 
The 450lb silverback, blessed with a noble bearing and a regal-sounding name 
(Harambe is Swahili for “togetherness”) was given a fond send-off by seemingly 
millions of memes.

“Bush did Harambe” <https://twitter.com/marincogan/status/756129001509416960> 
was a popular one. There wasHarambe driving next to Vin Diesel 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1aYXPw6iUQ> in Furious 7. Harambe was 
imagined as Private Ryan 
<https://i.redditmedia.com/yykCtTNj8paoBEAcrPMS0WHZi9Br29vAcPIPm93LC64.jpg?w=320&s=5bf39aa302296923da172343bb61a7ff>
. There were also songs, although many weren’t very good.

Public Policy Polling included Harambe as a presidential candidate on some of 
their surveys, with the deceased silverback winning 5% support in July and 2% 
in August.


On election day some people reportedly wrote in Harambe’s name 
<http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Talk-of-Write-In-Votes-For-Harambe-Numbering-Thousands-Sweeping-the-Internet-After-2016-Election-400564061.html>
 on their presidential ballots, but ultimately the gorilla did not win enough 
votes to serve as commander-in-chief.

Michael Phelps and his angry face

Phelps, a previously unheralded swimmer from the United States, sprang to fame 
when he was captured looking extremely angry as his South African rival, Chad 
Le Clos, pranced about in front of him ahead of their 200m butterfly Olympic 
semi-final.

It was an apparent attempt to psych Phelps out. It didn’t work. Phelps 
finished ahead of Le Clos in the semi-final then won gold in the final. Le Clos 
came fourth.

The memes – showing an image of Phelps’ angry face – came thick and fast. “tfw 
u wanted gryffindor but were sorted into hufflepuff,”wrote Twitter user 
@taylortrudon <https://twitter.com/taylortrudon/status/762837979383463936>. 

“When you found out that Vanilla Ice’s real name is Robert Van Winkle,” said 
@records and radio 
<https://twitter.com/recordsANDradio/status/762839977860304897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw>
 – a reference to the singer of the 1990 hit, Ice Ice Baby.

Some were more succinct. “Cargo shorts,” chimed @shirklesxp.

The Obama-Biden bromance

In hindsight the special relationship between Barack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> and Joe Biden may have been 
the main highlight for Democrats in 2016.

The pair’s close friendship was well known before 2016 – the number of 
photographsshowing them sharing intimate moments 
<http://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/g7653/barack-obama-joe-biden-funny-photos/?>
 is a testament to that – but it was after Trump was elected that the 
Obama-Biden memes really took off.

Most portray Biden in his long-established role as the president’s fun-loving, 
prankster sidekick. Frequently at the expense of Trump-Pence’s impending 
takeover of the White House.

Pepe the frog

Much less heartwarming was the rise of Pepe the frog. Pepe first appeared in a 
comic called Boy’s Club,the LA Times reported 
<http://%20http//www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-pepe-the-frog-hate-symbol-20161011-snap-htmlstory.html>
 – but the frog began to be appropriated by certain 4chan and Reddit users as a 
racist icon around 2015.

The Anti-Defamation League labelled Pepe a hate symbol 
<http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/pepe-the-frog.html#.WFGUIqJpGi4>
 in September 2016 after use of the frog alongside racist messaging 
proliferated among the “alt-right”.

Pepe has been portrayed wearing a yarmulke and smirking in front of an image 
<https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwiTjbuHrvTQAhXJbSYKHYboDx4QjBwIBA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mic.com%2Fkqmz4k17unf4arp8qem0wdfruruncgdas7tkbk0ybogoumqjugy8rseorffpaieg.jpg&psig=AFQjCNFu3WG4kU25oB8GJSD0k1CtYjtnSQ&ust=1481827951226372>
 of the burning Twin Towers. He has been seensporting a Hitler-esque moustache 
<https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwidrbz6rfTQAhUB3yYKHRLvBu0QjBwIBA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.informationliberation.com%2Ffiles%2Fnazi-pepes-maddow.jpg&psig=AFQjCNFu3WG4kU25oB8GJSD0k1CtYjtnSQ&ust=1481827951226372>
. Andmuch more 
<https://www.google.com/search?q=pepe+the+frog+racist+meme&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwie9460rfTQAhVHl5AKHSbhALcQ_AUICCgB&biw=806&bih=740#imgrc=UyS4Vw3ufXGa7M%3A>
.

During the presidential campaign Pepe caught the attention of Donald Trump Jr, 
who posted an Instagram photograph showing prominent Trump supporters. Pepe was 
among them.

Trump Jr later insisted 
<http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-jr-pepe-the-frog-228268> he 
had “never even heard of Pepe the frog”.

Pokémon Go

You had to/in some cases still do have to catch them all. It depends on your 
attention span.

Whether you liked Pokémon Go or not – and many people did not – it was 
certainly a big deal in 2016. It wasGoogle’s top trending search 
<http://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-is-googles-top-trending-search-term-of-/1100-6446269/>
 for the year – apparently the app isthe only thing capable of beating Donald 
Trump <https://www.google.com/trends/yis/2016/GLOBAL>.

Pokémon Go meme highlights include people pairing the app with nature-slaying 
hard man Bear Grylls 
<https://www.google.com/search?q=pokemon+go+memes&safe=off&espv=2&biw=784&bih=810&tbm=isch&imgil=9JPZZ6TBOwmzPM%253A%253Bu3LZfyZ2Zb4gxM%253Bhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.quora.com%25252FWhat-are-some-funny-Pok%25252525C3%25252525A9mon-GO-memes-and-pictures&source=iu&pf=m&fir=9JPZZ6TBOwmzPM%253A%252Cu3LZfyZ2Zb4gxM%252C_&usg=__c-7aYIadXcHSslCl9yiQL7i0y9I%3D&ved=0ahUKEwj35YDFuvTQAhUMmJAKHT8PA8AQyjcIMw&ei=r6JRWLfSFYywwgS_noyADA#safe=off&tbm=isch&q=pokemon+go+bear+grylls&imgdii=4smvZ3MBmZCmPM%3A%3B4smvZ3MBmZCmPM%3A%3BpXvvcuQ7BlmpaM%3A&imgrc=4smvZ3MBmZCmPM%3A>
. The resulting images involved Grylls travelling long distances to capture a 
Pokemon, often drinking his own urine in the process.

Other memes saw Forest Gump sprinting 
<http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/50/06/51/10512980/3/1024x1024.jpg> upon learning 
the location of a Pokémon – specifically, a Charizard – andBreaking Bad’s 
Heisenberg ordering
