Full time: Ivory Coast 0-0 Togo

The first rule of tournament football is you shall not  talk about tourn  lose 
the first game, and that fear dominated a poor game. We shouldn’t underestimate 
how good a result that is for Togo, however. Thanks for your company, night!

88 min Aurier heads Grazel’s diniked cross just wide. It was a really good 
effort, flicked deliberately towards the far corner. The keeper was nowhere 
near it and it drifted past the post.

84 min Adebayor has had a paternal influence on the game, moving all over the 
field, trying to be involved in everything. It’s quite sweet actually. Togo 
have been terrific, they fully deserve a draw. Their two wingers, Bebou and 
Dossevi, have both looked really dangerous at times.

80 min The lively Dossevi bursts into the box on the right and dinks the ball 
onto the roof of the net. I’m not sure whether that was a mishit cross or an 
attempt to chip Gbouhou, but it doesn’t really matter either way.

79 min Bony beats Ouro with a stepover and is flattened just outside the area. 
The free-kick is a fair way to the left of centre and Aurier clatters it into 
the wall.

78 min That was a chance for Togo. Adebayor plays a nice reverse ball down the 
left to Bebou, whose cross is headed over from near the penalty spot by Laba. 
It looked a great chance, though replays showed it took a small but vital 
deflection off a defender just before it reached Laba.

73 min I suppose, as terrible as this game has been, the result would be okay 
for both sides. Ivory Coast still have two winnable games to come against DR 
Congo and Morocco, while Togo -who got to this tournament by going through the 
cat-flap in the back door 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Africa_Cup_of_Nations_qualification> - 
would still have hope of sneaking through the group.

71 min “Hello from the United States,” says Joe Harvey. “As an academy 
washout, and a man who plays with some former professionals, how crap they are 
in 5 a side depends mostly on what made them special when they were pros. There 
are a fair amount of good players for whom once the pace is gone, the game is 
completely gone. Not that they aren’t functional and you wouldn’t want them on 
your team- practicing 5 days a week for however many years has its benefits, 
they just don’t set themselves apart from the pack in a very competitive 
league. It’s rare that they can take over a match. There are exceptions - I 
played with a guy who should still be playing at Werder Bremen, and he would 
single-handedly wrest the match from even very good opposing teams.”

On that note, I saw one of the Brazil 1998 World Cup squad playing 
seven-a-side recently and, seriously, he wasrubbish.

68 min Zaha surges down the right onto a long pass, does a Cruyff-turn on the

heading towards the corner.

59 min Zaha has been the most vivacious and probably the best attacker on the 
pitch. He plays a good pass down the line to Kessie, whose cross is headed 
clear.

57 min Kodija wins a corner for Ivory Coast on the left. It’s played short to 
Zaha, who surges past Atakora on the edge of the box and hits a rising drive 
not far over the top. The keeper had it covered but it was good play from Zaha.

53 min Serey Die fouls Laba, 30 yards from goal. Ayite decides not to shoot on 
goal, instead playing it wide to Gakpe. As the ball bounces up he heads it way 
from Traore, who accidentally kicks him flush in the coupon. Kapow! Another 
free-kick for Togo, this time just outside the box on the right. Dossevi 
overhits it and, though Adebayor stretches to head the ball back into the area, 
the attack soon fizzles out. Togo made a not inconsiderable Horlicks of two 
free-kicks in very good positions.

Half-time crapchat

“Rob,” says Steve Johnson. “You undersell how good many of these crap players 
are. You could stick most of them in a Championship side and they would stand 
out, never mind embarrassing your average Booze-Ravaged Middle Aged Wednesday 
Night 5-a-Siders. In fact there are a lot of ‘crap’ players who are not 
actually crap at all, but received wisdom or fashion or whatever it is deems 
them to be so. I know what I’m talking about. I am a Stockport County fan and 
over the years we have had a lot of crap players…”

Yes, good point. And if anyone says Stockport’s Kevin Francis was crap, I’ll 
take an eye out.

The first rule of tournament football is you shall not  talk about tourn  lose 
the first game, and that fear dominated a poor game. We shouldn’t underestimate 
how good a result that is for Togo, however. Thanks for your company, night!
 
90 min Added minutes there will be three.
 
89 min Togo’s final substitution: Razak Boukari replaces the terrific Adebayor.
 
88 min Aurier heads Grazel’s diniked cross just wide. It was a really good 
effort, flicked deliberately towards the far corner. The keeper was nowhere 
near it and it drifted past the post.
 
87 min Togo make another substitution, with Dossevi replaced by Komlan 
Agbegniadan.

84 min Adebayor has had a paternal influence on the game, moving all over the 
field, trying to be involved in everything. It’s quite sweet actually. Togo 
have been terrific, they fully deserve a draw. Their two wingers, Bebou and 
Dossevi, have both looked really dangerous at times.
 
81 min Togo replace Laba with Serge Akakpo, and Ivory Coast bring on 
Bournemouth’s Max Gradel for Aston Villa’s Kodija.
 
80 min The lively Dossevi bursts into the box on the right and dinks the ball 
onto the roof of the net. I’m not sure whether that was a mishit cross or an 
attempt to chip Gbouhou, but it doesn’t really matter either way.
 
79 min Bony beats Ouro with a stepover and is flattened just outside the area. 
The free-kick is a fair way to the left of centre and Aurier clatters it into 
the wall.
 
78 min That was a chance for Togo. Adebayor plays a nice reverse ball down the 
left to Bebou, whose cross is headed over from near the penalty spot by Laba. 
It looked a great chance, though replays showed it took a small but vital 
deflection off a defender just before it reached Laba.
 
77 min Almost a chance for Togo. Dossevi’s free-kick from the right flashes 
dangerously across the six-yard box before being cleared.
 
76 min Ivory Coast are starting to have more of the ball, though you couldn’t 
really say they are dominating as they aren’t creating anything.
 
73 min I suppose, as terrible as this game has been, the result would be okay 
for both sides. Ivory Coast still have two winnable games to come against DR 
Congo and Morocco, while Togo -who got to this tournament by going through the 
cat-flap in the back door 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Africa_Cup_of_Nations_qualification> - 
would still have hope of sneaking through the group.
 
71 min “Hello from the United States,” says Joe Harvey. “As an academy 
washout, and a man who plays with some former professionals, how crap they are 
in 5 a side depends mostly on what made them special when they were pros. There 
are a fair amount of good players for whom once the pace is gone, the game is 
completely gone. Not that they aren’t functional and you wouldn’t want them on 
your team- practicing 5 days a week for however many years has its benefits, 
they just don’t set themselves apart from the pack in a very competitive 
league. It’s rare that they can take over a match. There are exceptions - I 
played with a guy who should still be playing at Werder Bremen, and he would 
single-handedly wrest the match from even very good opposing teams.”

On that note, I saw one of the Brazil 1998 World Cup squad playing 
seven-a-side recently and, seriously, he wasrubbish.
 
70 min One Wilfried replaces another for Ivory Coast: Bony for Zaha. That’s a 
surprise as Zaha has been a threat, especially in the last 10 minutes.

Sanogo/AFP/Getty Images  
68 min Zaha surges down the right onto a long pass, does a Cruyff-turn on the 
run to get past Djene and moves infield before hitting a left-footed shot that 
is superbly blocked by Gakpe. That shot was certainly on target and possibly 
heading towards the corner.
 
67 min Bebou, who has been sporadically dangerous down the left for Togo, runs 
at Aurier and wins a corner. It’s headed clear.
 
66 min So anyway, who do you reckon did shoot JR?
 
65 min Ivory Coast make their first change: Seri off, Doukoure on.
 
62 min Kessie is given a soft free-kick just outside the Toga area. Kalou 
wafts it over the bar; Phil Podolsky winces knowingly.
 
59 min Zaha has been the most vivacious and probably the best attacker on the 
pitch. He plays a good pass down the line to Kessie, whose cross is headed 
clear.
 
57 min Kodija wins a corner for Ivory Coast on the left. It’s played short to 
Zaha, who surges past Atakora on the edge of the box and hits a rising drive 
not far over the top. The keeper had it covered but it was good play from Zaha.
 
55 min Kodija heads a simple chance wide from eight yards, then finds out he 
was offside anyway.
 
53 min Serey Die fouls Laba, 30 yards from goal. Ayite decides not to shoot on 
goal, instead playing it wide to Gakpe. As the ball bounces up he heads it way 
from Traore, who accidentally kicks him flush in the coupon. Kapow! Another 
free-kick for Togo, this time just outside the box on the right. Dossevi 
overhits it and, though Adebayor stretches to head the ball back into the area, 
the attack soon fizzles out. Togo made a not inconsiderable Horlicks of two 
free-kicks in very good positions.
 
49 min “Hi Rob,” says Kelvin. “Stockport’s Kevin Francis was crap... Please 
post before and after pictures.”

I wasn’t talking about my eyes, Kelvin.
 
48 min The players have seen the sleepy start to the first half and lowered 
it. The lack of urgency on both sides, even allowing for the inevitable 
first-match-of-the-tournament caution, has verged on the weird.
 
47 min David Edson has contributed to the Adebayor love-in, sending in the 
below clip. I hadn’t seen that before. It’s a rare type of goal: the 
close-range screamer.
 
46 min Emmanuel Adebayor begins the second half for Togo.
 
Half-time crapchat

“Rob,” says Steve Johnson. “You undersell how good many of these crap players 
are. You could stick most of them in a Championship side and they would stand 
out, never mind embarrassing your average Booze-Ravaged Middle Aged Wednesday 
Night 5-a-Siders. In fact there are a lot of ‘crap’ players who are not 
actually crap at all, but received wisdom or fashion or whatever it is deems

over the years we have had a lot of crap players…”

Yes, good point. And if anyone says Stockport’s Kevin Francis was crap, I’ll 
take an eye out.
 
That was not the greatest half of football in the history of mankind. It 
probably wasn’t in the top gazillion. But the second half will be better! Right?
 
45+1 min Dossevi yelps for a penalty when a cross hits the arm of Traore. He 
was jumping on the spot, imploring anyone and everyone to give a penalty. It 
did hit Traore’s arm but I think it deflected off his chest and certainly 
wasn’t deliberate.
