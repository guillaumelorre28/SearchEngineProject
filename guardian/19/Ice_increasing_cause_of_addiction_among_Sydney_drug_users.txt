Amphetamine addiction has become the leading problem for Sydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> residents seeking treatment 
for drug and alcohol dependence, figures suggest.

Australia’s largest rehabilitation service, Odyssey House, revealed on Monday 
in its annual report that 49% of its clients in the city cited amphetamine-type 
stimulants, such as ice, as their main reason for seeking treatment.

Odyssey House’s chief executive, Julie Babineau, said it was simply a matter 
of supply and demand. “The reason that people in addiction like it 
[methamphetamine] is that they can get it more pure, they really get their kick 
right away and it is a lot more addictive,” she said. “It is more accessible 
and cheaper.

“That is also why alcohol has been stable over the years. It is legal and it 
is readily available so when things get too expensive or it is hard to get 
people will substitute the drug with alcohol.”

Alcohol remained a significant problem during the year, nominated by 20% of 
clients as their principal drug of concern, down 9% from 2015.

While addiction to heroin and prescription opioids was down 45% on the 
previous year, Babineau warned that there could easily be another surge. “It 
fluctuates more than shares,” she said.

Odyssey House had a 164% rise in opioid admissions last year and a 20% fall in 
amphetamine admissions.

“It is really a question of accessibility, cost and the purity of the drug 
that they want,” Babineau said. “They need something every day, they need 
something all the time.”

The average age for first intoxication using alcohol or other drugs was as 
young as 12 to 13 years old, compared with 16 to 17 in 2003. “I think it is 
incredibly sad to see people at that age have their first intoxication and I 
suspect there is a big issue with society in general.”
