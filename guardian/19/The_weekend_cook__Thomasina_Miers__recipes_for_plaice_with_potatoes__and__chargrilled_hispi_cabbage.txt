Memorable food often comes from humble beginnings. When I was at cookery 
school in Cork, I remember a party atGubbeen Farm <http://www.gubbeen.com> 
where a deceptively simple soup of potatoes, thyme and chorizo oil left me 
mesmerised; this was all of 15 years ago, but I remember it as clearly as 
yesterday. I have had similar epiphanies, including atNoma in Copenhagen 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/rene-redzepi> (a charred spring onion 
puree) and atHartwood in Tulum, Mexico 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/24/a-plate-in-the-sun-restaurants-food-critics-winter-recipes>
 (wood-baked beetroot), so I hope you’ll give today’s simple-sounding recipes a 
go: they are comforting, rich in flavour and deeply satisfying.

Plaice with potatoes baked in anchovy cream

The garlicky anchovy cream blankets the spuds, and the oven turns them into a 
silky, golden mass. Serves six.

1kg white floury potatoes
2 lemons, 1 cut into wedges, the other halved
1 large or 2 medium onions
½ head garlic
6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
10 anchovy fillets
1 dried chilli, crumbled
500ml double cream
3-4 branches rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped
1 small handful fresh thyme sprigs
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1.2kg plaice

Peel the spuds and cut into 1- to 2mm-thick slices (use a mandoline, if you 
have one). Put the slices in a bowl, cover with cold water and squeeze in the 
juice of half a lemon. Peel the onion and cut it in half, then into wafer-thin 
slices.

Bash the head of garlic with a rolling pin to separate the cloves, then whack 
each clove once or twice, to break the skin. Peel off and discard the skins, 
then finely chop the garlic. Heat four tablespoons of the oil in a frying pan 
on a medium flame, then fry the garlic, anchovies and chilli, breaking up the 
anchovies with a wooden spoon. Don’t let the garlic burn – if it starts 
catching, turn down the heat a little. After a few minutes, the garlic should 
be soft and not coloured, and the anchovies dissolved into a paste. Add the 
cream and the rosemary and thyme leaves (reserve a few thyme stalks for later). 
Bring to a simmer, then take off the heat and season to taste (the anchovies 
are already salty, so you may not need much salt).

Heat the oven to 160C/320F/gas mark 2½. Drain and pat dry the potatoes and put 
back in the bowl. Add the onion and the cream mix, toss to combine, then 
arrange in two overlapping layers in a wide baking dish. Pour over any cream 
left in the bowl and gently press down the mix to level it out. Top with the 
reserved thyme stalks and bake for an hour.

Remove the spuds and leave them to rest while you get on with the fish. Turn 
up the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Cut the remaining lemon half into very 
thin slices and lay over a medium baking tray, making a bed for the plaice. Put 
the fish on top, drizzle over the rest of the oil, season generously and bake 
for 20 minutes, until tender and flaking apart.

Divide the fish between six plates and serve with the potatoes and wedges of 
lemon. Follow with a well-dressed, crisp green salad.

This unusual meat- and dairy-free main course works without the chilli relish, 
which you have to make ahead of time, but it is very special with it. If your 
local shops don’t stock anchos, they are widely available online from the big 
supermarkets as well as independents. Serves four.

For the ancho relish
8 ancho (or aleppo) chillies, stems removed, deseeded
3 banana shallots, peeled and finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
150ml red-wine vinegar
300ml olive oil

For the celeriac mash
60ml olive oil
1kg celeriac, peeled and cut into 1cm cubes
3 sprigs fresh thyme, picked and chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped

For the cabbage
2 hispi cabbages, outer leaves discarded, cut into quarters through stem
2 big handfuls each parsley and tarragon leaves, roughly chopped

First make the relish. Roughly rip up the chillies, then pulse in a food 
processor until broken into pieces the size of small snowflakes. Transfer to a 
bowl, then stir in the rest of the relish ingredients. Season to taste and 
leave to macerate for at least a few hours, and preferably overnight (the 
flavour will keep improving over several weeks).

For the mash, heat 40ml oil in a large pan on a medium-high flame, then add 
the celeriac, thyme and garlic, season well and fry, stirring once or twice, 
for five minutes, until the celeriac starts to brown. Turn the heat to low, add 
75ml cold water, cover and cook for 20-25 minutes, until very soft. Roughly 
mash the celeriac, stir in the remaining 20ml oil and season to taste. Keep 
warm.

Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, blanch the cabbage wedges for 
three minutes, then lift out of the water and leave to steam dry. Meanwhile, 
heat a large griddle pan or grill and, once hot, char the cabbage wedges on 
both sides, until they are covered in dark char marks and the edges are crisp.

Divide the celeriac mash between four warm plates and top each serving with 
two cabbage wedges. Spoon over some of the relish, then dribble a little oil 
from the relish over the top. Sprinkle with herbs – be generous – and serve at 
once.

And for the rest of the week…

Make lots of the relish, because it keeps for months in the fridge, covered 
with a film of olive oil. It’s a knockout with grilled pork or beef, on 
stir-fries or with roast monkfish or salmon; or have it with a cheesy, buttery 
baked potato. The mash, too, goes with just about anything. And do consider 
making double the amount of the creamy potatoes: they freeze well, and are very 
tasty reheated in a frying pan and eaten with a fried egg on top.
