The euro has continued to hold firm after recovering from its early falls in 
the wake of the Italian referendum. Against the dollar, it is currently at 
$1.076, its highest level since the middle of November. Meanwhile the pound is 
down around 1% against the single currency, at €1.1812.

Italian bond yields, which initially spiked higher, fell back from earlier 
highs and are currently up around 6 basis points at 1.97%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has called on governments to tackle the 
problem of inequality around the globe. Katie Allen reports on his speech in 
Liverpool:

The governor.. has issued a rallying cry to policymakers across advanced 
economies to tackle the causes of a growing sense of “isolation and detachment” 
among people who feel left behind by globalisation.

Mark Carney used his first big speech since Donald Trump swept to power 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-wins-us-election-news>
 in America, to warn that open markets are under threat and that politicians 
must do more to share out the gains of global trade and the rise of technology.

Carney reiterated the Bank’s stance that monetary policy could not be held 
accountable for rising inequality 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/nov/15/mark-carney-political-attacks-on-central-banks-deflection-exercise>
. He gave no new hints on the direction of interest rates in the UK and said 
rate-setters would continue to trade off the opposing forces ofrising prices 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation>
 and uncertainty stemming from the Brexit vote.

The main focus of his last speech of an eventful year, was inequality and he 
described current times as “the first lost decade since the 1860s”.

Carney noted the rise in living standards around the world in recent decades 
and said technological progress had lifted more than a billion people out of 
poverty. But he recognised those advances had not been felt equally.

European markets close higher

Despite initial falls after the result of the Italian referendum and the 
subsequent resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi, European markets have 
recovered to end the day higher. Apart that is from Italy itself, which fell 
back slightly. Earlier we listedsix reasons why markets did not drop sharply 
after the Italian news 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/05/italy-referendum-matteo-renzi-markets-spooked-shares-bonds-eurozone-live?page=with:block-5845296ee4b056d3d56ad74d#block-5845296ee4b056d3d56ad74d>
. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 16.11 points or 0.24% higher at 6746.83 
 * Germany’s Dax jumped 1.63% to 10,684.83 
 * France’s Cac closed up 1% at 4574.32 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.67% at 8664.7 
 * In Greece the Athens market added 1.03% to 620.29 
 * But Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.21% to 17,050.21. In the struggling bank 
sector, Monte dei Paschi lost 4% ahead of news of the fate of its rescue plan, 
while Unicredit dropped 3% 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new record high of 
19,274.85 but is currently off its best levels, up 0.33% at 19233.

Italy’s bonds are likely to continue to come under pressure despite the - 
relatively - muted response to the referendum, says Simon MacAdam at Capital 
Economics:

The rejection of the Italian government’s constitutional reforms in Sunday’s 
referendum is not in itself a game-changer for the bond markets ofItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> and the rest of the euro-periphery. 
But it may represent Italy’s first step along a path towards the euro-zone’s 
exit door. As a result, we think that the risks for Italian bond yields are 
skewed to the upside.

The outcome prompted little reaction in financial markets. The euro’s fall 
proved short-lived and the yield of 10-year Italian government bonds rose by 
just 10bp or so to around 2.0%. This is hardly surprising given that a “No” 
vote and subsequent resignation by Prime MinisterMatteo Renzi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-renzi> had largely been discounted, 
and that the risk of an imminent Italian exit from the euro-zone remains very 
small.

So what happens now? Despite doubling in recent months, the 10-year yield is 
not abnormally high and is a far cry from its level at the height of the 
euro-zone crisis in 2011. In fact, if anything, it – and the yields of other 
bonds – have been kept artificially low by the ECB’s asset purchases in the 
past two years. So there is plenty of scope for it to climb as political events 
unfold against a backdrop of renewed economic stagnation and ongoing concerns 
about the country’s banking sector...

Admittedly, any substantial rise in the yield will probably depend on a snap 
election being called, which would give the anti-euro Five Star Movement (M5S) 
an opportunity to seize power. While we doubt there will be an early election, 
we cannot rule out the possibility altogether...

Granted, the euro-zone authorities are far better equipped to deal with upward 
pressure on yields today than they were back in 2011/12. However, such support 
would probably be conditional on certain commitments being made by the Italian 
government, especially regarding continued membership of the monetary union. 
This would be a difficult condition to satisfy if M5S, potentially along with 
eurosceptic allies in other political parties, were to form a government and 
pledge to hold a referendum on euro membership. So in this case, we think 
Italian bond yields would surge.

Even if the “best-case scenario” for bonds came to pass – where a new Prime 
Minister were asked to head the existing government relatively quickly and an 
early election were avoided – we expect that it would only provide temporary 
respite for Italy’s bond market given the country’s troubles.

The market may not have gone into meltdown after the Italian vote, but there 
could be some weakness ahead, not least because of the latest European Central 
Bank meeting later this week. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

They came, they saw and they voted. Italy’s decision to reject Renzi’s 
constitutional reforms has not produced the feared apocalypse in global 
markets. Instead, we have seen European markets trade in positive territory, 
aside of course from the Italian index, which is still under pressure thanks to 
its embattled banking sector.

Europe’s bounce today definitely has the ‘relief rally’ feeling to it, so in 
the face of a rising euro and pre-ECB nerves it will be interesting to see 
whether gains can be sustained in coming sessions. No-one really expected 
Brexit or Trump, but here the result was priced in, and as a result we may well 
have to endure some extended weakness now that the initial excitement is out of 
the way.

The US data is likely to increase speculation of an interest rate rise next 
week. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:

An above-expectations uptick in ISM non-manufacturing PMI for November 
suggests that the US services sector – which accounts for two-thirds of the 
country’s economic activity – has remained a robust proposition in the weeks 
since Donald Trump’s surprise election victory...

The most immediate implication of today’s data is its impact on next week’s 
FOMC meeting, where Fed Chair Janet Yellen is expected to finally pull the 
trigger on the first interest rate hike for a year.”

Strong performance from US services sector

Despite the worries about Europe and the surprise election of Donald Trump as 
US president, the country’s service sector put in a strong performance in 
November.

The ISM non-manufacturing PMI came in at 57.2, up from 54.8 in October and 
better than the forecast 55.4. This is the highest figure since October 2015.

Earlier there were also PMI figures from Markit which came in broadly in line 
with expectations:

Ireland’s finance minister, Michael Noonan, has told reporters in Brussels 
that the European Central Bank won’t let Italy’s banks failed.


Speaking before this afternoon’s eurogroup talks, Noonan said:

It’s always a concern when you hear about banks being weak, and some Italian 
banks are weak.

But the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, is Italian and I 
can’t envisage a situation in which the ECB under Mario Draghi will let the 
Italian banks get into difficulty.

Draghi won’t be around for ever to save the Italian banks, though - his term 
expires in October 2019.

The euro has continued to hold firm after recovering from its early falls in 
the wake of the Italian referendum. Against the dollar, it is currently at 
$1.076, its highest level since the middle of November. Meanwhile the pound is 
down around 1% against the single currency, at €1.1812.

Italian bond yields, which initially spiked higher, fell back from earlier 
highs and are currently up around 6 basis points at 1.97%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
Bank of England governor Mark Carney has called on governments to tackle the 
problem of inequality around the globe. Katie Allen reports on his speech in 
Liverpool:

The governor.. has issued a rallying cry to policymakers across advanced 
economies to tackle the causes of a growing sense of “isolation and detachment” 
among people who feel left behind by globalisation.

Mark Carney used his first big speech since Donald Trump swept to power 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-wins-us-election-news>
 in America, to warn that open markets are under threat and that politicians 
must do more to share out the gains of global trade and the rise of technology.

Carney reiterated the Bank’s stance that monetary policy could not be held 
accountable for rising inequality 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/nov/15/mark-carney-political-attacks-on-central-banks-deflection-exercise>
. He gave no new hints on the direction of interest rates in the UK and said 
rate-setters would continue to trade off the opposing forces ofrising prices 
<https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation>
 and uncertainty stemming from the Brexit vote.

The main focus of his last speech of an eventful year, was inequality and he 
described current times as “the first lost decade since the 1860s”.

Carney noted the rise in living standards around the world in recent decades 
and said technological progress had lifted more than a billion people out of 
poverty. But he recognised those advances had not been felt equally.

Despite initial falls after the result of the Italian referendum and the 
subsequent resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi, European markets have 
recovered to end the day higher. Apart that is from Italy itself, which fell 
back slightly. Earlier we listedsix reasons why markets did not drop sharply 
after the Italian news

. The final scores showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished 16.11 points or 0.24% higher at 6746.83 
 * Germany’s Dax jumped 1.63% to 10,684.83 
 * France’s Cac closed up 1% at 4574.32 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.67% at 8664.7 
 * In Greece the Athens market added 1.03% to 620.29 
 * But Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.21% to 17,050.21. In the struggling bank 
sector, Monte dei Paschi lost 4% ahead of news of the fate of its rescue plan, 
while Unicredit dropped 3% 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new record high of 
19,274.85 but is currently off its best levels, up 0.33% at 19233.
 
Italy’s bonds are likely to continue to come under pressure despite the - 
relatively - muted response to the referendum, says Simon MacAdam at Capital 
Economics:

The rejection of the Italian government’s constitutional reforms in Sunday’s 
referendum is not in itself a game-changer for the bond markets ofItaly 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy> and the rest of the euro-periphery. 
But it may represent Italy’s first step along a path towards the euro-zone’s 
exit door. As a result, we think that the risks for Italian bond yields are 
skewed to the upside.

The outcome prompted little reaction in financial markets. The euro’s fall 
proved short-lived and the yield of 10-year Italian government bonds rose by 
just 10bp or so to around 2.0%. This is hardly surprising given that a “No” 
vote and subsequent resignation by Prime MinisterMatteo Renzi 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-renzi> had largely been discounted, 
and that the risk of an imminent Italian exit from the euro-zone remains very 
small.

So what happens now? Despite doubling in recent months, the 10-year yield is 
not abnormally high and is a far cry from its level at the height of the 
euro-zone crisis in 2011. In fact, if anything, it – and the yields of other 
bonds – have been kept artificially low by the ECB’s asset purchases in the 
past two years. So there is plenty of scope for it to climb as political events 
unfold against a backdrop of renewed economic stagnation and ongoing concerns 
about the country’s banking sector...

Admittedly, any substantial rise in the yield will probably depend on a snap 
election being called, which would give the anti-euro Five Star Movement (M5S) 
an opportunity to seize power. While we doubt there will be an early election, 
we cannot rule out the possibility altogether...

Granted, the euro-zone authorities are far better equipped to deal with upward 
pressure on yields today than they were back in 2011/12. However, such support 
would probably be conditional on certain commitments being made by the Italian 
government, especially regarding continued membership of the monetary union. 
This would be a difficult condition to satisfy if M5S, potentially along with 
eurosceptic allies in other political parties, were to form a government and 
pledge to hold a referendum on euro membership. So in this case, we think 
Italian bond yields would surge.

Even if the “best-case scenario” for bonds came to pass – where a new Prime 
Minister were asked to head the existing government relatively quickly and an 
early election were avoided – we expect that it would only provide temporary 
respite for Italy’s bond market given the country’s troubles.
 
The market may not have gone into meltdown after the Italian vote, but there 
could be some weakness ahead, not least because of the latest European Central 
Bank meeting later this week. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:

They came, they saw and they voted. Italy’s decision to reject Renzi’s 
constitutional reforms has not produced the feared apocalypse in global 
markets. Instead, we have seen European markets trade in positive territory, 
aside of course from the Italian index, which is still under pressure thanks to 
its embattled banking sector.

Europe’s bounce today definitely has the ‘relief rally’ feeling to it, so in 
the face of a rising euro and pre-ECB nerves it will be interesting to see 
whether gains can be sustained in coming sessions. No-one really expected 
Brexit or Trump, but here the result was priced in, and as a result we may well 
have to endure some extended weakness now that the initial excitement is out of 
the way.
 
Back with Italy <https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy>, and Reuters is 
reporting the fate of struggling Monte dei Paschi may not be known for a few 
days yet:

The US data is likely to increase speculation of an interest rate rise next 
week. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:

An above-expectations uptick in ISM non-manufacturing PMI for November 
suggests that the US services sector – which accounts for two-thirds of the 
country’s economic activity – has remained a robust proposition in the weeks 
since Donald Trump’s surprise election victory...

The most immediate implication of today’s data is its impact on next week’s 
FOMC meeting, where Fed Chair Janet Yellen is expected to finally pull the 
trigger on the first interest rate hike for a year.”
 
Despite the worries about Europe and the surprise election of Donald Trump as 
US president, the country’s service sector put in a strong performance in 
November.

The ISM non-manufacturing PMI came in at 57.2, up from 54.8 in October and 
better than the forecast 55.4. This is the highest figure since October 2015.

Earlier there were also PMI figures from Markit which came in broadly in line 
with expectations:

Ireland’s finance minister, Michael Noonan, has told reporters in Brussels 
that the European Central Bank won’t let Italy’s banks failed.


Speaking before this afternoon’s eurogroup talks, Noonan said:

It’s always a concern when you hear about banks being weak, and some Italian 
banks are weak.

But the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, is Italian and I 
can’t envisage a situation in which the ECB under Mario Draghi will let the 
Italian banks get into difficulty.

Draghi won’t be around for ever to save the Italian banks, though - his term 
expires in October 2019.
