The Green Mill


Quite simply, the boss. Like a beautifully preserved Spitfire that not only 
still flies but offers skydiving tours, the Green Mill gives you all the 
thrills of going back in time. This joyous jazz joint has it all: authenticity 
without feeling like you shouldn’t touch anything; a crowd that likes to dress 
up but is not snooty; cocktails next to a bottle of Schlitz with a chaser
Jeppson’sMalört <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeppson%27s_Mal%C3%B6rt>, the 
city’s own super-hardcore liquor. “You can’t get more Chicago than that,” says 
owner Dave Jemilio of the killer combo.

This was an Al Capone favourite back in the 1920s, and you can sit in his 
booth (which has a line of vision to every entrance, naturally) and watch the 
show. Posters on the walls testify to the place’s past, with owners like 
“Machine Gun” Jack McGurn, part of Capone’s outfit, and acts like the comedian 
Joe E Lewis, who had his throat cut by McGurn over a contract dispute, yet 
lived to return to the spotlight. The Green Mill illustrates perfectly the 
difference between a theme bar and a real bar.

The Berghoff


When prohibition ended, The Berghoff was granted the first liquor licence in 
Chicago and the queues snaked round several blocks. That hallowed licence is 
still kept under glass for all to see, and the dining room is a fitting tribute 
to a family-run business that kept the city in “near beer” and good food 
through those ambivalent years. The restaurant section is a grand affair with 
murals depicting the World’s Fair of 1893 on its illustrious wooden walls, and 
serving German-American fare of wiener schnitzel, bratwurst and its signature 
creamed spinach.

As for cocktails in the bar, which is just as prestigious, anything goes. The 
head bartender, Sergio (who has sadly since moved on), took me on a mazy, hazy, 
trip through its history. Starting with the magnificent pre-prohibition 
Aviation – so called as the violet liqueur gives it a sky-blue colour, not as I 
assumed, as it makes you fly – then a Ward 8, a prohibition-era popinjay of a 
drink that was more prosaic than poetic in delivering alcohol, and a Vanilla 
Punch, which sent me into shivers of ecstasy. If you want proof of Sergio’s 
dedication to his craft, he makes his own tonic at home.

The second place to get its liquor licence after the end of prohibition, the 
Coq D’or (pronounced Coke D’or) is a cosy, bijou bar in the basement of the 
Drake hotel. With the wooden panels and lanterns combining to cast long shadows 
across the elegant interior, it’s easy to feel like a private eye in a film 
noir. This is where men and women of status might come to discuss matters of 
great import, whereBoss’s 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/may/29/boss-kelsey-grammer-box-set-review>
 fictional Chicago mayor Tom Kane or the city’s real one,Rahm Emanuel 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rahm-emanuel>, might discuss topics fiscal 
and foreboding.

And it does is cocktails of great standing, through the years, very well. It’s 
chronological drinks menu takes you from Bloody Marys in the 1920s and 
Margaritas in the 30s right up to Cosmopolitans in the noughties. And if you’re 
feeling opulent, try the “executive” size.

The Pump Room

This Chicago landmark fizzes with sophistication and the flamboyance of a 
bygone era. Situated inside the hotel Public and peppered with photos of 
celebrities from the 1920s to the present, it’s a place to throw back Moscow 
Mules and sample canapes. Try the Ginger Margarita or the North by Northwest, 
and if you manage to snag a table for dinner I would definitely start with the 
tuna tartare.

If you’re feeling regal, aim for the “phone table”; back in the day there was 
only one phone available for diners, and the most important person in the room 
was usually sat next to it. The phone is still there, on top of a table. Round 
the corner is the screening room – a furry chamber of deep sofas and secrets, 
shag-pile carpets and effortless pomp.

The Glunz Tavern

The Glunz family reopened the doors of this tavern recently after nearly 90 
years of use as a storage room – and its proud history stares you down, from 
the perfectly preserved antique brass 10c beer signs to the dial on the vintage 
safe in the corner. Closed during prohibition, the tavern became a store for 
the wine and beer shop next door that made the family’s reputation, as 
connoisseurs of the grape, the hop, the juniper berry and pretty much 
everything else. It’s worth popping in for a look at this timeless emporium of 
fine tipples.


After that, pull up a stool or chair in the tavern and sample some of their 
superbly made 19th- and early 20th-century cocktails, like the Sidecar and the 
Sazerac. The food reflects the tavern’s German ancestry: coq au reisling, 
apfelstrudel and pretzel with beer mustard. The Glunz is the kind of place 
others spend millions trying to recreate, and fail – a genuine and habitable 
basilica to Chicago’s rich history, with the atmosphere to match.

“It seemed I was just muddling my ass off,” says head bartender Paul Sauter, 
when thinking back to his days as a cocktail jockey in Miami, constantly making 
bog-standard mojitos. So when he came to this Mexican restaurant and bar in 
Chicago he came up with a drinks menu that turned tradition on its head. Enter 
the Whiskey Mojito and a host of concoctions that blended a knowledge of the 
best tequilas, mezcal, rums and gins with the freshest seasonal ingredients and 
a dash of improvisation: try the peachy Copper Canyon or the more zesty V-9. 
And the freshly made chips and tortillas are a perfect accompaniment to the 
onslaught of flavours, and the mango guacamole seals the occasion.

Downstairs, Double A offers a speakeasy experience. Peer through a wooden slat 
to be admitted into this drinking foxhole. An open mixing area means you can 
get involved or simply watch close up as you sample an Old Smashion – like an 
Old Fashioned with mezcal instead of whiskey, invented by Paul – a white 
rum-based Wise Old Sage, or take inspiration from Mercadito’s name and try the 
Little Market, infused with sunshine (not literally).

A converted Turkish bathhouse in the Wicker Park district, Trenchermen 
splashes you with chic and fans you with panache, as you settle in among its 
white bricks and hardwood finery. It seems part cocktail bar, part gastropub 
and part opium den; a louche woosh of tantalising odours and animated 
conversations, lubricated and maintained by a pulsating bar area and a roaring 
kitchen. Try the salmon tartar with brioche and the crudites with your drinks, 
and if you leave without sampling the pickle tots – potato and gherkin in 
divine union – you are a fool and should be banished from the city limits. 
Drink a Pioneer, which has whiskey and Campari in it and yet is somehow nice, 
absorb the warmth of a Rumpelstiltskin, with orange peel rum and apricot, and 
give yourself an Ultimatum, with tequila and green chartreuse.

Naturally, as this is Chicago and I seemingly can’t escape it, the Malört 
comes out. But this time, instead of the more common Jeppson’s variety, master 
bartender Tona Palomino sidles over like an urbane tumbler-toting assassin and 
invites us to sample his own barrel-aged Malört, which is smoother and tastes a 
bit stronger. If you stay for dinner have the hake. Or the skate. Or the duck. 
In fact, have them all, along with the gnocchi and a cider doughnut for 
dessert. When you’re at Trenchermen, it’s easy to act like one.

The name comes from a term first minted during prohibition, and applied to 
someone who regularly flouted the booze ban. Not necessarily because they were 
criminally minded, but because they saw the law itself as an abomination. This 
newish gin joint – even the mussels are served with a gin sauce – is similarly 
pugnacious in its outlook. It takes some of the more hackneyed notions of the 
bar industry, pops them into a mixer with some garnish and ice, and gives them 
a good shaking.

It charges $8 for practically everything on both the drinks and snacks menu, 
and as my buddy Lou, a son of Chicago, pointed out, for a high-end bar in the 
city, “It actually treats you like you belong there, not like you’re lucky to 
be there”. It makes its own Old Tom gin, and with drinks like the Pellet Gun, 
burnished with what my friend Livya described as “some delicious pink stuff”, 
and the Lonesome Hero, with tequila, Aperol and “banana ice”, you’ll be baffled 
and happy and itching to come back.

While this list can be accused of criminally neglecting the South Side’s best 
spots and focusing too much on central Chicago, that is most likely where as a 
visitor you’ll spend most of your time, on your first visit anyway. And at some 
point you’ll end up in The Loop – the central business district that borders 
Lake Michigan and contains Millenium Park, home of Anish Kapoor’s sculpture the 
Cloud Gate (known locally as the Bean), the Frank Gehry-designed concert hall 
and the Art Institute, plus the Magnificent Mile of shops and arcades along 
Michigan Avenue.

And after a hard day of culture and consumerism, the Gage is a perfect place 
to refuel and rejuvenate yourself. A signature Gage cocktail with pear vodka 
and clove-infused apple juice, and a freshly made scotch egg appetiser should 
relight your fires, while a Sonic Boom, with tequila and “pineapple foam” may 
set your ambitions ablaze. This place is cosy in winter and breezy in summer, a 
great spot from which to watch the city walk by.

There’s now a steakhouse and Italian restaurant out the back, while the front 
bar revels in the venue’s marvellously sketchy history. A giant mural pays 
tribute to its makeover from speakeasy to the infamous Riccardo’s back in the 
30s – the city’s fulcrum for musicians, poets, political types, gangsters and 
journalists at one stage or another, with a bar shaped like a treble clef 
paying dues to it reputedly being the birthplace of live jazz. Cocktails range 
from the rugged taste of the Chancellor – all port, orange peel and 
determination – to the more epicurean delights of a Fudgesicle – with chocolate 
and Bailey’s and insouciance. On the food front, the fresh pastas and sliced 
meats will blow your sax off, and the sea bass is acknowledged to be among the 
best in the state.
