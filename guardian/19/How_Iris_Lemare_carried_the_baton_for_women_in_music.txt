) but Iris Lemare was, in 1937, the first female conductor of the BBC Symphony 
Orchestra and during the 1940s and postwar years the Lemare Orchestra brought 
music and opera to the north of England with soloists such as Joan Hammond and 
Benno Moiseiwitsch. She continued introducing contemporary works by British 
composers as she had done in London in the early 1930s when she co-organised 
the Macnaghten-Lemare concerts and premiered new works, some by women, which 
were not being heard elsewhere. In her late 80s she started one of the first 
music groups in York’s University of the Third Age, playing and discussing the 
music of Vaughan Williams, Britten, Tippett, Holst etc, referring to them by 
their first names as they were friends or fellow students at the Royal College 
of Music. In her 90th year she described her career with no regrets; she 
thought she had done her best by music, but a quarter of a century later 
perhaps she would wonder why a female conductor is still a rarity.
