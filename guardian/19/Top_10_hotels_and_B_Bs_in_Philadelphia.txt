Morris House Hotel


Four-poster beds, Victorian writing desks and hardwood floors create an 
atmosphere of luxury at one of Philadelphia's most acclaimed independent 
boutique hotels. Constructed right after the American Revolution in 1787, the 
15-room brick house underwent renovations in 2005 to perfect the sparse, 
slightly medieval-looking decor, which offers enough variety to suit most 
travellers' tastes (Room 302 feels like a cosy reading room, while the duplex 
Presidential Suite is anchored by a spiral staircase and balcony reached 
through french doors.) The effect is completed by a pristine formal back 
garden, where weddings are frequently held in the warmer months.

Alexander Inn

 Alexander Inn, Philadelphia 
What at first appears to be a humble family-owned B&B in Philly's Washington 
Square West neighbourhood soon reveals itself as a fully modernised, warmly 
decorated haven of old-world charm. The Alexander Inn has 48 oak-accented 
rooms, several of which have bay windows overlooking quaint Spruce Street. 
Original stained-glass fixtures and millwork are part of the building's 
historic appeal, though it's the friendly staff who earn the inn such high 
marks on sites such as TripAdvisor.

Philadelphia Bella Vista B&B

 Bella Vista Inn 
Philadelphia Magic Gardens, a nearby art gallery and studio well-known for its 
bewildering mosaic-lined passages and gardens, frequently refers visiting 
artists and students to this affordable Center City lodging. In these three 
townhouses dating from the 1860s, husband-and-wife team Dan and Barbara have 
furnished the 20 individually themed rooms and suites with antiques from around 
the country. The six suites have private kitchenettes and dining areas, and a 
continental self-service breakfast spread is laid out each morning.

Penn's View Hotel

 Penn's View Inn, Philadelphia 
Work your way through a five-glass "flight" (from $15.75) at Il Bar, an 
award-winning wine bar (with over 150 selections by the glass available on any 
given day) contained within this popular waterfront hotel. Facing out to the 
Delaware river, the shipping warehouse-turned-coffeeshop-turned-boutique hotel 
has seen many incarnations over the years, though its current set-up (49 rooms, 
two suites, one restaurant) may be the homiest yet. The odd juxtaposition of 
exposed brick and patterned wallpaper can at first seem jarring, but the 
hotel's aesthetics are soon forgiven for its prime riverfront views and easy 
access to the historic quarter.

Thomas Bond House

 Thomas Bond House b&b 
Each room at this 18th-century Georgian classical revival townhouse is named 
after various friends and relatives of Thomas Bond, a celebrated Maryland-born 
physician who co-founded the country's first public hospital with Benjamin 
Franklin in 1751. For example, the second-floor William Penn room has patriotic 
red-white-and-blue matching bedspreads and curtains, while the third-floor 
Phineas Bond room is an all-pink affair with pine four-poster bed and exposed 
wood beams. Wine-and-cheese hour is held each night in the ground-floor 
parlour, where a small library, Rumford fireplace and chess set are a ideal for 
whiling away a rainy morning.

Rittenhouse 1715

 Rittenhouse 1715 
Exit this charming 23-room boutique hotel and you find yourself right on the 
edge of Rittenhouse Square, one of Philadelphia's five original public parks 
dating back to the city's founding by William Penn in the late 1600s. The 
square's tree-lined walkways and smattering of high-end restaurants make a nice 
complement to the hotel itself, where marble bathrooms have Molton Brown 
toiletries, and a range of amenities (Wi-Fi, newspaper delivery, continental 
breakfast) are included in the rate.

Gables B&B

 The Gables b&B, Philadelphia 
Though it functioned as a church-owned nursing home until the late 1980s, this 
beautifully preserved Victorian building – complete with large wraparound porch 
and inlaid oak floors in all 10 rooms – is perfect for visitors seeking a 
quieter side of Philly. Be sure to ask for the Christmas Room, a former Santa 
Claus-themed shrine which, thankfully, was recently made over with a basic 
black-and-white colour scheme and a pair of twin beds, and remains the largest 
room in the house.

Independent Hotel

 The Independent Hotel bedroom 
City Hall, the Liberty Bell and Philly's own LGBT-friendly district, the 
Gayborhood, all sit within walking distance of this upscale boutique hotel, but 
you could just as happily spend your trip lounging in the gorgeous atrium-style 
lobby, gawking at the giant custom-made painting that spans four floors. The 
elegant rooms are outfitted with matching beige furniture, Keurig 
coffee-makers, microwaves and mini fridges – convenient amenities for the kind 
of savvy, on-the-go guests who stay here. Though if you feel like sleeping in, 
the hotel also offers complimentary hand-delivered breakfast; simply mark your 
preference (Greek yoghurt, pastries, cereal, fresh fruit) on a card outside 
your room before bed, and voilà!

The Pink House 

 Pink House, Philly 
Known around the neighbourhood for its brightly painted exterior, the Pink 
House offers two units: a guest suite, with private bathroom, kitchen and 
living/dining area, that can sleep up to four; and the studio, a cosy, 
functional two-person space whose entrance is playfully hidden behind a tall 
bookcase (a nifty piece of carpentry work by a friend of the owners). 
Theneighbourhood, University City, a 15-minute drive from Center City, has a 
small-town feel, with plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars, and is close to 
both Pennsylvania and Drexel universities. Since opening to the public in 2009, 
the unique guesthouse, which offers free Wi-Fi and a basic breakfast, attracts 
a mix of university graduates, European tourists, conference attendees and 
families of students.

 The Latham Hotel Philadelphia 
Recent renovations have helped bring this beloved 14-storey art deco building 
fully into the 21st century, with artsy black-and-white photos in all the 
rooms, a new fitness centre, and a glittering lobby befitting a trendy boutique 
hotel. Rooms on upper floors offer spectacular views of Downtown, and the 
bathrooms are bright and spacious, with toiletries by Gilchrist & Soames. As an 
added bonus, guests can make use of a complimentary house car, useful for
