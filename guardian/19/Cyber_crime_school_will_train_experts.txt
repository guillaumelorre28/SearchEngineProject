I read your story about online theft from Tesco Bank accounts (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/tesco-bank-freezes-transactions-online-attack>
, 8 November) with huge interest because in Surrey we’re planning a new cyber 
school where the next generation of security experts will be trained to thwart 
computer criminals. Working with Royal Holloway, University of London and 
global information technology and business services company CGI, among others, 
the college will equip hundreds of students with the expertise to combat the 
escalating threats posed by data theft, malware, online scams and cyber 
attacks. Not only will it arm young people with the skills needed to play a 
part in making cyberspace safe for our growing digital economy, it will also 
ease immense pressure on school places in Surrey, which has left the council 
with a funding gap of tens of millions of pounds.
