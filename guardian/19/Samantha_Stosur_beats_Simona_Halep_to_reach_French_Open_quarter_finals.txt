Samantha Stosur <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/samantha-stosur> has 
reached the quarter-finals of the French Open for a fourth time after beating 
the sixth seed, Simona Halep.

The 32-year-old Australian overcame her Romanian opponent 7-6, 6-3 on another 
rain-affected day at Roland Garros.

Stosur, who reached the French Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/frenchopen> final in 2010 and won the US 
Open title 12 months later, will next play Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria who 
in a second major upset beat the No2 seed Agnieszka Radwanksa 2–6, 6–3, 6–3. 
Pironkova had begun the day trailing 3–0 in the second set.

“It feels unbelievably great. I have no words – I’m so happy right now,” said 
Pironkova, who admitted the conditions were “very difficult with all the rain – 
we waited almost three days to finish the match. But I cannot complain!”

Pironkova joined the US player Shelby Rogers as the second player ranked 
outside the top 100 to reach the women’s quarter-finals.
