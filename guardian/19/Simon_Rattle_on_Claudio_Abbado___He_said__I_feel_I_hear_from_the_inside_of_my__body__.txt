We have lost a great musician and a very generous man. Ten years ago we all 
wondered whether he would survive the illness which has now claimed him, but 
instead, he, and we as musicians and public, could enjoy an extraordinary 
Indian Summer, in which all the facets of his art came together in an 
unforgettable way.

He said to me a few years ago, "Simon, my illness was terrible, but the 
results have not been all bad: I feel that somehow I hear from the inside of my 
body, as if the loss of my stomach gave me internal ears. I cannot express how 
wonderful that feels. And I still feel that music saved my life in that time!"

Always a great conductor, his performances in these last years were 
transcendent, and we all feel privileged to have witnessed them. Personally, he 
was always immensely kind and generous to me, from my earliest days as a 
conductor, and we kept warm and funny contact together even up to last Friday. 
He remains deep in my heart and memory.
