Elsewhere before the rain There were a number of victories for notable seeds, 
including Petra Kvitova, Alexander Zverev and Dominic Thiem, who all won in 
straight sets. Meanwhile Dan Evans was tied at 6-6 with Dolgopolov in the first 
set, whileHeather Watson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> was 
tied at a set all with Annika Beck. There’s no play on any of the outside 
courts so I’m going to wrap up today’s blog. Thanks, Sean

Meanwhile Willis is giving his view on the match:

It’s daunting playing on Centre Court. It’s tough. I was panicking on the big 
points until I settled into the match. He puts you under a lot of pressure - he 
hits balls you don’t want him too. I was enjoying it out there but I still have 
a lot of improving to do. I just need to keep going and keep my head down. It 
sounds funny but I am disappointed to lose, but I have had a fantastic few 
weeks. The last three years I have been more dedicated, but I have to knuckle 
down as I want more experiences like this. I’m absolutely exhausted - but I 
have earned myself a beer now.

Federer is speaking - and smiling: 

Today was very different. Marcus brought some unbelievable energy to the court 
and the fans, and he played some great shotmaking. I always knew it would be a 
completely different match than I have played at Wimbledon. He had nothing to 
lose and he went out and enjoyed himself. I had the pressure on my shoulders, 
even though I said beforehand this was a pressure-free tournament. My mindset 
going in was that I was playing a guy in the top 50 because that is how he has 
been playing. I hope he can rise in the rankings - it was a pleasure for me to 
play him.

FEDERER WINS 6-0, 6-3, 6-4 Willis has a half-chance at 15-30 after two 
uncharacteristic misses from Federer. But soon the natural order reasserts 
itself and Federer wins the next three points to come through in straight sets. 
The players hug at the net after a hugely enjoyable 85 minutes of tennis, and 
there are a few tears from Willis as he walks off. The 25-year-old Brit has 
belated realised that it might be a good idea not to squander his obvious 
talent: hopefully this isn’t the last we’ve seen of him at Wimbledon.

Third set: Federer 6-0, 6-3, 3-4* Willis Willis, as John McEnroe says on 
commentary, is feeding off the crowd’s energy. First there’s a lovely pick-up 
from a viciously dipping volley, then a monster backhand to go 30-0 up. A huge 
serve takes it to 40-0, before he seals the game with a dismissive backhand. 
Superb.

Third set: Federer* 6-0, 6-3, 3-3 Willis Another roar goes around a 
Pimms-fuelled Centre Court as a Willis challenge is successful and it seems to 
ruffle Federer, who screws a volley into the tramlines to go 30-15 down. The 
World No3 is unable to get a forehand back and finds himself facing breakpoint. 
Willis couldn’t, could he? No, he couldn’t. Federer hits the lines three times’ 
in a row to hold.

Third set: Federer 6-0, 6-3, 0-1* Willis Willis rushes to a 40-0 lead but then 
a series of calamities befalls him, including missing a straightforward put

hands: he wins the next two points to go ahead of Federer in this set!

his booming serve: at 30-15 he hits the sweetest of volleys which has Federer 
scrambling unsuccessfully and then chalks up another game with a venomous serve

Second set: Federer 6-0, 4-2 Willis* Willis is a touch slower and wilder now 
that his energy levels have dropped but his first serve appears to be keeping 
him in this. He saves two breakpoints with two big serves - but he simply can’t 
match Federer on the ground. A third breakpoint comes and this time the World 
No3 takes it. This could be over quite quickly now.

shoulder is tightening up - but he’s still swinging for England. He goes 40-0

Second set: Federer 6-0, 1-1 Willis* This might be tennis as pantomime, but 
even the hardest of hearts would be softening at the sight of Willis winning 
his first game. The sense of anticipation built as Willis went up 40-0 up 
thanks to a series of crushing serves. But then he netted a forehand and 
Federer smashed a winner to pull it back to 40-30. But finally a Willis 
forehand sent thousands of people on their feet, while the man himself raised 
his hands in the air in triumph.

First set: Federer 6-0 Willis* Willis is battling away here. A series of 
well-constructed points earns him a game point at 40-30. Then the parks’ player 
comes out as he hits a horrible shanked forehand and an errant volley. 
Federer’s first set point is saved by a superb serve and volley. But soon after 
he sends another ball out and he finds himself a set down after less than half

First set: Federer 4-0 Willis* Willis goes 30-0 up but he can’t put a game on 
the board. The Brit can clearly play but he already looks knackered, which is 
unsurprising given that Federer is skilfully nudging him around the court. Even 
though Willis has lost 55lb pounds since he was called ‘Cartman’ by his 
opponents a few years’ ago, he is - by the standards of men’s professional 
tennis - still not very fit. His face is red and he is puffing hard already. 
And we are just 15 minutes in.

First set: Federer* 3-0 Willis Willis punches the air with delight after a 
stupendous backpeddling lob flies over Federer and in. The crowd are on their 
feet. Even Federer appears to be laughing. 30-30. Then, suddenly, Federer nets, 
and Willis has breakpoint. The crowd is a mixture of giddy laughter and raucous 
energy: but after a long rally Willis nets a long pass. Federer then wins the 
next two points and he’s 3-0 up.

First set: Federer 2-0 Willis* Every Willis point is greeted with riotous 
acclaim, but - understandably - he initially rushes through his first service 
points on Centre Court just a little too quickly. After an on-the-knees volley 
puts him 30-15 up, Willis spews a groundstroke wide and then double faults and 
is immediately faces breakpoint. But all credit to Willis, who saves it with a 
120mph-plus serve! Another Federer breakpoint, another point saved: this time 
with a nifty serve and volley! A third breakpoint? Another save - this time 
with an ace! But Federer keeps at it and finally breaks.

First set: Federer* 1-0 Willis There’s a football-like atmosphere on Centre 
Court, and Willis seems to be revelling in it. He smiles throughout the 
knock-up and his old-school backhand, which has plenty of slice, keeps Federer 
off him initially before he holds to 30.

That’s it! Djokovic wins 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) ... but the straight sets victory 
doesn’t tell the entire story. The World No1 was pushed hard by his impressive 
opponent, who also dumped him on his back in the tie-break after a battle drop 
shots - but he finally comes through 7-5 in the tie-break to move through to 
the third.

Their respective tie-break records in 2016 tell a story: Djokovic is 13-2 this 
year, Mannarino is 2-7 ...but the Frenchman is on a roll and immediately hits a 
rasping forehand to win the first point. Djokovic then hold his serves, helped 
by an astonishing half-volley flick for the clean winner down the line, to go 
2-1 up. Then the point of the match, as the pair slug it out mano a mano, 
including a miraculous get from Djokovic that is smashed away by Mannarino. 
2-2. But Djokovic raises his game again, getting the mini-break and then 
passing his opponent to go 4-2 ahead ... surely now it’s match over?

Suddenly Djokovic is starting to look a little wobbly ... he shanks a forehand 
into the tramlines and suddenly he is 0-30 down on serve and two points away 
from losing this set. But Djokovic is the world No1 for reason: Smartly, he 
changes things up, electing to come to the net on a slice and benefitting when 
Mannarino hoiks a shot wide and then wins the next three points to take it to a 
tie-break.

Now Mannarino holds to go 6-5 up in the third... he’s like a pesky wasp who 
won’t go away despite Djokovic repeated attempts to swat him aside.

Mannarino breaks back: it’s now 6-4, 6-3, 5-5 After Mannarino holds his serve, 
Djokovic steps up to seal the match. There’s a sniff of a chance when Mannarino 
wrong-foots his opponent with a forehand to earn a breakpoint at 30-40, but 
Djokovic saves it with a serve down the line. Still, another opportunity arises 
when Djokovic volleys long - and this time, at the ninth time of asking, the 
Frenchman breaks! Cue raucous cheers.

Mannarino has played very well here ... but twice in succession he gets a rush 
of blood to the head and clouts forehands way past the baseline.Djokovic is 
15-40 up and sensing blood. The Frenchman saves the first breakpoint by 
wrongfooting his opponent, but then he sinks a shot into the net, and it’s very 
nearly game over, with Djokovic leading 6-4, 6-3, 4-3 - with a break in the 
third set.

Forgive the brief delay: Wimbledon’s wifi went down for a few minutes. You 
haven’t missed much - Djokovic had a sniff on Mannarino’s serve, but the 
Frenchman held on. Djokovic then held and it’s now 6-4, 6-3, 3-3.

Elsewhere before the rain There were a number of victories for notable seeds, 
including Petra Kvitova, Alexander Zverev and Dominic Thiem, who all won in 
straight sets. Meanwhile Dan Evans was tied at 6-6 with Dolgopolov in the first 
set, whileHeather Watson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> was 
tied at a set all with Annika Beck. There’s no play on any of the outside 
courts so I’m going to wrap up today’s blog. Thanks, Sean
 
Meanwhile Willis is giving his view on the match:

It’s daunting playing on Centre Court. It’s tough. I was panicking on the big 
points until I settled into the match. He puts you under a lot of pressure - he 
hits balls you don’t want him too. I was enjoying it out there but I still have 
a lot of improving to do. I just need to keep going and keep my head down. It 
sounds funny but I am disappointed to lose, but I have had a fantastic few 
weeks. The last three years I have been more dedicated, but I have to knuckle 
down as I want more experiences like this. I’m absolutely exhausted - but I 
have earned myself a beer now.
 
Federer is speaking - and smiling: 

Today was very different. Marcus brought some unbelievable energy to the court 
and the fans, and he played some great shotmaking. I always knew it would be a 
completely different match than I have played at Wimbledon. He had nothing to 
lose and he went out and enjoyed himself. I had the pressure on my shoulders, 
even though I said beforehand this was a pressure-free tournament. My mindset 
going in was that I was playing a guy in the top 50 because that is how he has 
been playing. I hope he can rise in the rankings - it was a pleasure for me to 
play him.
 
FEDERER WINS 6-0, 6-3, 6-4 Willis has a half-chance at 15-30 after two 
uncharacteristic misses from Federer. But soon the natural order reasserts 
itself and Federer wins the next three points to come through in straight sets. 
The players hug at the net after a hugely enjoyable 85 minutes of tennis, and 
there are a few tears from Willis as he walks off. The 25-year-old Brit has 
belated realised that it might be a good idea not to squander his obvious 
talent: hopefully this isn’t the last we’ve seen of him at Wimbledon.

Third set: Federer 6-0, 6-3, 5-4* Willis Suddenly all the energy is sucked out 
of Centre Court as Federer breaks to love. He’ll be serving for the match in a 
minute ...

Third set: Federer* 6-0, 6-3, 4-4 Willis Comfortable for Federer, who holds to 
15. Meanwhile it is raining again ... but they are still out in Court 12 where 
Annika Beck is having her ankle tapped andHeather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> is shivering in the cold. 
It’s about 15c out there - the same as it was in Wimbledon on Christmas Day 
last year.
 
Third set: Federer 6-0, 6-3, 3-4* Willis Willis, as John McEnroe says on 
commentary, is feeding off the crowd’s energy. First there’s a lovely pick-up 
from a viciously dipping volley, then a monster backhand to go 30-0 up. A huge 
serve takes it to 40-0, before he seals the game with a dismissive backhand. 
Superb.

Third set: Federer* 6-0, 6-3, 3-3 Willis Another roar goes around a 
Pimms-fuelled Centre Court as a Willis challenge is successful and it seems to 
ruffle Federer, who screws a volley into the tramlines to go 30-15 down. The 
World No3 is unable to get a forehand back and finds himself facing breakpoint. 
Willis couldn’t, could he? No, he couldn’t. Federer hits the lines three times’ 
in a row to hold.
 
Third set: Federer 6-0, 6-3, 2-3* Willis Another standing ovation for Willis 
as his eighth ace crashes home and then he hits another unreturnable serve to 
win his service game to love. “Come on!” he tells himself. “Come on!”
 
Third set: Federer* 6-0, 6-3, 2-2 Willis Another hold for Federer, who was a 
little erratic there but held to 30. Elsewhere Britain’s Dan Evans is 5-5 in 
the first set against Dolgopolov,Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> is a set all in her game 
against Annika Beck, while the eighth seed Dominic Thiem is two sets up against 
Florian Mayer.
 
Third set: Federer 6-0, 6-3, 1-2 Willis More good serving from the Willis, who 
lest we forget is still ranked 772nd in the world, as he holds to 15. If he can 
find the application to match his talent he could be a lot higher rated.

Third set: Federer* 6-0, 6-3, 1-1 Willis Federer holds to 15. Meanwhile 
Heather Watson <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> is having a 
shocker in the second set: she’s 5-0 down to Annika Beck, having won the first.
 
Third set: Federer 6-0, 6-3, 0-1* Willis Willis rushes to a 40-0 lead but then 
a series of calamities befalls him, including missing a straightforward put 
away at the net. But Willis has bottle as well as a punishing serve and soft 
hands: he wins the next two points to go ahead of Federer in this set!
 
Second set: Federer* 6-0, 6-3 Willis But Federer wastes little time in 
wrapping up the second set. Willis is beaming away here - he’s enjoyed every 
one of the 52 minutes this match has lasted.
 
Second set: Federer 6-0, 5-3 Willis* Willis clearly has good hands to go with 
his booming serve: at 30-15 he hits the sweetest of volleys which has Federer 
scrambling unsuccessfully and then chalks up another game with a venomous serve 
out wide.
 
Second set: Federer* 6-0, 5-2 Willis In a blink of the eye Federer holds his 
service game. Meanwhile Jo Konta has won 6-1, 7-5 against Monica Puig on Court 
One - a very impressive result for the 16th seed.
 
Second set: Federer 6-0, 4-2 Willis* Willis is a touch slower and wilder now 
that his energy levels have dropped but his first serve appears to be keeping 
him in this. He saves two breakpoints with two big serves - but he simply can’t 
match Federer on the ground. A third breakpoint comes and this time the World 
No3 takes it. This could be over quite quickly now.

Second set: Federer* 6-0, 3-2 Willis Federer wins another service game, this 
time to 30. Meanwhile on Court 12Heather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> has just won the first set 
6-3 against Annika Beck. Britain’s No17 Jo Konta is a set and 5-5 up against 
Puig.
 
Second set: Federer 6-0, 2-2 Willis* Willis has called for a trainer - his 
shoulder is tightening up - but he’s still swinging for England. He goes 40-0 
up and then wins the game to 15 with an ace!

Second set: Federer* 6-0, 2-1 Willis The crowd get a little more giddy when 
Willis goes 0-30 up on Federer’s serve, but the seven-times champion then 
rattles off four points in a row.
 
Second set: Federer 6-0, 1-1 Willis* This might be tennis as pantomime, but 
even the hardest of hearts would be softening at the sight of Willis winning 
his first game. The sense of anticipation built as Willis went up 40-0 up 
thanks to a series of crushing serves. But then he netted a forehand and 
Federer smashed a winner to pull it back to 40-30. But finally a Willis 
forehand sent thousands of people on their feet, while the man himself raised 
his hands in the air in triumph.

Second set: Federer* 6-0, 1-0 Willis Federer races through another service 
game. Willis has new balls here: can it help him finally get a game on the 
board?
 
Elsewhere at Wimbledon ... Bernard Tomic has come through his match against 
Fernando Verdasco in five sets, whileHeather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> is 4-2 up against Annika 
Beck.
 
First set: Federer 6-0 Willis* Willis is battling away here. A series of 
well-constructed points earns him a game point at 40-30. Then the parks’ player 
comes out as he hits a horrible shanked forehand and an errant volley. 
Federer’s first set point is saved by a superb serve and volley. But soon after 
he sends another ball out and he finds himself a set down after less than half 
an hour.
 
First set: Federer* 5-0 Willis 19 minutes in and this is match is fast running 
away from Willis. Federer seals another game with an imperious backhand smash.

First set: Federer 4-0 Willis* Willis goes 30-0 up but he can’t put a game on 
the board. The Brit can clearly play but he already looks knackered, which is 
unsurprising given that Federer is skilfully nudging him around the court. Even 
though Willis has lost 55lb pounds since he was called ‘Cartman’ by his 
opponents a few years’ ago, he is - by the standards of men’s professional 
tennis - still not very fit. His face is red and he is puffing hard already. 
And we are just 15 minutes in.
 
Elsewhere ... play is underway on the outside courts. I’ll try to keep you 
updated when and where I can. Looking over my shoulder I see thatHeather Watson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/heather-watson> is 3-1 up against Annika 
Beck.
 
First set: Federer* 3-0 Willis Willis punches the air with delight after a 
stupendous backpeddling lob flies over Federer and in. The crowd are on their 
feet. Even Federer appears to be laughing. 30-30. Then, suddenly, Federer nets, 
and Willis has breakpoint. The crowd is a mixture of giddy laughter and raucous 
energy: but after a long rally Willis nets a long pass. Federer then wins the 
next two points and he’s 3-0 up.
 Boom! Get in. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian  
First set: Federer 2-0 Willis* Every Willis point is greeted with riotous 
acclaim, but - understandably - he initially rushes through his first service 
points on Centre Court just a little too quickly. After an on-the-knees volley 
puts him 30-15 up, Willis spews a groundstroke wide and then double faults and 
is immediately faces breakpoint. But all credit to Willis, who saves it with a 
120mph-plus serve! Another Federer breakpoint, another point saved: this time 
with a nifty serve and volley! A third breakpoint? Another save - this time 
with an ace! But Federer keeps at it and finally breaks.
 
First set: Federer* 1-0 Willis There’s a football-like atmosphere on Centre 
Court, and Willis seems to be revelling in it. He smiles throughout the 
knock-up and his old-school backhand, which has plenty of slice, keeps Federer 
off him initially before he holds to 30.

Better news on the weather front: the covers are off on the outside courts and 
play could be getting underway in the next 30 minutes.
 
That’s it! Djokovic wins 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) ... but the straight sets victory 
doesn’t tell the entire story. The World No1 was pushed hard by his impressive 
opponent, who also dumped him on his back in the tie-break after a battle drop 
shots - but he finally comes through 7-5 in the tie-break to move through to 
the third.
 
Their respective tie-break records in 2016 tell a story: Djokovic is 13-2 this 
year, Mannarino is 2-7 ...but the Frenchman is on a roll and immediately hits a 
rasping forehand to win the first point. Djokovic then hold his serves, helped 
by an astonishing half-volley flick for the clean winner down the line, to go 
2-1 up. Then the point of the match, as the pair slug it out mano a mano, 
including a miraculous get from Djokovic that is smashed away by Mannarino. 
2-2. But Djokovic raises his game again, getting the mini-break and then 
passing his opponent to go 4-2 ahead ... surely now it’s match over?
 
Suddenly Djokovic is starting to look a little wobbly ... he shanks a forehand 
into the tramlines and suddenly he is 0-30 down on serve and two points away 
from losing this set. But Djokovic is the world No1 for reason: Smartly, he 
changes things up, electing to come to the net on a slice and benefitting when 
Mannarino hoiks a shot wide and then wins the next three points to take it to a 
tie-break.
 
Now Mannarino holds to go 6-5 up in the third... he’s like a pesky wasp who 
won’t go away despite Djokovic repeated attempts to swat him aside.

Mannarino breaks back: it’s now 6-4, 6-3, 5-5 After Mannarino holds his serve, 
Djokovic steps up to seal the match. There’s a sniff of a chance when Mannarino 
wrong-foots his opponent with a forehand to earn a breakpoint at 30-40, but 
Djokovic saves it with a serve down the line. Still, another opportunity arises 
when Djokovic volleys long - and this time, at the ninth time of asking, the 
Frenchman breaks! Cue raucous cheers.
 
Novak Djokovic is now just one game away from victory ... Mannarino tried to 
attack him again there, but the Serb was too good, clinching the game with a 
backhand down the line.

Mannarino has played very well here ... but twice in succession he gets a rush 
of blood to the head and clouts forehands way past the baseline.Djokovic is 
15-40 up and sensing blood. The Frenchman saves the first breakpoint by 
wrongfooting his opponent, but then he sinks a shot into the net, and it’s very 
nearly game over, with Djokovic leading 6-4, 6-3, 4-3 - with a break in the 
third set.

Forgive the brief delay: Wimbledon’s wifi went down for a few minutes. You 
haven’t missed much - Djokovic had a sniff on Mannarino’s serve, but the 
Frenchman held on. Djokovic then held and it’s now 6-4, 6-3, 3-3.
