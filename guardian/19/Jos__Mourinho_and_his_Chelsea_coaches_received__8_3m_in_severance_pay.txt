In a document available at Companies House, Chelsea

and compensation totalling £8.3m in relation to the changes in the first-team 
management during the year”.

Mourinho had signed a contract at Stamford Bridge in August 2015 that was 
worth £13m a year.

The figures also show Chelsea paid £67m to their kit manufacturer, Adidas, to 
end their deal six years early. They have agreed a new contract with Nike, 
which will begin next season and is worth £60m a year for the next 15 years. 
The agreement with Adidas was worth £30m a year.
