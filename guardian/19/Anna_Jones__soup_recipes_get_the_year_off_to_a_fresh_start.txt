The first column of a brave new year. I am an eternal optimist, a believer in 
new beginnings: we can turn over new leaves and wave goodbye to things that no 
longer serve us. When it comes to food, new beginnings can be useful – 
sometimes. But, before you turn the page, don’t worry: I’m not about to preach 
the holy virtues of spirulina or detoxing; I’m not into that.

About eight years ago, I was a recipe developer working in an office with a 
kitchen in every corner (in fact, it was more kitchen than office). Each day 
those kitchens were filled with us cooks making dishes from every corner of the 
world. We had to refine the recipes for home cooks; each had to be tested and 
tasted. I was the taster too. It was a wonderful education in food, but by the 
end of each day I felt jaded with eating, overwhelmed by the volume of it all. 
I hated that feeling – after all, food had always motivated me – but there is 
vulgarity in having too much food all the time. It felt a bit like I’d had a 
Christmas dinner every day.

I decided I needed to start afresh, letting what I eat revolve around 
vegetables, fruit, pulses and whole grains. And I’ve kept it up: not far-out 
healthy eating, but keeping plants at the core of what I eat, cooking them with 
care and layering them with flavour so they are downright delicious. This is 
nothing new or particularly remarkable, but it did change my life. That’s the 
thing I like about new beginnings: just one small change can trigger an 
unfolding of events we could never have imagined.

For a lot of us, I think January is the time when we are most open to change, 
especially when it comes to eating. These broths are warming, refreshing bowls 
of food to nourish new beginnings in any realm you choose. Both are 
particularly good when you are feeling off-colour.

Green peppercorn and lemongrass coconut broth (main picture)


Made creamy with coconut milk and sweetened with squash, this highly spiced 
broth feels especially restorative if you’re fighting off a cold. Turmeric, 
ginger and garlic are all immune-boosting ingredients, while fiery green 
chillies will blow away your cobwebs for the new year. I use green peppercorns, 
as I love the grassy punch they give: seek them out fresh if you can; if not, 
the brined ones in jars will do just fine.

Serves 4
4 tbsp coconut oil
A thumb of ginger (about 50g), peeled and roughly chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled
1-2 small green chillies, destemmed
4 spring onions, trimmed and roughly chopped
A small bunch of coriander,leaves and stalks
A few sprigs of mint
1 heaped tsp ground turmeric
15 green peppercorns, fresh or brined
2 x 400ml tins coconut milk
2 limes
1 tbsp vegetable stock powder or ½ vegetable stock cube
1 tbsp tamari or soy sauce
A stalk of lemongrass
½ butternut squash, peeled
100g spinach or winter greens
100g brown rice noodles
1 tbsp honey

1 Fill the kettle and put it on to boil. Gently warm the coconut oil over a 
low flame until it just melts. Put the ginger, garlic and chillies (the amount 
you use and whether you keep the seeds in depends on how hot you like things) 
into your food processor with the spring onions, almost all of the coriander 
and mint leaves. Add the melted coconut oil, then blitz for 30 seconds, or 
until you have a smooth, deep green paste. Scrape into a small bowl, cover with 
clingfilm and refrigerate until you are ready to use it.

2 Put a deep, medium-sized pan over a moderate heat and add the herb and spice 
paste, stirring it for a minute while it warms. Stir in the turmeric, 
peppercorns, both tins of coconut milk, the juice of one of the limes, the veg 
stock powder and the soy sauce.

3 Fill one of the tins one and a half times with hot water from the kettle and 
add it to the pan. Use a rolling pin or pestle, smash the lemongrass so it 
splinters but remains together, then tuck it into the pan. Bring to the boil 
then lower the heat and leave it to simmer, bubbling gently.

4 Meanwhile finely slice the butternut squash and add this to the pan too.

5 Shred the greens. Put the noodles into a heatproof bowl and pour over enough 
of the boiling water from the kettle to cover them.

6 Once the squash is cooked through, add the greens to the soup and allow it 
to come to a simmer again. Check the seasoning of the soup, adding the honey if 
it needs some sweetness and more lime and salt as needed.

7 Drain the noodles, then divide them between four deep soup bowls. Ladle over 
the soup and vegetables, adding a generous squeeze of lime juice and, if you 
like, a few extra coriander and mint leaves.

1 Heat a little olive oil in a large soup pot over a medium heat. Add the 
onion, leek, fennel, celery and carrot, then turn the heat down to low and cook 
gently for 20-30 minutes, or until everything is very soft and sweet, without 
browning too much. Keep a little jug of water close to the pan and add a splash 
of water if it looks like it’s going to stick.

2 Add the garlic and ginger, cook for another couple of minutes, then squeeze 
in the juice of the lemon.

3 Add the peppercorns and 2 litres of water, plus a good pinch of sea salt (or 
you can use vegetable stock if you want a fuller flavoured soup). Bring to the 
boil and simmer for 20-30 minutes.

4 Meanwhile, toss the tofu in 2 tbsp soy sauce. Heat a pan with a little olive 
oil and fry until crisp. Once the tofu is golden and crispy, add the final 
tablespoon of soy sauce and toss quickly in the hot pan: the soy should stick 
to the tofu and give it a rich stickiness. Remove from the heat.

5 Your soup should now be about ready. Add your pasta: if it’s long noodles 
then break them up as you add them: cook for another 8 minutes (or as long as 
your pasta takes to cook). Finally, taste, and adjust with more salt, water or 
even a squeeze more lemon, if needed. Ladle the soup into shallow bowls and top 
with the tofu, some fennel fronds and celery leaves, plus a good drizzle of 
olive oil.
