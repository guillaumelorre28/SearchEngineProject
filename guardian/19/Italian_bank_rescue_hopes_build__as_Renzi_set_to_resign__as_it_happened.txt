European markets on the rise again

Hopes that Italy’s banks can be bailed out one way or another - private 
investors, state aid or the European bailout fund - continue to support stock 
markets. And the expectation that the European Central Bank may extend its bond 
buying programme for a few more months is also providing some support. On Wall 
Street the global surge in banking stocks helped push both the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average and the S&P 500 to new intra-day peaks, although 
pharmaceutical shares were under pressure after president-elect Donald Trump 
said he would look at cutting drug prices. The final scores inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 1.81% or 122.39 points at 6902.23 
 * Germany’s Dax jumped 1.96% to 10,986.69 
 * France’s Cac closed up 1.36% at 4694.72 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 2.1% to 18,130.66 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.75% at 8960.4 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 2.82% to 640.07 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 92 points or 
0.48% at 19344, close to the day’s highs.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.

Helena Smith

In Greece tensions over reforms are once again mounting with creditors – this 
time over an IMF demand that shops remain open for business on Sundays. Helena 
Smith reports:

Most EU member states would relish overhauling a relic of old times like the 
ban on Sunday shopping. In Greece, though, it is the sort of measure that makes 
for front-page splashes, conspiracy theory and cries of protest.

But the International Monetary Fund, in the spirit of further opening up one 
of the continent’s most sclerotic economies, is not letting go. Instead the 
Washington-based body, which is still negotiating its participation in Greece’s 
latest bailout, has stepped up demands for trade to be liberalised saying shops 
should remain open on Sundays. Moreover, it argues, the reform will give people 
work in a nation hobbled by record levels of unemployment.
 IMF wants Greek shops to open on Sunday Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters
In its splash today, the daily Ethnos newspaper, citing a leaked email from 
the IMF, reports that closure of an ongoing review of the economy by creditors 
– the second since Athens received its third bailout last summer – is now 
contingent on shops opening up for commerce on Sundays. The organisation wants 
the measure to be signed and sealed this month. So far the response has been 
negative. Ministry of finance officials told the paper that, instead, they will 
push through an amendment that will allow shops in specially defined tourist 
areas to stay open. That’s unlikely to pass muster with lenders who have 
signalled they are going to rachet up the pressure on Greece to enforce the 
sort of reforms that will make it more competitive. Ideologically, the 
governing leftwing Syriza party is said to be against the move on the grounds 
that it will not only benefit bigger stores but is an infringement of basic 
workers’ rights.

The Greek Orthodox Church has already likened the step to a sin and shop 
employees, who have already taken to the streets, are girding for further 
battle.

One of the factors supporting the market rally is the expectation that the 
European Central Bank could announce an extension of its bond buying programme 
following its latest meeting on Thursday:

[APP is the asset purchase programme]

That hope, and optimism that Italy’s struggling banks can somehow be 
recapitalised, have combined to send European markets higher, with Germany’s 
Dax up 1.8%, France’s Cac 1.1%, the FTSE 100 1.6% and Italy’s FTSE MIB 1.5%.

On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new intra-day record 
of 19,276, despite concerns about healthcare companies after Donald Trump said 
he would look at drug pricing.

Markets continue to be buoyed by hopes of a resolution to Italy’s banking 
problems. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

With the Italian government passing its 2017 budget, and Mario Renzi 
confirming he will resign this evening, the European markets maintained their 
banking-boosted growth this Wednesday.

The continued lack of fuss following the Italian referendum result, combined 
with the prospect of a Monte dei Paschi bailout (potentially as soon as this 
week), has led the European indices to a bevy of highs this afternoon. The CAC 
is still at an 11 month peak, while the DAX, following a near 200 point rise, 
is at its best price in exactly a year.

The highs hit by the FTSE were a bit less impressive, though its 110 point 
increase does leave the UK index just 10 points away from 6900, a level it 
hasn’t seen since November 10th. While most of the pan-European growth has been 
inspired by the rallying banking sector, the FTSE has also benefited from a 
commodity stock rebound and the latest pound-plunge, with sterling shedding 
0.8% against the dollar and 1.1% against the euro.

But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, warned markets 
could be getting ahead of themselves:

Talk that the Italian banking system could be on the verge of a €15bn bailout 
from the European Stability Mechanism has pushed equity markets inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> to their highest levels in 
several months...

While the reports of a bailout request have been denied the usual rule of 
thumb when these sorts of reports do the rounds is that there is usually an 
element of truth to them, even if we don’t know the exact mechanics, and 
markets are responding to that.

As with most things the devil is likely to be in the detail, and the likely 
strings that are likely to be attached to any aid request, if and when it 
comes. It is here that markets could be getting ahead of themselves.

Renzi set to resign as Italian PM

Well it seems Matteo Renzi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-renzi> 
will not be staying on as Italian prime minister after all and plans to resign 
this evening now the budget has been passed. He tweeted:
Matteo Renzi (@matteorenzi) 
Legge di bilancio approvata. Alle 19 le dimissioni formali. Grazie a tutti e 
viva l'Italiahttps://t.co/PLsLxcrPGS <https://t.co/PLsLxcrPGS>
 <https://twitter.com/matteorenzi/status/806502084564619264> December 7, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/matteorenzi/status/806502084564619264> 
AP reports:

Italian Premier Matteo Renzi says he’ll resign now that Parliament has 
completed approval of the 2017 national budget.

Renzi had offered his resignation two days earlier to President Sergio 
Mattarella following his humiliating defeat in a government-backed voter 
referendum on reforms.

 But Mattarella told him to stay in office until passage of the budget law, 
which was done Wednesday afternoon.

Renzi tweeted that he plans to go to the president to resign at 7 p.m. (1800 
GMT).

UK economic growth flat, says NIESR

Following the poor UK manufacturing figures earlier, comes news that the 
economy’s growth has flattened in the last few weeks, according to a leading 
think tank.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Reseach has estimated that UK 
output grew by 0.4% in the three months to the end of November, the same as in 
the three months to October. But it warned a slowdown was ahead.


The think tank said the economy was being supported by the service sector, 
which was borne out by the earlier weak manufacturing figures. Rebecca Piggott, 
research fellow at NIESR, said:

Recent economic growth has been driven almost entirely by the UK’s broad 
service sector, supported by robust consumer spending. In stark contrast, the 
official figures suggest that the production and construction sectors of the 
economy have declined over recent months.

Looking ahead, we do not expect such buoyant consumer spending growth to 
persist. Sterling’s pronounced depreciation this year is expected to pass 
through to the consumer prices throughout the course of 2017 and 2018, eroding 
the purchasing power of households substantially.

NIESR’s latest quarterly forecast published just over a month ago forecast GDP 
growth of 2% per annum in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017. CPI inflation was expected to 
reach 3.8% at the end of 2017.

Another area likely to be hit by the uncertainty of the UK leaving the EU is 
the Irish banking sector, according to ratings agency Fitch. It said:

Fitch Ratings has revised the 2017 sector outlook for Irish banks to stable 
from positive, as the UK’s vote to leave the EU increases uncertainty for the 
operating environment. Ireland’s economic recovery should remain strong in the 
short term, underpinning the stable sector outlook. The rating outlook on Irish 
banks is positive, reflecting our expectation that improving bank credit 
fundamentals should outweigh these challenges.

 Brexit is negative for Ireland’s long-term economic and political prospects, 
putting pressure on GDP growth and creating uncertainty around relations with 
Northern Ireland. The extent of any weakening of the bank operating 
environment, triggered by a slowdown of GDP growth in the UK, sterling 
depreciation, or potential trade barriers, will become clear only as EU-UK 
negotiations develop. A deterioration in the operating environment could slow 
any improvements in the asset quality and capitalisation of Irish banks...

Capitalisation, although improving, remains vulnerable. We expect capital 
ratios to strengthen in 2017, despite pressure from volatility in pension fund 
deficits and foreign-exchange markets. Fully-loaded regulatory capital ratios 
remain weaker than international peers, primarily due to large amounts of 
deferred tax assets; these assets are reducing slowly because of Ireland’s low 
corporate tax rate and relatively low levels of profitability compared to the 
size of the balance sheet. Large, albeit reducing, stocks of unreserved problem 
assets also leave Irish banks’ capitalisation more exposed if the operating 
environment deteriorates.

 Further improvements in asset quality and capitalisation would improve the 
banks’ risk profiles and may result in ratings upgrades; this is why the 
ratings outlook for Irish banks is positive. Although uncertainty as regards 
the operating environment has increased, we believe credit fundamentals will 
improve in 2017, as the sector continues to work through its backlog of 
impaired loans.

But... Bloomberg is reporting that Renzi might be having second thoughts about 
stepping down.

They say:

Matteo Renzi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-renzi> is wavering on 
whether to stay on as Italian prime minister despite his resignation offer 
after Sunday’s referendum defeat, according to a senior state official.

President Sergio Mattarella wants Renzi to reconsider his decision in order to 
provide political and economic stability, said the official, who asked not to 
be named because the issue is confidential.

Back in the markets, European stocks are hitting multi-month highs on 
continued optimism that Italy’s banking sector will receive much-needed fresh 
capital soon. 

Every index is sharply higher today, with some traders speculating that the 
fabled “Santa Rally” might be kicking off (stock markets often rally in the 
run-up to Christmas).

Over in Milan, Monte dei Paschi is still having a good day, up 8%, following 
the reports that the Italian government could take a €2bn stake in the bank.

And the suggestions that Rome could turn to the ESM for a €15bn bank bailout 
continues to calm fears of an imminent financial crisis.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index says:

Even the prospect of a nationalisation [of Monte dei Paschi], potentially as 
early as this weekend, isn’t spooking the markets as it may avoid retail 
bondholders having to take any losses.

The FTSE 100 index is now up by 100 points, or 1.5% at 6880 -- a chunky rise. 
However, that’s partly because the pound fell at 9.30am whenOctober’s weak UK 
manufacturing data were released

The German Dax is still at a one-year high, the French CAC is at its highest 
level since January, and Italy’s FTSE MIB it at its highest level since June.

EC antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager declined to comment directly on 
the Monte dei Paschi rescue talks.

But she did point out that the commission is keen to support citizens who have 
been missold financial products.

That could be significant, as the small retail investors who own Italian bank 
bonds may argue that they were deceived about the risk of being possibly 
‘bailed into’ a rescue. And some analysts reckon the Italian government could 
circumvent those new bail-in rules by compensating these small investors.

Vestager told reporters in Brussels that:


“One of the things that we are working with is tools to enable governments to 
compensate for mis-selling of different kinds.

 “It is something we have set up before. We will work with governments again 
if they want to set up schemes that can allow citizens to be compensated if 
mis-selling has been taking place.”

Hopes that Italy’s banks can be bailed out one way or another - private 
investors, state aid or the European bailout fund - continue to support stock 
markets. And the expectation that the European Central Bank may extend its bond 
buying programme for a few more months is also providing some support. On Wall 
Street the global surge in banking stocks helped push both the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average and the S&P 500 to new intra-day peaks, although 
pharmaceutical shares were under pressure after president-elect Donald Trump 
said he would look at cutting drug prices. The final scores inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> showed:

 * The FTSE 100 finished up 1.81% or 122.39 points at 6902.23 
 * Germany’s Dax jumped 1.96% to 10,986.69 
 * France’s Cac closed up 1.36% at 4694.72 
 * Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 2.1% to 18,130.66 
 * Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.75% at 8960.4 
 * In Greece, the Athens market added 2.82% to 640.07 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 92 points or 
0.48% at 19344, close to the day’s highs.

On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your 
comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
 
In Greece tensions over reforms are once again mounting with creditors – this 
time over an IMF demand that shops remain open for business on Sundays. Helena 
Smith reports:

Most EU member states would relish overhauling a relic of old times like the 
ban on Sunday shopping. In Greece, though, it is the sort of measure that makes 
for front-page splashes, conspiracy theory and cries of protest.

But the International Monetary Fund, in the spirit of further opening up one 
of the continent’s most sclerotic economies, is not letting go. Instead the 
Washington-based body, which is still negotiating its participation in Greece’s 
latest bailout, has stepped up demands for trade to be liberalised saying shops 
should remain open on Sundays. Moreover, it argues, the reform will give people 
work in a nation hobbled by record levels of unemployment.
 IMF wants Greek shops to open on Sunday Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters
In its splash today, the daily Ethnos newspaper, citing a leaked email from 
the IMF, reports that closure of an ongoing review of the economy by creditors 
– the second since Athens received its third bailout last summer – is now 
contingent on shops opening up for commerce on Sundays. The organisation wants 
the measure to be signed and sealed this month. So far the response has been 
negative. Ministry of finance officials told the paper that, instead, they will 
push through an amendment that will allow shops in specially defined tourist 
areas to stay open. That’s unlikely to pass muster with lenders who have 
signalled they are going to rachet up the pressure on Greece to enforce the 
sort of reforms that will make it more competitive. Ideologically, the 
governing leftwing Syriza party is said to be against the move on the grounds 
that it will not only benefit bigger stores but is an infringement of basic 
workers’ rights.

The Greek Orthodox Church has already likened the step to a sin and shop 
employees, who have already taken to the streets, are girding for further 
battle.

One of the factors supporting the market rally is the expectation that the 
European Central Bank could announce an extension of its bond buying programme 
following its latest meeting on Thursday:

[APP is the asset purchase programme]

That hope, and optimism that Italy’s struggling banks can somehow be 
recapitalised, have combined to send European markets higher, with Germany’s 
Dax up 1.8%, France’s Cac 1.1%, the FTSE 100 1.6% and Italy’s FTSE MIB 1.5%.

On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new intra-day record

he would look at drug pricing.

Markets continue to be buoyed by hopes of a resolution to Italy’s banking 
problems. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

With the Italian government passing its 2017 budget, and Mario Renzi 
confirming he will resign this evening, the European markets maintained their 
banking-boosted growth this Wednesday.

The continued lack of fuss following the Italian referendum result, combined 
with the prospect of a Monte dei Paschi bailout (potentially as soon as this 
week), has led the European indices to a bevy of highs this afternoon. The CAC 
is still at an 11 month peak, while the DAX, following a near 200 point rise, 
is at its best price in exactly a year.

The highs hit by the FTSE were a bit less impressive, though its 110 point 
increase does leave the UK index just 10 points away from 6900, a level it 
hasn’t seen since November 10th. While most of the pan-European growth has been 
inspired by the rallying banking sector, the FTSE has also benefited from a 
commodity stock rebound and the latest pound-plunge, with sterling shedding 
0.8% against the dollar and 1.1% against the euro.

But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, warned markets 
could be getting ahead of themselves:

Talk that the Italian banking system could be on the verge of a €15bn bailout 
from the European Stability Mechanism has pushed equity markets inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> to their highest levels in 
several months...

While the reports of a bailout request have been denied the usual rule of 
thumb when these sorts of reports do the rounds is that there is usually an 
element of truth to them, even if we don’t know the exact mechanics, and 
markets are responding to that.

As with most things the devil is likely to be in the detail, and the likely 
strings that are likely to be attached to any aid request, if and when it 
comes. It is here that markets could be getting ahead of themselves.
 
Well it seems Matteo Renzi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-renzi> 
will not be staying on as Italian prime minister after all and plans to resign 
this evening now the budget has been passed. He tweeted:
Matteo Renzi (@matteorenzi)

AP reports:

Italian Premier Matteo Renzi says he’ll resign now that Parliament has 
completed approval of the 2017 national budget.

Renzi had offered his resignation two days earlier to President Sergio 
Mattarella following his humiliating defeat in a government-backed voter 
referendum on reforms.

 But Mattarella told him to stay in office until passage of the budget law, 
which was done Wednesday afternoon.

Renzi tweeted that he plans to go to the president to resign at 7 p.m. (1800 
GMT).
 
Following the poor UK manufacturing figures earlier, comes news that the 
economy’s growth has flattened in the last few weeks, according to a leading 
think tank.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Reseach has estimated that UK 
output grew by 0.4% in the three months to the end of November, the same as in 
the three months to October. But it warned a slowdown was ahead.


The think tank said the economy was being supported by the service sector, 
which was borne out by the earlier weak manufacturing figures. Rebecca Piggott, 
research fellow at NIESR, said:

Recent economic growth has been driven almost entirely by the UK’s broad 
service sector, supported by robust consumer spending. In stark contrast, the 
official figures suggest that the production and construction sectors of the 
economy have declined over recent months.

Looking ahead, we do not expect such buoyant consumer spending growth to 
persist. Sterling’s pronounced depreciation this year is expected to pass 
through to the consumer prices throughout the course of 2017 and 2018, eroding 
the purchasing power of households substantially.

NIESR’s latest quarterly forecast published just over a month ago forecast GDP 
growth of 2% per annum in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017. CPI inflation was expected to 
reach 3.8% at the end of 2017.

Another area likely to be hit by the uncertainty of the UK leaving the EU is 
the Irish banking sector, according to ratings agency Fitch. It said:

Fitch Ratings has revised the 2017 sector outlook for Irish banks to stable 
from positive, as the UK’s vote to leave the EU increases uncertainty for the 
operating environment. Ireland’s economic recovery should remain strong in the 
short term, underpinning the stable sector outlook. The rating outlook on Irish 
banks is positive, reflecting our expectation that improving bank credit 
fundamentals should outweigh these challenges.

 Brexit is negative for Ireland’s long-term economic and political prospects, 
putting pressure on GDP growth and creating uncertainty around relations with 
Northern Ireland. The extent of any weakening of the bank operating 
environment, triggered by a slowdown of GDP growth in the UK, sterling 
depreciation, or potential trade barriers, will become clear only as EU-UK 
negotiations develop. A deterioration in the operating environment could slow 
any improvements in the asset quality and capitalisation of Irish banks...

Capitalisation, although improving, remains vulnerable. We expect capital 
ratios to strengthen in 2017, despite pressure from volatility in pension fund 
deficits and foreign-exchange markets. Fully-loaded regulatory capital ratios 
remain weaker than international peers, primarily due to large amounts of 
deferred tax assets; these assets are reducing slowly because of Ireland’s low 
corporate tax rate and relatively low levels of profitability compared to the 
size of the balance sheet. Large, albeit reducing, stocks of unreserved problem 
assets also leave Irish banks’ capitalisation more exposed if the operating 
environment deteriorates.

 Further improvements in asset quality and capitalisation would improve the 
banks’ risk profiles and may result in ratings upgrades; this is why the 
ratings outlook for Irish banks is positive. Although uncertainty as regards 
the operating environment has increased, we believe credit fundamentals will 
improve in 2017, as the sector continues to work through its backlog of 
impaired loans.
 
But... Bloomberg is reporting that Renzi might be having second thoughts about 
stepping down.

They say:

Matteo Renzi <https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-renzi> is wavering on 
whether to stay on as Italian prime minister despite his resignation offer 
after Sunday’s referendum defeat, according to a senior state official.

President Sergio Mattarella wants Renzi to reconsider his decision in order to 
provide political and economic stability, said the official, who asked not to 
be named because the issue is confidential.

Back in the markets, European stocks are hitting multi-month highs on 
continued optimism that Italy’s banking sector will receive much-needed fresh 
capital soon. 

Every index is sharply higher today, with some traders speculating that the 
fabled “Santa Rally” might be kicking off (stock markets often rally in the 
run-up to Christmas).

Over in Milan, Monte dei Paschi is still having a good day, up 8%, following 
the reports that the Italian government could take a €2bn stake in the bank.

And the suggestions that Rome could turn to the ESM for a €15bn bank bailout 
continues to calm fears of an imminent financial crisis.

Kathleen Brooks of City Index says:

Even the prospect of a nationalisation [of Monte dei Paschi], potentially as 
early as this weekend, isn’t spooking the markets as it may avoid retail 
bondholders having to take any losses.

The FTSE 100 index is now up by 100 points, or 1.5% at 6880 -- a chunky rise. 
However, that’s partly because the pound fell at 9.30am whenOctober’s weak UK 
manufacturing data were released

EC antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager declined to comment directly on 
the Monte dei Paschi rescue talks.

But she did point out that the commission is keen to support citizens who have 
been missold financial products.

That could be significant, as the small retail investors who own Italian bank 
bonds may argue that they were deceived about the risk of being possibly 
‘bailed into’ a rescue. And some analysts reckon the Italian government could 
circumvent those new bail-in rules by compensating these small investors.

Vestager told reporters in Brussels that:


“One of the things that we are working with is tools to enable governments to 
compensate for mis-selling of different kinds.

 “It is something we have set up before. We will work with governments again 
if they want to set up schemes that can allow citizens to be compensated if 
mis-selling has been taking place.”
