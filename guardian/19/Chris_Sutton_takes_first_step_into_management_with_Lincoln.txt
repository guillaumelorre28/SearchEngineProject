Chris Sutton has been appointed as manager of the League Two 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball> club Lincoln City. The 
36-year-old will be assisted at Sincil Bank by his former Blackburn team-mate 
Ian Pearce, both of whom will begin their roles on Wednesday.

Sutton replaces Peter Jackson who was sacked at the start of September 
following a disappointing run of home results.

Simon Clark has been in temporary charge while the club have looked for 
Jackson's successor and he will remain in control for City's home league game 
against Notts County tomorrow night.

The job is Sutton's first managerial appointment and Lincoln 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/lincoln> have admitted to taking "a 
calculated gamble" with the former Norwich, Blackburn, Chelsea and Celtic 
striker.

"We received over 70 applications for the vacant manager's post and although 
this double appointment could be seen as a calculated gamble, the board have 
every confidence in Chris and Ian and are looking forward to working with 
them," read a club statement. "Both Chris and Ian impressed every member of the 
board with their enthusiasm, ambition and preparation and the decision to 
appoint them was a unanimous one."
