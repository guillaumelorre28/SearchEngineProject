Opposite a vast painting of the Last Supper in 13th-century Saint Francis of 
Assisi monastery in Cres town is a small alcove. Smiley father Zdrak, whose 
benign presence is like a tonic, leads us there. And in the alcove is another 
kind of tonic. No, not the half-empty orange Fanta bottle, but a glass urn of 
greenish liqueur from which the father pours with some glee. “It’s calledkoromac
,” he says, “We make it using fennel from our garden.”

It is delicious. We repeat the tasting. My daughter Maddy (13) turns down the 
koromac and gazes longingly at the Fanta, but it is not offered. It is 9am and 
Maddy, my partner Sophie and I are just beginning our exploration of the island 
cities of the Kvarner gulf, the broad bay of Adriatic sea that snuggles up 
under Croatia’s Istrian chin.

Cres Town is an easygoing place, little frequented by tourists and pleasant to 
stroll around, even in August. (The pronunciation of the island’s name is 
subtle and sibilant and not at all like cress, stress or tress, but somewhere 
between the three. A glass of koromac is probably required for precision.) We 
buy olive oil from the co-operative and admire the work of Mate Solis, a local 
artist and character now in his 80s who still finds inspiration in Cres’s 
pretty boat-filled harbour.

Next day we take a short ferry ride to Krk, which is a big change after the 
depopulated harshness of Cres. Krk is verdant and well-inhabited: its main 
town, also Krk, is busier than Cres but with similar cool stone lanes. A walk 
through its crowded streets can be slow, but why hurry? There are so many 
strange highlights: the temple of Venus that is now a beachwear shop, the 
restaurant (Konoba Maritim <http://www.maritim-krk.com/eng/index.htm>) that 
serves us tangy sheep’s cheese with octopus and squid (Maddy looks wistfully at 
other diners’ spaghetti), and a little doorway in the city wall that leads to 
one of the world’s most astonishing cafes: Volsonis.

 Volsonis cafe in Krk town, built in Roman walls. Photograph: Kevin Rushby 
The building was bought in 1999 by Maria Elena and Goran Stanic, who set about 
converting it to a cafe, but discovered a Roman wall, and then a tomb under the 
floor. In some countries that might have ended any hopes of a cafe, but in Krk 
things are different: they simply integrated a cafe, nightclub and gallery into 
the structure of an ancient building. The result is startling and original – 
and they do good coffee.

We take a day trip to Vrbnik, in Krk’s wine region. This handsome hilltop 
seaside town sees no need to lure tourists: there are few hotels or cafes, and 
lots of ungentrified winding lanes, including one, Klancic, that is so narrow 
we have to squeeze through sideways. There is also a luminously brilliant 
family-run restaurant: Nada. They love their local wines here – all based on 
the indigenous žlahtina grape. We eat a grand seafood dinner and remember not 
to attempt the Klancic on our way back to the car.

 Octopus, squid and cheese at Maritim restaurant, Krk town. 
Our fourth town is Rab, on the island of the same name and about an hour away 
by ferry. These inter-island ferries, operated byJadrolinija 
<http://www.jadrolinija.hr/>, are fast becoming real pleasures on this trip. 
You queue on the road outside the port and race the other drivers to the ticket 
office. On board it’s like being on a mini-cruise: lovely views and a decent 
cafe. If the breeze is right, you can smell the different islands: I swear I 
can detect Cres’s sage, Krk’s pine and, coming up on the bow, Rab’s lavender. 
Maddy is unconvinced, claiming that it is chocolate and chips.

Someone on the ferry tells us Rab “fancies itself”. That’s immediately obvious 
in the super yachts moored by the old town and the chi-chi boutiques that line 
the main street. But this is a subtle and complex town. An enquiry at the 
tourist office for “something unusual” leads us to the headquarters of the 
medieval order of crossbowmen, a surreal mix of weaponry, heraldry and archive 
photos of Rab in the 1930s. That was when Rebecca West came, writing in her 
1941 travel masterpieceBlack Lamb and Grey Falcon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview2> 
of stricken people with the faces of “crucified Christs”. The island is, 
thankfully, a lot more prosperous now.

Maddy is asleep on the hallowed bench of the crossbowmen. She has the face of 
a crucified teenager in dire need of sugar. But first we must visit the four 
bell towers of Rab, a sequence that has all the rhythm and resonance of a peal. 
We climb two before we relent and help our wilting daughter towards the 
dangling carrot that has kept her feet moving since breakfast: Rab cake.

 Another view of three of Rab Town’s belltowers. 
When Pope Alexander III came to the island in 1177, the sisters of St Anthony 
concocted a cake to celebrate: a filling of eggs, almonds, sugar, citrus zest 
and cherry liqueur baked in a spiral-shaped pastry case. AtRabska Torta 
<http://en.rabskatorta.com/> on the edge of town they show you how – with great 
deliberation. Maddy is twitching like an addict awaiting her fix, but finally 
the cake is done. We retire to the garden half-expecting a refusal followed by 
demands for Kit Kat, but no:rabska torta is a hit.

She eats more than Pope Alexander, then, sweating, asks about a swim. Simple: 
there’s a wild forested peninsula next to town, dotted with coves. We stumble 
to the harbour and hire a boat for the afternoon.

Discovering Croatia: fruits of the sea

Croatia is a seafood lovers’ paradise. Ivana Gamulin from the renowned Villa 
Spiza restaurant in Split gives her take on the country’s best fish. “The most 
important thing is seasonality. Sardines are best in May, calamari in summer.
Brudetis the classic dish: a stew of garlic, onion, white wine, tomatoes and 
fish. If I findkosmej or grancigula crabs, I use them, too. A very traditional 
recipe isfažol na brudet, a bean and fish dish. Wash it down with white wine (
bogdanušaor parč grape) or a light red (plavac mali).”
