It’s not clear in what subject Professor Mike Bury holds his chair (Letters, 
23 December 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/22/music-needs-a-home-not-a-vanity-project>
), but if it’s history, he should know that London has been lacking a decent 
venue for symphonic music for as long as anyone can remember. This predates 
Simon Rattle, and the deficiencies of both the Festival Hall and the Barbican 
have been acknowledged by many leading musicians. One need not travel to 
Berlin, Paris, Tokyo or Boston to be aware of what a good hall sounds like. We 
lived in the West Midlands through the Rattle years. It is not an exaggeration 
to say that the whole bustling Broad Street area of Birmingham was transformed 
by the building of the conference centre and Symphony Hall. Georg Solti was so 
impressed on his first visit to the hall that he booked more dates on the spot. 
Birmingham rarely had top international ensembles visit before.

• Let’s have a new concert hall for London 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> costed, pro bono, and then distribute 
the estimated sum for musical education in schools worldwide. Rattle et al want 
there to be audiences for the future, don’t they? Or are they all too 
interested in having others’ money spent on new temples in which to display 
their own magnificence?
