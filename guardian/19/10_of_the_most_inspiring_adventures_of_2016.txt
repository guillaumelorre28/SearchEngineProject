To my mind, a great journey is one that inspires others. This past year has 
seen some great feats of endurance and adventure, with new ascents pioneered on 
remote mountains or implausible rock faces. Some have dived into flooded 
underworlds; others, inspired by history, have retraced the routes of the past; 
and large areas of challenging territory have been crossed on foot, or by bike 
or motorised paraglider. Whether famous or not, most have been shared with 
followers online. Here are a few journeys with soul and heart that have caught 
my attention this year.

You’d be forgiven for thinking that having trained for years to compete at the 
Paralympics in Rio that gold-medallist Karen Darke might want a break from 
extreme physical exertion. Not so. Along with fellow paralympians Jaco van Gass 
and Steve Bate, and Bate’s wife Caroline,Darke is currently hand-cycling the 
Carretera Austral 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/dec/24/my-best-travel-discovery-of-2016-by-writers-adventures>
, a 770-mile route through rural Patagonia from Puerto Montt to Villa 
O’Higgins. They estimate that the challenge will take them 25 days, and aim to 
cover 35-40 miles a day. Darke says she is not an adrenaline junkie: “I just 
love the wilderness. I love mountains. I love adventure. I love sharing these 
places with friends, and meeting strangers.”

In 1930, explorer Bertram Thomas and Omani sheikh Saleh bin Kalut made the 
first crossing of the Rub al Khali, orEmpty Quarter 
<http://www.crossingtheemptyquarter.com> – the biggest sand desert in the 
world, stretching across Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. They had to cope with 
warring tribes, an unforgiving landscape, scorching heat, freezing nights and 
sandstorms, surviving on a diet of brackish water, dates, dried meat and packet 
soup. In November 2015, Mark Evans and two Omani companions, Mohammed al 
Zadjali and Amour al Wahaibi, set out to retrace their route, walking some 600 
miles from the coast of Oman, through Saudi Arabia, to the coast of Qatar. The 
area is even today one of the world’s last true wildernesses. This modern 
journey was far better supported than the original, but Evans encountered many 
of the same challenges with the aim of inspiring a new generation of Omanis to 
explore their beautiful country.

On 13 December 2015, conservationist and freediver Sacha Dench took to the 
skies in a motorised paraglider for the start of a daring 4,500-mile expedition 
across the Russian Arctic. Her aim was to draw attention to the decline of the 
UK’s smallest, shyest species of swan. Over 10 weeks, Dench acted as a “human 
swan <https://www.flightoftheswans.org/>”, following thousands of Bewick’s 
swans on their annual migration. From the Pechora delta on Russia’s north 
coast, she headed west and south across Siberia, before crossing 11 countries, 
including Finland, Poland and Germany, to the swans’ wintering grounds in 
Gloucestershire. Often flying as low as 100 metres, Dench provided a bird’s eye 
view of the challenges facing this endangered species. Landing at night on the 
endless taiga, she dodged polar bears, helped with a reindeer rescue and had to 
contend with engine failure, freezing temperatures, thunderstorms and a 
dislocated kneecap.

In January 2010 Stephen Fabes waved goodbye to family and friends from outside 
St Thomas’ Hospital in London, where he worked as a doctor and set off on his 
bicycle. His plan wasto cycle the length of all six continents 
<http://cyclingthe6.com/>. On that first day, he didn’t get far. He pedalled 
off, did a U-turn and headed to the pub, where he hunched over a pint, fraught 
with self-doubt, while his loved ones supposed he was pedalling towards France. 
Eventually, without coming up with a good excuse not to go, he set off into the 
night. Six years and 53,568 miles later, he was once again peddling back across 
Westminster bridge. While many have now travelled the world by bicycle, his 
journey was more than an adventure: it was an opportunity to learn more about 
health inequality in remote areas. He visited medical projects, hospitals and 
clinics, and interviewed patients and staff.

Atlantic, following the route of Viking explorer Leif Eriksson. The crew sailed

A couple of years ago, photographer Federico Cabrera came across The Burning 
House <http://theburninghouse.com/>, a project where blogger and adventurer 
Foster Huntington asked people what they would take with them if their house 
was burning. This struck a chord with Cabrera, who had nearly lost his own home 
in a fire. He also found himself increasingly annoyed at tourists taking 
photographs of people who didn’t own a single family portrait. For his new 
project,Their Only Portrait <http://theironlyportrait.com/>, he is cycling 
thousands of miles through developing countries with a mobile photographic 
studio, creating, printing and giving back family portraits of people he meets. 
He is also giving water filters and solar lights to those who need them. He has 
already covered more than 3,000 miles along the Andes in his home country of 
Argentina and plans to visit a new country every year.

a hobby turned into a more ambitious undertaking: to discover and experience 
400 permanent bodies of water. It will take her years to complete, in all 
weathers. To Rickman-Poole, tramping over snow and breaking ice on frozen lakes 
amplifies each encounter. It is, she says, “a life changing personal adventure”

In May, adventurer and researcher Ian Finch <http://ianefinch.com/> and 
photographer Jay Kolsch began a 68-day, 2,000-mile canoe journey from the 
source of the Yukon river in Canada to its mouth at Emmonak on the Bering Sea 
in Alaska. The journey across remote wilderness explores the home of the 
Athapaskan First Nations people, who, more than 10,000 years ago, crossed the 
Bering land bridge from Asia and settled in the Yukon region. Finch’s aim was 
to research the Athapaskan way of life and tell how environmental and cultural 
change is affecting their communities.

On 10 December 2015, Natalia Spencer’s five-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, died 
suddenly and unexpectedly. Grief-stricken, Spencer decided to focus her energy 
on a year-long5,000-mile walk around the coast of Britain 
<http://elizabethsfootprint.com/>, starting at Durdle Door in Dorset, the beach 
where she and her daughter had their last seaside visit. Over the past 11 
months, she has tramped through freezing fog and staggered over bogs and 
marshes. Now, having covered over 4,000 miles, she is on the home stretch. Her 
efforts won her Endurance Fundraiser of the Year at the 2016JustGiving Awards 
<http://pages.contact.justgiving.com/awards/2016/voting/>. She is raising money 
for the Wallace & Gromit Grand Appeal, which improves the lives of children 
with rare, critical conditions.
