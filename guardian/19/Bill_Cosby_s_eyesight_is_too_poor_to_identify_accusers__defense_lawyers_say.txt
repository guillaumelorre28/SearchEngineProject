Bill Cosby’s eyesight has deteriorated to the point where he cannot identify 
his accusers in photographs or otherwise help with his defense, his lawyers 
said Wednesday as they waged a multi-pronged effort to get thesexual assault 
case

 against the 79-year-old comedian thrown out.

His attorneys also portrayed Cosby as a political pawn who is being prosecuted 
only because a suburban Philadelphia district attorney used the public furor 
over the comic to get elected last year.

 And they renewed their argument that Cosby’s lurid 2005 deposition

 from a related lawsuit should not be admitted at his trial, saying he answered 
questions under oath only after being assured he would not be charged with a 
crime.

Cosby leaned back in his chair as his lawyers made their case to a judge at 
the pretrial hearing.

The Cosby Show star once known as America’s Dad is scheduled to go on trial in 
June on charges he drugged and molested Andrea Constand, a former Temple 
University employee, at his home in 2004. He could get 10 years in prison.

Cosby has said the encounter was consensual. He is free on $1m bail. 

Dozens of additional accusers have come forward, including 13 women whom 
prosecutors want to call as witnesses at the trial to show that they were 
drugged and violated in similar fashion. Cosby’s lawyers are fighting that 
strategy.

Defense attorney Angela Agrusa argued that prosecutors unfairly prejudiced 
Cosby by waiting a decade to pursue Constand’s complaint. The defense said 
Cosby had memory problems and was also legally blind, presenting a medical 
report that said he was blind in his right eye and had glaucoma in both eyes.

“In the materials they turned over, the photographs, Mr Cosby cannot look at a 
photograph or any evidence and help his counsel or explain who those people 
are,” Agrusa said.

However, prosecutors said Cosby himself caused the delay by fighting efforts 
by the Associated Press – in 2006 and again in 2014 – to unseal his testimony 
in Constand’s 2005 lawsuit. Prosecutors said it was not until a judge unsealed 
the material last year that they learned that Cosby had admitted to a series of 
affairs and acknowledged obtaining quaaludes to give to women before sex.

“He had never admitted to using powerful drugs to facilitate sex with women. 
That’s a big deal,” the deputy district attorney Robert Falin said. “In our 
case, it goes to what exactly did he give to Andrea ... I think any reasonable 
prosecutor would have taken another look at the case.”

 Cosby’s lawyers have also argued that he sat for the deposition only after 
the then district attorney,Bruce Castor

, promised he would never face arrest in the Constand case.

Cosby’s attorneys are using that supposed promise to try to get the case 
thrown out or, failing that, to keep the deposition from being used at his 
trial. The judge did not immediately rule on the issue.

They are also focusing on the campaign battle between Castor and the current 
district attorney, Kevin Steele, in last year’s election in Montgomery County. 
Steele ran press releases and TV commercials attacking Castor for not 
prosecuting Cosby.

Steele made Cosby a “pawn in that election”, Agrusa argued. 

“His cause célèbre became attacking Mr Cosby, stating publicly that his 
opponent had not been aggressive enough, had not done his job,” she said. “And 
now he’s in a situation where he’s got to act on it.”

 At another point, Agrusa said: “My client is not a meme. He’s a human being. 
And his rights have been trampled by ego and ambition.”
