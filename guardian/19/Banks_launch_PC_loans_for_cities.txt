Five of the world's most powerful banks have launched a $5bn (Â£2.5bn) fund to 
speed up energy efficiency programmes in 16 world capitals.

As a result, London, Chicago, Sao Paulo and other centres will be able to 
slash carbon dioxide emissions. It is hoped the project will cut the price of 
green technologies because the combined purchasing power of the cities will 
bring economies of scale.

The energy efficiency fund will make loans to 16 cities on commercial terms. 
Cities' repayments will come from reducing municipal energy bills by up to 30 
per cent.

London Mayor Ken Livingstone has pledged to call tenders within three months 
for companies to refit GLA and public buildings with insulation, more efficient 
air conditioning and green energy capability. The bank deal was brokered by 
Bill Clinton, who brought together ABN Amro, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan 
and UBS.

Urban areas are responsible for about 75 per cent of energy use and greenhouse 
gas emissions in the world. Buildings account for nearly 40 per cent of 
greenhouse gas emissions, and in cities such as New York and London it is close 
to 70 per cent.

The programme could enable London's New Scotland Yard to undergo a green 
makeover. Companies such as Honeywell, Trane, Siemens and Johnson Controls have 
expressed interest in energy efficiency programmes.
