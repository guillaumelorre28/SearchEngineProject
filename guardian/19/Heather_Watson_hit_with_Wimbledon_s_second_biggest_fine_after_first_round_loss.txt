, smashed her racket into the grass after the morale-sapping defeat.

Her fine is only beaten by the $20,000 handed to Fabio Fognini during the 2014 
tournament, also for unsportsmanlike conduct. The Italian received his for 
“damaging the court” but was also given an extra fine of $7,500 for abusing the 
tournament official Wayne McKewen and making an obscene gesture to his opponent.

Watson’s defeat was one of the most disappointing of her career, coming 12 
months after she wastwo points from beating Serena Williams

<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/jul/03/wimbledon-2016-andy-murray-and-novak-djokovic-in-action-on-day-six-video-highlights>
The Briton, who will slide 10 places down the rankings to No65 after 
Wimbledon, said she wanted to “punish herself” after the defeat, so went on 
Twitter andread all the abuse that came her way 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/30/heather-watson-hits-out-internet-trolls-wimbledon-defeat>
. “I was in a bad mood,” she said. “It’s like when you’re in a bad mood and you 
bang your racquet, it’s not a positive thing.”

Watson is in good company, with women’s champion Williams, Viktor Troicki and 
Nick Kyrgios among those fined. Williams, the world No1, was fined $10,000 
after she threw her racket behind her and it collided with a cameraman. An 
incensed Troicki was involved ina rant against the umpire

 in his defeat by Albert Ramos-Viñolas, the Serb accusing him of being the 
“worst umpire ever”. Kyrgios was fined in his first two matches, $2,500 for 
unsportsmanlike conduct in the first round and $4,000 for an audible obscenity 
in the second.
