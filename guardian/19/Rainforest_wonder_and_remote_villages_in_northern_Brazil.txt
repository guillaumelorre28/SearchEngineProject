Tumbling waves rocked our small wooden boat. I clung on, struck by surf spray 
and fear, while Jose, our skipper, just smiled at me, knowingly. I was coursing 
across the Tapajós river, as wild and as wide as the sea, a tributary of the 
clay-brown Amazon where I’d been entranced by slinking pink dolphins.

I’d begun my journey in Alter do Chão, a busy, bohemian town on the banks of 
the Tapajós. At night, I danced like an uptight novice to Carimbó, Amazonian 
folk music, pulsating from bars and car stereos. By day, I lolled on milk-white 
beaches. Teardrop-clear, the Tapajós is so rich in quartz that dazzling beaches 
have formed along its bank like a string of pearls. In 2009,the Guardian’s 
Brazil correspondent named this his favourite beach 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/apr/15/beach-brazil-top-10>.

A handful of South Americans and Europeans arrived in Alter and never left, 
opening cafes and restaurants in the square (try Mae Natureza for potent 
cocktails and live music at the weekends).

But I wanted an adventure beyond the town and so signed up for a trip with AMZ 
Projects <http://www.amzprojects.com/>, an organisation run by Adhara Luz, 
which specialises in sustainable tourism, offering tailor-made tours to remote 
spots using boats and hostels run by riverside communities.

 The river’s water quality is of huge importance to those living on its banks.

Like many areas of the Amazon, it is beset with environmental concerns and 
controversies. A recent Greenpeace report warned that a series of hydroelectric 
dams are planned along the Tapajós and its tributaries, which will result in 
mass deforestation, flooding and water contamination, destroying fish, flora 
and fauna habitats.Protests from locals and indigenous groups resulted in a 
victory this month 
<http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/megadam-in-the-heart-of-amazon-license-cancelled-by-ibama/blog/57189/>
: the license for the São Luiz do Tapajós mega-dam, the largest planned in the 
Amazon, was cancelled. But the battle to save the rivers continues.

I left Alter with two other guests, a Brazil-based couple from the US, armed 
with a three-day AMZ itinerary. There was no guide to accompany us, but every 
element of our transport and accommodation was pre-arranged. We crossed the 
Tapajós by boat to the smaller Arapiuns channel.

At dusk, we arrived in the Atodi community and hung our hammocks in the hostel 
– really just an enclosed sleeping area. It’s designed to keep mosquitoes out 
but didn’t prevent a tarantula coming in. In the adjoining restaurant, we ate 
huge portions of rice, beans and fish.

Tourists first arrived at Atodi in 2008, through Projeto Saúde e Alegria 
<http://www.saudeealegria.org.br/> (Project Health and Happiness). This NGO was 
formed 30 years ago by Adhara Luz’s parents. By boat, the organisation brought 
medical assistance and health education to riverside villages and provided 
vital clean water and sanitation systems. Development projects, from artisanal 
crafts promotion to small-scale tourism, came later, helping to boost rural 
economies.

Just over 200 people live in the village of rattan-roof houses and run 
smallholdings predominantly growingmandioca (manioc). The root vegetable is 
dried and ground intofarinha (flour), a staple of the Amazonian diet.

In the morning, we hiked along a rainforest trail, guided by Atodi member, 
Nilson Martins. We stopped alongside towering Brazil nut trees and tasted sap 
from theamapá tree. “Secondary forest like this was once farmland,” Nilson 
explained. “It takes 20 years to grow back again.” Arriving at a natural pool 
by a stream, we jumped in. Nilson grabbed handfuls of clay from the banks and 
we smothered our bodies in, hoping its reputed healing properties would work on 
us.

The sleeping area is designed to keep mosquitoes out but didn’t prevent a 
tarantula coming in

Nilson believes that the benefits of hosting tourists go beyond the financial. 
It has helped the community begin an important exchange with outsiders. “Young 
people have gained confidence in interacting with strangers,” he said. “They’re 
more aware of the wider world now.”

We spent the rest of our time on the beach beneath the hostel, before taking a 
boat back across river, stopping on route at Praia Ponta Grande. I walked the 
length of this empty and truly otherworldly sandbar beach, tracking the lone 
footprints of cranes.

Anã community stands in Tapajós-Arapiuns Extractive Reserve, an area of 
protected land between the two rivers. We were met by the buzz of 21 students 
from Saint Mary’s College, California, who had arrived via a Saúde e Alegria 
exchange programme, helping to improve the hostel facilities.

We took rowing boats across the lake to see the tucunaré river fish farm, 
which has increased the food supply and helped reduce malnutrition. Reginalva 
Alves Godinho is one of 15 women from Anã who is central to running NGO 
supported projects to aid self-sufficiency. “The men joined in once they saw 
the projects take off,” she said.

Under the shade of a mango tree, I tasted citric-sweet honey from Ivai’s 
Godinho’s stingless-bee farm. He carefully showed us how to extract the liquid 
from the delicate honeycombs. When we left Anã there were hugs all round. “Now 
you know the way!” Reginalva called after us in Portuguese – she was asking us 
to return one day.

Returning to Alter do Chão, we travelled south, 2½ hours by car to the 
Floresta Nacional do Tapajós (entry is free to the forest with a guide). We 
trekked to find the 1,000-year-oldsamaúma. One of the region’s largest endemic 
trees, this venerable specimen was a towering, awe-inspiring vision of life 
force and power. That evening, we ate dinner at a small restaurant on the 
beach, run by the Jamaraquá villagers. My final Amazonian sunset is forever 
etched on my memory. It burnt amber, setting the sky and water ablaze.
