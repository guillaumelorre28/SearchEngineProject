House of Two Urns, Chicago

The House of Two Urns is a characterful B&B in Wicker Park, one of the most 
happening neighbourhoods in Chicago. It is halfway between downtown blues 
joints and local indie music establishments such as theEmpty Bottle 
<http://www.emptybottle.com>. Each of the nine rooms has its own charm (we like 
the look of the Das Porzellanzimmer, which features antique German and French 
plates bordering the ceiling), so expect an eclectic mix of antiques and art. 
Two of the rooms share a bathroom; the others are en suite. Regardless of the 
room you stay in, everyone is entitled to enjoy breakfast – served in the 
dining room every morning.

Nestle Inn, Indianapolis
 Nestle Inn, Indianapolis 
In the historic Chatham Arch neighbourhood – east of downtown and close to the 
restaurants on Massachusetts Avenue – this Victorian house from the mid-1800s 
is home to a charming inn with a focus on food. Owners Robert and Leesa Smith, 
who took over the inn two years ago, bring in local chefs for cooking classes. 
Weekend breakfast is a small-plates affair with Nestle signatures: stuffed 
waffles, egg lasagne and homemade pastries, home-cooked on-site. Choose from 
tasteful, no-fuss standard guestrooms, king suites with sitting rooms, and a 
third-floor suite that feels more like an apartment with its living room, 
kitchen and view of the city.

The Villa Inn, Indianapolis
 Villa Inn, Indianapolis

Mediterranean flair, The Villa has been operating as an inn for more than 20 
years. Comfy guestrooms offer carved four-poster beds, plush sofas and corner 
whirlpool baths, while the inn's kitchen turns out a daily selection of 
homemade brunch standards such as quiche and pancakes. Afterwards visit the

The 21C, Louisville
 21C Hotel, Louisville 
Louisville's 21C Museum Hotel opened five years ago, but the cutting-edge art 
hotel seems to get increasingly more relevant and interesting. Designed by 
architect Deborah Berke, it's the only museum hotel in the country. And the 
exhibits, largely comprising works from owners Steve Wilson and Laura Lee 
Brown's personal collection, change regularly. The 90 guestrooms are spare and 
serene. One of the star amenities is a 21C "Pip" mobile: aLincoln Towne Car 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Town_Car> covered entirely with shiny red 
glass by Louisvillian Monica Mahoney. The galleries are worth setting aside a 
couple hours to explore, and the restaurant, Proof on Main, serves a fantastic 
brunch with southern-inspired goodies, such as fried oysters and grits, or 
quail with hot pepper, root beer, succotash, bacon and pecans.

The Shack Up Inn, Clarksdale, Mississippi
 Shack Up Inn, Clarksdale 
Perhaps the coolest, most-storied place you'll stay along the route – if 
you're looking for an authentic Mississippi Delta experience, that is. In the 
"heart of the land where Blues began", The Shack Up Inn is a former working 
plantation tucked into the expanse of the cotton fields, just a mile and a half 
from the "Crossroads <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Road_Blues>". Their 
cheeky byline is "The ritz we ain't", and in case there's any confusion, that's 
meant in the best possible way. The old sharecropper shacks, an original cotton 
gin and seed houses make an appropriate home base for exploring the back roads 
of the Mississippi Delta and the legends of Sam Cooke,Howlin' Wolf 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howlin%27_Wolf>, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/03/robert-johnson-photograph-identified/print>
 and Charlie Patton. Don't miss Clarksdale'sDelta Blues Museum 
<http://www.deltabluesmuseum.org> and, if you're lucky, time it with Shack Up's 
five-day guitar and bass camp, which offers a full-immersion, all-levels 
experience in the Blues.

Union Station Hotel, Nashville
 Photograph: Lindsay Scott 
A restored 19th-century railroad station, this historic hotel is adored for 
its barrel-vaulted lobby ceiling with gold-leaf medallions, original Luminous 
Prism stained glass and bas relief panels depicting a steam locomotive and 
horse-drawn chariot. With 125 rooms decked out in contemporary furnishings, 
it's an elevated option for Nashville's gritty reputation as Music City. Walk 
down Broadway to get a lively, if not mainstream, dose of the venues and 
western outfitters, and don't missHatch Show Print 
<http://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/our-work> for its seminal collection of 
historic and current concert posters.

Top O'Woodland, Nashville
 Photograph: Lindsay Scott 
Investment adviser, opera singer and triathlon competitor Belinda Leslie 
bought the inn – built in 1898 – 12 years ago and filled it with a mix of 
salvage and inherited family belongings. Her mother's lace wedding dress from 
the 1950s hangs on the wall above one of the guest beds, and her great 
grandmother's leather lace-up boots sit next to a Stetson that belonged to her 
great-great-grandfather, who put himself through dentistry school by secretly 
playing the piano at a speakeasy. There's a story behind everything. The huge, 
mahogany four-poster bed in the master bedroom came from a thrift store. If 
you're allergic to cats, ask for Mr Greene's cottage out back. Spend downtime 
relaxing on the wrap-around front porch or sprawling back patio.

Talbot Heirs, Memphis
 Talbot Heirs, Memphis 
A block and a half from the famous Beale Street 
<http://www.bealestreet.com/wordpress/>, where delta blues, jazz, rock'n'roll, 
R&B and gospel spill from clubs and restaurants, the Talbot Heirs is a 
contemporary guesthouse with an arty, eccentric spin. Checkerboard floors, 
bright purple walls and a gothic iron bed are a few of the hallmarks that 
differentiate the seven spacious suites. What they have in common: comfy 
furniture, kilim rugs and a down-to-earth cosiness. For a head start on the 
music front, send a grocery list before arrival, and the staff will stock your 
in-room fridge.

Heartbreak Hotel, Memphis
 Heartbreak Hotel, Memphis 
Sure, it's a little tired, but the Heartbreak Hotel, across the street from 
Graceland <http://www.elvis.com/graceland/>, is a tribute to the life and times 
of Elvis Presley. Beyond the 124 standard guestrooms, four themed suites pay 
over-the-top homage to the King and his accomplishments, including the Burning 
Love suite and the Hollywood Suite, which is all about art-deco grandeur. 
There's a diminutive Graceland suite and, possibly the most audacious, the Gold 
and Platinum suite, which is kitted out with mirrored walls and gold lamé sofas.
