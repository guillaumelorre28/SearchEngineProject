The recount effort by Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein

 came to an end on Monday, after weeks of legal wrangling yielded only one 
electoral review in Wisconsin that ended up favoring Donald Trump.

Earlier in the day, a federal judge in Pennsylvania

a recount and an examination of that state’s voting machines for evidence of 
hacking in the 8 November election.

Meanwhile, Wisconsin election officials said on Monday that they had completed 
their 10-day recount after finding that Trump’s margin of victory over Democrat 
Hillary Clinton had increased by 131 votes, bringing Trump’s total lead to 
22,748.

Stein, who finished fourth, challenged the results in those two states as well 
as Michigan, where the state’s top court on Friday denied Stein’s last-ditch 
appeal to keep a recount going. All of those traditionally Democratic 
strongholds supported Trump over Clinton.


Even if all three recounts had taken place, it was considered highly unlikely 
that they would flip the overall result from Trump to Democratic challenger 
Hillary Clinton.

 US presidential elections are determined not by the overall national popular 
vote but by the electoral college, which awards votes based on the outcome in 
each state. Clinton won the popular vote by more than 2.6m ballots nationwide, 
according to the latest count.
