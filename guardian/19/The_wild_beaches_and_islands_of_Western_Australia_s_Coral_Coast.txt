In October 1616, a Dutch trading ship on its way to Java was blown off course 
and fetched up on a long, narrow island off the west coast of Australia. The 
captain probably wasn’t the first European to set foot on Australian soil: but 
a pewter plate inscribed with his name makes Dirk Hartog’s the first recorded 
European’s presence.

Last month’s 400th anniversary of this visit briefly put what’s now called 
Dirk Hartog Island in the international spotlight. Afterwards, the only 
inhabitants, Tory Wardle and her dog, Salty, went back to their quiet life, 
hosting occasional fishermen or corporate groups who hire her beautiful 
stone-built lodge.

Storms, sharks and sheep … a trip up Western Australia’s Ningaloo coast

Four centuries after the Eendracht’s landfall, Europeans have still to truly 
discover theCoral Coast 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/25/western-australia-ningaloo-reef-gnaraloo>
, the stretch of wild beaches and homely resort towns that runs for almost 800 
miles north of Perth to Exmouth. While Hartog was in a hurry to get to 
Jakarta’s markets and wharves, today’s blow-ins have their sights on other 
Australian coastal hotspots: Victoria’s Great Ocean Road, Queensland’s Gold 
Coast and Great Barrier Reef, hippy Byron Bay, iconic Bondi, pristine Tasmania, 
the cool urban beaches of Melbourne and Adelaide and way south of here, the 
boutique winelands of Margaret River.

I’ve been to those places and the Coral Coast’s beauty and emptiness make it a 
match for any of them. It includes the Abrolhos Islands, in the Indian Ocean 40 
miles off the town of Geraldton, four hours north of Perth. These used to be 
off limits to anyone other than fishermen, lobster importers and the occasional 
TV chef, but now, charter flights have begun taking daytrippers there from 
Geraldton. The plane first sweeps north over Waigen, an extraordinary 
algae-coloured pink lake and favourite photo opp. Then, heading due west over 
aquamarine and jade seas, it lands at East Wallabi, one of the largest of the 
group of 122 islands.

A peaceful kind of soft adventure awaits: lunch in a basic shelter above the 
beach, a gentle hike to scan the blustery coast for sea eagles and ospreys, 
pauses to spot a wallaby rummaging in the undergrowth.

But tranquillity and nature aren’t the only reasons for visiting the Abrolhos. 
In 1629, a second Dutch ship, the Batavia, was also blown off course, and 
foundered on a reef off nearby Beacon Island. A subsequent massacre by 
mutineers has created a small literary industry. The film rights to one book, 
Islands of Angry Ghosts by Hugh Edwards, have been acquired by Russell Crowe’s 
production company. If the film is made it won’t make for pleasant viewing, but 
the trickle of curious visitors already drawn by the Batavia story is sure to 
grow.

Back on the mainland, the allure of Australia’s “midwest” is history of a more 
ancient variety. Most ancient of all are the Jack Hills, inland north-east of 
Geraldton. Zircon crystals found here are the oldest rocks on Earth: remnants 
of the Hadean aeon, 4.4 billion years ago.

It’s not the only geological hotspot: for a brief spin through the history of 
our planet, it’s hard to beat the 270-mile drive from Geraldton to Monkey Mia – 
on a peninsula in Shark Bay, east of Dirk Hartog island. In shallow water in 
Hamelin Pool nature reserve there are stromatolites, bacterial structures 
descended from the first living organisms on Earth. Embedded in the sandstone 
cliffs of theKalbarri national park 
<https://www.kalbarri.org.au/things-to-do/kalbarri-national-park> is fossil 
evidence of the scorpion-like creatures that first ventured from the primordial 
seas on to land.

 The road to Monkey Mia from Denham. Photograph: Alamy 
Yet what people seek here is a place beyond time. And they can find it by 
turning off west anywhere as the long road north turns from farmland to bush to 
scrub. At nightfall I drove out of the small resort and fishing town of Denham, 
on the other side of the peninsula from Monkey Mia. I crept slowly along, 
keeping a wary eye out for kangaroos and emus. Ten minutes later, I was at 
Little Lagoon, sitting on the sand in total blackness with just the Milky Way, 
the occasional unseen splashing fish and a cold beer for company.

The lagoon’s bigger brother up the coast – that’d be Big Lagoon – is reached 
by a long and sandy four-wheel drive in theFrancois Peron national park 
<https://parks.dpaw.wa.gov.au/park/francois-peron>. The lagoon is closed to 
visitors right now, while the visitor centre is redeveloped. Unless, that is, 
you are with Darren “Capes” Capewell, the area’s busiest and most Instagrammed 
Aboriginal guide. Capes’ mob, as he calls his people, aren’t bound by access 
restrictions, temporary or otherwise. So with him, visitors get to set off in a 
double kayak and paddle around Big Lagoon as rays and turtles sweep through the 
shallow turquoise waters. It costs A$200/£120 for afull day tour

I could go on listing the beaches and the incredible variety of experiences 
this coast offers. Blindingly white Shell Beach, where the cockle shells lie 10 
metres deep for mile after mile; or Shark Bay itself, a scary name for the 
least intimidating encounter with our finned friends – in this case, a small 
species actually called nervous sharks, who live up to their name by darting 
away anxiously at the sight of human legs in the shallow water.

Even the most touristy place, Monkey Mia, where a pod of female dolphins make 
a daily visit for fish and photo opportunities, is a supremely tranquil place 
once the daytrippers have gone.

So what is missing from the Coral coast? Well, it certainly has nothing in the 
way of sophisticated or luxurious places to stay. TheDongara tourist park 
<http://www.dongaratouristpark.com.au/> is a group of simple chalets 
overlooking the dunes (from A$99/£60 a night). TheMonkey Mia Dolphin Resort 
<https://parksandresorts.rac.com.au/park/monkey-mia/> (from $125/£75) is a 
notch up, but the accommodation is nothing fancy.

I wasn’t looking for fancy, but the lodgings around Geraldton and Shark Bay 
are largely tired, 1990s-style motels that stretch the meaning of the word 
“resort”. Many travellers solve this by coming in motorhomes.

Urban sophistication ends in Geraldton, which is the last place to get a 
decent coffee before heading north. Above what could be called the espresso 
parallel, you’re in the region of fish and chips, raucous bars and “utes”, the 
ubiquitous rural Aussie all-purpose vehicle. Those who want club lounges and 
concierge services will find them on the Gold Coast, a mere 53-hour drive away 
on the opposite side of the country. This place is all about the simple urge to 
discover.
