Dedicated to the memory of Debussy and originally written for 24 (later 
reworked for 23) wind and brass instruments, Stravinsky’s 1920 masterpiece is 
determinedly not in symphonic form and was laughed at during the first 
performance. But its spartan originality has changed musical thinking and, at 
under 10 minutes, rewards repeated listening.Fiona Maddocks

Not a symphony? Really? Debussy’s “trois esquisses symphoniques pour 
orchestre” nevertheless has plenty in common with one, as that subtitle 
implies. The three part structure, the thematic interconnections and the 
music’s developmental motor all ensure thatLaMeris much more than mere scene 
painting. Think of La Mer not just as one of the great orchestral works of the 
20th century but also as one which redefined the possibilities of the symphonic 
tradition.Martin Kettle

Unlike Elgar or Vaughan Williams, Britten never composed a conventionally 
titled, purely orchestral symphony, but the emotional tensions of his Sinfonia 
da Requiem (1939-40) - partly conceived as a memorial to his parents, partly as 
an affirmation of his pacifist beliefs - make it one of his essential works.

Liszt’s deeply personal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/jan/08/classicalmusicandopera]> Dante 
Symphony, though less frequently heard than its predecessor, is just as awesome 
and ground-breaking, if not more so. The Francesca da Rimini sequence was 
blatantly copied byTchaikovsky <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJQ3nLnO6Tg>. 
The Purgatorio pre-empted Tristan und Isolde long before Wagner’s masterpiece 
was finished.Tim Ashley

Though it wasn’t performed until 40 years after it was completed, and more 
than a decade after its composer had died, Ives’s Fourth is perhaps the 
quintessential American symphony. With its patchworks of quotations from hymns 
and popular songs, multi-layered tempos (that sometimes require a second 
conductor) and harmonic complexity, it’s easily Ives’ most ambitious work, and 
the climax of his tireless musical experimenting.Andrew Clements

A symphony composed in the model of Haydn on the eve of the Bolshevik 
revolution? The form was hardly earth-shattering in 1917, but Prokofiev’s 
blithely spruce and witty first symphony set a major precedent for modernism’s 
interface with classicism and laid the groundwork for the composer’s towering 
symphonies to come.Kate Molleson
