I made a vegetable loaf the other day, seed-encrusted and flecked with herbs, 
a practice run for the big feast itself. A tangle of root vegetables, parsnips 
and carrots mostly, coarsely grated and held together with buttery onion and a 
little egg, the plan is that it will be the vegetarian option, though it would 
make a fine accompaniment for the roast bird. Soft and giving, with the crunch 
of seeds and woody herbs, the loaf sliced neatly enough. The outside had 
crisped up nicely in its wrapping of buttered parchment.

The loaf was good, but needed some sort of gravy. We made it with onions and 
mushrooms, a sauce as dense and dark as Christmas pudding. Included in the 
recipe is a bitter stout which we tamed with sweet redcurrant jelly. You can 
tinker with the bitter-sweet thing to your heart’s content, letting the fruit 
jelly dissolve into the simmering gravy, tasting as you go, to get something to 
everybody’s liking.

The next day I fried slices of the loaf in a little butter and ate them with 
shredded red cabbage and kale with slices of crisp apple, pomegranates and 
sticky dates. I warmed up a pan of the onion gravy, too. A meatless feast I 
will happily go along with, but a Christmas feast without gravy would be 
unthinkable.

Parsnip loaf, rosemary and mushrooms

Let the loaf rest for 10 minutes or so before slicing, using a palette knife 
to ease it from the baking parchment.

Serves 6
parsnips 500g
carrots 250g
apple 1
butter 75g
onions 2, medium
garlic 2 large cloves
parsley 2 heaped tbsp, chopped
rosemary needles 2 tbsp
thyme leaves 1 tbsp
hemp seeds 1 tbsp
pumpkin seeds 1 tbsp
sunflower seeds 1 tbsp
poppy seeds 1 tbsp
eggs 2
butter for greasing the loaf tin
thyme sprigs 8

You will also need a loaf tin measuring about 22cm x 12cm x 8cm, lined with 
baking parchment.

Peel the parsnips, then cut lengthways into quarters. Grate them finely using 
the coarse blade of a food processor, slightly thinner than matchsticks, then 
do the same with the carrot. (I don’t find it necessary to peel the carrots, 
only to scrub them with a vegetable brush.) Grate the apple, without peeling 
it, and add to the bowl.

Warm half the butter in a shallow pan, then add the grated root vegetables and 
apple and let them cook, for 3 or 4 minutes, until they are bright and 
approaching softness. Tip them into a large mixing bowl. Set the oven at 
180C/gas mark 4. Peel, halve and finely slice the onions. Melt the remaining 
butter in the shallow pan then cook the onion until it is soft and pale gold. 
Peel the garlic, crush finely then add to the onion and continue cooking. Tip 
the onion and garlic into the bowl with the carrots and parsnips. Add the 
chopped parsley to the mixture then finely chop the rosemary needles and thyme 
and add them, too. Add the hemp, pumpkin, sunflower and poppy seeds and a 
generous grinding of salt and pepper. Break the eggs into a bowl, beat them 
lightly to combine yolks and whites, then fold into the mixture. Combine the 
ingredients making sure the seeds, eggs and herbs are evenly distributed.

Line the loaf tin with baking parchment then butter it generously. Scatter a 
few thyme sprigs over the bottom of the tin. Transfer the mixture into the loaf 
tin, pressing it firmly into place. Smooth the surface level and cover with 
buttered parchment. Place the loaf tin on a baking sheet and bake in the 
preheated oven for about 45 minutes, until lightly firm to the touch.

Remove from the oven and leave to settle for 10 minutes then turn out of the 
tin and carefully peel away the paper. Cut into slices and serve with the sauce 
(below) or Cumberland or cranberry sauce.

 Indispensable: stout and onion gravy. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the 
Observer 
A dark and deeply flavoured accompaniment for the vegetable loaf (above), but 
also good for spooning over baked vegetables or a slice of pie.

Enough for 6
onions 2, medium
butter 40g
garlic 3 cloves
button mushrooms 250g
olive oil 3 tbsp
thyme sprigs 8
plain flour 1-2 tbsp
vegetable stock 250ml, hot
stout or other dark beer 250ml 
fruit jelly, such as redcurrant 4 tbsp

Peel the onions, cut them in half from stem to root, then slice each half into 
thin segments. Warm the butter in a heavy-based saucepan, add the onion and 
leave to cook over a medium heat. Peel and thinly slice the garlic, add to the 
onions and continue cooking for a good 15-20 minutes until the onions are 
thoroughly soft, golden and sweet.

Spoon the gravy over baked vegetables or a slice of pie

Slice or quarter the button mushrooms as you wish then add them, together with 
the oil, to the onions. Pull the thyme leaves from their stalks then stir into 
the onions and mushrooms. When the mushrooms are soft and nut brown, scatter 
the flour over the surface, stir and cook for a couple of minutes. Pour in the 
stock and stout and bring to the boil. While stirring, lower the heat, season 
with salt and black pepper, then leave to simmer for 15-20 minutes.

Stir in the redcurrant or other fruit jelly, taste for sweetness, adding more 
if you wish. You are after a nicely balanced gravy – savoury and sweet with a 
deep, wintery character.
