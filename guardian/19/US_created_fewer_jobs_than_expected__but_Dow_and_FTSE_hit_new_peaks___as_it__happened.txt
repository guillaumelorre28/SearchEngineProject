US markets and FTSE 100 hit record highs

Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have hit new peaks in 
the wake of the latest US jobs data, showing the economy in reasonably healthy 
shape and paving the way for further US rate rises.

But so far the 20,000 barrier for the Dow has proved elusive, with the index 
coming within a whisker at 19,999.63.

Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has also hit a new record, with the strength of the US 
currency lifting dollar earners.

On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and 
we’ll be back on Monday.

Now this is getting too much: the Dow has hit 19,999.63 before dipping again. 
Less than a point below 20,000, and another new peak.

Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:

The bulls are out in force and there’s no stopping the FTSE in 2017. The blue 
index closed the week with yet another record high, finally closing above 7,200 
after another strong session. It’s the seventh straight record close and means 
the index has risen for five consecutive weeks – the best performance since the 
Brexit vote in June.

We’ve also got US equities jumping with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting fresh 
intra-day record highs.

And after a pretty soggy start to the US session the Dow Jones has also 
rallied and is now just 40 or so points away from the 20,000 mark. The session 
could yet see the 20k barrier finally broken. The great rotation from bonds 
into stocks – the Trump trade – is back on.

FTSE 100 hits new record close

A burst of life on Wall Street following further consideration of the US jobs 
data has helped push the FTSE 100 to a record close for the seventh day in a 
row.

Another closing high on Monday would see the index match the eight day record 
winning streak seen in 1997.

After an uncertain start, the index finished 14.74 points or 0.2% higher at 
7210.05 - the first time it has closed above 7200.

This is the fifth consecutive weekly rise - the best performance since the 
immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote last year.

The rise in the US currency on talk of further rate rises after the non-farm 
numbers has given a lift to the dollar earners in the FTSE 100, with 
Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems both among the leading risers.

Larry Elliott

And here is our economics editor Larry Elliott on Barack Obama’s final jobs 
data:

So that’s it. The last jobs report of Barack Obama’s presidency has been 
published and the figures encapsulate his eight-year presidency.Job creation in 
December was not bad at 156,000, simply a bit mediocre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/06/us-wage-growth-trump-labour-market-barack-obama-job-creation>
. Better was expected.

In Obama’s defence, he was left the worse possible legacy. The world’s biggest 
economy was in freefall when he arrived in the White House in early 2009.Lehman 
Brothers <https://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers>had gone bust six 
weeks before the November 2008 presidential election and the Federal Reserve 
had taken emergency action to stimulate growth as fears grew that the clock was 
about to be turned back to the 1930s.

The full Grapes of Wrath nightmare was avoided, but the economy lost jobs in 
every month of 2009 and didn’t start to recover until February 2010. Since 
then, jobs have been created every month...

So how does Obama’s record stack up? The answer is that it depends on what is 
measured and what it is measured against.

By the standards of his predecessors in the White House during the seven 
decades since the end of the second world war, Obama’s record is distinctly 
modest. The number of employed people increased on average by around 1% a year 
over his two terms. Only three presidents since 1945 – the two George Bushes 
and Dwight Eisenhower – have a worse record...

If the comparison is with other developed countries, the US does better, at 
least in terms of job creation and unemployment.Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> arrives in the White House 
with the jobless rate at 4.7%, less than half that of the eurozone, and 
reasonably close to what the Federal Reserve considers to be full employment.

Larry’s full analysis is here:

So far the US jobs numbers have failed to put much of a spark in markets, 
albeit the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now just about in positive territory 
and the FTSE 100 has edged higher and could well see another record close. 
Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

It wasn’t a particularly bad jobs report... It just wasn’t good enough to 
secure a market-wide rise, the dollar instead being the only major beneficiary, 
rising 0.8% against the Japanese yen, 0.7% against the pound and 0.3% against 
the euro. This helped suppress investors’ appetite for the Dow Jones, which 
merely sat flat at 19900 after the bell.

 The weakened pound (it also dropped 0.5% against the euro) caused the FTSE to 
ease over the 7200 line... though it wasn’t enough for the index to match the 
intraday peak struck during Thursday’s trading. The eurozone, meanwhile, was a 
dead-zone, with the DAX and CAC barely managing a 0.1% rise between them.

So that’s almost it for the first week of 2017. Bar that initially 
7200-grazing flurry for the FTSE it’s been a painfully dull week, with 
investors seemingly reluctant to get on board with the all-time high-flirting 
indices, but content enough to let those same indices loiter just below a 
series of landmark levels. Though next week is even blander data-wise, a string 
of post-Christmas statements from the FTSE’s key supermarkets and retailers, 
and a dose of financial earnings from the US on Friday, could cause a bit more 
excitement.

Katie Allen

Here’s our story on the US jobs market, from Katie Allen:

The US economy added more than 2m jobs in 2016 and finished the year with a 
pick-up in wages, suggesting Donald Trump will inherit a solid labour market 
from outgoing presidentBarack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama>.

The news of the strongest wage growth since 2009 also raised expectations that 
the president-elect’s first year in office will be accompanied by a series of 
interest rate rises from the US central bank.

In the final set of jobs figures 
<https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm> for the Obama administration, 
December’s job creation missed economists forecasts, with 156,000 new jobs 
added rather than the expected 178,000. But earlier months’ figures were 
revised to show 19,000 more jobs were created than previously thought and pay 
growth was stronger than expected.

Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at the consultancy Capital Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> commented: “The more modest 
156,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in December suggests that labour market 
conditions weakened just a fraction in the closing stages of last year. 
Nevertheless, that is still a solid gain, particularly as it followed an even 
bigger 204,000 increase in November.”

The figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a total of 2.2m jobs 
were added to the world’s biggest economy in 2016 after the creation of 2.7m in 
2015.

US factory orders dip

More US data, and a slightly disappointing set of factory goods orders.

New orders fell 2.4% in November after a drop in the volatile civilian 
aircraft numbers. Analysts had been expecting a decline of 2.2% although 
October’s figure was revised upwards from a gain of 2.7% to 2.8%.

And the underlying trend suggested that manufacturing is holding up. Excluding 
aircraft, orders rose 0.9% in November, the same as the previous month.

However Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, believes a rate 
rise could be more imminent:

The December Labour market report shows why it is wrong to write off a March 
hike from the Fed.

The key figure here is average hourly earnings – now rising at 2.9% year on 
year, its highest rate of growth since June 2009. Along with rising headline 
inflation the Fed is probably looking back to its 3-hike 2017 dot-diagram, and 
thinking ”told you so!”

We still think there may only be 2 hikes in 2017, but believe there is a very 
strong case for a March hike now, and are forecasting just that. Were we to see 
only 2 hikes in 2017, it is most likely to be because the Fed switches its 
attention later in the year to balance sheet adjustment, rather than rate hikes.

The rest of the report was somewhat mixed. Payrolls rose 156,000, lower than 
the consensus 175,00 (INGf 150,000). But this is still enough to more than 
absorb the growth in the labour force, so no grounds for real disappointment. 
And the unemployment rate ticked back up from 4.6% to 4.7% (ING forecast 4.8%), 
which is just noise caused by labour participation volatility.

In short, this report underlines that the US labour market is tight, and 
getting tighter. The Fed will not want to hang about before tightening again. 
This is the message we believe Janet Yellen will try to get across in her 
speech next Friday.

After raising US interest rates in December, the Federal Reserve predicted 
there could be three further rises in 2017. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/us-federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-second-time-since-2008>
 But after the jobs data, they may not come immediately, reckons Ian Kernohan, 
economist at Royal London Asset Management:

The latest payrolls report is in line with other evidence that the US economy 
continues to expand at a reasonable healthy rate. The Fed have signalled that 
they wish to continue with gradual interest rate rises, however given the 
uncertainty about the timing, size and composition of any fiscal stimulus, we 
expect them to hold off until they have greater detail on policy changes from 
the new administration. This suggests they will wait until the second quarter 
of 2017 before raising rates again.

Dow down after jobs data

Despite the US jobs market seeming in fairly robust shape despite a 
disappointing headline figure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen back 
in early trading.

It is currently down 40 points at 19859 points, shying further away from the 
20,000 barrier. But the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened slightly 
higher.

Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have hit new peaks in 
the wake of the latest US jobs data, showing the economy in reasonably healthy 
shape and paving the way for further US rate rises.

But so far the 20,000 barrier for the Dow has proved elusive, with the index 
coming within a whisker at 19,999.63.

Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has also hit a new record, with the strength of the US 
currency lifting dollar earners.

On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and 
we’ll be back on Monday.
 
Now this is getting too much: the Dow has hit 19,999.63 before dipping again. 
Less than a point below 20,000, and another new peak.
 
The Dow has come within less than 2 points of the elusive 20,000 barrier, but 
has slipped back:
Paul R. La Monica (@LaMonicaBuzz) 
19,998.22. Please tell me that's not the peak for the day. Come on, Dow!
 <https://twitter.com/LaMonicaBuzz/status/817425260740018176> January 6, 2017 
<https://twitter.com/LaMonicaBuzz/status/817425260740018176>  
Heads up, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now hit a new peak and is just 
7 points shy of 20,000.
 
In Europe, the mood in the markets has stayed a little more subdued.

Germany’s Dax ended 0.12% higher at 11,599.01, France’s Cac closed up 0.19% at 
4909.84 and Italy’s FTSE MIB finished 0.23% higher at 19,687.71.
 
Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:

The bulls are out in force and there’s no stopping the FTSE in 2017. The blue 
index closed the week with yet another record high, finally closing above 7,200 
after another strong session. It’s the seventh straight record close and means 
the index has risen for five consecutive weeks – the best performance since the 
Brexit vote in June.

We’ve also got US equities jumping with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting fresh 
intra-day record highs.

And after a pretty soggy start to the US session the Dow Jones has also 
rallied and is now just 40 or so points away from the 20,000 mark. The session 
could yet see the 20k barrier finally broken. The great rotation from bonds 
into stocks – the Trump trade – is back on.
 
And the FTSE 100 is not the only record breaker, nor is all the attention in 
the US market on whether the Dow will breach 20,000:
Dominic Chu (@TheDomino) 
Forget about #Dow20K <https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dow20K?src=hash>, the S&P 
500 just hit a record intraday high in today's trading of 2,278...last record

<https://twitter.com/TheDomino/status/817413102077612034>  
A burst of life on Wall Street following further consideration of the US jobs 
data has helped push the FTSE 100 to a record close for the seventh day in a 
row.

Another closing high on Monday would see the index match the eight day record 
winning streak seen in 1997.

After an uncertain start, the index finished 14.74 points or 0.2% higher at 
7210.05 - the first time it has closed above 7200.

This is the fifth consecutive weekly rise - the best performance since the 
immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote last year.

The rise in the US currency on talk of further rate rises after the non-farm 
numbers has given a lift to the dollar earners in the FTSE 100, with 
Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems both among the leading risers.
 
After a negative start, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 49 points 
at 19948 - back on its way towards 20,000.
 
And here is our economics editor Larry Elliott on Barack Obama’s final jobs 
data:

weeks before the November 2008 presidential election and the Federal Reserve 
had taken emergency action to stimulate growth as fears grew that the clock was 
about to be turned back to the 1930s.

The full Grapes of Wrath nightmare was avoided, but the economy lost jobs in 
every month of 2009 and didn’t start to recover until February 2010. Since 
then, jobs have been created every month...

So how does Obama’s record stack up? The answer is that it depends on what is 
measured and what it is measured against.

By the standards of his predecessors in the White House during the seven 
decades since the end of the second world war, Obama’s record is distinctly 
modest. The number of employed people increased on average by around 1% a year 
over his two terms. Only three presidents since 1945 – the two George Bushes 
and Dwight Eisenhower – have a worse record...

If the comparison is with other developed countries, the US does better, at 
least in terms of job creation and unemployment.Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> arrives in the White House 
with the jobless rate at 4.7%, less than half that of the eurozone, and 
reasonably close to what the Federal Reserve considers to be full employment.

So far the US jobs numbers have failed to put much of a spark in markets, 
albeit the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now just about in positive territory 
and the FTSE 100 has edged higher and could well see another record close. 
Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:

It wasn’t a particularly bad jobs report... It just wasn’t good enough to 
secure a market-wide rise, the dollar instead being the only major beneficiary, 
rising 0.8% against the Japanese yen, 0.7% against the pound and 0.3% against 
the euro. This helped suppress investors’ appetite for the Dow Jones, which 
merely sat flat at 19900 after the bell.

 The weakened pound (it also dropped 0.5% against the euro) caused the FTSE to 
ease over the 7200 line... though it wasn’t enough for the index to match the 
intraday peak struck during Thursday’s trading. The eurozone, meanwhile, was a 
dead-zone, with the DAX and CAC barely managing a 0.1% rise between them.

So that’s almost it for the first week of 2017. Bar that initially 
7200-grazing flurry for the FTSE it’s been a painfully dull week, with 
investors seemingly reluctant to get on board with the all-time high-flirting 
indices, but content enough to let those same indices loiter just below a 
series of landmark levels. Though next week is even blander data-wise, a string 
of post-Christmas statements from the FTSE’s key supermarkets and retailers, 
and a dose of financial earnings from the US on Friday, could cause a bit more 
excitement.
 
Here’s our story on the US jobs market, from Katie Allen:

The US economy added more than 2m jobs in 2016 and finished the year with a 
pick-up in wages, suggesting Donald Trump will inherit a solid labour market 
from outgoing presidentBarack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama>.

The news of the strongest wage growth since 2009 also raised expectations that 
the president-elect’s first year in office will be accompanied by a series of 
interest rate rises from the US central bank.

In the final set of jobs figures 
<https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm> for the Obama administration, 
December’s job creation missed economists forecasts, with 156,000 new jobs 
added rather than the expected 178,000. But earlier months’ figures were 
revised to show 19,000 more jobs were created than previously thought and pay 
growth was stronger than expected.

Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at the consultancy Capital Economics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics> commented: “The more modest 
156,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in December suggests that labour market 
conditions weakened just a fraction in the closing stages of last year. 
Nevertheless, that is still a solid gain, particularly as it followed an even 
bigger 204,000 increase in November.”

The figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a total of 2.2m jobs 
were added to the world’s biggest economy in 2016 after the creation of 2.7m in 
2015.

More US data, and a slightly disappointing set of factory goods orders.

New orders fell 2.4% in November after a drop in the volatile civilian 
aircraft numbers. Analysts had been expecting a decline of 2.2% although 
October’s figure was revised upwards from a gain of 2.7% to 2.8%.

And the underlying trend suggested that manufacturing is holding up. Excluding 
aircraft, orders rose 0.9% in November, the same as the previous month.
 
However Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, believes a rate 
rise could be more imminent:

The December Labour market report shows why it is wrong to write off a March 
hike from the Fed.

The key figure here is average hourly earnings – now rising at 2.9% year on 
year, its highest rate of growth since June 2009. Along with rising headline 
inflation the Fed is probably looking back to its 3-hike 2017 dot-diagram, and 
thinking ”told you so!”

We still think there may only be 2 hikes in 2017, but believe there is a very 
strong case for a March hike now, and are forecasting just that. Were we to see 
only 2 hikes in 2017, it is most likely to be because the Fed switches its 
attention later in the year to balance sheet adjustment, rather than rate hikes.

The rest of the report was somewhat mixed. Payrolls rose 156,000, lower than 
the consensus 175,00 (INGf 150,000). But this is still enough to more than 
absorb the growth in the labour force, so no grounds for real disappointment. 
And the unemployment rate ticked back up from 4.6% to 4.7% (ING forecast 4.8%), 
which is just noise caused by labour participation volatility.

In short, this report underlines that the US labour market is tight, and 
getting tighter. The Fed will not want to hang about before tightening again. 
This is the message we believe Janet Yellen will try to get across in her 
speech next Friday.

After raising US interest rates in December, the Federal Reserve predicted 
there could be three further rises in 2017. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/us-federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-second-time-since-2008>
 But after the jobs data, they may not come immediately, reckons Ian Kernohan, 
economist at Royal London Asset Management:

The latest payrolls report is in line with other evidence that the US economy 
continues to expand at a reasonable healthy rate. The Fed have signalled that 
they wish to continue with gradual interest rate rises, however given the 
uncertainty about the timing, size and composition of any fiscal stimulus, we 
expect them to hold off until they have greater detail on policy changes from 
the new administration. This suggests they will wait until the second quarter 
of 2017 before raising rates again.
 
Despite the US jobs market seeming in fairly robust shape despite a 
disappointing headline figure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen back 
in early trading.

It is currently down 40 points at 19859 points, shying further away from the 
20,000 barrier. But the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened slightly 
higher.
