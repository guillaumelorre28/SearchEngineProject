Gurbaksh Chahal, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who pleaded guilty to assault 
after police said he punched and kicked his girlfriend 117 times 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/12/gurbaksh-chahal-silicon-valley-domestic-assault-sentence>
 in 2013, has been appointed an adviser at a venture capital firm, something 
domestic violence organizations say sends a “disturbing message”.

The appointment by Chicago-headquartered NIN Ventures comes less than six 
months after Chahal was sentenced to a year in jail for violating his probation 
by allegedlyassaulting a second woman

 months after pleading guilty to the first case. His sentence is suspended 
pending an appeal.

Announcing Chahal’s appointment last month, NIN Ventures’ CEO, Nin Desai, 
said: “We have great faith in Mr Chahal and his contribution to the ad tech 
industry and believe his addition will strengthen our position in identifying 
key technologies in this space.”

When Pando questioned the hiring decision, Desai said that Chahal had been 
nothing but a “gentleman”

 in her interactions with him.

Domestic violence <https://www.theguardian.com/society/domestic-violence> 
organizations have criticized the appointment, arguing that it highlights how 
privileged and wealthy businessmen can get away with serious misconduct.

 “It sends a very disturbing message that this is OK. He is awaiting what 
could be a year’s jail sentence, but he’s out in the world and we are not sure 
he’s learned anything. We think he’s a public safety risk,” said Beverly Upton, 
executive director of the San Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium.

“We see it in politics, we see it in corporate America, we see it in sports 
and we see it inSilicon Valley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley>,” she added.

Jacquie Marroquin from the California Partnership to End Domestic Violence 
added: “This could be disheartening to any survivor who is seeking justice and 
healing, and can be a dangerous message for those who are considering speaking 
out in their personal and professional lives about the harm they’ve experienced.

“We’re calling on all companies, including those in Silicon Valley, to keep 
the safety of domestic violence survivors central to their business practices 
so that all employees can work in a safe and supportive environment.”

Others see his appointment as a calculated attempt by NIN Ventures to attract 
investors to contribute to its fund.

“It looks as if they haven’t actually raised the funds and they are trying to 
get publicity right now to raise the capital,” said Eileen Carey, the founder 
and CEO ofGlassbreakers <https://www.glassbreakers.co/>. “It’s a Trump 
situation – a bait and switch.”

Carey doesn’t believe that the appointment vindicates Chahal. “I think the 
opposite. It’s a demonstration of how desperate he is for a job.”

Chahal, who founded multiple advertising technology companies including 
RadiumOne (from which he wasousted by the board in April 2014 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/28/silicon-valley-ad-boss-gurbaksh-chalal-fired-over-abuse-convictions>
) and Gravity4, has been at the center of controversy since he was arrested and 
charged with 47 serious felony charges for an attack on 5 August 2013. Police 
officials said that a 30-minute security camera video they had showed the 
entrepreneur hitting and kicking his then girlfriend 117 times and attempting 
to suffocate her inside his $7m San Franciscopenthouse 
<http://www.businessinsider.com/this-sf-adtech-execs-7-million-penthouse-is-now-a-crime-scene-2013-8>
.

Chahal’s lawyers, however, claimed that police had illegally seized the video, 
and a judgeruled 
<http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/gurbaksh-chahals-ugly-revenge> that the 
footage was inadmissible despite the prosecutor’sargument 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/08/video-of-silicon-valley-mogul-kicking-his-girlfriend-117-times-could-send-him-to-jail.html>
 that officers didn’t have time to secure a warrant out of fear that the tech 
executive would erase the footage.

Without the video as evidence, most of the charges were dropped and Chahal 
pleaded guilty totwo misdemeanor battery charges 
<http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2014/04/ad-mogul-gurbaksh-g-chahal-pleads-guilty-to-two.html>
 of domestic violence. He avoided jail time through a deal in which he agreed 
to complete a year-long domestic violence rehabilitation course, 25 hours of 
community service and three years’ probation. However, on 17 September 2014 
prosecutors say he attacked another woman in his home, leading to another 
arrest and the year-long jail term.

Throughout the controversy, Chahal tried to play down his actions, including 
writing ablogpost (now archived) after his first arrest in which he said 
<https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20140427192714/http://www.chahal.com/can-you-handle-the-truth>
:

“I recognize that my temper got the better of me, and I will regret that for 
the rest of my life. But there is a difference between temper and domestic 
violence, and the truth of what actually happened is nowhere close to what the 
police claimed nor anywhere near what the online chatter and pundits are now 
making it out to be.”

He went on to suggest that he was a victim himself. “Celebrities in sports, 
entertainment and business, and high net worth individuals in general are all 
potential targets. It was only a matter of time when I would fall prey,” he 
said.
