Notting Hill Carnival, London


August Bank Holiday in London means (mainly) one thing – Carnival. Officially 
turning 50 this year, Europe’s biggest street party is a whirlwind of parades, 
dancing and booming sound systems, attracting about two million people. Parades 
start at around 9am on Sunday (known as children’s day, the vibe’s more 
chilled) and Monday (which can be full-on for some). After the action winds up 
on Sunday, head south-east to Peckham for the Deadly Rhythm Carnival After 
Party at the Bussey Building (10pm-5am,residentadvisor.net 
<https://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?617256>, from £10). Another option 
is Secretsundaze’s birthday bash at the Oval in Bethnal Green, from 2pm on 
Sunday until 6am the next day (secretsundaze.net 
<http://www.secretsundaze.net/#birthday>, from £14.50).

It’s not a national holiday in Scotland, but still – why not spend Sunday 
exploring the Borders in old-school style on board a steam train? Running twice 
a day between Edinburgh and Tweedbank and back every Sunday until 25 September 
(and stopping at Galashiels along the way), you’ll chug through beautiful 
scenery on the historic Royal Scot locomotive, with optional extras such as a 
three-course lunch or a tour of Sir Walter Scott’s house.

something for all ages and abilities (until 4 September,moorlandguides.co.uk

Step back in time for a re-enactment of the great siege (the longest in 
medieval history) of Kenilworth Castle on its 750th anniversary. The two-day 
event will see battles re-enacted at the striking Norman keep and there will be 
lots to learn about the skills needed to survive an attack, plus plenty of 
entertainment.
