Patrick Kluivert, PSG’s sporting director, reacts to being drawn against 
Barcelona: “In this group, you knew the possibility was there to draw one of 
the biggest clubs in the world. We have played Barcelona two times, we know it 
is going to be a big match. We know everything about Barcelona, everybody does, 
but we have to face it. But Barcelona has to watch out for us.”

Leicester, meanwhile, have a tricky tie against Sevilla, who are third in La 
Liga. Sevilla are so experienced in Europe and while they’re not of the big 
names, I make them favourites, even though they travel to the King Power 
Stadium for the second leg.

“Surely worth pointing out that PSG drew Barca, meaning that Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> did indeed do well to win their 
group this time around,” says Daniel Barnett. “Could’ve been much, much worse.”

Indeed. Probably one of the main aims for Arsenal now must be for Santi 
Cazorla to return from his injury.

As for Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, 
that’s a good draw given that they could have had Atletico Madrid, Borussia 
Dortmund or Juventus.Monaco performed admirably in their wins over Tottenham, 
but City will be confident of beating them. Monaco won’t know how to handle 
their 0-2-1-4-2-0-1 formation.

When Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> won their group in 
2011, they drew Milan and lost the first leg 4-0 in Italy.The aim must be for 
the tie to still be alive when Bayern visit the Emirates. “We thought it might 
happen,” David Miles, Arsenal’s club secretary, says. “The fans will think once 
again we’ve got the rough end of the draw but at some stage the tide is going 
to turn. We’re in a good rich vein of form, we’re second in the Premier League. 
We’re delighted to be playing the second leg at home, so we’re going to be 
upbeat and positive.”

Arsenal faced Bayern in the last 16 in 2013 and 2014, losing on both 
occasions, while they finished second to them in their group last season.The 
good news is that they have the second leg at home and beat them 2-0 at the 
Emirates last season. The bad news is they lost 5-1 to them in Germany last 
season. That said, Bayern haven’t been quite as dominant since Carlo Ancelotti 
replaced Pep Guardiola. They are beatable, but it’s still not the drawArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> would have wanted.

Off to Uefa headquarters we go! Pedro Pinto is master of ceremonies. “What a 
group stage it was, goals, goals, goals,” he says, like that’s a good thing. 
You’re not fooling me, Pedro. It was a chore.

In the BT Studio, Michael Owen, Owen Hargreaves and Steve McManaman. Michael 
Owen didn’t win theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague>. He only won the Uefa 
Cup. That draws some patronising laughter from “Hargo” and “Macca”. Banter.

“While we are waiting for the UEFA politburo to consume their tasty viands, 
may I point out that the list of possible draws forLeicester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity> contains one error - they 
can’t be drawn against Juventus because both are group winners and are 
therefore seeded,” says Kim Speight.

Good, you’re paying attention. That was a test. You passed.

Hello and welcome to live coverage of Arsenal being drawn against Bayern 
Munich or Real Madrid.Or knowing their luck, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. 
Yes, they’ve finally gone and won their group, but a brief flick through Uefa 
rulebook shows that Arsenal must crash out of theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> in the round of 16, so 
their supporters have already mentally prepared themselves for the 
inevitability of a daunting draw against one of Europe’s giants. Arsene Wenger 
can gaze longingly at Benfica or Porto all he wants, but there’s no escaping 
fate.

Winning your group isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, you know. Take Leicester 
City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity>, who could be drawn 
against the French, German, Italian or European champions, or Juventus, who 
could land PSG, Bayern or Real Madrid. Then again, the Pep Guardiola Experiment 
woke up this morning hoping to avoid Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and 
Juventus, or indeed anyone who’s worked out that there’s a strong chance of 
scoring a goal if one of your strikers simply stands near Aleksandar Kolarov 
for a few minutes.

But enough of trying to predict who’s getting who. Let’s get on with the draw. 
We’ve waited long enough, after all, having sat through the gnawingly dull 
group stage, which treated us to few surprises and little in the way of 
sporting drama or tension. The fun is set to begin at11am GMT, although I have 
been advised that Uefa suits have been treating themselves to breakfast, so 
maybe come back in five or six hours to see how we’re set. Before then, 
however, check out the various permutations below.

Patrick Kluivert, PSG’s sporting director, reacts to being drawn against 
Barcelona: “In this group, you knew the possibility was there to draw one of 
the biggest clubs in the world. We have played Barcelona two times, we know it 
is going to be a big match. We know everything about Barcelona, everybody does, 
but we have to face it. But Barcelona has to watch out for us.”
 
The first legs will be played on 14-15 and 21-22 February. The second legs 
will be played on 7-18 and 14-15 March.
 
Manchester City’s director of football Txiki Begiristain has reacted to his 
club’s draw against Monaco.“I think they are playing the best football in 
France now,” he says. “All the respect for what they are doing in the league. 
They have young players and a lot of talent.”
 
Leicester, meanwhile, have a tricky tie against Sevilla, who are third in La 
Liga. Sevilla are so experienced in Europe and while they’re not of the big 
names, I make them favourites, even though they travel to the King Power 
Stadium for the second leg.
 
“Surely worth pointing out that PSG drew Barca, meaning that Arsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> did indeed do well to win their 
group this time around,” says Daniel Barnett. “Could’ve been much, much worse.”

Indeed. Probably one of the main aims for Arsenal now must be for Santi 
Cazorla to return from his injury.
 
As for Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity>, 
that’s a good draw given that they could have had Atletico Madrid, Borussia 
Dortmund or Juventus.Monaco performed admirably in their wins over Tottenham, 
but City will be confident of beating them. Monaco won’t know how to handle 
their 0-2-1-4-2-0-1 formation.
 
When Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> won their group in 
2011, they drew Milan and lost the first leg 4-0 in Italy.The aim must be for 
the tie to still be alive when Bayern visit the Emirates. “We thought it might 
happen,” David Miles, Arsenal’s club secretary, says. “The fans will think once 
again we’ve got the rough end of the draw but at some stage the tide is going 
to turn. We’re in a good rich vein of form, we’re second in the Premier League. 
We’re delighted to be playing the second leg at home, so we’re going to be 
upbeat and positive.”
 
Arsenal faced Bayern in the last 16 in 2013 and 2014, losing on both 
occasions, while they finished second to them in their group last season.The 
good news is that they have the second leg at home and beat them 2-0 at the 
Emirates last season. The bad news is they lost 5-1 to them in Germany last 
season. That said, Bayern haven’t been quite as dominant since Carlo Ancelotti 
replaced Pep Guardiola. They are beatable, but it’s still not the drawArsenal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal> would have wanted.
 
The draw for the last 16 is over! Arsenal have Bayern Munich! See, this is 
what you get for winning your group.
 
Sevilla v Leicester
 
PSG v Barcelona
 
Bayer Leverkusen v Atletico Madrid
 
Porto v Juventus
 
Bayern Munich v Arsenal <https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal>
 
Benfica v Borussia Dortmund
 
Real Madrid v Napoli
 
Manchester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity> v Monaco
 
The draw is almost set to begin. I zoned out while they were explaining how it 
works.
 
Newcastle United legend Ruud Gullit is today’s special Uefa guest.
 
And here’s Giorgio Marchetti! He’ll run us through the rules of the draw.
 
Off to Uefa headquarters we go! Pedro Pinto is master of ceremonies. “What a 
group stage it was, goals, goals, goals,” he says, like that’s a good thing. 
You’re not fooling me, Pedro. It was a chore.
 
In the BT Studio, Michael Owen, Owen Hargreaves and Steve McManaman. Michael 
Owen didn’t win theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague>. He only won the Uefa 
Cup. That draws some patronising laughter from “Hargo” and “Macca”. Banter.
 
“While we are waiting for the UEFA politburo to consume their tasty viands, 
may I point out that the list of possible draws forLeicester City 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity> contains one error - they 
can’t be drawn against Juventus because both are group winners and are 
therefore seeded,” says Kim Speight.

Good, you’re paying attention. That was a test. You passed.
 
Hello and welcome to live coverage of Arsenal being drawn against Bayern 
Munich or Real Madrid.Or knowing their luck, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. 
Yes, they’ve finally gone and won their group, but a brief flick through Uefa 
rulebook shows that Arsenal must crash out of theChampions League 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague> in the round of 16, so 
their supporters have already mentally prepared themselves for the 
inevitability of a daunting draw against one of Europe’s giants. Arsene Wenger 
can gaze longingly at Benfica or Porto all he wants, but there’s no escaping 
fate.

Winning your group isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, you know. Take Leicester 
City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity>, who could be drawn 
against the French, German, Italian or European champions, or Juventus, who 
could land PSG, Bayern or Real Madrid. Then again, the Pep Guardiola Experiment 
woke up this morning hoping to avoid Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and 
Juventus, or indeed anyone who’s worked out that there’s a strong chance of 
scoring a goal if one of your strikers simply stands near Aleksandar Kolarov 
for a few minutes.

But enough of trying to predict who’s getting who. Let’s get on with the draw. 
We’ve waited long enough, after all, having sat through the gnawingly dull 
group stage, which treated us to few surprises and little in the way of 
sporting drama or tension. The fun is set to begin at11am GMT, although I have 
been advised that Uefa suits have been treating themselves to breakfast, so 
maybe come back in five or six hours to see how we’re set. Before then, 
however, check out the various permutations below.
