.

The tests on the joint revealed a tear lying between grades two and three, 
damage which had left Vertonghen in tears as he departed the turf at White Hart 
Lane and would normally rule him out at the very least until mid-March. 
Rehabilitation will begin once the swelling has receded on the left ankle and 
Mauricio Pochettino is preparing for life without the influential defender.

Spurs have found their best form of the season over recent weeks, winning 
seven matches in succession in all competitions to rise to second in the 
Premier League table. The adaptable and dependable Vertonghen has been a key 
element in that and is distraught at the timing of the injury. At the same 
stage last year heinjured medial knee ligaments

, having been elbowed in the face by Crystal Palace’s Connor Wickham, and was 
ruled out for over 11 weeks at a critical stage of the season.

This time he will sit out Saturday’s trip to Manchester City, as well as the 
game at Liverpool in mid-February and the Europa League tie with the Belgian 
club Gent next month. Tottenham have utilised a back three over recent weeks 
and Vertonghen’s absence may see either Kevin Wimmer or Ben Davies, who plays 
in that system with Wales, drafted in alongside Eric Dier and Toby Alderweireld 
across the backline. At present, Pochettino is not inclined to enter the 
transfer market in search of a stop-gap.
