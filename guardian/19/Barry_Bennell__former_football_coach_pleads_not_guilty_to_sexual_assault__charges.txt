Barry Bennell, the former football coach, has denied eight charges of sexual 
abuse against a boy in the 1980s.

Bennell, 63, appeared via videolink at Chester crown court on Monday and 
pleaded not guilty to all of the charges during a brief hearing attended by 
about 30 members of the media.

All the offences, including assault with intent to commit buggery, are alleged 
to have happened between 1981 and 1985, when the boy was aged from 11 to 15. 
One of the charges relates to a Butlin’s holiday camp and others allegedly 
happened in Cheshire.

Bennell was remanded into custody until 20 March for a further hearing to take 
place at the same court, with a view to arranging a trial date.

Judge Roger Dutton reminded the press and members of the public that any 
identification of the alleged complainant “will be treated very seriously” by 
the courts.

Bennell had a seven-year association with Manchester City before moving to 
Crewe in 1985 and worked there for the same amount of time. He has also coached 
for Stoke City and a number of other junior sides in Cheshire, Derbyshire, 
Staffordshire and Manchester, as well as the US.
