It was this fixture last season that spelt the end for José Mourinho at 
Chelsea as Leicester returned to top spot in a sign of things to come. Thirteen 
months on and the normal order has been restored as Leicester languish in the 
bottom half andChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> lead the 
way, yet Claudio Ranieri’s side have a chance to upset the apple cart. Jamie 
Vardy returns for Leicester after recovering from illness, with Nathan Aké set 
to replace the suspended John Terry in Chelsea’s squad.Stuart James
