Almost 3,000 cabin crew from British Airways’ mixed fleet branch at Heathrow 
will strike again next week in a row over what the union describes as poverty 
pay.

The crew will walk out for three days from next Thursday, following a 48-hour 
strike this week 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/10/strike-southern-rail-commuters-british-airways>
 that led to about 100 flights being cancelled or merged by BA.

The union, Unite <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/unite>, says pay at the 
national carrier is so low that crew are taking second jobs or working while 
sick because they cannot afford to take a day off.

With more crew having joined up since the dispute started, Unite called on BA 
to raise pay, which starts at £12,192 basic, although the airline says most 
crew earn at least £21,000 with flying allowances.

Oliver Richardson, a national officer of the Unite union, said: “British 
Airways should be under no illusion about our members’ determination to secure 
a settlement that addresses their concerns over poverty pay.”

All new recruits to BA now join the mixed fleet, which was set up during the 
bitter industrial dispute of 2010-11 and work on long- and short-haul flights.

BA said the strike action was “bizarre and regrettable”. The airline said the 
last strike had failed to disrupt operations and added: “We will again aim to 
ensure that all our customers travel to their destinations.”
