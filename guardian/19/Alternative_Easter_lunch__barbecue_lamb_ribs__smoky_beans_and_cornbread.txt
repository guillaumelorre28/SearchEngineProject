An Easter barbecue might seem a foolish idea in a year when the holiday falls 
at the end of March. If the annual egg hunt is more likely to feature frostbite 
than scorching sunshine, you don’t want to be stuck in the garden desperately 
trying to coax damp charcoal to life – but, with these recipes, you won’t be. 
In fact, there’s no need to scrape the rust off the grill at all even if the 
sun does shine next week because this is barbecue in thetrue, American sense of 
the word 
<http://xroads.virginia.edu/~class/ma95/dove/history.htmlhttp://xroads.virginia.edu/~class/ma95/dove/history.html>
.

In the States, burning burgers while wearing a comedy apron is called 
grilling, and it’s what you do on your summer vacation. Barbecue, conversely, 
involves large slabs of meat cooked low and slow in awood-fuelled “pit” oven 
<http://thedailysouth.southernliving.com/2015/07/20/the-pits-a-primer-part-1/>, 
and that’s something you can enjoy all year round. Indeed, sub-zero 
temperatures proved to be the perfect appetite-whetter on a recent trip to 
Kansas City – though barbecue’s spiritual home lies further south, there’s no 
denying their passion in this midwestern outpost, where the very wind smells of 
woodsmoke and snow covers the woodstacks outside every right-thinking 
restaurant. 

In fact, it was Kansas City that lit the spark at an even further-flung homage 
to the elemental joys of slow-cooked meat. Britain’s first barbecue joint, 
Bodean’s,opened in Soho in 2002 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/feb/02/foodanddrink.shopping1>, 
inspired not by Memphis, or Lexington, but by founder Andre Blais’s love of KC 
barbecue in all its eclectic glory. I took a trip out there with him and his 
executive chef Richard Coates earlier this year to visit gems such as Joe’s 
Kansas City Bar-B-Que, a local institution housed in a working gas station, and 
Arthur Bryant’s, ano-frills joint  
<http://www.slate.com/articles/life/welltraveled/features/2005/an_american_barbecue_pilgrimage/go_to_arthur_bryants.html>
(fans include Sarah Palin and Barack Obama; their barbecue sauce carries the 
legend “The President’s Choice”).

Struggling to keep up, I soon saw just what had got them so excited about this 
smoky, succulent meat – and in the process developed an unhealthy crush onburnt 
ends 
<http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/08/what-are-burnt-ends-brisket-barbecue.html>, 
the fatty point of a brisket. My favourite example was served up on a 
grease-stained cardboard plateby Danny Edwards 
<http://www.kansascity.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/chow-town/article33743760.html>
, a 37-year veteran of the pit, who got the bug from his father, a Texan who 
moved north in search of work during the Great Depression.

Barbecue came to Missouri with the railroad, which brought in workers from all 
over the South – so unlikeTexas 
<https://www.southernfoodways.org/oral-history/southern-bbq-trail/texas-bbq/> 
with its ribs, or South Carolina with itspulled pork 
<https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/jan/31/how-to-cook-perfect-pulled-pork>
, one of the joys of Kansas City barbecue is that has no particular speciality. 
In fact it has appetite enough forall of it 
<http://www.eater.com/2014/7/10/6196209/the-american-barbecue-style-guide-meat-fat-and-smoke-from-sea-to>
. As Doug Worgul of Joe’s is fond of saying: “Kansas City didn’t invent 
barbecue; we just perfected it.”

And perfect barbecue involves wood; Bodean’s gets through several hundred 
tonnes a week in its various outlets, and though the recipes below were 
inspired by our trip to the American midwest together, I wouldn’t dare call 
them “barbecue” in front of the chefs we met there (These are men who can break 
down half a hog in less time than it would take me to work out which end was 
which.) But, between ourselves, you can do low and slow pretty well in an oven 
too. And the best bit is, you don’t even have to venture outside.

Though they’re far less popular in the US than their porcine equivalent, 
delicate lamb ribs are well worth seeking out – the robust flavour stands up 
well to the traditional sweet and spicy rub, while the generous coating of fat 
stops them drying out during cooking.

3 racks of lamb ribs 
1 tsp fine salt
4 tbsp dark brown sugar
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tbsp cumin powder
½ tbsp ground coriander 
1 tsp black pepper
1 tbsp ground ginger

Mix together the seasoning and spices then rub all over the ribs, massaging it 
well into the meat. Leave to sit for at least three hours, and up to overnight.

Heat the oven to 130C/250F/gas mark ½. Put the ribs on a rack above a roasting 
tin, and roast for 2½-3 hours or until the meat is falling off the bone. Rest, 
then peel off the tough membrane from the back of the rack before breaking into 
ribs and serving.

You can use a bought barbecue sauce in the beans if you like, but this sweet 
Kansas City-style version is quick to make, and goes well with the lamb too.

2 tbsp oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 tbsp ground cumin
½-1 tsp cayenne pepper
½ tsp ground black pepper
500ml tomato ketchup
4 tbsp molasses
75ml cider vinegar
1 tbsp mustard powder

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a medium-low heat and cook the onion 
until soft and golden. Add the garlic and cook for another couple of minutes, 
then stir in the cumin, cayenne and pepper, and cook for a minute. Stir in the 
remaining ingredients and bring to a simmer.

Cook for 30 minutes, then leave to cool slightly, then blend until smooth. 
Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.

Baked beans, but not as you know them: sweet and smoky and slightly spicy, 
they make a decent meal on their own.

450g dried pinto beans (or other beans of your choice)
2 tbsp fine salt
150g smoked bacon, cut into lardons
1 large onion, finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
500ml chicken stock
150ml barbecue sauce (see above, or use ready-made)

Soak the beans in water overnight in 500ml cold water with the salt dissolved 
in it. Drain.

Cook the bacon in a large, heavy-based pan over a medium-low heat until it has 
rendered most of its fat, then add the onion and sauté until soft and golden. 
Add the garlic and cook for another couple of minutes, then add the drained 
beans and stir well. Pour in the stock and 750ml water and bring to a boil, 
then reduce the heat and simmer until tender, topping up the water, a little at 
a time, if necessary.

Stir in the barbecue sauce, season to taste, then put in the roasting tin 
underneath the ribs for an hour, or cook on the hob until the sauce clings 
thickly to the beans.

Whether you’re eating burnt ends or pulled pork, brisket sandwiches or smoked 
turkey, barbecue always comes with white bread, pickles and coleslaw. It’s the 
law. This one is sharp and tangy enough to cut through the richness of the meat.

1 small hard cabbage (white, green or red)
1 tsp fine salt 
2 carrots
5 spring onions
125ml buttermilk
4 tbsp mayonnaise
2-3 tbsp cider vinegar
2-3 tsp mustard

Finely shred the cabbage and toss with the salt in a colander. Leave to drain 
for at least an hour. Rinse under cold water, toss and pat dry.

Grate the carrots into a large bowl and add the cabbage and spring onions, 
finely chopped.

Mix together the buttermilk and mayonnaise then whisk in the vinegar and 
mustard. Season to taste, adding more of any of the ingredients if you think it 
needs it, then toss with the vegetables just before serving.

Inspired by the one served in unlovely foam cups at one of my favourite Kansas 
City barbecue joints, Danny Edwards, it’s the perfect tool for mopping up 
excess sauce.

50g butter 
1 small red onion, finely diced
1 green pepper, finely diced
2 tsp chipotle paste
500g sweetcorn, drained
120ml sour cream
125g cheddar, grated



For the cornbread topping:
200g coarse cornmeal
2 tsp soft light brown sugar
½ tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp bicarbonate
3 large eggs

Start by toasting the cornmeal in a hot, dry pan until fragrant. Heat the oven 
to 180C/350F/gas mark four.

Melt the butter in a frying pan and soften the onion and pepper over a medium 
heat, then stir in the chipotle. Cook for a minute or so, then stir in the 
sweetcorn and season.

Stir the remaining dry cornbread ingredients into the toasted cornmeal, and 
then mix in the eggs. Tip in the sweetcorn mixture from the pan, spoon into a 
greased oven dish and bake for 15 minutes.

Beat together the cheese and cream and spoon over the top. Bake for another 
30-40 minutes until well browned. Serve warm, rather than hot, cut into 
generous squares.
