1) Contrasting fortunes tilt balance away from Arsenal


Given Chelsea’s rampaging form at the top of the table, the first Premier 
League meeting between Pep Guardiola and Arsène Wenger feels hugely 
significant, particularly for Manchester City who could find themselves 10 
points off the title pace should they suffer defeat at the Etihad. A week ago 
Arsenal might have started this contest as favourites, but their 14-game 
unbeaten streak in the league came to an end in themidweek defeat at Goodison 
Park,

 while City rectified their recent slump with aconfident 2-0 win over Watford. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/14/manchester-city-watford-premier-league-match-report>
 City’s performance was enhanced by Raheem Sterling’s return to the starting 
XI, who showed glimpses of the sort of form that lit up their blistering start 
to the campaign by flitting into central positions and surging the tempo. 
Arsenal meanwhile appear a little vulnerable; Shkodran Mustafi’s absence was 
exposed by Everton and Wenger will be without him again. All of a sudden it is 
City who have their tails up, before a game they can hardly afford to lose.LO

2) Blues can take defining stride from chasing pack

Crystal Palace <https://www.theguardian.com/football/crystalpalace> have yet 
to feature in a scoreless draw this season and at least three goals have been 
scored in each of their past eight matches. With Chelsea coming to Selhurst 
Park on Saturday, more look assured and the earliness of the kick-off means a 
win for the the league leaders would leave the chasing posse with plenty of 
time to think about the widening chasm they need to bridge as they wait for 
their turn to play. Fourth-placed City take on Arsenal in a match that 
guarantees at least one of the two sides will lose further ground on Chelsea, 
while Liverpool face a tricky trip across Stanley Park to face Everton on 
Monday, where victory is far from assured. A Chelsea win in south London is by 
no means a formality, but if they prevail one can’t help but feel it could be a 
defining moment in their season.BG

3) Will Valencia blunt Baggies’ Brunt?

You’d have got long odds on this being a clash between the teams placed sixth 
and seventh in the table when the fixture list came out, but that’s the state 
of affairs as Manchester United travel to the Hawthorns to test themselves 
against the team directly below them in league. While the sight of any West 
Brom striker scoring a hat-trick is remarkable,Salomón Rondón’s three midweek 
goals 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/14/west-bromwich-albion-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report>
 were even more so because they all came via his head. Makeshift left-back 
Chris Brunt was the unlikely provider of two of them and Manchester United’s 
Antonio Valencia, the man tasked with keeping him under wraps this weekend, 
will need to have his wits about him if he is to keep this unlikely creative 
force from enhancing Albion’s even more unlikely reputation as a free-scoring 
side.BG

4) Eriksen must reap rewards of attacking licence

Spurs’ lack of pace and width is a problem that will not be resolved this 
season. But at least Mauricio Pochettino has now taken steps to mitigate the 
problem, switching to a back three and lightening the defensive burden on 
full-backs better going forwards than backwards and his only players likely to 
beat a man on the outside. This adjustment might also liberate Christian 
Eriksen who, rather like Juan Mata, is not quite good enough to justify his 
lack of physical attributes, while being plenty good enough to sometimes do 
some very good things. Now that he is not expected to act as a winger, Eriksen 
is best placed to do them more often –as he did against Hull in midweek 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/14/tottenham-hotspur-hull-city-premier-league-match-report>
 – but to hold on to his spot this season, to say nothing of next, he must find 
some consistency. No longer does he have the excuse of an infelicitous 
formation.DH

5) All eyes on the man in the middle 

Craig Pawson has been appointed to officiate Saturday’s match between Stoke 
City and Leicester and it will be intriguing to see how he bounces back from 
Wednesday night’s horror show at Selhurst Park. It would be quite the 
understatement to say the official from south Yorkshire did not have one of his 
better games while refereeingManchester United’s win 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/14/crystal-palace-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report>
 over Crystal Palace. Marcos Rojo should have walked, Paul Pogba could have 
walked, Manchester United should have had a goal disallowed and been awarded a 
penalty, while one perfectly good goal Juan Mata did score was erroneously 
chalked off. It was, in short, a nightmare for Pawson and his assistants, whose 
collective mood will not have been helped by the fact that their high profile 
errors were broadcast live to a TV audience. It was a performance to forget and 
he will be hoping for an easier time at the bet365 Stadium.BG

6) Time for Wilshere to enjoy himself

Jack Wilshere has played tidily enough since signing for Bournemouth, passing, 
moving and all the rest of it, and has quickly become an integral part of the 
team. But if there is a criticism of Eddie Howe’s side, who hostSouthampton 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton> on Saturday, it is that they 
lack devil and invention, precisely the qualities that marked Wilshere out as a 
special talent. So, having taken half a season to settle in, avoid injury and 
regain confidence, it is now time for him to make the next step and throw 
himself into those surges that made the ball seem like an extension of his 
foot, taking risks, turning up late in the box and generally enjoying himself. 
Assuming he wants to get back to Arsenal, get back in with England and make the 
most of what he’s got, he’s going to have to.DH

The two teams either side of the thick black line go toe-to-toe on the back of 
defeats in which they both shipped three goals. Swansea City’s defensive 
frailties have been well-documented in this column in recent weeks, so it is to 
Middlesbrough we will turn our gaze in the wake of their heaviest loss of the 
season,at home to Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/14/middlesbrough-liverpool-premier-league-match-report>
. While Swansea are unlikely to play with the kind of intensity that left Aitor 
Karanka so in awe of Liverpool, the Spaniard ought to be concerned by the 
manner in which his normally obdurate team capitulated in the face of their 
opponents’ ferocious onslaught. The lowest goalscorers in the Premier League, 
Boro have missed the cutting edge offered by their injured and occasionally 
infuriating midfielder Gastón Ramírez inconsecutive defeats where they have 
failed to score 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/14/middlesbrough-liverpool-premier-league-match-report>
 and their fans will be hoping the Uruguayan is passed fit to return ahead of 
this crucial six-pointer.BG

8) Watford a litmus test for Sunderland under Moyes

Are David Moyes’s side the relegation certainties of the first two months of 
the season or the upwardly mobile battlers of November? This game could go some 
way to telling us. After winning three games out of four,Sunderland 
convincingly lost a six pointer at Swansea last weekend, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/10/swansea-city-sunderland-premier-league-match-report>
 but were only narrowly edged out by leaders Chelsea at the Stadium of Light on 
Wednesday. Their opponents, Watford, are a well-oiled machine and strong in the 
middle of the park. But they have also lost three of their last four matches 
and conceded as many goals as their hosts this weekend. If Sunderland’s back 
four play as well as they did at Chelsea and treat Troy Deeney with the same 
attention as they did Diego Costa, the Black Cats might just get lucky.PM

9) Hammers must dispel home blues against Hull

West Ham have yet to notch back-to-back home league wins at the much maligned 
London Stadium but following afairly unimpressive midweek win against Burnley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/14/west-ham-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report>
 they will never have a better chance to lay the foundations of something 
resembling a fortress at their new home. Hull City are the visitors this 
weekend and anything other than an emphatic win over Mike Phelan’s team is 
likely to leave the natives feeling even more restless than has been usual in 
their new digs. Following West Ham’s draw against Liverpool last week, Slaven 
Bilic said it was imperative that his team win their next two games and they’re 
already halfway there. Considering the paucity of talent in their ranks and bad 
luck with injuries, it could be argued that Hull are actually over-achieving 
this season despitetheir lowly league status. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/14/tottenham-hotspur-hull-city-premier-league-match-report>
 Should West Ham fail to beat them, the prospect of relegation for the Hammers 
would become considerably more real.BG

10) Will Everton resist the irresistible? 

Mersey Monday and the big question is whether Ronald Koeman can summon his 
dogs of war. The intensity thatdrove Everton to an unexpected victory over 
Arsenal on Tuesday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/13/everton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report>
 was out of keeping with a recent anaemic run of form and will be required 
again should the Blues hope to prevail over the Reds at Goodison Park. A derby 
is the ideal motivation of course, but Everton will have to be focussed from 
minute one to protect themselves againstLiverpool’s irresistible, bewildering 
attack.
