Emma Thompson <https://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-thompson> has broken a 
court injunction – and come uncomfortably close to a manure-spreading tractor – 
to film a Great British Bake Off spoof on land leased for fracking.

The Oscar-winner, along with her sister Sophie, made The Frack Free Bake Off 
as a satirical way of protesting against any drilling activity on a Lancashire 
site used by oil and gas exploration companyCuadrilla 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/15/cuadrilla-wins-partial-backing-for-lancashire-fracking>
. Protesters have been banned from the area after a 2014 injunction.

“I’ve been aware of this issue for a while with my work with Greenpeace, and 
it came to a head for me when David Cameron went to the Paris climate 
conference and signed on to the protocol and then on the sly at Christmas, when 
nobody was looking,gave the nod to 200 fracking sites in Britain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/fracking-uk-government-hands-out-new-licences>
,” the actor said. “It proved to me our Government is saying one thing and 
doing the opposite.”

The sisters baked energy-themed cakes in a marquee created by Greenpeace and 
have released aseries of videos <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2xbqf1ev9g> 
detailing their work. A full episode of the show they have created will be 
released later today, 28 April.

The farmer who leases the land, at Preston New Road on the Fylde, near 
Blackpool,drove a muck spreader past the makeshift studio

Police arrived but made no arrests.

The decision to lease the field to Cuadrilla has caused local upset and an 
application to drill has been rejected by Lancashire County Council 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/09/lancashire-county-council-fracking-cuadrilla-public-inquiry>
, but the company has appealed the decision.

It follows Emma Thompson’s involvement 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/03/mark-rylance-and-emma-thompson-urge-british-museum-to-drop-bp-a/>
 in an attempt to urge the new director of the British Museum to drop BP as a 
sponsor. Along with other notable figures, including Mark Rylance and Margaret 
Atwood, an open letter was sent toHartwig Fischer 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/25/german-art-historian-first-foreign-director-british-museum-hartwig-fischer>
 in the hope he would veto a new contract with the oil company.
