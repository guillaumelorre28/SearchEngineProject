10-year period.

Barton this week agreed a deal in principle to join Burnley – with whom he won 
promotion to the Premier League last season – in the January transfer window 
until the end of the current campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/20/joey-barton-makes-return-burnley-january-transfer-window>
, but the club have now indicated the player may not become a member of their 
squad next month after it was alleged by the FA that he placed bets between 26 
March 2006 and 13 May 2016.

It is understood that the FA became aware of the allegations in September 
after being alerted by a betting company and has been investigating ever since, 
although it is believed the decision to charge him has nothing to do with his 
imminent return to Turf Moor.

Barton, 34, was handed a one-match suspension by the Scottish FA

 in November – the same month his brief, ill-fated time at Rangers came to an 
end – after he admitted breaching zero-tolerance rules, which forbid players 
gambling on any match. He placed 44 bets on games between 1 July 2016 – when 
his Ibrox deal started – and 15 September. That ban has yet to be served after 
Barton’s departure from Ibrox and will now be carried over into his second 
spell at Turf Moor, should that come about.

“Burnley Football Club have today been made aware of FA charges brought 
against Joey Barton relating to historic betting on football matches,” read a 
club statement. “The club will be discussing the matter with Joey and his legal 
representatives and will be making no further comment on the matter at this 
time.”

The Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, made it clear on Thursday that Barton, who 
was named the club’s player of the year on the back of being an instrumental 
part of their 2015-16 Championship title-winning squad, had not formally 
re-signed. “He’s not a contracted player atBurnley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/burnley>,” Dyche said. “We’ve just had a 
chat with him and agreed in principle the idea of it going forward.”

In May, the former Manchester City defender Martín Demichelis was fined 
£22,000 for betting on 29 matches, while at Tottenham, Andros Townsend was
banned for four months 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/07/andros-townsend-boredom-ban-betting>
, three of which were suspended, and fined £18,000 in 2013 after breaching 
betting regulations.

“It all started while watching games in my hotel room,” said Townsend, who is 
now at Crystal Palace. “I was bored and there were TV ads promoting bets you 
could have on the matches I was watching.

“In December, the betting company informed me they were reporting me to the FA 
for breaching betting regulations, as you can’t bet on games in a competition 
that either your loan clubs or parent team had played in during that current 
season.

Barton’s case will be heard by an independent regulatory commission headed by 
a QC. He has until 5 January to respond to the charge.
