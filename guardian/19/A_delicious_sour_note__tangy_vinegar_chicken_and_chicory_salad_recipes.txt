While salt enhances flavour and fat helps define it, acid is the element of 
balance in cooking. As the child of Iranian immigrants – for whom no dish is 
complete unless it causes the lips to pucker – I was primed for this lesson. I 
learned the value of acid long before I began to cook for a living, with the 
feta cheese, yoghurt, pickles, sour oranges and limes that accompanied every 
meal I ate growing up. Watching my parents, aunts and grandparents balance each 
bite with a little yoghurt or a squeeze of lime, I learned to do the same. My 
palate grew to expect that tang – and I missed it in its absence.

Away from home, I’d add salsa to tacos, Chinese black vinegar to soup 
dumplings and pickled daikon to Vietnamese bánh mì sandwiches. While I couldn’t 
yet put a name to the practice, as a teenager I came to view condiments as 
secret weapons in my personal battle against blandness.

Unlike salt, which must be added to food gradually throughout cooking, acid 
usually shines brightest when added just before eating. Think of mint sauce, 
brown sauce and chutneys, all of which offer the welcome contrast of tartness 
to rich, salty foods. Consider fish and chips, which are entirely incomplete 
until they’ve been drizzled with vinegar. Some dishes, though, need acid added 
from the start – see the chicken dish below.

causes the lips to pucker

When I started cooking professionally, I saw my desire for acidic garnishes 
validated by chefs time and again. Every day, before dinner service began, the 
cooks would prepare a sample of each dish for the head chefs to taste. Without 
fail, as they tinkered to ensure that everything tasted just right, something 
acidic was called for: a squeeze of lemon over clam pasta, a spoonful of 
vinegar stirred into a soup, a crumble of blue cheese over a salad that needed 
a little lift. It all seemed so familiar. I may not have had any formal 
training in the kitchen, but my Persian palate had certainly prepared me to 
taste for acid.

Yet I had to keep cooking to learn more about the other, unexpected ways acid 
can improve a dish.Poulet au vinaigre, a traditional lyonnais chicken dish, 
seems at first glance to be an unlikely place to learn about the value of acid, 
as it is rich with butter and cream. But peer more closely at the ingredients 
and you’ll see how multiple forms of acid, layered into the dish over time, can 
both balance richness and create nuanced flavours.

First, white wine. I learned to cook in a kitchen that drew heavily on French 
and Italian traditions, both of which boast long histories of wine-making. 
Where there is wine, people will cook with it. Add it to a dish early and its 
flavour will transform, leaving only a welcome tang to contrast with the 
sweetness of onions and browning.

Next, wine vinegar. Where wine is produced, there will also inevitably be wine 
vinegar. Most commonly, vinegar finds its way into vinaigrettes and other 
sauces and condiments. But uncommonly, rich dishes – such as the hearty chicken 
braise below – welcome the extra bite that vinegar can bring. As with wine, add 
the vinegar early on, to allow its flavour to mellow and integrate with the 
others in the dish.

And then, there’s the creme fraiche, stirred in at the end. Some versions of 
this dish are made with heavy cream, but my acid-loving tongue prefers the 
tartness of soured cream. Never forget the mouth-watering gift a little bit of 
cultured dairy – whether cheese, buttermilk, yoghurt, sour cream or creme 
fraiche – can bestow on a dish just before it is served.

With three distinct forms of acid layered into it, poulet au vinaigre turns 
the corner from threateningly cloying to delightfully balanced.

To ensure the meal as a whole is balanced, serve it with a salad layered with 
as many, or even more, types of acid. Take the chicories with pomegranate and 
parmesan vinaigrette salad below. Bitter and bold, chicories such as endive, 
frisee or radicchio, plead for bright accompaniments such as pomegranate arils, 
which offer both tartness and crunch. They also call for pungent dressings that 
teem with acid. With both balsamic and red wine vinegars and a healthy handful 
of grated parmesan, this vinaigrette does just the trick, coating the lettuces 
with sweetness, savouriness and of course, plenty of acidity. Do what I do and 
taste the dressing with a leaf of lettuce when you think it’s done and then 
adjust the salt and acid one last time. Your tastebuds, and your dining 
companions, will thank you.

Poulet au vinaigre (chicken with vinegar)

Serves 4 generously
1 chicken (about 1.8kg), cut into 8 pieces
Salt and black pepper
75g plain flour
Extra virgin olive oil
45g unsalted butter
2 medium onions, thinly sliced
175ml dry white wine
90ml white wine vinegar
5 or 6 sprigs tarragon, leaves picked and finely chopped
120ml creme fraiche

1 In advance of cooking, season the chicken generously with salt and pepper at 
least an hour before, preferably overnight in the fridge. Bring back to room 
temperature when ready to cook.

2 Put the flour with a generous pinch of salt in a bowl. Coat the chicken 
pieces in the flour, shake off the excess, and put on a parchment-lined tray.

3 Put a large skillet over a medium-high heat and add just enough oil to coat 
the pan. Brown the chicken in two batches, not to crowd the pan. Begin 
skin-side down, then turn to brown evenly – 4 minutes or so each side. Put on a 
tray. Discard the fat and wipe out the pan.

4 Return the pan to a medium heat and melt the butter. Add the onions plus a 
pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and brown – about 
25 minutes.

5 Increase the heat to high, add the wine and vinegar, and scrape the pan with 
a wooden spoon to deglaze.

6 Add half the tarragon and stir. Return the chicken, skin-side up, to the 
pan, and lower the heat to a simmer. Put a lid loosely on the pan leaving a gap 
and continue to simmer. Remove the breasts when cooked, after about 12 minutes, 
but let the dark meat continue to cook until tender at the bone: 35-40 minutes 
total.

7 Transfer the chicken to a platter. Increase the heat under the pan and add 
the creme fraiche. Let the sauce come to a simmer and thicken. Taste and adjust 
with salt, pepper and a little more vinegar if needed to perk up the sauce. Add 
the remaining tarragon and spoon over the chicken to serve.
