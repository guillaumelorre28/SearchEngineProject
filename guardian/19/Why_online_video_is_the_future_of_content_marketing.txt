If it were five years in the future, would you be reading this article or 
would you be watching it? As online video continues its inimitable rise, it's 
an interesting question to ponder.

By 2017, video will account for 69% of all consumer internet traffic, 
according to Cisco. Video-on-demand traffic alone will have almost trebled 
<http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns341/ns525/ns537/ns705/ns827/white_paper_c11-481360_ns827_Networking_Solutions_White_Paper.html>
. Leafing through a swathe of statistics on the subject, I'm hard pressed to 
find any indicator that doesn't suggest rapid growth.

With online video quickly becoming a key means for people to satisfy their 
information and entertainment needs, small businesses that fail to include it 
in their internet marketing strategies will do so at their peril.

Video is the future of content marketing. That is, if it's not the here and 
now.Various studies 
<http://axonn.co.uk/axonn-research/content-marketing-trends-in-2013> show more 
than half of companies are already making use of the medium – a figure that's 
predicted to rise as more and more realise the possibilities. Nielsen claims64% 
of marketers 
<http://www.brafton.com/news/survey-says-marketers-increase-social-video-content-budgets>
 expect video to dominate their strategies in the near future. It's not 
difficult to see why.

When it comes to potential reach, video is peerless. YouTube receives more 
than one billion unique visitors every month 
<http://www.youtube.com/yt/press/en-GB/statistics.html> – that's more than any 
other channel <http://www.alexa.com/topsites/global>, apart from Facebook. One 
in three Britons view at least one online video a week 
<http://www.reelcontent.co.uk/resources/learn/> – that's a weekly audience of 
more than 20 million people in the UK alone. Video can give you access to all 
this. Video done well can give you a slice of it. What other form of content 
can do the same?

The success stories of videos that have gone viral are legend. A recent 
campaign from Volkswagen 
<http://www.reelcontent.co.uk/blog/auto-brands-seek-success-in-video/#sthash.lK6gGi5G.tcqCPt9Z.dpbs>
, for example, saw a trio of its videos viewed a combined 155 million times. If 
such numbers seem out of reach for companies without 12-figure revenue streams, 
they at least demonstrate video's inherent shareability. Engage viewers and 
they will share the video with others. They will spend longer on your website 
and more time interacting with your brand. For any social media campaign, any 
SEO exercise, video is without doubt one of the best tools in the kit.

It is naturally engaging and, in an age of information overload, it's vital 
for small businesses to offer content that is easy to digest; if not, consumers 
will simply move on. Video does this very well. If a picture paints 1,000 words 
thenone minute of video is worth 1.8 million, so say Forrester's researchers 
<http://www.techjournal.org/2012/05/a-picture-is-worth-1000-words-an-online-video-is-worth-1-8-million/>
. Little wonder then that Axonn Research found seven in 10 people view brands 
in a more positive light after watching interesting video content from them.

But is video really possible for small businesses? Absolutely. Production 
costs have fallen significantly in recent years and you no longer need to be a 
technical whiz to work out how to use it. Apps such as Twitter's Vine, with its 
six-second maximum clip length, have dramatically increased the opportunity for 
businesses on a limited budget to get stuck in. Nevertheless, if you're to 
realise a decent return on your investment, you will need to bear the following 
in mind.

Always consider the audience you are trying to reach and ensure the video is 
relevant to them. If it's not the most appropriate means of getting your 
message across, you are probably wasting your time.

Do not neglect social media and be sure to promote across multiple channels. 
If you want to fully realise video's potential, you must make it easy for users 
to find and share it. Don't neglect mobile either.Ooyala has 
<http://go.ooyala.com/wf-video-index-q1-2013.html> claimed a tenth of all video 
plays happen on mobiles and tablets, and it's an increasingly important 
segment, with mobile phones holding41%  
<http://go.ooyala.com/rs/OOYALA/images/Ooyala-Global-Video-Index-Q2-2013.pdf> 
more share of video consumption at the end of June 2013 than at the start of 
that year.

Finally, be creative, not only with the videos themselves but in the campaign 
strategy you build around them. As my head of marketing likes to say, 
creativity wins over the cost of production every time. Get that bit right and 
video won't just be the future of content marketing, it'll be the future of 
content marketing for you.
