Special instructions

Each clue contains a one-word definition of the word required at the number 
where it stands but belongs as a whole to a word of the same length elsewhere. 
Method recommended is to find, after solving a clue, a definition of the 
solution in one of the other clues to words of its length: this will show where 
the word is to go.across.

Every answer is in The Chambers Dictionary (2011) . It gives two of them as 
both one word and two, a fact that Azed has exploited in the relevant clues.
