half years, will be joining Apple in an internship position for this summer,

I'm delighted to announce that I accepted an offer to be working with the 
CoreOS security team at Apple this summer.

Developed by Open Whisper Systems, an open-source development house spun out 
of Twitter in 2013, Signal is a favoured communications tool of 
security-conscious users worldwide. It has been endorsed by users including NSA 
whistleblowerEdward Snowden <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden>
, journalist Laura Poitras and and security researcher Bruce Schneier.

Compared to other encrypted messaging apps, which include WhatsApp, Telegram 
and Apple’s own iMessage, Signal has earned plaudits for the comprehensiveness 
of its own security, as well as its ease-of-use. While security breaches can 
occur through bugs in applications, user error is just as frequently at fault, 
and Signal is widely praised for avoiding the common pitfalls in design that 
lead to users inadvertently exposing their communications.

Jacobs will be joining Apple as the company squares off against the FBI over 
whether or not it can be mandated to write software to help the bureau hack 
into seized iPhones. The standoff hasreportedly prompted Apple to work on 
security upgrades

 to its operating system and services that would prevent it from being able to 
comply with future demands.

The hiring doesn’t seem to be directly related to that effort, but Apple’s 
security team is gaining a higher profile with the rest of the world than it 
ever has before.
