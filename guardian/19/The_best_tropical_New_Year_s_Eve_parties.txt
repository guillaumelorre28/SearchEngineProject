Ranchos Itaúna, Santa Teresa, Costa Rica

Ranchos Itaúna is a small rustic-chic hotel in the sleepy village of Santa 
Teresa near some ofCosta Rica’s best 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/nov/28/costa-rica-holiday-guide-beaches-hotels>
 surf breaks. Austrian expat owner Peter Ottinger has been known to make his 
beachfront hotel the focal point for the best parties on the Nicoya peninsula 
(full moon parties are traditional). And NYE festivities have become all but 
mythic. Don’t expect flyers or a Facebook events page; though one of the 
biggest fiestas west of San José, this is a word-of-mouth affair. Just make 
sure to book a room so your stumble home is a short one.

A three-hour drive south of Viña del Mar, Pichilemu is home to some of the 
best left surf breaks on the planet. Quiksilver throws itsBig Wave Invitational 
 
<http://www.surfertoday.com/videos/3516-final-of-the-quiksilver-big-wave-invitational-chile>
at nearby Punta de Lobos, so come prepared if you plan on hitting the waves. 
Here, collective Casa Nômade, a Viña-based art, music and design team, is 
putting on an NYE fiesta called the Dome Experience. Casa Nômade places a heavy 
emphasis on the arts, specifically pixel-mapped audio-visual art installations 
throughout the Dome. Each guest is allowed to bring in one bottle of booze to 
help offset expenses. Now that’s civilised.

This party has a spiritual component, so if discussions about chakras are a 
red flag for you, this one is a hard “no”. But if yoga sessions, naturalist 
workshops (sustainability, Mayan weaving, poetry of Rumi), and the work of 
artistAlex Grey <http://alexgrey.com/art/paintings/> get your neurotransmitters 
firing, Cosmic Convergence is the one. Plus there’s music, fire-jugglers, 
swimming holes and dreadlocks aplenty. On the southern tip of Lago Atitlán, in 
the lush jungles of Guatemala, arguably the most beautiful country in Central 
America, Cosmic Convergence is the embodiment hippiedom.

The mystic land of Goa is a blend of palm-studded white sand beaches, ancient 
esoteric spirituality and unhinged, trance-fuelled hedonism. Exploiting this 
mash up are festivals such as Sunburn. It rivals the big western fests in terms 
of production standards and amenities, but skipping all that noise in favour of 
the more intimate satellite and after-parties sprouting up is recommended. 
World-class DJs play in the many tiki bars of Anjuna beach, and if that’s too 
crowded try the more isolated bamboo forest-lined dunes of Palolem or Vagator. 
The midnight fireworks displays are said to be a hallucination-inducing 
kaleidoscope.

Day Zero is an epic bacchanalia in the jungles of Tulum, two weeks after the 
standard new year. Globetrotting DJ/producer Damian Lazarus combines his 
experience of some of the wildest parties on Earth – from Ibiza and Berlin to 
London and Brooklyn – into one mystic space for people to discover their inner 
Carlos Castaneda. Guests are encouraged to go on cave hikes and swim in 
underground cenotes (limestone caves), in between sweaty sets dancing amid the 
lush Yucatan flora. Guy Laliberté, founder of Cirque du Soleil, guides the 
exceptional production via his new Burning Man-inspired project Red Moon, while 
Stevie Wonder’s lighting team, a high-powered laser setup, and a top-notch 
360-degree Funktion One sound system fill in the holes. The line-up includes 
Dixon, Âme, Bedouin, Dinky, DJ Three, Lum, Mathew Jonson and of course Lazarus 
himself. It’s sold out for 2017, so start planning for 2018 now!

Not many westerners would put Africa on a NYE party shortlist, which is what 
makes Ghana such an inviting alternative. Kokrobite, a fishing village 30km 
west of the capital Accra, has been dubbed the “Ibiza of Africa 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/16/ghana-new-ibiza-international-party-set>
” for the rising popularity of its beach raves. Expect to boogie with your feet 
in the sand to Afro-house, a mashup of house with African pop and reggae. When 
the sun sets, bonfires and fireworks light your way. Accra’s nightclub scene 
also offers a friendly, more champagne-popping milieu: the entire Osu Oxford 
Street boulevard morphs into a giant carnival. Either way the parties don’t 
slow down till the rising sun turns the Atlantic pink and orange, and everyone 
rushes to the ocean for a collective morning swim to welcome in the new year.

Everyone thinks about where they want to be on New Year’s Eve, but what about 
New Year’s Day? Let Them Eat Cake, a twinkling star in Australia’s boutique 
festival circuit, rings in the new year while the sun is shining. Half an hour 
from Melbourne in the bucolic gardens of Werribee Mansion, Cake attracts a 
who’s who of Melbourne royalty and Aussie cool (DJs, floppy-haired rock stars, 
artists and more). Its growing fame can be attributed to a heavy investment in 
the guest experience, with roving performers, interactive art installations and 
numerous themed bars selling artisan cocktails, craft beers and ciders (there 
are so many bars, organisers promise you won’t wait longer than one minute for 
a re-up). The line-up includes an impeccable selection of deck maestros: Heidi, 
Dusky, Mano Le Tough, Tokimonsta, Edit, Cut Chemist, Leon Vynehall, Maribou 
State and more.
