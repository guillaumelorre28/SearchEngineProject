Omerdic appeared in the Melbourne magistrates court on Friday, along with 
another man, who cannot be named.

That man is charged with sexual penetration of a child under the age of 16 and 
being a party to a forced marriage.

A DVD of the ceremony being conducted at a mosque may form part of the 
evidence, the court was told.

Omerdic’s bail was continued and the other man was further remanded in custody 
until the case resumes on 3 February.

name of the second man charged.
