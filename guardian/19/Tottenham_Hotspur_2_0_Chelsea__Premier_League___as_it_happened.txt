Full time: Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 Chelsea

Chelsea’s astonishing winning run is over. Spurs were at their charming, 
admirable best to win an unyielding match between two excellent sides. Dele 
Alli headed two lovely goals to make it six in three games and seven in four. 
He’s on quite a run; Chelsea’s is over, but they are still five points clear at 
the top of the table. Could be worse, eh. Thanks for your company; here’s Mac 
Millings with the last word.

“Wrong. Roy Walker.”

90+2 min “Kyle Walker or Des Walker?” says Simon Frank. I’m appalled you even 
had to ask the question. Always, always Des. At his best, either side of Italia 
90, he pretty much perfected defending. Best England defender of my lifetime.

90 min David Luiz, in the Huth-at-Camp-Nou-bugger-dignity-we’re-losing role, 
flicks a header high over the bar from 12 yards. It was maybe slightly better 
than a half-chance.

with the obvious exception of Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao, reigning champions 
of the much admired Chinese Super League.

87 min Costa, frustrated, has a little tug of Dier’s right ear. Not sure where 
that stands on Niall Mullen’s hygiene-o-meter. Moments later, Danny Rose is 
booked for something or other. Rose and Walker have been so good again.

83 min Chelsea haven’t done a huge amount wrong tonight. The timing of the 
goals - one just before half-time, one when Chelsea were rampant just after the 
break - was really important. Spurs have done unto Chelsea asChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> have done unto so many other 
teams this season.

80 min For the first time, Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are hinting at an acceptance of 
defeat. The good news for them is that the next two league games - Leicester 
away, and Hull at home, and by the way I hope Hull are relegated in each of the 
next 48 seasons after that utterly scandalous decision to sack Mike Phelan - 
are winnable. They are still strong favourites, but at least the rest of the 
Big Six have hope.

77 min Rose is fouled 30 yards from goal, slightly to the left of centre. 
Eriksen has a pop nonetheless and curls a nice effort just wide of the near

67 min Eriksen combines yet again with Walker and hits a shot that is blocked 
by Cahill. It would be entirely wrong to say that Eriksen and Alli are Spurs’ 
version of Xavi and Iniesta, so that’s exactly what I’m going to do. You know 
what I mean. They are nowhere near that all-time-great class, but they go 
together beautifully and they are so lovely to watch. The portmanteau isn’t 
quite as good as Xaviesta, though: Allikesen? Elli?

59 min Eriksen’s cross deflects towards Kane, eight yards out, and Courtois 
gets there just before him to palm the ball away. Dele Alli, as you probably 
know, has now scored six in his last three games.

you can’t see a Conte team doing that.

GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 Chelsea (Alli 54)

They’ve done it again! Another lovely cross from Eriksen on the right, and a 
fine header from Dele Alli. This was a superb ball, clipped beyond the far 
post, and Alli hung in the air for an age before cushioning a header back 
across Courtois and into the net. Brilliant.

any Spurs fans who gave up smoking for the New Year may be in for a tough 45

just given up smoking. “Stay resolute! Let’s hope Spurs do too! Rob?”

50 min “Rob,” says Thaddeus Verhoff. “I thought it an entertaining first 
half--if a tad sloppy. Wanted to shout out to my friend Brian in CA, Carmen in 
NYC (where I am watching live while he wanders about selling beer) and Melissa 
who couldn’t be bothered to show up for the first half. If Melissa did show up 
at the pub we could engage in some good-natured banter, as she somehow roots for
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> and I for Spurs. Here’s 
to the second half!”

Are you suggesting not all banter is good-natured? Next you’ll be saying 98 
per cent of banter is just bullying by another name!

49 min This is a furious start to the second half from Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>. Moses falls over in the box 
after a challenge from Dembele. Martin Atkinson waves play on. It was probably 
a foul, a shove to the side, but the original contact was outside the box.

48 min Hazard misses a great chance! A cross from the right was half cleared 
to Alonso, who headed it back towards goal. It bounced up to Hazard, just 
beyond the far post, and he headed wide from a few yards. He did have Lloris 
and Vertonghen between him and the goal but should still have scored.

47 min Chelsea aren’t going to go quietly. Diego Costa works some space 20 
yards from goal and hits a fierce low shot that is excellently palmed away by 
Lloris. Then Hazard slides a dangerous ball across the face of goal that Rose 
puts behind for a corner.

47 min “It’s therefore inevitable that you’ll move to cover the Chinese Super 
League (if your comments are anything to go by),” says Jerome Mallon. “And when 
you do, it will have always been a boyhood dream, am I right?”

Exactly. At university, while everyone else had profound posters of Che 
Guevara and Pamela Anderson on their wall, I preferred an artist’s impression 
of Fan Zhiyi.

the second half. They have only needed to come from behind twice in this run - 
against City and Spurs - but teams managed by Antonio Conte will never shy away 
from adversity.

Half-time chit-chat

“Continuing on the Chinese Super League theme,” says Gerrard Catesby, “I pose 
another question: do you think that players are selfish putting their financial 
situation (which in reality isn’t exactly unsustainable in the European 
leagues) above their fame, prestige, and, ultimately, their career, or do you 
think that it is - as mentioned - a slice of their own downfall, initiated by 
their own actions? Thus, it is no longer selfish, but ignorant. Thoughts 
please.”

Well, Gerrard, China are certainly looking to develop their football, looking 
at their signings and their recruitment. If an opportunity came along I am 
contracted to the Guardian but I have to look at my long-term strategy of my 
career. How long can I last as a liveblogger? I have been at the Guardian 13 
years. It’s been a wonderful 13 years. There is no offer on the table but if 
they made an offer it would be under consideration. But at the moment I still 
enjoy working for the Guardian.

Half time: Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Chelsea

Well, that changes things. Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> won’t panic - they were behind 
at half-time against Manchester City last month and ended up stuffing them. 
Spurs are a much better side defensively, mind. See you in 10 minutes what 
should/will/may be a belting second half.

GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Chelsea (Alli 45+1)

This is a fine goal. Walker runs at Alonso and gives the ball back to Eriksen, 
who curls a fine ball towards the far post. Alli gets between two defenders and 
loops a high-class header back across the leaping Courtois and into the net. 
What a joyous footballer he is.Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> won’t be happy with the 
defending but Eriksen and Alli, two lovely footballers, played their parts 
immaculately.

years. It’s been a wonderful 13 years. There is no offer on the table but if 
they made an offer it would be under consideration. But at the moment I still 
enjoy working for the Guardian.

38 min Cahill gives the ball to Eriksen, panics, pulls him back and is booked. 
Well played Gary. The resulting free-kick, taken by Dembele on the right, is 
swung beyond the far post. Dier heads it across the six-yard box and Courtois 
dives to his left to push it away. It wasn’t a save as such, as it wasn’t going 
in, but it may have saved a goal nonetheless.

Chelsea’s astonishing winning run is over. Spurs were at their charming, 
admirable best to win an unyielding match between two excellent sides. Dele 
Alli headed two lovely goals to make it six in three games and seven in four. 
He’s on quite a run; Chelsea’s is over, but they are still five points clear at 
the top of the table. Could be worse, eh. Thanks for your company; here’s Mac 
Millings with the last word.

“Wrong. Roy Walker.”

90+3 min Son replaces Harry Kane, who has done plenty of sour metres up front 
tonight.
 
90+2 min “Kyle Walker or Des Walker?” says Simon Frank. I’m appalled you even 
had to ask the question. Always, always Des. At his best, either side of Italia 
90, he pretty much perfected defending. Best England defender of my lifetime.
 
90+1 min There will be four additional minutes of futile defiance from Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>.
 
90 min David Luiz, in the Huth-at-Camp-Nou-bugger-dignity-we’re-losing role, 
flicks a header high over the bar from 12 yards. It was maybe slightly better 
than a half-chance.
 
88 min If only Spurs had played their Champions League games at White Hart 
Lane, eh. They are good enough to beat any team in the world on this ground - 
with the obvious exception of Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao, reigning champions 
of the much admired Chinese Super League.
 
87 min Costa, frustrated, has a little tug of Dier’s right ear. Not sure where 
that stands on Niall Mullen’s hygiene-o-meter. Moments later, Danny Rose is 
booked for something or other. Rose and Walker have been so good again.
 
86 min Spurs make another change: Moussa Sissoko replaces the wonderful Dele 
Alli.

substituted. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters  
85 min Chelsea make their final change: Michy Batshuayi comes off the missing 
persons list to replace Victor Moses.
 
83 min Chelsea haven’t done a huge amount wrong tonight. The timing of the 
goals - one just before half-time, one when Chelsea were rampant just after the 
break - was really important. Spurs have done unto Chelsea asChelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> have done unto so many other 
teams this season.
 
81 min  “Tactics question,” says Zulfiqar Shah. “What do you think Spurs are 
doing to exploit Chelsea’s 3-4-3 system?”

Scoring goals. You’re welcome!
 
80 min For the first time, Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are hinting at an acceptance of 
defeat. The good news for them is that the next two league games - Leicester 
away, and Hull at home, and by the way I hope Hull are relegated in each of the 
next 48 seasons after that utterly scandalous decision to sack Mike Phelan - 
are winnable. They are still strong favourites, but at least the rest of the 
Big Six have hope.
 
79 min Cesc Fabregas gets a warm welcome as he comes on to replace N’Golo 
Kante.
 
78 min “The correct portmanteau is Delisen,” says Shaun, “which sounds as 
delicious as their link-ups.”

Look, all of it, just let it go.
 
77 min Rose is fouled 30 yards from goal, slightly to the left of centre. 
Eriksen has a pop nonetheless and curls a nice effort just wide of the near 
post. Courtois had it covered.
 
76 min  “Deliksen,” suggests Gustav Björklund for the Alli/Eriksen 
portmanteau. I think I’m just going to call them Dele Alli and Christian 
Eriksen.
 
74 min A Spurs substitution: Harry Winks replaces the excellent Mousa Dembele. 
You have to love Pochettino’s faith in young players. You have to love 
Pochettino full stop.
 
73 min Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> have won 13 
matches in a row and yet - cliche alert - a draw here would feel like the 
biggest victory of all.
 
72 min Pedro, who has been lively since going to left wing-back, wins a 
corner. That leads to another, of which he makes a Horlicks.
 
68 min Pedro’s fast cross is cleared superbly in the kung-fu style by 
Vertonghen, in his own six-yard box. Moments later, Alderweireld blocks Costa’s 
scissor-kick.Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> are as 
incessant as the aliens in Space Invaders, and almost as inexorable.

67 min Eriksen combines yet again with Walker and hits a shot that is blocked 
by Cahill. It would be entirely wrong to say that Eriksen and Alli are Spurs’ 
version of Xavi and Iniesta, so that’s exactly what I’m going to do. You know 
what I mean. They are nowhere near that all-time-great class, but they go 
together beautifully and they are so lovely to watch. The portmanteau isn’t 
quite as good as Xaviesta, though: Allikesen? Elli?
 
66 min “Don’t forget the Snoop Dogg posters, Bobby,” says my university buddy 
James Hatfield <https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/jimbob96>, whose memory 
is apparently not what it was.
 
65 min That second goal has rocked Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, who were playing so well at 
that point. Willian is coming on to replace Marcos Alonso, so Pedro will play 
as the left wing-back.
 
62 min Moses is a little fortunate not to be booked for a lunge at Alli.
 
59 min Eriksen’s cross deflects towards Kane, eight yards out, and Courtois 
gets there just before him to palm the ball away. Dele Alli, as you probably 
know, has now scored six in his last three games.
 
57 min This is a great test for Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>, who will be pretty aggrieved by 
the scoreline. Many players would sulk and/or give up in this situation, but 
you can’t see a Conte team doing that.
 
55 min If you’re not truly, madly, deeply in love with Dele Alli, you’re 
either aChelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> fan or you’re 
living the wrong life. He makes football fun, just like it used to be. He’ll 
soon be a national treasure.
 
They’ve done it again! Another lovely cross from Eriksen on the right, and a 
fine header from Dele Alli. This was a superb ball, clipped beyond the far 
post, and Alli hung in the air for an age before cushioning a header back 
across Courtois and into the net. Brilliant.

54 min “A note to wantaway MBM blogger Rob Smyth, if you’re still there Rob: 
any Spurs fans who gave up smoking for the New Year may be in for a tough 45 
minutes,” says Justin Kavanagh, who has a friend who supports Spurs and has 
just given up smoking. “Stay resolute! Let’s hope Spurs do too! Rob?”
 
52 min This is the match we expected. It’s lurching from end to end now, with 
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> looking especially 
menacing.
 
50 min “Rob,” says Thaddeus Verhoff. “I thought it an entertaining first 
half--if a tad sloppy. Wanted to shout out to my friend Brian in CA, Carmen in 
NYC (where I am watching live while he wanders about selling beer) and Melissa 
who couldn’t be bothered to show up for the first half. If Melissa did show up 
at the pub we could engage in some good-natured banter, as she somehow roots for
Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> and I for Spurs. Here’s 
to the second half!”

Are you suggesting not all banter is good-natured? Next you’ll be saying 98 
per cent of banter is just bullying by another name!
 
49 min This is a furious start to the second half from Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea>. Moses falls over in the box 
after a challenge from Dembele. Martin Atkinson waves play on. It was probably 
a foul, a shove to the side, but the original contact was outside the box.
 
48 min Hazard misses a great chance! A cross from the right was half cleared 
to Alonso, who headed it back towards goal. It bounced up to Hazard, just 
beyond the far post, and he headed wide from a few yards. He did have Lloris 
and Vertonghen between him and the goal but should still have scored.

47 min Chelsea aren’t going to go quietly. Diego Costa works some space 20 
yards from goal and hits a fierce low shot that is excellently palmed away by 
Lloris. Then Hazard slides a dangerous ball across the face of goal that Rose 
puts behind for a corner.
 
47 min “It’s therefore inevitable that you’ll move to cover the Chinese Super 
League (if your comments are anything to go by),” says Jerome Mallon. “And when 
you do, it will have always been a boyhood dream, am I right?”

Exactly. At university, while everyone else had profound posters of Che 
Guevara and Pamela Anderson on their wall, I preferred an artist’s impression 
of Fan Zhiyi.
 
46 min Pee peep! Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> begin 
the second half. They have only needed to come from behind twice in this run - 
against City and Spurs - but teams managed by Antonio Conte will never shy away 
from adversity.
 
Half-time chit-chat

“Continuing on the Chinese Super League theme,” says Gerrard Catesby, “I pose 
another question: do you think that players are selfish putting their financial 
situation (which in reality isn’t exactly unsustainable in the European 
leagues) above their fame, prestige, and, ultimately, their career, or do you 
think that it is - as mentioned - a slice of their own downfall, initiated by 
their own actions? Thus, it is no longer selfish, but ignorant. Thoughts 
please.”

Well, Gerrard, China are certainly looking to develop their football, looking 
at their signings and their recruitment. If an opportunity came along I am 
contracted to the Guardian but I have to look at my long-term strategy of my 
career. How long can I last as a liveblogger? I have been at the Guardian 13 
years. It’s been a wonderful 13 years. There is no offer on the table but if 
they made an offer it would be under consideration. But at the moment I still 
enjoy working for the Guardian.
 
Well, that changes things. Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> won’t panic - they were behind 
at half-time against Manchester City last month and ended up stuffing them. 
Spurs are a much better side defensively, mind. See you in 10 minutes what 
should/will/may be a belting second half.
 
45+2 min Alli is booked for expressing joy towards other human beings.

This is a fine goal. Walker runs at Alonso and gives the ball back to Eriksen, 
who curls a fine ball towards the far post. Alli gets between two defenders and 
loops a high-class header back across the leaping Courtois and into the net. 
What a joyous footballer he is.Chelsea 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> won’t be happy with the 
defending but Eriksen and Alli, two lovely footballers, played their parts 
immaculately.

45 min “How much,” says Juan Torres, “would it take for you to uproot and move 
to China to cover the Chinese Super League?”

Well, Juan, China are certainly looking to develop their football, looking at 
their signings and their recruitment. If an opportunity came along I am 
contracted to the Guardian but I have to look at my long-term strategy of my 
career. How long can I last as a liveblogger? I have been at the Guardian 13 
years. It’s been a wonderful 13 years. There is no offer on the table but if 
they made an offer it would be under consideration. But at the moment I still 
enjoy working for the Guardian.
 
44 min Steve Waterhouse (2 min) is a clairvoyant. There hasn’t been a single 
shot on target.
 
41 min “Fistbumps are just more hygienic than handshakes,” says Niall Mullen, 
sending a medical graphic as proof 
<http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0196655314006592-gr1.jpg>. My 
whole handshake world has been shattered. Everything I know is wronDON’T EFFING 
SHAKE MY HAND OKAY.
 
40 min Wanyama is booked for a sliding foul on Hazard.
 
38 min Cahill gives the ball to Eriksen, panics, pulls him back and is booked. 
Well played Gary. The resulting free-kick, taken by Dembele on the right, is 
swung beyond the far post. Dier heads it across the six-yard box and Courtois 
dives to his left to push it away. It wasn’t a save as such, as it wasn’t going 
in, but it may have saved a goal nonetheless.

36 min Hazard’s penetrative square pass from the left finds Costa in space 
just outside the box. He moves the ball into the D and then belts it into Row Q.
 
35 min This game is still waiting for an innocuous incident and/or a goal to 
spark it into life.Chelsea <https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea> will 
be the happier team, just about.
