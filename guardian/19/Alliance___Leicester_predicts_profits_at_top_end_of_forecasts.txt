Alliance & Leicester today predicted profits this year will hit the top end of 
City forecasts as revenue growth outstripped previous years.

Britain's seventh biggest listed bank said revenues for the first nine months 
of the year were around 3.5% higher than a year earlier, excluding exceptionals.

Analysts' forecasts for core operating profits for 2006 range from £553m to 
£582m, compared with the £548m made last year.

The bank reiterated its costs are under control even though they are likely to 
be "slightly higher" than last year's £692m.

It incurred one-off redundancy costs of £10m in the second half, following 
£14m in the first half. The bank laid off 350 people when its updated its back 
office processes.

A&L stressed that the quality of its lending remains strong.

It has delivered on its earlier reassurances that the recent surge in bad 
debts is past its peak.

It stressed today that, thanks to tighter lending criteria, bad debt charges 
at its retail bank in the second half will be no higher than in the first six 
months, when the charge surged 56% to £48m.
