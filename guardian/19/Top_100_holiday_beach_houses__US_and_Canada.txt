Moonshadow Carova Beach, North Carolina

 Good for total isolation
Sleeps 6
 Cost from $2,100 a week

North Carolina's Outer Banks are a 200-mile string of barrier islands with 
vast, duney beaches and a population of native wild mustang horses that trot up 
and down the coast. But, for all the islands' serene scenery, places to stay 
are few and cluster around the southern part of the islands on the Cape 
Hatteras National Seashore. For more seclusion, you have to head around 100 
miles north to Carova Beach, near the Virginia border. This house has a 
far-from-the-world feel – since there are no paved roads, you can only get 
there by driving a 4x4 along the beach. But once that's done, it's all quiet 
calm. The modular three-bedroom property has a retro 60s-style loft layout and 
three decks from which to watch the sun rise over the ocean. This really is one 
for people who want to be isolated as it's about an hour's drive to any 
semblance of a shop or restaurant.

romantic weekend at this bayside cottage. There's one cosy bedroom, indoor and 
outdoor kitchens and a long lawn that leads to a palmy beach shared with two

Folly Beach House, Folly Beach, South Carolina
 Folly Beach House, South Carolina 
Good for hearty families and groups of friends Sleeps 10
Cost from $2,195 a week

It may only be a 20-minute drive from Charleston, but Folly Beach's surf 
stores and pizza joints make it feel much further from the famously precious 
city. This stilted home's bright decor and bargain price attracts crews of 
surfers and swimmers. It's spacious and modern, with two porches for taking in 
the Atlantic views. While the screened-in lower deck is a godsend on mosquito-y 
summer evenings, the half-covered upper deck is a good sunbathing spot.

Kona Moana Hale, Big Island, Hawaii

Good for surfing couples
Sleeps 2
 Cost from $2,023 a week

In the cute historic town of Kailua Kona on the Big Island's west coast, this 
one-bedroom cottage sits on a narrow rocky shore. The beach is so narrow, in 
fact, that the views are almost like those from a boat. In January to early 
March, you can watch whales breaching from the master bedroom. It takes surfers 
just a few minutes to paddle from the back door to the break, and snorkellers 
can discover the tropical fish and sea turtles that live in the shallow end. 
This 50s cottage was recently redone, with shiny steel appliances, granite 
worktops and burnished hardwood floors, but it retains a hint of old Hawaii in 
gauzy curtains and teak and wicker furniture.

peninsula.

Waterfront house, Fort Pond Montauk, New York state


Good for hippies with style
Sleeps 6 
Cost from $3,150 a week

Montauk's 80s-style motels may be succumbing to a slew of hipster-friendly 
resorts, but there's still at least one interesting place to stay in Long 
Island's coolest beach town – this three-bedroom house with its retro touches, 
open-shelved kitchen and tribal-style prints on the walls. The back garden has 
a firepit and access to Ford Pond (strictly, this is a lake beach house), ideal 
for stand-up paddleboarding. You might even make it to Surf Lodge or Montauk 
Manor, one of the two hotels across the lake.

House on the water, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts


Good for extended families
Sleeps 10

Make like the Kennedys at this old-school New England home on the shores of 
saltwater Lake Tashmoo: think bunting, quilts, white wicker rocking chairs and 
a big American flag on a pole on the beach. With its small waves and plentiful 
seashells, the home's private beach is ideal for children.

Sandspit, Prince Edward Island, Canada

Good for family parties
Sleeps 8 (12 with two sofabeds)
Cost from £1,120 a week

Some of Canada's best beaches are on Prince Edward Island, off Nova Scotia, 
where the weather's warmer than you'd expect for such a northerly location. 
This house comes with a lobster cooker and a double kayak, which tells you 
something about the area's attractions – flat expanses of water, excellent 
seafood and clam-digging practically from the front porch. It looks expensive 
at first glance, but for 12 of your nearest and dearest it works out at quite a 
steal.
