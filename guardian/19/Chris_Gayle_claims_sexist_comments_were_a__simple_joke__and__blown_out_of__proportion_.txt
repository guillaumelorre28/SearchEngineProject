Speaking at Melbourne airport, Gayle said his comments, in which he asked 
McLaughlin for a drink and said “don’t blush, baby”, were a “simple joke” and 
were “not meant to be disrespectful”.

Gayle has been fined $10,000 for the incident and his club, the Melbourne 
Renegades, hasformally apologised to McLaughlin

Gayle says the comments were a joke that had been “blown out of proportion 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/jan/05/chris-gayle-sexist-comments-blown-out-of-proportion-video>
” 
Told that McLaughlin was upset about the incident, Gayle said at the airport: 
“There wasn’t anything meant to be disrespectful or offensive to Mel. If she 
felt that way, I’m really sorry for that. There wasn’t any harm meant in that 
particular way, to harm any particular person in any particular way like that. 
It was a simple joke. The game was going on. Entertainment, things get out of 
proportion but these things happen. It wasn’t any harm done and like I said, I 
will leave it at that. I’m sorry for that. We have to move on, simple.”

He said he had not spoken to McLaughlin.

“I tried to reach out to her last night but it didn’t happen,” Gayle said. 

Asked whether McLaughlin should have been made to feel uncomfortable in her 
workplace, Gayle said: “Did she tell you she was uncomfortable?” before 
terminating the media conference.

Gayle, whose Renegades team had been playing the Hobart Hurricanes in 
Tasmania, initially appeared reluctant to address the media, walking past the 
waiting press pack to take selfies with a few fans and then stand by the 
baggage carousel. Shadowed by the Renegades media manager, he then wandered to 
a shop to get a bottle of water, turning to ask the pack of cameramen, “has 
anyone got $3?”

At one point his West Indies teammate Dwayne Bravo, who has also joined the 
Renegades for the Big Bash League, began singing Justin Bieber’s song Sorry. 
When one journalist suggested it was an inappropriate choice, Bravo said it was 
their favourite song.

Gayle returned to address the media, towing his bag, after a stern 
conversation with Renegades chief executive Stuart Coventry. Asked if he had to 
convince Gayle to make a statement, Coventry said, “I think it’s such a big 
press corps here this morning that he was a little bit overwhelmed by it all.”

“I was with a few of the West Indian boys a last night and they were quite 
disappointed that, I suppose, his comments went this far, but I can also 
understand what Mel’s feeling today.”

‘Let’s move on’: Mel McLaughlin reacts to Chris Gayle comments 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/jan/05/lets-move-on-mel-mclaughlin-reacts-to-chris-gayle-comments-video>
He was also trying to organise for Gayle and McLaughlin to “get together in 
the next 24 hours” so the former could apologise face-to-face, he said.

In a statement later in the day the Renegades said Gayle’s remarks were 
“completely inappropriate and disrespectful”. It said Gayle had “acknowledged 
that his comments were out of line”.

Chris Gayle tells reporter: ‘Your eyes are beautiful, hopefully we can have a 
drink’

Coventry said at the airport: “On behalf of the franchise I want to apologise 
to Mel, I hope that she didn’t feel uncomfortable in her professional 
environment. She’s a wonderful sports reporter and doesn’t deserve that at the 
time.”

Asked if the incident highlighted the need for better education of cricketers, 
Coventry said, “we do everything we possibly can to educate cricketers”.

“BBL players come in for a six-week period and during that six-week period 
they are under a lot of stress and strain, so on a super positive to both 
Dwayne and Chris they have been fantastic in the group, I can’t complain about 
anything at all, it doesn’t matter if it’s children, families, kids, females, 
girls, housewives, husbands, they’re more than happy to help and sign 
autographs,” he said. “Even after the episode last night Chris had his bat 
almost go around half the venue for kids to hold it and get it signed and feel 
like they’re part of our franchise, so all in all I think last night at the 
cricket was a positive experience and I think there were a few learnings out of 
it as well.”

Cricket Australia chief executive officer James Sutherland was more firm, 
telling reporters in Sydney 
<http://www.cricket.com.au/news/chris-gayle-mel-mclaughlin-apology-david-barham-channel-10-bbl-renegades-press-conference-video/2016-01-05>
 that Gayle’s comments “border on harassment”.

“It’s not a nightclub, and I think one of the things that perhaps hasn’t 
dawned on everyone is it’s actually a workplace,” Sutherland said. “Anyone that 
sees the humour in that is misunderstanding and somewhat delusional about the 
situation.”

Channel Ten’s head of sport, David Barham, told 3AW on Tuesday morning that 
McLaughlin was angry and upset over the incident, but said she handled it 
“brilliantly”.

“She was angry and she was upset,” he said. “She was doing her best to get an 
insightful interview about the cricket, that’s what her job is.

“She was asking him legitimate questions about cricket and he turned it into 
talking about her eyes. She was a bit taken aback, embarrassed. I thought it 
was a bit demeaning.

Ian Chappell said Gayle should be suspended for his “arrogant” apology 
<http://www.3aw.com.au/news/ian-chappell-says-chris-gayle-must-be-suspended-after-arrogant-apology-20160105-glzggn.html>
.

“I think the arrogant approach at the end to that last question ... if he’s 
not suspended then I don’t think they’re serious about it,” Chappell said.

Chappell expressed doubt about Gayle’s sincerity even before the press 
conference began, after the batsman retweeted this comment of support from TV 
presenter Piers Morgan.
Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) 
I'm absolutely outraged that everyone's so absolutely outraged by @henrygayle

“This retweet I’m looking at right now from Chris Gayle 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-gayle> tells me any apology will be a 
bit hollow,” Chappell said.

It’s not the first time either McLaughlin or Gayle has been involved in an 
inappropriate pitchside interview.

In 2014, Gayle responded to a female reporter’s question about pitch conditions
 
<http://antiguaobserver.com/chris-gayle-blasted-for-making-sexist-comments-to-female-reporter/>
 by saying, “Well I haven’t touched yours yet, so I don’t know how it feels.”

The same year, Gayle’s teammate, Bravo, delivered a message via a Channel 9 
commentator to McLaughlin, who was in a studio alongside co-anchors Ricky 
Ponting and Damian Fleming, saying: “I just want to say hello to Mel, beautiful 
Mel, I was lucky enough to meet her once inSydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney>. I just want to say hi and 
I see she’s still looking beautiful”.

A Channel Nine report of the incident 
<http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/2016/01/05/09/42/gayle-not-only-west-indian-smitten-with-mclaughlin>
 said McLaughlin “appeared visibly embarrassed”. Ponting said, “that was 
slightly uncomfortable”.

In 2012, the veteran sports broadcaster was kissed on the cheek by Tim Cahill 
<https://youtu.be/zxJWa0CoEBQ> before a post game interview. The Socceroos star 
tweeted support of Gayle last night.

Fox Sports reporter Neroli Meadows said Gayle was a “repeat offender” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/05/fox-sports-journalist-neroli-meadows-unloads-chris-gayle>
 who was well known for making inappropriate remarks to female journalists, 
herself included.

“He’s a repeat offender and he does it purely to humiliate that person in that 
public arena,” Meadows told Macquarie radio on Tuesday.

“He does it constantly and he has done it over a number of years. You can say 
that Chris Gayle is never going to change – that’s fine, and he probably won’t. 
But what should change is the reaction to what Chris Gayle does. It’s not 
funny. It’s just not.”

Labor finance spokeswoman Penny Wong also weighed in, telling ABC radio in 
Adelaide that, “in a professional context women are entitled to be treated 
professionally and it’s not being precious to say that”.
