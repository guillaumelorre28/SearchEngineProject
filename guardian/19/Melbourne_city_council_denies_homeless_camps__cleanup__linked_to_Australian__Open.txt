Melbourne’s city council says a “cleanup” of homeless camps in the central 
business district was not linked to the Australian Open, saying the attempted 
removal of two significant camps this week was a routine operation.

Council workers accompanied by police officers asked about a dozen people 
camped outside Flinders Street Station on Wednesday to move on, the ABC 
reported, a day after performing a similar operation underneath Sandridge 
Bridge, which crosses the Yarra river.

Police asked the public to stand back while the cleanup took place. When 
police left, those who lived outside the station moved back.

Until nine years ago, John Kenney would have been among them. The 62-year-old 
lived on the streets ofMelbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> between the ages of 
seven and 52 before becoming eligible for a seniors’ housing block.

He still sleeps rough a few nights every month and regards the city’s homeless 
population as his family. Some things have improved since his earlier days – he 
said people no longer have to break into houses and steal food to survive – but 
he said thelack of housing options

 for people aged 21 to 49 meant many in that age bracket had “given up”.

“You have got the councils on their back trying to get them off the streets 
and there’s no sense of where to put them,” he said. “I think people don’t 
care: they’re right, they’ve got a job, they don’t care. I think a lot of 
people just don’t look.”

Kenney said people living at Flinders Street had learned of the upcoming 
cleanup through the media, and had been under increased pressure to move along. 
He said many, like himself, had found their way on to the street because they 
were fleeing domestic violence and had not been offered appropriate housing 
options.

“They really don’t care where they end up, just so long as they go,” he told 
Guardian Australia.

He said many believed they had been moved along to make the city look tidy for 
international visitors attending the Australian Open, but a spokesperson from 
the City of Melbourne denied any connection: “There is no link between our 
routine and ongoing cleanup operations and any major events occurring in the 
city.”

The spokesperson said council regularly monitored sites known to be used by 
people sleeping rough to ensure the areas “do not become detrimental to public 
amenity or safety”.

“In the last two weeks, we have focused on improving public amenity by 
removing abandoned belongings such doonas, milk crates and rubbish at locations 
such as Sandridge Bridge, Bourke Street and Swanston Street.”

The operation was supported by representatives of the Salvation Army and other 
homeless outreach services but services say there isn’t enough stable, secure, 
long-term accommodation available for all those who were moved on.

The number of people sleeping rough in Melbourne CBD has increased by 74% in 
the past two years, from 142 in 2014 to 247 at last count in 2016. They make up 
about a tiny portion of people experiencing homelessness inVictoria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria>. At the last census, in 
2011, there were 1,091 people sleeping rough throughout the state and 23,000 
experiencing some form of homelessness.

Jenny Smith, chief executive of the Council to Homeless Persons, said 
“stereotypes and misreporting” about homeless people had a negative impact on 
public perception.

She said conversation should shift from cleaning up the streets to addressing 
the systemic issues, such as the long waiting list for public housing.

“Perpetuating false stereotypes about the homeless as drug users, dirty and 
dangerous only further stigmatises an already marginalised group of people,” 
Smith said. “It separates them as somehow different from ‘us’ and suggests that 
they’ve chosen their lot in life and don’t deserve our sympathy or help.”

Wayne Merritt, the senior manager of integrated youth services at Melbourne 
City Mission, said the council usually issued warning notices a few days before 
a cleanup to allow people to get their belongings together.

Along with a general increase in the number of people sleeping rough in the 
city, he said, there was an increase in the number of homeless people who 
camped with “a whole range of items”.

The city had to balance its cleanup efforts against the rights of homeless 
people to keep their belongings together, he said, adding: “It may be just a 
doona or a few bags, but that’s someone’s life.”
