Louie's Afterdeck (& Upper Deck)

A wooden deck with a bar that juts out over the Atlantic, this one is all 
about the beautiful setting. Sunset proper happens on the other side of the 
island but watching the evening fall over the ocean, with the clouds 
illuminated with brilliant oranges and pinks, is just as spectacular. Designed 
as a sort of waiting lounge for upscale restaurant Louie's Backyard, the deck 
works just as well for a peaceful drink or two at dusk, as you listen to the 
waves lap against the beach below. And if you're hungry but don't feel like 
dinner at the restaurant, themore casual Upper Deck 
<http://www.louiesbackyard.com/pages/bar.cfm> located upstairs (among the tops 
of the trees) offers smaller plates and an excellent wine selection.

Orchid Bar
 Orchid Bar 
One of the smaller bars you're likely to come across, this eight-seater craft 
cocktail spot delivers in a big way on quality drinks and a stylish setting. 
Located poolside in the beautifully revamped 1950s-style motel The Orchid Key 
Inn, the Orchid Bar offers fresh and seasonally inspired cocktails with syrups 
and cordials that are made on premises. It's a perfect grown-up spot to observe 
cocktail hour.

The Chart Room
 The Chart Room 
Tucked inside the sprawling luxury resort of The Pier House, the snug Chart 
Room has stood on the same spot since the 1960s – in fact, the hotel was built 
around it as specified in the original contract. A dive hidden in the middle of 
a fancy hotel, this is a funky little wooden cave with photos of famous guests 
pinned to the walls: Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote, Jimmy Buffett – and 
offering free popcorn, hot dogs and peanuts, with the discarded peanut shells 
carpeting the floor.

The Gardens Hotel/d'vine Wine Gallery
 The Gardens Hotel/d'vine Wine Gallery 
A sprawling former private estate has been converted to a 16-room luxury 
hotel, and the main house features the d'vine Wine Bar, with over 35 wines on 
offer, and multiple options of tastings. Enjoying a glass in the secluded 
grounds, surrounded by palm trees, flowering bushes and hanging orchids, is 
idyllic. Jazz combos play on Sunday afternoons when the pool bar is open to 
non-guests. The no-kids policy is just one part of why this is a highly 
civilised spot to get a quiet drink.

Wine Gallery open Wed-Sun 5pm-10pm, Pool Bar open Sun 5pm-8pm

The Porch
 The Porch 
Somewhat improbably located in the middle of the touristy end of Duval Street, 
where the bars are loud and geared to frat boys and cruise-ship passengers, The 
Porch is tucked away from the main drag and partially obscured by a large 
garden. The clientele are cool, friendly locals who are there to relax, so you 
could find yourself sitting next to an architect, a stand-up paddle board 
instructor or a bartender (this is a big off-duty bartender hangout). With an 
impressive rotating selection of craft beers and wines, The Porch is a chill 
haven at this end of town.

Bagatelle

Downstairs at this restaurant/bar is a solid fine-dining restaurant, but it's 
when you pass through the lounge and ascend a hard-to-find (just ask) staircase 
that you find a hidden gem: an outdoor deck, nestled atop a lush canopy of palm 
trees. The martini bar within the restaurant is front loaded with stirred 
cocktails such as The Mexican (Don Julio Silver, fresh lime and agave – perfect 
on a balmy night) and the astro-tastic Buzz Aldrin (a vodka and Tang martini). 
This is a late-night, service-industry party spot, with DJs on deck at the 
weekends.

Open daily 9am-midnight

Don's Place
 Don's Place 
This down-and-dirty bar caters to both serious late-night drinkers as well as 
early risers: Don's Place only closes briefly between 4am and 7am (opening at a 
restrained noon on Sundays). Situated a few blocks off the main strip, it's all 
about beer and shots here. There's always a game of pool to be had, and there's 
a dilapidated outdoor "tiki bar", as well as a convenient drive-through liquor 
store in the same building – Don's really has all your partying needs covered. 
It's far from fancy but, of course, its very lack of pretension is its 
principal charm.

Hogfish Bar and Grill

Stock Island is the considerably more ramshackle neighbouring key just north 
of Key West and it's there, among trailer parks and dusty boatyards, that 
you'll find this waterfront seafood shack. Overlooking the fishing docks of 
Safe Harbour, the open bar and grill serves fresh seafood – you can literally 
watch the boats carrying your meal to the dock across the way. Beers served in 
metal pails filled with ice are the drink of choice here, and peeled pink 
shrimp caught that morning and Baja fish tacos are the standout dishes. Great 
for a lazy afternoon of drinking and snacking.

Point 5 Lounge

Situated on the second floor of a Victorian house (atop the restaurant 915), 
the vibe at this lounge is decidedly mid-Atlantic cool crossed with 
sub-tropical island laidback vibes, and the soundtrack is chill-out mixes 
peppered with groovy DJs on weekend nights. The proprietor is a former 
club-owning Brit and this is one of the more urbane, even trendy, spots on the 
island. The menu consists of savoury nibbles – the Vietnamese chicken rolls are 
excellent but there are also several good vegetarian options, as well as a 
smart assortment of thin, brick-oven pizzas. A Eurocentric beer and wine list 
is nicely complemented by a strong cocktail list: the gin and tonic with 
house-made tonic is a standout.

2 Cents
 2 Cents Bar 
The casual atmosphere at this outdoor restaurant/bar belies the seriousness of 
the cuisine and the cocktails. Chef Chris Otten cut his culinary teeth in 
Portland, Oregon, and brings that local and seasonal aesthetic to Floridian 
ingredients, with his own eclectic sensibility and light touch. With an 
exemplary gin selection, a large collection of bitters and an array of 
champagne cocktails, this is one of the best places for a proper cocktail in 
Key West. Sunday evenings are taco nights, with a buzzy atmosphere fuelled in 
part by verdita shots – a tequila shot with añejo, chased by an invigorating 
blend of mint, coriander, jalapeno and pineapple.
