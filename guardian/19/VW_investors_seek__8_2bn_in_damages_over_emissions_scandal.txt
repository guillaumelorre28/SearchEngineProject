Volkswagen faces €8.2bn (7bn) of damages claims from investors over its 
emissions scandal in the legal district where the carmaker is based.


 About 1,400 lawsuits have been lodged at the regional court in Braunschweig 
near VW’s Wolfsburg headquarters, the court said. It added that it received 
about 750 lawsuits on Monday alone, the first business day after the 
anniversary of VW’s diesel emissions test-rigging scandal.

 The court brought in extra staff to process suits submitted by shareholders 
concerned that 18 September –the date VW’s manipulations were disclosed a year 
ago

 – could be the deadline to file.

 Plaintiffs say the German carmaker did not inform shareholders quickly enough 
over its cheating software, which was installed in up to 11m vehicles wordwide.

 VW, which faces lawsuits and investigations around the world, insists it did 
not break capital markets regulations in the disclosure of its cheating.

 The biggest claim at the Braunschweig court, totalling €3.3bn, was filed by 
lawyer Andreas Tulip on behalf of institutional investors about six months ago.

 The court detailed additional complaints on Wednesday, including a filing by 
institutional investors for €30m in damages, two investor groups demanding 
€1.5bn and €550m respectively and an investment company that sued the carmaker 
for €45m.

 It would take about four weeks to fully process the additional claims, the 
court said. Complaints have also been filed by German state pension funds.

 VW has set aside about $18bn (£14bn) to cover the cost of vehicle refits and 
a settlement with US authorities, but analysts predict the bill could rise much 
further as a result of lawsuits and regulatory penalties.
