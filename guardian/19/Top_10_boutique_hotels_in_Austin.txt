Hotel Saint Cecilia

Appropriately named for the patron saint of music and poetry, the Hotel Saint 
Cecilia is an inspiring oasis in the middle of downtown Austin. Set on a 
secluded compound blocks from theSouth Congress shopping district 
<http://www.videocityguide.com/austin/listings/south-congress-avenue-shopping>, 
the hotel's suites, studios, and bungalows blend rustic accents with colourful, 
pop culture-inspired modern flair; think black and white tiled floors, chrome 
and neon lighting, and retro rock'n'roll memorabilia. If you're up for 
exploring, they have a fleet of bikes guests may borrow, or if you feel like 
staying in, browse the Saint Cecilia Library's carefully curated shelves of 
books, films, and records – rooms come equipped with soundsystems (and goodie 
baskets stocked with local snacks).

The Driskill
 The Driskill hotel, Austin, Texas 
One of Austin's oldest historic landmarks, The Driskill is known for its 
opulent marble lobby and leathered lounge – and the ghostly guests that are 
rumoured to haunt its halls. The romantically lit bar, with signature and 
seasonal craft cocktails and snacks, is the epitome of old-world style, lined 
with stately portraits (try a "Batini", a vodka concoction made with hibiscus, 
named the official cocktail of Austin in 2010). Rooms range in size from 
converted former staff quarters to skyline-view suites; or, if you're feeling 
fancy, there's the famed LBJ Presidential Suite, designed for dignitaries but 
often occupied by A-listers. The hotel's 6th Street-facing patios are perfect 
for people-watching and, when the sun goes down, you're literally steps from 
the city's famed entertainment strip.

Kimber Modern
 Kimber Modern hotel, Austin, Texas 
The Kimber Modern's sleek, spare design makes it feel more like a dream home

automated arrivals and departures, and there are several rooms to choose from, 
including the Red Suite and the White Suite (which has a tub big enough for two 
and a private balcony). While it's centrally located for South Austin 
adventures (and conveniently close to 24-hour dinerMagnolia Cafe 
<http://themagnoliacafe.com/>), the Kimber Modern's daily happy hours, 
luxurious common areas, and oak-shaded outdoor loungers make staying in
