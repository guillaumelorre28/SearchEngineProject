The Douglas Fir or Scots pine may be gone from the front room, but these trees 
grow across Britain and offer a wonderful ingredient for a seasonal martini. 
Take a few sprigs from a wild specimen, rinse in water, then add to a bottle of 
gin. Infuse for a few days, then strain. Serves one.

35ml pine-infused gin (go for a properly aromatic one, such as Hepple 
<http://www.hepple-gin.com>)
15ml dry vermouth (Noilly Prat <http://www.noillyprat.com> or Regal Rogue 
Daring Dry <http://www.regalrogue.com/regalrogue_daringdry.html#>, for 
preference)
1 thumb-sized piece orange rind

Stir the gin and vermouth over ice, then strain into a chilled martini glass. 
Squeeze the orange peel over a lit match on to the drink: the aromatic oils 
will ignite and settle on the surface. Drink to 2017.
