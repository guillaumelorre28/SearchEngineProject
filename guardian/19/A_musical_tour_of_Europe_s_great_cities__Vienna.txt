I lazily plumped for Vienna as the latest stopping-off point on our tour of 
musical cities, thinking the sheer multiplicity of classical composers who have 
lived and worked there would make it easy. In fact, of course, it makes 
choosing which music to focus on very difficult. As the centre of Europe’s 
musical life for more two centuries, thanks to its status of capital of the 
Habsburg empire, many of the greats – notably Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven – 
gravitated to Vienna, and Schubert was born in the city.

The trusty @abkquan <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13885567> 
suggests choosing “pieces that describe the city and evoke its atmosphere 
rather than great pieces written by Viennese composers”. He offers the 
nature-lovingBeethoven’s Pastoral Symphony <https://youtu.be/LHmWoAj4al0>, a 
work we take for granted but which, if you listen to it afresh, is little short 
of miraculous.

The Vienna Philharmonic play Beethoven’s Symphony No 6, Pastoral 
<https://youtu.be/LHmWoAj4al0> 
@abkquan is taken with the Viennese pastoral theme – the city does have it 
bucolic side – and also suggestsJohann Strauss II’s Tales from the Vienna Woods 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og3joyCntrI> and, inevitably, the Blue Danube 
<https://youtu.be/woWJqKznCSc>, available in all manner of versions by everyone 
from the Vienna Philharmonic toAndré Rieu 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/20/andre-rieu-violin-superstar-king-of-waltz-interview>
. The latter has no fewer than 16m hits on YouTube for his version. The Vienna 
Phil tend to get rather less.

Strauss’s Blue Danube Waltz <https://youtu.be/woWJqKznCSc> 
We must have Johann Sr’s Radetzky March, written in 1848 when the Habsburgs 
were still managing to win battles. I was very pleased to stumble ona clip of 
the elderly Herbert von Karajan conducting the Vienna Phil 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHFf7NIwOHQ> at the New Year’s Day concert in 
1987, Karajan smiling in a somewhat forced way and the audience largely 
terrified to clap along as they like to do with this traditional encore.

This entire column could be filled with the Strauss family. @abkquan draws our 
attention to Johann I’s second son, Josef, who died in his early 40s and was 
eclipsed by the success of his elder brother Johann. But the engaging
Dorfschwalben aus Österreich (Village Swallows from Austria) 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbiVwHO_0P4> demonstrates that he had the 
family’s facility with dance music.

Ravel’s La Valse <https://youtu.be/TMSgWhIENSk> 
But perhaps that is enough of the Strausses. Several commenters, including @
thesecretorganist <https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15303784>, suggest 
Ravel’sLa Valse <https://youtu.be/TMSgWhIENSk> as an antidote to the 
chocolate-box view of Vienna. La Valse began life as a piece called Vienne, 
which Ravel saw as a tribute to the age of the waltz. After the first world 
war, he reworked it as a ballet for Diaghilev. The latter rejected it, leading 
to a rupture between the two, but it was quickly accepted in the concert hall.

Critics have always seen the work as a commentary on the disintegration of the 
Hapsburg empire after the war, but Ravel flatly denied that interpretation. “It 
doesn’t have anything to do with the present situation in Vienna, and it also 
doesn’t have any symbolic meaning in that regard,” he said in 1922. “In the 
course of La Valse, I did not envision a dance of death or a struggle between 
life and death.” It may, however, be one of those instances where the artist’s 
intention and the reality of the piece he writes diverge. Somehow, as the piece 
whirls to its climax, the listener can hear both the apotheosis of the waltz 
and its destruction.

 Franz Schubert, who led ‘the most agonisingly tragic life of any of the 
so-called great composers’ Photograph: Rischgitz/Getty Images 
We are on safer ground with Schubert, the Viennese composer par excellence. 
@thesecretorganist sums up his genius far better than I could: “He led perhaps 
the most agonisingly tragic life of any of the so-called great composers. Dead 
at just 31; seriously ill with what’s believed to be syphilis throughout most 
of his 20s; hopelessly in love with women who just weren’t interested; almost 
none of his works published during his life – and yet he just kept on writing! 
When I listen to the music Schubert wrote in the last year of his life, I 
think: ‘What on earth would that man have produced if he had lived another five 
or 10 years, let alone another 50?’”

Listen to Maurizio Pollini play Schubert piano sonatas 
<https://youtu.be/IUvObtbGxfs> 
I also concur with @thesecretorganist’s choices of Schubert’s most enduring 
pieces.Winterreise <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_X6WBVR1mU>, the Ninth 
Symphony <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNocKxKd8-I> and the last three piano 
sonatas <https://youtu.be/IUvObtbGxfs> are imperishable works that capture 
longing, joy, suffering and ultimately a fulfilled resignation. Schubert is 
buried beside his hero Beethoven in Vienna’s main cemetery, the 
Zentralfriedhof. In 2005,while on a mad mission to hear every note Beethoven 
composed <https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/may/27/classicalmusicandopera1>
, I lay beside their graves listening to the Missa Solemnis on headphones. I 
now wish I’d listened to Schubert’sB flat major Piano Sonata 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok9tofNmqNY> instead – a message from the dead 
to the living if ever there was one.

Schubert’s Mass No 6 <https://youtu.be/I4r7vjI1s-o> 
@thesecretorganist also suggests a less familiar Schubert work – the Mass No 6 
in E flat major: “It is a work which hardly ever gets performed, despite the 
fact it is undoubtedly one of the greatest mass settings of its time, looking 
forward to Bruckner and beyond.”

As well as the great lineage of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms, 
composers grouped together in the so-called first Viennese school, there is 
also the more formalised second Viennese school – composers such asAlban Berg 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/01/opera-lulu-alban-berg> and Anton 
Webern 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/apr/23/buildingaclassicalmusiclib1>
 who took their lead from Arnold Schoenberg and sought to extend the German 
romantic tradition or, once Schoenberg had embraced serialism and atonality, 
develop an entirely new approach to composition.

Schoenberg’s Verklärte Nacht <https://youtu.be/U-pVz2LTakM> 
The early string sextet Verklärte Nacht <https://youtu.be/U-pVz2LTakM> 
(Transfigured Night), written in 1899, demonstrates the more conventional early 
Schoenberg – a masterly setting of a poem by the German writer Richard Dehmel. 
A decade later, with Erwartung and Pierrot Lunaire, he had revolutionised 
music. Just as the empire of which Vienna was the centre was crumbling, so the 
musical tradition that it had fostered was also being subverted.

More than a century after its Straussian heyday, Vienna remains a musically 
rich city, and the public image associated with the Vienna Phil and the New 
Year’s Day concert belies the radicalism of its musical life. There is even a 
third Viennese school, now centred on theKlangforum Wien 
<http://www.klangforum.at/>, a chamber orchestra that specialises in 
contemporary music.

One of its leading figures is composer Kurt Schwertsik 
<http://www.boosey.com/podcast/Schwertsik-on-Schwertsik/100074>, who after 
early immersion in the modernist world ofDarmstadt 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmstadt_School> broke away from what he saw as 
its rigidities to write tonal music. He says his fellow modernists saw him as a 
“freak” for doing so in the 1960s, but musical history has proved what might be 
called his postmodern compositional style to have been farsighted. Where the 
fourth Viennese school will take us is anyone’s guess.

Anton Karas’s music from The Third Man <https://youtu.be/2oEsWi88Qv0> 
What we can say for sure is that the next stop on our journey will be Amsterdam
, and after that we will end inBerlin. All thoughts on music and musicians 
associated with these cities will be gratefully received. And in case you 
thought I’d forgotten: it would not be possible to survey the music of Vienna 
without mentioningAnton Karas’s score for the 1948 film The Third Man 
<https://youtu.be/2oEsWi88Qv0>. Never has a zither been used to greater effect.
