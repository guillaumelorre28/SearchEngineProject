JDL from Cold Crush Brothers: New York
The Paradise Theater (2413 Grand Concourse, +1 718 220 1015, 
paradisetheaterevents.com <http://www.paradisetheaterevents.com/>) opened in 
1929 and, back in the day, people went there to watch movies. It closed in 
1994, but was reopened a few years ago by Cathy Moriarty-Gentile – who is from 
the Bronx and played Vikki LaMotta opposite Robert De Niro in Raging Bull – and 
her husband Joseph Gentile, as a great music venue. You get some good old 
school hip-hop acts playing there.

There aren't any good record shops left in the Bronx now, but SOS DJ (1154 
Castle Hill Ave,sosdjshop.com <http://www.sosdjshop.com/>) is a great DJ shop, 
the best joint to go to for turntables, mixers, amps, you name it.

If you're after vinyl, I would probably send you down to Rock and Soul (462 
7th Avenue, +1 212 695 3953,rockandsoul.com <http://www.rockandsoul.com/>), 
which has a lot of old hip-hop and re-pressings, as well as DJ equipment.

If you're after some real good soul food, I would definitely recommend Jacob's 
Restaurant(373 Malcom X Boulevard, +1 212 866 3663, jacobrestaurant.com 
<http://www.jacobrestaurant.com/>) in Harlem. I'll tell you now, that joint is 
better thanSylvia's (sylviassoulfood.com <http://www.sylviassoulfood.com/>), 
which is better known and only two blocks down (on Lenox Avenue). Sylvia's is 
good, but you got to check Jacob's.

You should also check out Doug E's Chicken and Waffles (2245 Adam Clayton 
Powell Jr Blvd, +1 212 368 4371), from hip-hop pioneer Doug E Fresh. They do 
amazing cookies-and-cream waffles and peach cobbler waffles. Doug E, the man 
they call "the original human beatbox" only lives one block over, in an old 
Brownstone, so he'll be there a couple of nights a week.

Down in Brooklyn, Buffalo Boss (554 Fulton Street, +1 718 624 2677, 
buffaloboss.com <http://www.buffaloboss.com/>) is quite a new joint, opened 
late last year, and owned by Jay-Z's cousin Jamar White, and Jay has put some 
money behind it. They got good sweet potato fries and great chicken wings with 
a hot sauce they call Fire In The Hole.

DJ Yoda: New York, Rio, Shenzhen
New York City is really the mecca for any fan of hip-hop. It's true – most of 
the classic record stores have now closed down, and the city's club scene ain't 
what it used to be. But you can take theRoots of Hip-Hop tour in Harlem and the 
Bronx (+1 212 209 3370,hushtours.com <http://hushtours.com/>), and see 1520 
Sedgwick Avenue, the birthplace of hip-hop, where the likes of Kool Herc and 
Grandmaster Flash first scratched a record. The tour is led by old-school 
rappers too, so it's nice to know old rappers don't die, they just become tour 
guides.

A lot of places like Harlem and Brooklyn that birthed hip-hop have slowly 
become gentrified throughout the years. So it's appropriate that a new, 
bastardised style of hip-hop, known as "baile funk", is being born out of the 
favelas of Rio de Janeiro. The music is uptempo and raw, and has gained a 
respectable international fanbase. I've DJ'd in Rio alongside one of the 
biggest baile funk DJs,Sany Pitbull <http://www.myspace.com/sanypitbull>, and 
seeing him playing this music to thousands of adoring fans was unforgettable.

A less likely place is Shenzhen, in China. I went to DJ there without knowing 
anything about it. When I got to the city I was surprised to discover that it 
has a bigger population than London. Everything is new, everyone is young, and 
they are just discovering western-style hip-hop and clubbing. There is more 
bling and more flashy cars than P Diddy would ever require, so in many ways 
it's more hip-hop than most other places I've been. The club I went to was 
calledBabyface (Jiangbei Road, babyface.com.cn 
<http://www.babyface.com.cn/index.php?controller=index&action=index>), and is a 
crazy, multi-roomed mega-club with karaoke in one room, a whisky bar in another 
and then the guest DJ in a big room.

Annie Nightingale, DJ: Eastern Europe
Eastern Europe is the most exciting place I've been recently for an 
adventurous break, with dance music. TheSziget festival in Hungary (8-15 August,
sziget.hu/festival_english <http://www.sziget.hu/festival_english>) is 
brilliant and magical. Near Budapest, it's the size of Reading festival, with a 
Glastonbury vibe.

My most bizarre clubbing experience in Eastern Europe was in Romania, in a 
resort on the Black Sea calledMamaia (mamaia.com 
<http://mamaia.com/about/eng.asp>), that was built for workers in Ceausescu's 
time. It was in a hotel and was like something out of Scarface – very 
heavy-looking characters who had bodyguards and were surrounded by scantily 
dressed women. These rich guys arrived around 9pm and sat there with a big 
bottle of vodka, listening to the most awful Eurotrash music. But then at 
2-3pm, all the young promoters took over, all the cool young people suddenly 
came flooding in, and they took over the night, playing very now music. It was 
all done on a shoestring and basically funded by the rich guys – a clever use 
of the economic system.

Andy Butler from Hercules and Love Affair: New York
Disco freaks have to visit New York. Neil Aline's Nouveaux New York party 
which happens at Le Bain at the Standard Hotel (848 Washington at 13th Street, 
+1 212 645 4646,standardhotels.com/new-york-city 
<http://www.standardhotels.com/new-york-city/>) in the Meatpacking District is 
fun. This part of New York has become a little overrun with people trying to 
get the Sex and the City experience, but here the crowd is cute, the sound 
system great and the DJ line-up solid.The SubMercer (147 1/2 Mercer St, +1 212 
966 6060) is a club underneath the Mercer Hotel in SoHo, which boasts a great 
mix of DJs. One night they might have a disco legend, the next a quality 
hip-hop DJ.

Barcelona's best export, Sylvia Prada, has been having parties over in NYC 
recently. Whether she is hosting a party for fashion boutique Opening Ceremony (
openingceremony.us <http://www.openingceremony.us/>) or throwing her Club 
Tropicana party atTrophy Bar in Williamsburg (351 Broadway, between 9th and 
Keap St, +1 347 2278515,trophybar.blogspot.com <http://trophybar.blogspot.com/>
), you know the music, on a classic house tip, is gonna be good. Kim Ann Foxman 
from Hercules and Love Affair plays regularly.
• Hercules and Love Affair play Springfestival, Graz, Austria, which takes 
place from 1-5 June (springfestival.at

Steve Angello, Swedish House Mafia: Miami 
South Beach is my favourite area of Miami. We usually stay at the W Hotel 
(2201 Collins Avenue, +1 305 938 3000,starwoodhotels.com 
<http://www.starwoodhotels.com/whotels/property/overview/index.html?language=en_US&propertyID=1599>
) which is where a lot of DJs and the music industry hang out, so if you hang 
around the bar you end up seeing everyone!

The LIV (4441 Collins Ave, +1 305 674 4680, livnightclub.com 
<http://www.livnightclub.com/index.php>) up the road in Fontainebleau, has an 
amazing vibe and a great line of big-name house DJs. Go to theDelano (1685 
Collins Avenue, +305 672 2000,delano-hotel.com 
<http://www.delano-hotel.com/en-us/#/home/>) for poolside dining and cocktails, 
with an underwater soundtrack. While you're in Miami, make sure you stay up to 
see the sun come up … and try a drink called Miami Vice, which is a mix of 
daiquiri and pina colada.

Kissy Sell Out: Toronto
There is a very vibrant electronic music scene in Toronto, with many notable 
artists emerging such as MSTRKRFT and Zeds Dead. The dubstep scene is currently 
setting the city ablaze, but for big room dance music connoisseurs there are 
also huge clubs such asGuvernment Night Club (132 Queens Quay East, +1 416 869 
0045,theguvernment.com <http://www.theguvernment.com/>), which hosts thousands 
of passionate clubbers every night to a world-class sound system with decadent 
interior design.
