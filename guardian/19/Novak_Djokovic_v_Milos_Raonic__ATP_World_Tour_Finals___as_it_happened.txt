Second set tie-break: Djokovic* 5-5 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic comes 
to the net and Raonic thinks he’s got the job done with an excellent backhand 
from left to right. It lands at Djokovic’s feet. He somehow produces a 
miraculous backhand that completely takes Raonic by surprise.

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-6 Raonic (*denotes server): The first two points 
are shared, and Djokovic is in a spot of bother when he double-faults to make 
it 15-30. He gathers his thoughts, though, deals with a pesky Raonic slice and 
draws an errant backhand from the Canadian with a well-placed overhead for 
30-all. Yet he’s in trouble when he pushes a backhand long at the net, handing 
Raonic his first set point! The volume rises. The man in front of me does some 
whistling. Behind Djokovic, an eedjit decides now’s the time to use the flash 
on his phone. The umpire intervenes. Play resumes. Djokovic nets a first serve. 
He makes the second. They rally for a while – and Raonic is fuming with himself 
when he weakly nets a forehand! The game goes to deuce, Djokovic holds with a 
peach of a forehand pass and we’ll have another tie-break.
 Djokovic eyes the ball as he readies himself to hit a forehand return.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 5-6 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic whistles a 
backhand down the line for a 40-15 lead and clenches his fist. He does so again 
when he wraps up the game with an ace. Over to you, Novak.

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 5-5 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic is three 
points away from the second set when Djokovic nets a forehand for 0-15. In 
other news, I can no longer de-bold this text. 2016, eh? Back to the tennis, 
Raonic moves into a 15-30 lead with a clean forehand winner down the line, but 
he nets a backhand return to make it 30-all. Then they treat us to a 
magnificent rally, Raonic withstanding a Djokovic smash, only to dab a backhand 
pass into the net. Djokovic holds.

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 4-4 Raonic (*denotes server): Down 30-0, Raonic 
still isn’t willing to give up, fighting back to 30-all. He’s been spirited in 
this set and he’s giving the crowd value for money. He even earns a break point 
when Djokovic nets a backhand - and that’s the cue for Djokovic to net a 
forehand! They’re on level terms again!

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic batters an ace 
past Djokovic, who amuses himself by heading the bouncing ball to a ball boy. I 
assume Nikola Zigic is his sporting hero. As for the game, it drifts to deuce. 
Raonic’s serve is coming under severe pressure. He manages to shake free, 
though, and holds with his umpteenth ace.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 3-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): Djokovic has had to 
be at the height of his defensive powers at times tonight and his hustling is 
occasionally forcing Raonic to rush and go for too much. He does so on the 
first point, dragging a forehand wide, and Djokovic quickly opens up 0-30 lead. 
Djokovic earns two break points, a low slice at the end of a tense rally 
confounding Raonic, who promptly nets a backhand to drop his serve again.

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 2-2 Raonic (*denotes server): The game goes to 
30-all, Raonic still defiant. He’s played well but hasn’t taken his chances. 
It’s been a lesson in ruthlessness so far. But here’s an opportunity to show 
that he’s learning. Raonic carves out a break point with a splendid backhand 
down the line. Can he finally take one? Yes! Djokovic tries to serve and 
volley, but Raonic beats him with a forehand pass to haul himself back into the 
second set!

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 2-0 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic isn’t done 
quite yet, though. At 30-all, he larrumps a forehand past Djokovic to earn a 
break point. He can’t take, it though, smacking a backhand return wide after a 
good serve from Djokovic, who celebrates with a roar at his box. Djokovic holds 
and consolidates the break.

to get over the disappointment of losing that set. He served so well. He had 
the break points. He had the mini-break. At 30-all, though, he nets a forehand

sends a backhand long. It’s a long way back from here.

Novak Djokovic wins the first set 7-6!

First set tie-break: Djokovic 8-6 Raonic* (*denotes server): A double fault! 
From Raonic! The set belongs to Djokovic! What fight from the world No2! He was 
on the ropes for much of it, but you get the sense he’d really like that No1 
spot back off Andy Murray.

First set: Djokovic 6-6 Raonic* (*denotes server): Needing to hold, Raonic 
charges into a 30-0 lead. But Djokovic produces another outstanding flicked 
backhand scoop from left to right to get himself back in the game and he’s very 
much in it at 30-all. Time for another ace, then. There’s a gasp of 
astonishment from the crowd as Raonic stomps into a 40-30 lead. He holds. 
Tie-break.

First set: Djokovic* 6-5 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic locates the line 
over on the left with a forehand. Or did he? Raonic challenges. Hawkeye is on 
his side and that’s 0-15. Soon it’s 15-30, Djokovic netting a backhand slice. 
Raonic seizes the initiative during the next rally - but he clips a forehand 
wide to make it 30-all. He could have had two break points there. Instead it’s 
not long before he’s down 40-30. Djokovic holds.

First set: Djokovic 5-5 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic has to hold to keep 
the set alive, so he bashes an ace down the middle for 15-0. Then he puts a 
smash away, reading a Djokovic lob well. Another ace makes it 40-15 and Raonic 
holds to 15 without any fuss at all.

First set: Djokovic* 5-4 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic looks comfortable 
at 30-0. Raonic tries to make him uncomfortable. Easier said than done. At 
30-15, Djokovic dinks a backhand from left to right and Raonic can only stoop 
and net a backhand. Djokovic holds. If he can break here, the first set is his.

First set: Djokovic 4-4 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic lopes towards the 
net and immediately realises he’s made a mistake as Djokovic wallops a forehand 
down the line for 0-15. Djokovic is beginning to look ominously on his game and 
when he defends excellently again, moving so well, Raonic scoops a confused 
forehand past the baseline, making it 0-30. But that Raonic serve is such an 
effective weapon. It brings him back to 30-all. There’s still work to be done, 
though. Will Raonic pass this test? You betcha! A forehand winner and an ace 
ways to deal with adversity.

First set: Djokovic* 4-3 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic has been hitting 
some superb forehands. Now he comes up with a delicious backhand, firing one

overpowering Raonic at the net for 30-15. He holds to 15. We’ll have some new

First set: Djokovic 3-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic opens up the court 
with an excellent serve out wide, but he fails to land the second blow, sending 
a forehand wide. Djokovic leads 0-15. Not for long, though. He nets a forehand, 
before Raonic blasts an ace past him for 30-15. The Canadian holds to 15, a 
second ace polishing off the game.

First set: Djokovic* 3-2 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic has had problems 
in his service games. He’ll be desperate for a simple one this time because 
Raonic is not holding back at all. He’s not afraid to whack the fuzz off the 
ball, supreme hitting allowing him to make it 15-all. Djokovic needs some first 
serves. It also helps when Raonic misses a couple of forehands, making it 
40-15. Another poor forehand from Raonic and Djokovic holds. There. Easy.

First set: Djokovic 2-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic blooters a serve 
down the middle. It’s wide, but it almost takes out a line judge, who manages 
to duck just in time. Take it from me, a serve to the head hurts. Still, Raonic 
wins the point anyway, then he gobbles up the next one with a pinpoint forehand 
down the line for 30-0. Another crunching serve makes it 40-0, at which point 
he wobbles a little, double-faulting. But not for long. Another superb serve 
sees him hold to 15.

First set: Djokovic* 2-1 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic pings a forehand 
into the left corner, making Raonic run, but the Canadian digs out a backhand 
and Djokovic nets a volley to make it 0-15. Then Djokovic sends a forehand 
long. 0-30. A cracking second serve makes it 15-30, but Raonic grabs two break 
points with a contemptuous forehand return off another second serve. He nets a 
forehand return off the first, though. The second goes begging as well, a 
forehand flying long. You can’t be wasting those chances against Djokovic, who 
recovers well to hold. Raonic has seen three opportunities to break come and go.

First set: Djokovic* 1-0 Raonic (*denotes server): Resisting the 
understandable temptation to smack a ball in the direction of the press seats,
Novak Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> gets the 
match underway. It begins with a fine rally, one that ends with Raonic sending 
a crisp forehand missile down the line for a 0-15 lead. The next rally’s a long 
one too. Djokovic finds a gap with a backhand, forcing Raonic to net a 
forehand, but the Canadian wins the next point with another excellent forehand 
winner for a 15-30 lead. The game goes to 30-all, but Raonic earns a break 
point when Djokovic knocks a forehand long. Djokovic saves it with an ace out

It’s time for the toss. Up into the air it goes! But it’s a dreadful toss of 
the coin. It lands by the net and on its side and, well, it’s impossible to 
make heads or tails of it. We’ll have to try again. Everything passes off 
smoothly on the second try. Djokovic will serve first. Now for the warm-up. 
Tok! Tok! Tok!

Preamble

Hello. At the risk of incurring the wrath of All of Serbia, Novak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> got angry the other day. He 
smacked a ball in the direction of his box after losing the first set against 
Dominic Thiem and it flew into the crowd. He didn’t take kindly to being asked 
about it in his press conference after recovering to beat Thiem in three sets. 
But it definitely happened! There were cameras there and everything. Djokovic’s 
beef was with the idea that he was playing a dangerous game, that his momentary 
loss of control exposed his troubled mental state and could have resulted in 
serious consequences if the ball had sent a hot dog out of a spectator’s pint 
or, even worse, caused someone to spill their pint.

Secretly, though, Djokovic was probably glad it happened. The fire still burns 
inside him, as Thiem duly discovered, and it was a reminder that no one should 
think for a moment that the Serbian is in the grip of terminal decline despite 
recent tricky times on and off the court. By Djokovic’s standards, this has 
been a troublesome year. But he can still end it as the world No1 by winning 
every match here this week and that would set him up nicely for another strong 
defence of his Australian Open title.

Tonight, however, the challenge is likely to stiffen. Milos Raonic was 
supposedly stricken with a thigh injury when he arrived in London, but the 
Canadian looked sprightly in his victory over Gael Monfils the other night. The 
world No4 has lost all seven of his encounters with Djokovic, so hell need to 
be at his powerful best. But Marin Cilic had lost 14 in a row before beating 
Djokovic in Paris. It can be done. But is the beast stirring again?


Play begins at: 8pm GMT.

Second set tie-break: Djokovic* 5-5 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic comes 
to the net and Raonic thinks he’s got the job done with an excellent backhand 
from left to right. It lands at Djokovic’s feet. He somehow produces a 
miraculous backhand that completely takes Raonic by surprise.

Second set tie-break: Djokovic 2-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): A Raonic serve

Second set tie-break: Djokovic 0-1 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic serves 
well and wins the point with a smash.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 6-6 Raonic (*denotes server): The first two points 
are shared, and Djokovic is in a spot of bother when he double-faults to make 
it 15-30. He gathers his thoughts, though, deals with a pesky Raonic slice and 
draws an errant backhand from the Canadian with a well-placed overhead for 
30-all. Yet he’s in trouble when he pushes a backhand long at the net, handing 
Raonic his first set point! The volume rises. The man in front of me does some 
whistling. Behind Djokovic, an eedjit decides now’s the time to use the flash 
on his phone. The umpire intervenes. Play resumes. Djokovic nets a first serve. 
He makes the second. They rally for a while – and Raonic is fuming with himself 
when he weakly nets a forehand! The game goes to deuce, Djokovic holds with a 
peach of a forehand pass and we’ll have another tie-break.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 5-6 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic whistles a 
backhand down the line for a 40-15 lead and clenches his fist. He does so again 
when he wraps up the game with an ace. Over to you, Novak.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 5-5 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic is three 
points away from the second set when Djokovic nets a forehand for 0-15. In 
other news, I can no longer de-bold this text. 2016, eh? Back to the tennis, 
Raonic moves into a 15-30 lead with a clean forehand winner down the line, but 
he nets a backhand return to make it 30-all. Then they treat us to a 
magnificent rally, Raonic withstanding a Djokovic smash, only to dab a backhand 
pass into the net. Djokovic holds.
 
Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-5 Raonic* (*denotes server): The crowd’s perked up 
and so has Raonic, who crashes an ace away for 15-0. More aces take him to 
40-15. He holds and Djokovic will serve to stay in the second set!

Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 4-4 Raonic (*denotes server): Down 30-0, Raonic 
still isn’t willing to give up, fighting back to 30-all. He’s been spirited in 
this set and he’s giving the crowd value for money. He even earns a break point 
when Djokovic nets a backhand - and that’s the cue for Djokovic to net a 
forehand! They’re on level terms again!

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 4-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic batters an ace 
past Djokovic, who amuses himself by heading the bouncing ball to a ball boy. I 
assume Nikola Zigic is his sporting hero. As for the game, it drifts to deuce. 
Raonic’s serve is coming under severe pressure. He manages to shake free, 
though, and holds with his umpteenth ace.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 4-2 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic cruises into 
a 40-0 lead, three stress-free points setting up a commanding position. He 
holds to love with a backhand winner and inches closer to the semi-finals.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 3-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): Djokovic has had to 
be at the height of his defensive powers at times tonight and his hustling is 
occasionally forcing Raonic to rush and go for too much. He does so on the 
first point, dragging a forehand wide, and Djokovic quickly opens up 0-30 lead. 
Djokovic earns two break points, a low slice at the end of a tense rally 
confounding Raonic, who promptly nets a backhand to drop his serve again.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 2-2 Raonic (*denotes server): The game goes to 
30-all, Raonic still defiant. He’s played well but hasn’t taken his chances. 
It’s been a lesson in ruthlessness so far. But here’s an opportunity to show 
that he’s learning. Raonic carves out a break point with a splendid backhand 
down the line. Can he finally take one? Yes! Djokovic tries to serve and 
volley, but Raonic beats him with a forehand pass to haul himself back into the 
second set!
 
Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 2-1 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic makes sure 
this isn’t going to be a procession for Djokovic, kerblamming an ace away to 
hold.
 
Second set: Djokovic* 7-6, 2-0 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic isn’t done 
quite yet, though. At 30-all, he larrumps a forehand past Djokovic to earn a 
break point. He can’t take, it though, smacking a backhand return wide after a 
good serve from Djokovic, who celebrates with a roar at his box. Djokovic holds 
and consolidates the break.

Second set: Djokovic 7-6, 1-0 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic quickly needs 
to get over the disappointment of losing that set. He served so well. He had 
the break points. He had the mini-break. At 30-all, though, he nets a forehand 
to gift Djokovic a break point. It’s Djokovic’s first of the night. Raonic 
sends a backhand long. It’s a long way back from here.
 
First set tie-break: Djokovic 8-6 Raonic* (*denotes server): A double fault! 
From Raonic! The set belongs to Djokovic! What fight from the world No2! He was 
on the ropes for much of it, but you get the sense he’d really like that No1 
spot back off Andy Murray.

wild forehand wide off a second serve. Oof. Another set point for Djokovic.
 
First set tie-break: Djokovic* 6-6 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic grunts 
and groans around the baseline. It’s Raonic who’s pressing. It’s Raonic who 
wins the point, a piercing forehand forcing Djokovic to hit long! Crikey.

he’s hit a forehand winner. Djokovic lifts his arm. Turns out it was called 
out, so Raonic challenges. And ... it was in!

First set: Djokovic 6-6 Raonic* (*denotes server): Needing to hold, Raonic 
charges into a 30-0 lead. But Djokovic produces another outstanding flicked 
backhand scoop from left to right to get himself back in the game and he’s very 
much in it at 30-all. Time for another ace, then. There’s a gasp of 
astonishment from the crowd as Raonic stomps into a 40-30 lead. He holds. 
Tie-break.
 
First set: Djokovic* 6-5 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic locates the line 
over on the left with a forehand. Or did he? Raonic challenges. Hawkeye is on 
his side and that’s 0-15. Soon it’s 15-30, Djokovic netting a backhand slice. 
Raonic seizes the initiative during the next rally - but he clips a forehand 
wide to make it 30-all. He could have had two break points there. Instead it’s 
not long before he’s down 40-30. Djokovic holds.
 
First set: Djokovic 5-5 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic has to hold to keep 
the set alive, so he bashes an ace down the middle for 15-0. Then he puts a 
smash away, reading a Djokovic lob well. Another ace makes it 40-15 and Raonic 
holds to 15 without any fuss at all.
 
First set: Djokovic* 5-4 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic looks comfortable 
at 30-0. Raonic tries to make him uncomfortable. Easier said than done. At 
30-15, Djokovic dinks a backhand from left to right and Raonic can only stoop 
and net a backhand. Djokovic holds. If he can break here, the first set is his.

First set: Djokovic 4-4 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic lopes towards the 
net and immediately realises he’s made a mistake as Djokovic wallops a forehand 
down the line for 0-15. Djokovic is beginning to look ominously on his game and 
when he defends excellently again, moving so well, Raonic scoops a confused 
forehand past the baseline, making it 0-30. But that Raonic serve is such an 
effective weapon. It brings him back to 30-all. There’s still work to be done, 
though. Will Raonic pass this test? You betcha! A forehand winner and an ace 
ways to deal with adversity.

First set: Djokovic* 4-3 Raonic (*denotes server): Raonic has been hitting 
some superb forehands. Now he comes up with a delicious backhand, firing one 
down the line as Djokovic advances. 0-15. His feathers ruffled, Djokovic 
responds with a stonking forehand for 15-all, then defends brilliantly before 
overpowering Raonic at the net for 30-15. He holds to 15. We’ll have some new 
balls.
 
First set: Djokovic 3-3 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic opens up the court 
with an excellent serve out wide, but he fails to land the second blow, sending 
a forehand wide. Djokovic leads 0-15. Not for long, though. He nets a forehand, 
before Raonic blasts an ace past him for 30-15. The Canadian holds to 15, a 
second ace polishing off the game.
 
First set: Djokovic* 3-2 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic has had problems 
in his service games. He’ll be desperate for a simple one this time because 
Raonic is not holding back at all. He’s not afraid to whack the fuzz off the 
ball, supreme hitting allowing him to make it 15-all. Djokovic needs some first 
serves. It also helps when Raonic misses a couple of forehands, making it 
40-15. Another poor forehand from Raonic and Djokovic holds. There. Easy.

First set: Djokovic 2-2 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic blooters a serve 
down the middle. It’s wide, but it almost takes out a line judge, who manages 
to duck just in time. Take it from me, a serve to the head hurts. Still, Raonic 
wins the point anyway, then he gobbles up the next one with a pinpoint forehand 
down the line for 30-0. Another crunching serve makes it 40-0, at which point 
he wobbles a little, double-faulting. But not for long. Another superb serve 
sees him hold to 15.
 
First set: Djokovic* 2-1 Raonic (*denotes server): Djokovic pings a forehand 
into the left corner, making Raonic run, but the Canadian digs out a backhand 
and Djokovic nets a volley to make it 0-15. Then Djokovic sends a forehand 
long. 0-30. A cracking second serve makes it 15-30, but Raonic grabs two break 
points with a contemptuous forehand return off another second serve. He nets a 
forehand return off the first, though. The second goes begging as well, a 
forehand flying long. You can’t be wasting those chances against Djokovic, who 
recovers well to hold. Raonic has seen three opportunities to break come and go.
 
First set: Djokovic 1-1 Raonic* (*denotes server): Raonic misses a couple of 
first serves and lets Djokovic into a couple of rallies, but he makes it 15-all 
with a forehand winner down the line. He holds without any trouble from there.

First set: Djokovic* 1-0 Raonic (*denotes server): Resisting the 
understandable temptation to smack a ball in the direction of the press seats,
Novak Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> gets the 
match underway. It begins with a fine rally, one that ends with Raonic sending 
a crisp forehand missile down the line for a 0-15 lead. The next rally’s a long 
one too. Djokovic finds a gap with a backhand, forcing Raonic to net a 
forehand, but the Canadian wins the next point with another excellent forehand 
winner for a 15-30 lead. The game goes to 30-all, but Raonic earns a break 
point when Djokovic knocks a forehand long. Djokovic saves it with an ace out 
wide and goes on to hold.
 
It’s time for the toss. Up into the air it goes! But it’s a dreadful toss of 
the coin. It lands by the net and on its side and, well, it’s impossible to 
make heads or tails of it. We’ll have to try again. Everything passes off 
smoothly on the second try. Djokovic will serve first. Now for the warm-up. 
Tok! Tok! Tok!
 
Here come the players! They’ll be playing tennis soon. Both get huge cheers 
from the crowd, which is beginning to fill up nicely.

If Novak Djokovic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> wins 
tonight, he secures top spot in the group and moves into the last four. In the 
day’s early match, Dominic Thiem kept his hopes alive by beating Gael Monfils 
in three sets.

Hello. At the risk of incurring the wrath of All of Serbia, Novak Djokovic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/novak-djokovic> got angry the other day. He 
smacked a ball in the direction of his box after losing the first set against 
Dominic Thiem and it flew into the crowd. He didn’t take kindly to being asked 
about it in his press conference after recovering to beat Thiem in three sets. 
But it definitely happened! There were cameras there and everything. Djokovic’s 
beef was with the idea that he was playing a dangerous game, that his momentary 
loss of control exposed his troubled mental state and could have resulted in 
serious consequences if the ball had sent a hot dog out of a spectator’s pint 
or, even worse, caused someone to spill their pint.

Secretly, though, Djokovic was probably glad it happened. The fire still burns 
inside him, as Thiem duly discovered, and it was a reminder that no one should 
think for a moment that the Serbian is in the grip of terminal decline despite 
recent tricky times on and off the court. By Djokovic’s standards, this has 
been a troublesome year. But he can still end it as the world No1 by winning 
every match here this week and that would set him up nicely for another strong 
defence of his Australian Open title.

Tonight, however, the challenge is likely to stiffen. Milos Raonic was 
supposedly stricken with a thigh injury when he arrived in London, but the 
Canadian looked sprightly in his victory over Gael Monfils the other night. The 
world No4 has lost all seven of his encounters with Djokovic, so hell need to 
be at his powerful best. But Marin Cilic had lost 14 in a row before beating 
Djokovic in Paris. It can be done. But is the beast stirring again?


Play begins at: 8pm GMT.
