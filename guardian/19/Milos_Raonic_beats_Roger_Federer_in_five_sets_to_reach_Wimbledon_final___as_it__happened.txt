Fifth set: Raonic 5-2 Federer* (*denotes next server)

A 142mph serve sets the tone, then consecutive forced errors by Federer make 
it 40-love. Federer pushes it to 40-15 when Raonic misses on a forehand, but a 
Federer missed backhand seals the hold and Federer will serve to stay in the 
tournament.

Fifth set: *Raonic 4-2 Federer (*denotes next server)

Federer falls behind love-15 and 15-30, but Raonic misses a forehand and then 
Federer dials in an ace to move it to 40-30. Federer then misses a forehand for 
deuce and Raonic crushes a forehand winner for a chance at a commanding 
two-break lead. Federer saves it when Raonic misses a backhand, but Federer 
misses a forehand to return it to give Raonic another break-point chance. 
Federer saves it with a clean forehand winner and a pair of Raonic errors give 
Federer the hard-won hold.

Raonic breaks!

Fifth set: *Raonic 3-1 Federer (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Raonic dumps a slice backhand into the net. But Federer nets a 
forehand on the next point for 30-all and the crowd buzzes. A Federer netcord 
winner makes it 40-30, but Raonic brings it to deuce when Federer misses an 
inside-out forehand millimeters wide. Raonic with a running forehand winner to 
end an extraordinary, hyperkinetic 14-stroke rally and earn a break-point 
chance. Federer took a tumble while lunging for the winning point and appeared 
to injure his left ankle. He’s off to his chair now to be looked at by the 
trainer, but within less than a minute he’s up and returned to his position 
behind the baseline. And he saves the break point by pounding a forehand winner 
into the corner just out of the 6ft 5in Raonic’s reach! A missed backhand gives 
Federer game point, but Raonic returns it to deuce with a smash winner than 
earns another break-point chance when Federer double faults again! Raonic makes 
the most of this one, crushing a forehand winner for the crucial break. Raonic 
now within three games of his first major final.

Fifth set: Raonic 2-1 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Two quick points for Raonic. Federer gets on the board when Raonic misses on a 
backhand, but Raonic wins the next point and Federer can barely get the egde of 
his racket on a 130mph service winner that gives the Canadian the hold.

Federer’s quarter-final win over Marin Cilic was only his first five-set match 
since his comeback from two sets down against Gael Monfils in the 2014 US Open. 
Now he’s going the distance for the second time in as many matches. His career 
record in five-setters is 24-19, compared to 7-5 for Raonic.

Raonic breaks and wins fourth set!

Fourth set: Raonic 7-5 Federer

It appears it will be a brisk service game for Federer, who moves ahead 
40-love on a backhand winner. But Raonic hits a forehand winner and then 
Federer mixes in back-to-back double faults and suddenly we’re at deuce. Raonic 
hits forehand winner to earn a set point, but Federer strikes back with 
forehand winner to save it. Another winner off the forehand side earns him a 
second set point, but Federer comes back with a forehand winner and an ace to 
stake a game point of his own. Raonic returns it to deuce with a backhand 
winner and a missed forehand past the baseline by Federer earns him a third set 
point. This one is not wasted as Raonic crushes a backhand winner down the line 
past an approaching Federer to break the seven-timesWimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> champion and force a fifth and 
deciding set.

Fourth set: Raonic 6-5 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Raonic falls behind love-15 on a mishit backhand, then love-30 on an exquisite 
backhand winner down the line by Federer that brings Bradley Cooper to his 
feet. Five-alarm danger zone, this. But Raonic claws back with three straight 
points – including a gorgeously struck volley winner and a 143mph service 
winner – and takes the game when Federer nets a backhand from the baseline. 
Federer will now serve to force a fourth-set tiebreaker.

Fourth set: Raonic 5-4 Federer* (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Federer hits a gorgeous forehand volley winner just inside the line 
to bring it to 15-30. Raonic with a deftly struck forehand on the approach that 
Federer can’t return inside the lines to make it 30-all, but a forehand error 
by the Canadian gives Federer a look at a break point at 30-40. Feels like this 
could be the match, but Raonic erases it with a 139mph service winner followed 
by a 131mph service winner to give him game point. A missed forehand brings it 
back to deuce, but Raonic wins the next two points and Federer will serve to 
stay in the fourth set.

At 15-all, Raonic sends a running forehand long and Federer has a half-chance 
at 15-30. But a Federer error followed by a 123mph second-serve service winner 
by Raonic bring it to 40-30. Then Raonic double faults – his ninth of the match 
– for deuce. Raonic then hits a pair of forehand winners to take the game and 
stay on serve.

Fourth set: Raonic 3-2 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Federer somehow returns a preposterous Raonic serve but he closes on the net 
and puts away a deft volley winner. Yet a lapse in concentration from Raonic 
sees Federer win three straight points and earn a pair of break-point chances 
at 15-40. The way Federer is serving, this feels like the match. Raonic saves 
the first on a service winner, then the second when Federer nets a running 
forehand from the baseline. Deuce. Federer nets an attempted passing shot to 
give Raonic game point, but brings it back to deuce on a winner. Raonic hits a 
sharply angled volley winner to earn another game point – how those volleys 
have seemed to improve since the addition of McEnroe! – then a service winner 
to earn the hold from 15-40 down.

Fourth set: Raonic 2-1 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Another breezy service game for Raonic. A whopping 51 winners against 28 
unforced errors as he’s really given it his all. Yet it’s Federer, with 28 
winners and only seven unforced errors (seven!), within touching distance of 
the finish line.

Fourth set: Raonic 1-0 Federer* (*denotes next server)

An easy hold at love for Raonic. Just what he needed to steady himself after 
coming a bit undone emotionally there in the third.

Federer wins third set!

Third set: Raonic 4-6 Federer

Federer’s serve, iffy earlier on, is dialed in now. He’s just held at love to 
close out the third set, punctuating the game with a 122mph ace down the middle 
that Raonic scarcely attempted to return. He’s now one set from reaching a 
record-extending 28th grand slam final.

Federer breaks!

Third set: Raonic 3-4 Federer* (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Raonic double faults. Then Federer rips a forehand winner and all 
of a sudden he’ll have a pair of break-point chances at 15-40. He saves the 
first with a 122mph service winner, but Raonic frames a backhand from the 
baseline on the next point to give Federer the break.

@BryanAGraham <https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham> "That’s Federer: give him an 
inch and he’ll take a mile" Yet he can't convert four setpoints??

Third set: *Raonic 2-2 Federer (*denotes next server)

Serving at 40-15, Federer makes an error off the backhand side and then double 
faults. Deuce. Raonic then misfires off the backhand side but follows up with a 
forehand winner to return it to deuce. But Federer earns the hold with a 
service winner followed by a forehand winner.

Third set: Raonic 2-1 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Another quick hold for Raonic, who is serving so well today. The variety of 
spin and placement is making Federer guess. How ironic that one of Raonic’s 
only service missteps of the day – the double fault at 3-all in the breaker – 
is why they’re level on sets. That’s Federer: give him an inch and he’ll take a 
mile.

Federer falls behind love-30, a golden chance for Raonic to sneak an early

“I was struggling there through the third in fourth set,” an animated Raonic 
says. “But I saw a little, little opening and it was enough.”

Adds Raonic: “I’m by no means done what I’m here to do.”
 
Milos Raonic becomes the first Canadian man in history to reach a grand slam 
final. He’s also the first non-European male finalist at Wimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> since Andy Roddick in 2009.

No yips here. Raonic closes in style, holding at love, with Federer sending a 
running backhand astray on triple match point.

Fifth set: *Raonic 5-3 Federer (*denotes next server)

Clinical service game for Federer, who holds at love. Raonic will serve to 
become the first Canadian man ever to reach a grand slam final.
 
Fifth set: Raonic 5-2 Federer* (*denotes next server)

A 142mph serve sets the tone, then consecutive forced errors by Federer make 
it 40-love. Federer pushes it to 40-15 when Raonic misses on a forehand, but a 
Federer missed backhand seals the hold and Federer will serve to stay in the 
tournament.
 
Fifth set: *Raonic 4-2 Federer (*denotes next server)

Federer falls behind love-15 and 15-30, but Raonic misses a forehand and then 
Federer dials in an ace to move it to 40-30. Federer then misses a forehand for 
deuce and Raonic crushes a forehand winner for a chance at a commanding 
two-break lead. Federer saves it when Raonic misses a backhand, but Federer 
misses a forehand to return it to give Raonic another break-point chance. 
Federer saves it with a clean forehand winner and a pair of Raonic errors give 
Federer the hard-won hold.

Raonic follows up a double fault with a 139mph ace down the T then a 140mph 
service winner for 30-15. Federer nets a backhand to make it 40-15, then Raonic 
dials in another service winner to back up the break.

Fifth set: *Raonic 3-1 Federer (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Raonic dumps a slice backhand into the net. But Federer nets a 
forehand on the next point for 30-all and the crowd buzzes. A Federer netcord 
winner makes it 40-30, but Raonic brings it to deuce when Federer misses an 
inside-out forehand millimeters wide. Raonic with a running forehand winner to 
end an extraordinary, hyperkinetic 14-stroke rally and earn a break-point 
chance. Federer took a tumble while lunging for the winning point and appeared 
to injure his left ankle. He’s off to his chair now to be looked at by the 
trainer, but within less than a minute he’s up and returned to his position 
behind the baseline. And he saves the break point by pounding a forehand winner 
into the corner just out of the 6ft 5in Raonic’s reach! A missed backhand gives 
Federer game point, but Raonic returns it to deuce with a smash winner than 
earns another break-point chance when Federer double faults again! Raonic makes 
the most of this one, crushing a forehand winner for the crucial break. Raonic 
now within three games of his first major final.

Fifth set: Raonic 2-1 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Two quick points for Raonic. Federer gets on the board when Raonic misses on a 
backhand, but Raonic wins the next point and Federer can barely get the egde of 
his racket on a 130mph service winner that gives the Canadian the hold.

Fifth set: *Raonic 1-1 Federer (*denotes next server)

Federer holds at love. Slight work. Closes it out with an ace.

 
Fifth set: Raonic 1-0 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Federer pushes Raonic to 40-30 from 30-love down but the Canadian closes out 
the hold with a 141mph thunderbolt of an ace.
 
Federer’s quarter-final win over Marin Cilic was only his first five-set match 
since his comeback from two sets down against Gael Monfils in the 2014 US Open. 
Now he’s going the distance for the second time in as many matches. His career 
record in five-setters is 24-19, compared to 7-5 for Raonic.

Fourth set: Raonic 7-5 Federer

It appears it will be a brisk service game for Federer, who moves ahead 
40-love on a backhand winner. But Raonic hits a forehand winner and then 
Federer mixes in back-to-back double faults and suddenly we’re at deuce. Raonic 
hits forehand winner to earn a set point, but Federer strikes back with 
forehand winner to save it. Another winner off the forehand side earns him a 
second set point, but Federer comes back with a forehand winner and an ace to 
stake a game point of his own. Raonic returns it to deuce with a backhand 
winner and a missed forehand past the baseline by Federer earns him a third set 
point. This one is not wasted as Raonic crushes a backhand winner down the line 
past an approaching Federer to break the seven-timesWimbledon 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/wimbledon> champion and force a fifth and 
deciding set.

Fourth set: Raonic 6-5 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Raonic falls behind love-15 on a mishit backhand, then love-30 on an exquisite 
backhand winner down the line by Federer that brings Bradley Cooper to his 
feet. Five-alarm danger zone, this. But Raonic claws back with three straight 
points – including a gorgeously struck volley winner and a 143mph service 
winner – and takes the game when Federer nets a backhand from the baseline. 
Federer will now serve to force a fourth-set tiebreaker.
 
Fourth set: *Raonic 5-5 Federer (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Federer can’t handle a deep forehand to the baseline and it’s 
15-30, but he rattles off three quick points to level it at five games apiece.
 
Fourth set: Raonic 5-4 Federer* (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Federer hits a gorgeous forehand volley winner just inside the line 
to bring it to 15-30. Raonic with a deftly struck forehand on the approach that 
Federer can’t return inside the lines to make it 30-all, but a forehand error 
by the Canadian gives Federer a look at a break point at 30-40. Feels like this 
could be the match, but Raonic erases it with a 139mph service winner followed 
by a 131mph service winner to give him game point. A missed forehand brings it 
back to deuce, but Raonic wins the next two points and Federer will serve to 
stay in the fourth set.

Fourth set: *Raonic 4-4 Federer (*denotes next server)

A comfortable hold for Federer despite some hard-fought points. Here’s a 
telling stat: Federer’s first-serve percentage is up to 81% in the fourth set 
from 61% in the third, 54% in the second and 55% in the first.
 
Fourth set: Raonic 4-3 Federer* (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Raonic sends a running forehand long and Federer has a half-chance 
at 15-30. But a Federer error followed by a 123mph second-serve service winner 
by Raonic bring it to 40-30. Then Raonic double faults – his ninth of the match 
– for deuce. Raonic then hits a pair of forehand winners to take the game and 
stay on serve.
 
Fourth set: *Raonic 3-3 Federer (*denotes next server)

Raonic with a sniff of a break after hitting a backhand winner for 15-30 on 
Federer’s serve. Federer responds with a forehand volley winner and a 122mph 
ace to move it to 40-30. He nets a volley for deuce, but a pair of errors by 
Raonic give him the hold.
 
Fourth set: Raonic 3-2 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Federer somehow returns a preposterous Raonic serve but he closes on the net 
and puts away a deft volley winner. Yet a lapse in concentration from Raonic 
sees Federer win three straight points and earn a pair of break-point chances 
at 15-40. The way Federer is serving, this feels like the match. Raonic saves 
the first on a service winner, then the second when Federer nets a running 
forehand from the baseline. Deuce. Federer nets an attempted passing shot to 
give Raonic game point, but brings it back to deuce on a winner. Raonic hits a 
sharply angled volley winner to earn another game point – how those volleys 
have seemed to improve since the addition of McEnroe! – then a service winner 
to earn the hold from 15-40 down.
 
Fourth set: *Raonic 2-2 Federer (*denotes next server)

Federer falls behind love-15 to give Raonic a distant whiff of the break, but 
he rattles off four straight points including back-to-back winners to close out 
the hold.

Fourth set: Raonic 2-1 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Another breezy service game for Raonic. A whopping 51 winners against 28 
unforced errors as he’s really given it his all. Yet it’s Federer, with 28 
winners and only seven unforced errors (seven!), within touching distance of 
the finish line.
 
Fourth set: *Raonic 1-1 Federer (*denotes next server)

Federer answers Raonic’s hold at love with one of his own as the match passes 
the two-hour mark. New balls for this next game.
 
Fourth set: Raonic 1-0 Federer* (*denotes next server)

An easy hold at love for Raonic. Just what he needed to steady himself after 
coming a bit undone emotionally there in the third.
 
Third set: Raonic 4-6 Federer

Federer’s serve, iffy earlier on, is dialed in now. He’s just held at love to 
close out the third set, punctuating the game with a 122mph ace down the middle 
that Raonic scarcely attempted to return. He’s now one set from reaching a 
record-extending 28th grand slam final.

Third set: Raonic 4-5 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Raonic cruises ahead 40-love on a service winner and consecutive aces. Raonic 
misfires on a forehand volley but takes the game on a missed backhand by 
Federer, who will now serve for the third set.

 
Third set: *Raonic 3-5 Federer (*denotes next server)

Federer backs up the break the best way possible: a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it 
hold at love. Two unforced errors in the game by Raonic, who will serve to stay 
in the third set.
 
Third set: Raonic 3-4 Federer* (*denotes next server)

At 15-all, Raonic double faults. Then Federer rips a forehand winner and all 
of a sudden he’ll have a pair of break-point chances at 15-40. He saves the 
first with a 122mph service winner, but Raonic frames a backhand from the 
baseline on the next point to give Federer the break.

Third set: *Raonic 3-3 Federer (*denotes next server)

A hold at love for Federer. Closes it out with a thudding ace out wide.
 
Third set: Raonic 3-2 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Another quick hold for Raonic including a 140mph service winner and a 111mph 
second-serve ace to close out the hold.
 
Third set: *Raonic 2-2 Federer (*denotes next server)

Serving at 40-15, Federer makes an error off the backhand side and then double 
faults. Deuce. Raonic then misfires off the backhand side but follows up with a 
forehand winner to return it to deuce. But Federer earns the hold with a 
service winner followed by a forehand winner.
 
Third set: Raonic 2-1 Federer* (*denotes next server)

Another quick hold for Raonic, who is serving so well today. The variety of 
spin and placement is making Federer guess. How ironic that one of Raonic’s 
only service missteps of the day – the double fault at 3-all in the breaker – 
is why they’re level on sets. That’s Federer: give him an inch and he’ll take a 
mile.
 
Third set: *Raonic 1-1 Federer (*denotes next server)

Federer falls behind love-30, a golden chance for Raonic to sneak an early 
break. But the Swiss rattles off four straight points including a cracking 
forehand winner – his 18th, compared to 36 for Raonic – to scratch out the hold.
