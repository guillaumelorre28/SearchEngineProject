Swap Kandy for Jaffna

Kandy is home to one of Sri Lanka’s greatest and most-visited Buddhist sites, 
the Temple of the Tooth, and is busy with tourists and devotees from across the 
island. For a quieter cultural buzz, head toJaffna, in the far north 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/feb/07/northern-sri-lanka-jaffna-trincomalee-holiday>
. Identifying more with southern India, this vibrant Tamil city, now seeing a 
resurgence in visitors after years of civil war, is fascinating, and still off 
the radar for most tourists. Must-sees include the sacred Nallur Kandaswamy 
Hindu temple, Hindu and Buddhist shrines on Nainativu Island, Delft Island’s 
beaches, wild ponies and the ruins of a Dutch fort, and Point Pedro, the 
island’s northernmost tip.

With ruins atop and around a 180-metre granite outcrop, Sigiriya, near 
Dambulla, is one of Sri Lanka’s most spectacular sites, but its narrow 
staircases can be frustratingly slow going when visitor volume is high. As an 
alternative, make for Yapahuwa, a couple of hours west. This former 
13th-century royal capital crafted out of an outcrop half the height of 
Sigiriya even hosted the Buddha’s tooth that’s now in Kandy (see above) for a 
time, though few visitors make it here now. The highlight is a steep, 
narrow-stepped ornamental staircase, flanked by finely sculpted lions, 
elephants, dwarfs and goddesses, leading to a doorway, which is all that 
remains of the palace. The top of the rock was not built upon, but it is worth 
the scramble up there for the 360-degree views.

Another tip: Those who really don’t want to miss Sigiriya can still escape the 
crowds (and the £25 ticket price for foreigners) by scrambling up Pidurangala 
rock, about a mile away. It offers unbeatable views, from a unique northerly 
perspective, of the seventh-century citadel, and costs just £2.50. The 
monastery here actually predates Sigiriya, and various temple relics can be 
seen as you climb.

Mulkirigala’s 2,000-year-old cave temples are the south coast’s answer to 
Dambulla’s Golden Temple, and worth a visit if you’re not going to the Cultural 
Triangle. The seven Buddha-adorned sanctuaries are carved out of a 206-metre 
rock, and accessed via stone staircases and breath-catching terraces. The most 
significant of these is the Rajamaha Vihara, where ola-leaf manuscripts, 
discovered in 1826, facilitated The Mahavamsa, Sri Lanka’s historical 
chronicle, to be translated for the modern age. At the top is a stupa for 
absorbing the 360-degree views.

Visitors are drawn to Yala by the wild leopards. However, even if they spot 
one, the cacophony of hundreds of vehicles clamouring around the park can make 
for a less-than-tranquil experience. A worthy alternative is north-westerly 
Wilpattu, a much larger and arguably more beautiful reserve that sees far fewer 
visitors. Although wildlife is shyer here, the park is home to leopards, sloth 
bears, crocodiles, elephants, deer and many bird species.

 Elephant in Gal Oya national park. Photograph: Alamy 
Minneriya’s annual gathering of elephants from August to October – it has the 
best dry-season feeding – is one of nature’s great spectacles, but for the rest 
of the year a safari here is underwhelming. Gal Oya national park is a barely 
touched reserve that encompasses the island’s largest inland body of water, 
Senanayaka Samudra lake. Its unique boat safaris offer superb opportunities to 
spy elephants bathing in the water or feasting on the grassy shore.

Sri Lanka is one of the best places in the world for blue whale watching and 
Mirissa on the south coast is the island’s main focus, offering consistent 
sightings between December and April. However Trincomalee in the north-east is 
rapidly emerging as a second, equally impressive, hub. Migrating blue, and 
sometimes sperm whales pass here in March/April and August/September, and are 
regularly sighted, alongside spinner dolphins, within 30 minutes of the shore. 
One fine place to spy them is from clifftop Swarmi Rock, a temple-topped 
promontory in the south of the town.

Jet skiing, banana boating, water skiing and deep-sea fishing are all on offer 
at Bentota, Sri Lanka’s unofficial water sports capital, but for kite-surfing, 
north-westerly Kalpitiya peninsula is the place to be. May to September, when 
wind speeds reach 20-30 knots, is the best period for this high-energy sport, 
which can be done out on the lagoon (good for beginners) or at sea; many hotels 
are set up for kite-surfers. Kalpitiya also offers whale- and dolphin-watching 
cruises without the crowds, while Bar Reef, a couple of miles offshore, is one 
of the island’s best-preserved marine sanctuaries, teeming with tropical fish.

Hikkaduwa, in the south west, used to be the place to surf, but the sharp rise 
in the number of surfers “discovering” Sri Lanka’s many breaks has resulted in 
a spread south and east, as surfers search for less crowded breaks, holistic 
experiences (such as yoga) and pristine locations. One current favourite is 
Hiriketiya, east of Dikwella, whose deep, intimate and as-yet-unspoiled bay is 
fringed by thick stands of coconut palms. It’s gaining a reputation as a 
chilled surf and yoga destination, and offers a central break for beginners and 
a fun reef break for experienced surfers. There are other breaks, such as at 
Talalla, a tuk-tuk ride away.

Buzzy Arugam Bay is a favourite with surfers and budget travellers, however 
you can completely escape the crowds at Kalkudah, a three-hour journey up the 
east coast. The long sweep of beach here is brilliantly pristine, and the scene 
– fishermen with red betel-mouthed grins repairing nets beneath swaying palms – 
has changed little in decades. May to October is the best time to visit and, 
unlike Arugam Bay and the south and west coasts, the sea is completely flat, a 
piercing turquoise blue, and shallow for 50 or so metres out to sea. There are 
simple guesthouses in the village serving local food, but mercifully, nothing 
yet on the beach itself.
