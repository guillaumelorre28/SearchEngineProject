The worst thing about sewers, in my limited experience, is not being down 
there – smelly, cramped and claustrophobic though they are – but getting into 
them. You stand above the shaft, peer into the darkness, fret about how to get 
your feet on to the slippery rungs of the ladder that will take you 20, 30, 
40ft down, and wonder why on earth you are doing this.

Those are the thoughts that flash through my mind as I try to manoeuvre my 
large, far-from-supple body on to the ladder that will take me into the 
underworld. I am with a group of sewer technicians (colloquially known as 
“flushers”) from Thames Water’s Hammersmith depot in west London, and we are 
about to inspect a sewer they refer to as “the Crypt” because you access it 
from the side ofSt Mary’s church in Putney <http://stmarys.parishofputney.com>. 
As I sit above the shaft, trying to work out how to get in, I am hoping someone 
nearby is saying a prayer for me.

I do eventually manage to climb down, and immediately wish I hadn’t. I had 
been down a sewer in centralLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> a 
few weeks earlier, but that was far more spacious – a Hilton among sewers. The 
one next to the Thames in Putney is at best a B&B, and a dilapidated one at 
that.

The tunnels are so low you have to be bent double almost all the time. There 
arefatbergs 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/21/huge-10-ton-fatberg-removed-chelsea-sewer-london>
 – giant lumps caused by disposable wipes, cooking fat and sewage coalescing 
and congealing – everywhere. There is a strong smell, especially when the 
flushers started prodding the fatbergs. And it is very hot, despite it being a 
cool autumn day above ground.

I feel faint and wish I was wearing fewer clothes under my protective white 
suit and weighted plastic thigh-high waders. “Lucky you didn’t faint,” says 
Vince Minney, who has been a flusher for 26 years. “You’re a big chap and we 
would have struggled to get you out.”

Minney, who is 56, is a character, a straight-talking, heavy-smoking Londoner 
who doesn’t mince his words. He is also an enthusiast for a job most people 
would run a mile from. At his age, he could take an office job with Thames 
Water and be supervising operations from afar, but he prefers to carry on going 
underground. “I don’t have to go down,” he says. “I choose to. You want to get 
involved and, if you’re the one writing the report, it’s much easier to see it 
yourself. If I’m healthy and fit, there’s nothing to stop me. To be a full part 
of the team, you have to go underground. You can’t just take the cream. That 
ain’t right.”

I join the flushers at the start of their day shift at 7am. There used to be 
10 depots in London; now there are three. The full-time workforce that once 
numbered hundreds is down to 45, with contractors taking up a lot of the slack. 
The 20 men at Hammersmith – they are all men, though women can apply too if 
they want – service the whole of west London and much of central London too. 
That’s quite a few thousand miles of sewers, but they don’t have to visit them 
all. Indeed, many won’t have been explored for decades. They know from 
experience where the blockages are likely to occur – at bends and junctions in 
the sewers – and their first job is to keep those clear.

Today they are investigating several points south of the Thames where the 
developers of the Tideway tunnel will sink shafts to connect with the existing 
sewer system – hence our trip to the Crypt at Putney.Tideway 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/27/london-super-sewer-branded-waste-time-money>
 is the vast £4.2bn scheme that will dig a tunnel twice the size of a tube 
tunnel under the Thames and stop overflow sewage being discharged into the 
river.

Victorian engineer Joseph Bazalgette’s much-vaunted 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/04/story-cities-14-london-great-stink-river-thames-joseph-bazalgette-sewage-system>
 London sewage system, built in the 1860s and 70s, was a huge improvement on 
the previous patchwork of rivers, gullies and conduits but, on about 50 days a 
year when rain is heavy, raw sewage is still discharged into the Thames. The 
Tideway tunnel is designed to stop most of that. Most but not all, note. 
According to Andy Alder, central project delivery manager for Tideway, stopping 
everything would be unfeasibly expensive. Even the tunnel as planned, which is 
due to become operational in 2024, will add £25 a year to the bill of every 
Thames Water customer.

But that’s for the future – a vast concrete sewer that may well be serviced by 
robots, or even drones. Today, it’s just a bunch of blokes who will be bent 
double opening metal flaps in one of Bazelgette’s sewers and poking at 
fatbergs, with disgusting effect. How can they be so cheery is my first thought 
when I meet them at seven in the morning. What drives them to come to work for 
a starting salary, as I discover later, of £19,000 a year, rising to about 
£30,000 with experience and overtime?

“I was a bricklayer before I did this, but there was a recession in the 
building industry and I needed something with more reliable pay,” says Minney 
as we drive to Putney. “There’s a variety of work, and you can get job 
satisfaction from it. There’s also a good team spirit most of the time.”

That camaraderie is important, and in the periods when they are preparing to 
go underground the men are constantly joking and fooling about. “It’s not just 
a team, it’s like a family,” says Gari Pattison, 30, who has been a flusher for 
three years and says he gets a real kick out of working in Bazelgette’s sewers 
and being part of an honourable tradition. “Everyone covers everyone else. 
Everyone knows the job; everyone knows the positions to be in and, if there are 
problems, someone will have an idea of how to solve it.”

We are in the car with Stan Cheeseman, who has been a flusher for six years. 
He knew Minney and heard there was the chance of a job – social and family 
connections are important in this tight-knit world. I ask Cheeseman how people 
react when he tells them he works down the sewers. “You get the same reaction 
from everyone,” he says. “‘How can you do that job?’ People think you are 
knee-deep in whatever all day, but you’re not really. A lot of the sewers are 
ex-rivers.”

Myth number one about the sewers: you’re not “knee-deep in whatever”, or 
indeed – Cheeseman is too polite to say it – in shit. Only 2% of what is 
flowing through the sewers is sewage; the rest is water and accumulated debris 
– the vast amount of water you flush down the toilet and all the water and silt 
that seeps into the sewers when it rains. You will see the odd turd, but at no 
point will you be trudging through raw sewage.

You will see the odd turd down here, but at no point will you be trudging 
through raw sewage

Forty-year-old Tim Henderson is a senior member of the team out today. His 
father worked at a pumping station for 37 years, and two of Henderson’s 
brothers also became flushers. He says he likes not being stuck in an office 
and enjoys the variety of the work. He reckons the public exaggerate the 
horrors of working in the sewers. “People think this is a dirty, horrible job, 
but it’s not really that bad. They think you’re walking through torrents of 
poo, but you’re not; it’s just water.” He does, though, admit that fatbergs are 
no fun. “Fat is just about the worst, because a lot of it has to be dug out by 
hand,” he says.

Myth number two: there are huge killer rats in the sewers. An association is 
always made in the public mind between sewers and rats – huge, king-size, 
child-eating rats. “You do come across rats,” says Minney, “but they’re not as 
widespread as the general population think. They’re not much of an issue with 
us unless they’re in our way. They might be sitting on top of a big of 
apparatus that we want to operate, but they generally leg it. They might want 
to get by you, and they might feel threatened because they have young, but they 
won’t attack you. They just want to get past, so you let them go. We’re not 
there to destroy them.”

 A flusher’s life: ‘People think this is a dirty, horrible job, but it’s not 
really that bad.’ Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian 
On our trip underground, I don’t see any rats, but I do see a crab living 
quite happily in the slime, and one of the flushers spots an eel slithering out 
along the little tunnel into the Thames. But there is no sign of anything more 
exotic, though a man who comes up to us when we emerge from the sewer – the 
public are always fascinated when they see teams going underground – says he 
once saw a flusher emerge carrying a 12ft python.

Far more worrying than rats, or indeed pythons, are the issues of gas, 
possible flooding and the danger of falling – Cheeseman says a head for heights 
is essential. For every flusher underground, there will be one above ground 
monitoring the weather and ready to effect a rescue if a problem occurs. Gas 
levels are constantly monitored, and the team underground will rarely be far 
from an access point. One of the team tells me the furthest he had ever 
travelled underground away from a manhole or other exit was 600m. Each flusher 
carries an emergency airbag in a metal tin that can provide clean air for up to 
an hour. Thames Water’s safety record is exemplary, but the dangers are ever 
present.

We are only underground at Putney for about half an hour – flushers can 
sometimes spend up to three hours underground in a single stint – but that’s 
more than enough for me. It’s not as smelly as people imagine (myth number 
three), but it is still unpleasant, especially when the space is this confined, 
and one of the men tells me he reckons they are underpaid for what they do.

It is nice to get back to the surface, though the change of temperature and 
the sudden intake of oxygen leaves me feeling a little light-headed. “Make sure 
you wash your hands well,” one of the flushers tells me when we get back to 
their van. Newcomers can be susceptible to bugs, and stomach upsets are common; 
so much so that he says Thames Water is very tolerant of time off for sickness 
in the early days of employment. But eventually, he reckons, you build up 
resistance to whatever you might come across underground.

You really can get used to anything if you have to, and spending your life 
down a sewer isn’t quite as bad as it’s cracked up to be, but it is still a 
pretty tough job. So if you see a flusher emerging from a sewer near you (with 
or without a python), do say thanks rather than moaning about your blocked 
toilet or the size of your water bill. And never chuck a wet wipe down the loo, 
or you will be haunted by the spirits of flushers past and present. Call it the 
curse of the fatberg.
