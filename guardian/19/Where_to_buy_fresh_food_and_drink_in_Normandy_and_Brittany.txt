Pays d’Auge and Pays d’Ouche 

The Pays d’Auge region, just an hour’s drive east of Caen and straddling the 
departments of Calvados, Orne and part of Eure, is Normandy’s gastronomic 
heart, with apple orchards, cider farms and calvados distilleries amid rolling 
green hills. Further east is the Pays d’Ouche, a region influenced by the 
rivers Seine and Risle, also with great places for foodies to investigate.

What to buy
The local apple brandy, calvados, takes its name from the area around it and 
the elegantChateau du Breuil 
<http://www.chateau-breuil.com/index2.asp?id_langue=15>, north of Lisieux, 
offers tours of the aromatic cellars and distillery followed by tasting of aged 
and flavoured varieties. For cider head further east toLe Clos Cerisey 
<http://www.lecloscerisey.com/> near Evreux, a cider farm that specialises in 
apples with red skin and red flesh. Visitors can tour the orchards, then taste 
and buy red cider and red apple juices at the rustic farm shop.

The new kid on the cider block is cidre de glace (ice cider), made with apples 
that are left on the trees until winter then pressed, the cold juice being left 
to ferment for months. TheManoir du Val 
<http://manoirduval.free.fr/cadre.html.htm> near Bernay is one of a dozen farms 
producing it, along with a host of other apple-based products.

Cheese lovers can stock up in the tiny village of Camembert at La Fromagerie 
Durand 
<http://www.bienvenue-a-la-ferme.com/normandie/ferme-fromagerie-durand-135078/contact_plan_acces>
. Further south in Mortagne-au-Perche, the town’s Saturday morning farmer’s 
market is the place to findle petit percheron, a soft, raw milk cheese aged in 
cider. Fans of charcuterie will love France’s capital of the black pudding (
boudin noir); it’s such a big deal in Mortagne-au-Perche that there’s even an 
annual festival during which metre-long sausages are devoured by the dozen. 
Wine barLa Vie en Rouge (31 rue Sainte-Croix, +33 966 138 820, no website) 
sells fine wines by the glass, bottle and case, to wash down thesaucisson. 
Cider lovers will relish tours and tastings atLa Cidrerie Traditionnelle du 
Perche <http://www.cidrerie-traditionnelle-du-perche.fr/>. Those who prefer 
vintage bric-a-brac could head south to Bellême for its antique andbrocante 
(vintage) shops.

Where to eat
Homely antique shop-meets-restaurant La Maison d’Horbé in the tiny village of 
La Perrière doubles as a tearoom (offering 40 varieties of tea and coffee 
varieties) and sells food to take away. But don’t expect fast food; we’re 
talking duck foie gras (€25), ratatouille (€9 for four people) and boeuf 
bourguignon (€16 for two).

The Palais Bénédictine <http://www.benedictinedom.com/global/en/home.aspx> at 
Fécamp is a rambling neo-Gothic palace, in which the distillery churns out the 
world’s supply of Benedictine, a herbal liqueur with medieval origins. Visitors 
can discover its fascinating story before indulging in a few cocktails at the 
stylish bar.

Dieppe has several delicatessens and wine boutiques worth investigating. LC 
Vins <http://lcvins.fr/>, on the outskirts, for example, is currently offering 
Cuvée Léa Chateau St Preignan (AOP Languedoc) for €6.50 a bottle. This pleasant 
seaside town merits a further stroll.L’Epicerie Olivier 
<http://olivierdieppe.com/> has a great selection of wine and cheese 
(neufchâtel is a speciality) as well as interesting tea and coffee varieties. 
Wine boutiqueLa Feuille de Vigne <http://www.la-feuilledevigne.com/>, amid the 
striking townhouses that line the harbour in Honfleur, is like an Aladdin’s 
cave of tasty tipples and artisanal groceries; it has about 800 wines and 
spirits on sale, plus rillettes, oils, vinegars and terrines.

 Plenty to scoff … Roscoff is noted for seafood and onions. Photograph: Alamy 
This idyllic town in Finistère looks out towards the enchanting Ile de Batz, 
and is famous for its onions and variety of seafood.

What to buy and see
Onions may not be top of many people’s shopping list for a gastronomic weekend 
away, but the pink onions of Roscoff have a smooth, sweet flavour that makes 
them special. They were popular England in the early part of the 20th century, 
when Onion Johnnies – beret-wearing Frenchmen on bicycles, brought them over 
the Channel. The museum dedicated to the Johnnies’ story,La Maison des Johnnies 
et de l’Oignon de Roscoff 
<http://www.roscoff.fr/-Maison-des-Johnnies-et-de-l-Oignon-.html>, is an 
interesting place to check out before buying a string at the morning market on 
Wednesdays. There is an annual festival celebrating the Johnnies, this year on 
20-21 August.
