Nick Kyrgios <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nick-kyrgios> rained down 23 
aces as he beat David Goffin in a 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 comeback to win the Japan Open 
and claim his third title of the season.

The Australian added the Japanese event to the first two trophies of his 
career, which he won earlier in 2016 in Marseille and Atlanta.

Kyrgios spent two hours on court against his Belgian opponent, saving 11 of a 
dozen break points while breaking Goffin twice – including in the penultimate 
game which set up victory.

He put his big game on display for eager Japanese fans, who adopted the 
21-year-old as a favourite after the early elimination of national tennis hero 
Kei Nishikori.

Kyrgios put in a massive effort to start turning the momentum after dropping 
the first set to the fifth-seeded Goffin.

The 15th-ranked Kyrgios saved five break points to hold for 2-1 in the second 
set and then broke in the next game on his way to levelling at a set each.

In the third, his break of Goffin for 6-5 made the different as he served out 
the win a game later.

Victory helped Kyrgios in the points chase to the season-ending finals next 
month in London, with the Australian moving to provisional 12th for the 
eight-man World Tour Finals.

Kyrgios now stands 38-14 for the season and he becomes just the fifth men’s 
player this year to win three titles or more.
