Critics turned composers 

It’s just a coincidence, surely, but no less than three of the composers with 
major premieres in the 2016 Proms have been music critics in previous lives.
Anthony Payne <http://www.classical-artists.com/janemanning/anthony-payne.htm> 
left that world behind a long time ago, and is far better known nowadays for 
his own beautifully crafted music and for his completions of unfinished works 
by Elgar and Vaughan Williams. His Of Land, Sea and Sky gets its first 
performance in Andrew Davis’s concert with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. But both
Malcolm Hayes <http://www.malcolmhayes.co.uk/> and Bayan Northcott 
<http://www.stainer.co.uk/bayan.html> still work as critics, even though 
composing is now their main occupation. Tai Murray is the soloist in Hayes’s 
Violin Concerto, with Thomas Søndergård conducting the BBC National Orchestra 
of Wales, while the BBCSO under Simone Young gets to introduce Northcott’s 
Concerto for Orchestra.

’s appearances at the Proms, usually conducting the BBC Symphony, almost 
invariably contain something special or unexpected. There are both in his 
concert with the orchestra this year. The first half is devoted to Brahms’s 
First Piano Concerto, not a rarity at all, except that the soloist isPeter 
Serkin <http://www.ingpen.co.uk/artist/peter-serkin/>, who is one of the finest 
pianists around today and collaborates with Knussen, but who only rarely gives 
concerts in Britain. After that comes the UK premiere ofReinbert de Leeuw 
<http://www.herzberger-artists.com/de%20leeuw.htm>’s Der Nächtliche Wanderer 
(The Night Wanderer). De Leeuw, a Dutch contemporary of Louis Andriessen, is 
much better known these days as a conductor than as a composer. This sumptuous 
55-minute nightscape, first performed in 2014, and which includes pre-recorded 
sounds of barking dogs, a distant accordion playing Wagner and the words of the 
Hölderlin poem from which the work takes its title, was his first orchestral 
score in 40 years.

Levene for the Guardian 
The parade of international orchestras that traditionally lights up the last 
few weeks of the season includes some of the usual suspects. But one particular 
juxtaposition stands out this time, when two concerts by theBerlin Staatskapelle
 <http://www.staatsoper-berlin.de/en_EN/orchester> with its music director 
Daniel Barenboim 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2016/jan/14/daniel-barenboim-60-years-in-london-in-pictures>
, are followed immediately by two concerts from theDresden Staatskapelle 
<http://www.staatskapelle-dresden.de/en/> and its chief, Christian Thielemann 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2009/oct/15/christian-thielemann>
, who is making a rare London appearance. The opportunity to compare and 
contrast two of the real heavyweights of the German orchestral scene is 
enhanced by the fact that three of their four programmes feature a Mozart piano 
concerto followed by a Bruckner symphony. Barenboim is the soloist in Mozart’s 
C minor and D major concertos, K491 and 537, as well as conducting Bruckner’s 
Fourth and Sixth Symphonies, whileDaniil Trifonov <http://daniiltrifonov.com/> 
is the soloist in the C major Concerto K467 with Thielemann, who tackles 
Bruckner’s always problematic Third Symphony.

 and Glyndebourne’sBarber of Seville

bespoke for the Proms. The concert staging of Janáaček’s The Makropulos Affair 
that Jiří Bĕlohlávek conducts with the BBC Symphony follows on from his much 
admiredJenůfa

 at the Festival Hall in April; as in that performance, the cast includesKarita 
Mattila 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/24/soprano-karita-mattila-opera-interview>
, here singing the role of Emilia Marty. Rossini’s rarely heard Semiramide, 
though, is being given in a straight concert performance; Mark Elder conducts 
the period instruments of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in this 
one, withAlbina Shagimuratova <http://www.albinashagimuratova.com/> in the 
demanding coloratura title role.

The Proms matinees on Saturday afternoon have been dispersed around London 
this year. There are concerts in theOld Royal Naval College 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ezmwhn> in Greenwich, the Roundhouse 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/eg85v2> in Chalk Farm and at the Sam Wanamaker 
Playhouse <http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e2v8gw> on the South Bank, while the 
series ends in the most unlikely venue of all. Over the last five years 
conductorChristopher Stark 
<https://christopher-stark-8hlw.squarespace.com/%C2%A3welcome#welcome> and his 
Multi-Story Orchestra have carved out their own very distinctive south London 
niche with theirconcerts in a municipal car park in Peckham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/13/the-car-park-prom-meet-the-orchestra-who-perform-on-the-ninth-floor-of-a-multi-storey>
. It’s there, on home ground, that Stark and his orchestra present an 
80th-birthday tribute to the great American minimalistSteve Reich 
<http://www.stevereich.com/>. Their programme concentrates on Reich’s early 
works, and includes his first ever orchestral piece, Music for Large Ensemble, 
as well as the beautiful Vermont Counterpoint and the octet Eight Lines.
