On the surface Munich is very posh and bourgeois, but that’s just the shell. 
For all its elegance and grandeur, it’s much more about old-fashioned family 
values and communities. Whereas Berlin is a fast-paced place that’s constantly 
reshaping,in Munich people like their traditions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/nov/07/munich-city-guide-bars-restaurants-hotels-germany>
, things don’t change easily and it’s much more down to earth than people 
imagine.

When I was little I dreamed of living in Paris, New York or London, but the 
more I travelled, the more I started to appreciate my city. Whenever I come 
back from a crazy metropolis and land at Munich airport, it feels as though 
somebody has pushed the slow-motion button. That’s a feeling I value a lot.

No building in Munich is allowed to be higher than the Frauenkirche cathedral. 
As long as this law stays in place, the city won’t turn into a concrete jungle. 
There are some beautiful buildings, such as the opera house and the Hercules 
Hall inside the Munich Residenz, the home of the Bavarian Radio Symphony 
orchestra. In summer, our two main orchestras perform open-air concerts in 
Odeonsplatz.

I love walking through the old town, listening to street musicians play. In 
Munich, people really take the time to listen to street music.

As a child I dreamed of playing at the Gasteig with the Munich Philharmonic. 
So when this happened, in 2010, it was very emotional for me. The Gasteig is 
not known for its great acoustics – Leonard Bernstein wrote in its guest book: 
“Burn it!” – and the building itself looks very ugly from the outside, but I 
have attended so many wonderful concerts that I feel at home here.

Munich is the only place in the world you can find a truly great bretzl 
(pretzel). They are crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside – and 
delicious when buttered too. My favourite ones are from theDallmayr store 
<http://www.dallmayr.com/> and from Müller Brot

The shops and restaurants I knew as a child still exist. My favourite shop for 
musical scores isBauer & Hieber <http://muenchen.bauer-hieber.com/>, and the 
staff in theLudwig Beck store’s <http://kaufhaus.ludwigbeck.de/kaufhaus/musik/> 
record department – some of whom have been there for 20 years – have amazing 
knowledge.

If you want to experience Munich at its best, visit one of the beer gardens, 
where they grillsteckerlfisch and spare ribs. The moment the weather starts to 
change for the better in spring, people flock to them.

It’s funny, but people here don’t see me as German – and in Japan I’m not seen 
as Japanese. My father is German and my mother Japanese. The city has a 
surprisingly big Japanese community, with two Japanese schools, but I only went 
to a Japanese Saturday school.

My favourite areas of Munich are the Glockenbach quarter and the very bohemian 
Schwabing area. Both have lots of interesting cafes and independent shops. For 
brunch or tea, go toCotidiano – The Bakery Restaurant 
<https://www.facebook.com/RestaurantCotidiano> in Glockenbach. In Schwabing, I 
go toI Love Leo <http://iloveleo.de/> for frozen yoghurt and, for clothes, 
Mohrmann Basics <http://www.nicolemohrmann.com/our-stores-stores-muenchen>, 
which also has a cosy cafe and wonderful accessories.

My favourite view of the city is the one you get while sitting next to the two 
stone lions on the stairs of Odeonsplatz and looking down Ludwig Street, 
especially after sunset when the city lights illuminate the streets.An hour out 
of Munich towards the south-west you come across five lakes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/14/top-10-lake-holidays-bavaria-munich-germany>
, of which the most famous is the Chiemsee, where Ludwig II drowned. My parents 
live there and the landscape is indescribably beautiful. It’s my hideaway and 
the place I go to recharge my batteries.
