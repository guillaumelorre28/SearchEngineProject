Coutinho has not played since he suffered ankle ligament damage 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/28/philippe-coutinho-liverpool-out-six-weeks-ankle-injury>
 during the win over Sunderland at the end of November and Klopp, who has seen 
his side pick up three wins and a draw from their last five Premier League 
matches, admitted he will not rush the 24-year-old back too soon.

Asked if Coutinho will feature against City at Anfield, he replied: “No, but 
he’s in a good way. The City game for sure is too early, pretty sure the 
Sunderland game is too early too.”

Liverpool <https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool> will also be 
without Matip as he continues his rehabilitation from an ankle injury when they 
host Pep Guardiola’s side. Klopp’s results against the City manager have been 
as good as anyone’s with four victories – albeit three in cup competitions – in 
eight meetings during their time in the Bundesliga.

Klopp insists recent history counts for nothing but accepts that in Guardiola, 
City have a man of huge influence.

“We know everything about how Pep played with Bayern but that is not important 
any more because it is different players and different systems,” said the 
Liverpool manager, whose record against City since arriving last season is two 
resounding league wins and a Capital One Cup final defeat on penalties.

“We are a different team so at this moment both sides cannot be sure which 
idea the other team has.

“It is not that we have a look back at the last few games against Pep Guardiola
 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/pep-guardiola> because our teams don’t 
play each other.

“In Holland it was Johan Cruyff and Total Football. He [Guardiola] was very 
nearly perfect with Barcelona, he had a big influence with Bayern and changed 
their style completely.

“He is an outstanding manager 100%. I am not interested too much in giving 
things a name but you can see on the pitch he is an influential manager.

“He has a clear idea and a pretty much good idea. He has had a fantastic 
career until now.

“He had a nice style with Barcelona and was really good with Bayern and now he 
is at City and he is there to be successful and not to show how good he is. 
That is how we all are. We want to help our team.

“He is very influential but the Barcelona style is not possible for each team 
to play. It depends a lot on the players you have. If a Sunday morning team 
tried to play like Barcelona it would be pretty difficult.

“You always adapt to your players and that is what he is doing and it is what 
we do.”

Klopp also dismissed reports that he is interested in signing Arsenal 
midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/28/liverpool-consider-january-move-arsenal-alex-oxlade-chamberlain>
 in January.

“I don’t usually say anything about transfer rumours but I can make an 
exception. Nonsense,” he said.

“This kind of thing I think a lot about but I say nothing because it is really 
not interesting what I think about this.

“You [the media] are already on a path so do with it what you want but from 
our side nothing else to say about it.”
