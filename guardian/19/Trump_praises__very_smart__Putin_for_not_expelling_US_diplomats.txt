Vladimir Putin has refused to engage in tit-for-tat diplomacy after the US 
expelled 35 Russian diplomats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/30/us-expulsions-put-spotlight-on-russias-gru-intelligence-agency>
 amid a row over cyber-hacking.

Just hours after the Russian foreign minster said he was recommending a 
symmetrical response, Putin said his country had every right to make such a 
move but that he would not “drop to this level of irresponsible diplomacy”.

He said his government would instead wait to see how relations developed under 
the incoming president,Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>, who later described the 
Russian leader in a tweet as “very smart”.

“We will make further steps to help resurrect Russian-American relations based 
on the policies that the administration of Trump will pursue,” the Russian 
president said in a statement on the Kremlin’s website.

Putin, mindful that Trump will be in the White House in just three weeks, went 
on in an almost teasing way to wishBarack Obama 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama> and his family, and Trump 
and the American people a happy new year. He invited “all the children of 
American diplomats accredited in Russia to the New Year and Christmas 
celebrations in the Kremlin”.


His stance appeared to be warmly welcomed by the president-elect.

Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!

Putin’s pointedly magnanimous intervention came after a day in which Russian 
officials launched increasingly angry invective at Barack Obama and his 
administration.

On Thursday, the outgoing US administration had announced a package of 
measures targetingRussia <https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia> in 
retaliation for cyber-attacks US intelligence agencies believe were directed by 
Moscow to help Trump get elected. Russian officials have repeatedly denied the 
claims.


Sanctions were placed on Russia’s GRU and FSB intelligence services, and 
individuals and companies linked to them, while35 diplomats the US believes are 
engaging in espionage were given 72 hours to leave the country 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/29/barack-obama-sanctions-russia-election-hack>
.

Maria Zakharova, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, launched a stinging attack on 
the outgoing US administration, writing on Facebook: “The people who have spent 
eight years in the White House are not an administration – they are a group of 
foreign policy losers, embittered and shortsighted. Today, Obama officially 
proved this.”

Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, wrote on Facebook: “It is 
regrettable that the Obama administration, which started out by restoring our 
ties, is ending its term in an anti-Russia agony. RIP.” The Russian embassy in 
London tweeted a picture of a duck with the word “lame” written on it, and 
called theObama administration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/obama-administration> “hapless”.

But Putin’s response was surprisingly measured. He said any Russian 
retaliation would be postponed in the hope that bilateral relations improve 
when Trump takes office in January.

Diplomatic expulsions are normally met with reciprocal action, and the stage 
seemed set for a strong Russian response. In 2001, the George W Bush 
administrationexpelled 51 Russian diplomats 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/22/russia.usa> it said were spies. 
Russia responded by telling 50 US diplomats to leave Russia.

US will retaliate against Russia over election hacking, Barack Obama says on 16

“Reciprocity is the law in diplomacy and international relations,” Russia’s 
foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said before Putin’s statement. Lavrov said he 
was recommending that Putin order the expulsion of 31 diplomats from the US 
embassy in Moscow and four from the consulate in St Petersburg.

Lavrov also suggested Russia would cut off the use of a warehouse in Moscow 
and an embassy dacha on the outskirts of the Russian capital, in response to US 
moves to deny Russia access to two recreational compounds in the US.

However, Putin said this too would not happen for now. “We are not going to 
make problems for American diplomats. We are not going to expel anyone. We are 
not going to forbid their families and children from using their usual 
relaxation places during the new year’s holidays,” Putin said.

Russian officials were widely quoted praising Putin’s “wise” move and hoping 
for better relations under a Trump presidency. Sergei Zheleznyak, an MP and 
member of the foreign affairs committee, called Obama a “bad Santa” and said he 
wanted to “ruin the holiday period for lots of people”.

Russia plans to send a special government plane to the US to pick up the 
diplomats affected by the expulsion order. Earlier, a diplomatic source told 
Interfax that many of those affected were struggling to find tickets back to 
Russia as planes were full because of the holidays. The foreign ministry said 
96 Russians, including the 35 diplomats and their family members, were being 
forced to leave the US.


US intelligence services believe Russia ordered cyber-attacks on the 
Democratic National Committee 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/16/barack-obama-final-press-conference-election-hacking>
, Hillary Clinton’s campaign and other political organisations, in an attempt 
to influence the election in favour of Trump. Russia’s military intelligence 
agency, the GRU, has been at the centre of the accusations.

Whistleblower Edward Snowden, who now lives in Russia, wrote on Twitter 
<https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/814877772191592448> that the evidence 
against the country released so far was insufficiently persuasive and called on 
US authorities to release more.

“Few techs doubt that Russians could have a hand in hacks, but public policy 
requires public evidence. Trump can’t roll back declassification,” wrote 
Snowden.

While denying accusations of interference, Putin claimed last week to have 
always known Trump would win.

“Nobody believed he’d win. Except us, of course. We always believed,” he said, 
during his annual press conference 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/23/vladimir-putin-defeated-democrats-blame-game-not-very-dignified-trump>
. Putin has praised Trump and expressed cautious optimism that relations could 
improve when he enters the White House.

Trump will now have to decide how to calibrate his Russia policy when he 
enters the White House. He has previously brushed off criticism over his 
fawning attitude towards Putin, and his tone was not changed by the recent US 
intelligence assessments of interference.


In a statement earlier this month, Trump said he had received a “very nice 
letter” from Putin wishing him a happy Christmas, and said Putin’s “thoughts 
are so correct” on the need to improve bilateral relations. Trump has also 
voiced approval of Russia’s intervention in Syria.

Trump has dismissed reports of Russian interference 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/11/donald-trump-cia-russia-election-ridiculous>
 in the election. On Thursday, he said: “It’s time for our country to move on 
to bigger and better things.”

He added, however, that “in the interest of our country and its great people, 
I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be 
updated on the facts of this situation”.

Thursday’s expulsion is the latest in a long line of diplomatic incidents

diplomat in Moscow by a Russian police officer. Washington says it is the 
latest incident in an escalating campaign of harassment against US embassy 
staff “in an effort to disrupt our diplomatic and consular operations”.Russia

Russia expels a US embassy employee, Ryan Fogle

after parading him on state TV claiming he was a CIA spy who had been trying to 
recruit a Russian counter-terrorism officer.

Days later, the FSB names a man it says is the CIA station chief in Moscow 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/17/russia-reveal-identity-cia-moscow-chief>
, in what appears to be a calculated snub to Washington, weeks after the two 
countries agreed to share intelligence over the Boston marathon bombers, who 
had roots in Russia’s north Caucasus region.
