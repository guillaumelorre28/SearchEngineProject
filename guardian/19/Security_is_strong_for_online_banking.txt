I was extremely concerned by your articles that used Cardiff University's 
research to suggest that one of HSBC's internet banking security controls is 
flawed (Security flaw leaves 3m HSBC online accounts open to fraud, August 10; 
HSBC knew about security loophole in online banking, August 11). This was 
inaccurate and while the correction published today addresses some of our 
concerns, I would like to reassure readers of the strength of HSBC's security 
systems.

Our records show that HSBC has one of the lowest online fraud rates across all 
UK banks. The research did not take into account the full range of defences 
used by HSBC. In our opinion, if these had been reflected properly, they would 
illustrate that the bank's controls are at least as strong as those of other 
major banks.

In a world of ever-changing technology, we continually improve our fraud 
detection capabilities - many of which will not be visible to our customers. We 
remain committed to providing secure internet banking services and, during 2006 
alone, the HSBC Group plans to spend more than $5bn (Â£2.6bn) on IT. In 
addition, HSBC is an active sponsor of the government's Get Safe Online 
initiative. Online users who follow the advice available to them should not be 
vulnerable to this or other such threats.
