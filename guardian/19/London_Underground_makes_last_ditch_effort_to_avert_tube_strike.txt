The move came on the fourth day of talks between the company and officials 
from the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and theTransport 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport> Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA). 
No details were given of the offer.

Union members are due to walk out for 24 hours from 6pm on Sunday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/22/london-underground-tube-staff-24-hour-strike-new-year>
 in a dispute over jobs and ticket office closures.

The TSSA said it will consult with its representatives overnight before 
deciding whether to call off the action. TheRMT 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/rmt> delegation had left the meeting at 
Acas, the conciliation service, before the offer was made.

In a message to RMT members, regional organiser John Leach said that the talks 
had “failed” and the strike will go ahead. “We saw LU face to face and 
reiterated our position on the key issues of the dispute. We demanded that they 
guarantee the staffing of all station control rooms. We demanded that the 
current offer of 150 additional jobs be significantly improved and guaranteed 
to not be lowered under any circumstances.

“LU’s response was to repeat their offer of yesterday. This is just not 
acceptable. The unsafe practices and pressure on staff and passengers have to 
be resisted and will be.”

An RMT spokesman told the Press Association that the hundreds of job cuts 
agreed by Boris Johnson, London’s former mayor, had been a “disaster” and 
should be reversed. “The cuts have gone too far and it is the staff who are 
highlighting the impact on moving millions of people every day.”

A spokesman for the RMT said more than 800 jobs had been lost under the 
so-called Fit for the Future programme, adding that LU was only offering to 
reinstate 150. The RMT added thatLondon <https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> 
Underground was refusing to reopen any of the closed ticket offices.

The TSSA’s general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said: “London Underground [has] 
made us a new offer. We will now share its contents with our reps and seek 
their views overnight.”

A spokesman for Transport for London said: “Talks have concluded for the day. 
We have made a proposal to the unions and we await their response.”

The RMT has more members on the tube than the TSSA. 

Transport for London has advised passengers that there will be a severely 
reduced service across the tube network on Sunday evening and all day on Monday 
if the strike goes ahead.

An Acas spokesman said: “Talks have now adjourned. The parties have no plans 
to return to Acas.”
