The number of City financiers who were paid more than €1m (£800,000) per year 
jumped to nearly 3,000 in 2014, with one earning up to €25m.

The European Banking <https://www.theguardian.com/business/banking> Authority 
(EBA) said the UK, with the Europe’s biggest financial centre in London, had 
more than three times as many high-earning bankers as the rest of the EU 
combined.

 Critics of high pay said the soaring wages showed little has been learned 
from the financial crisis.

The regulator’s data 
<http://www.eba.europa.eu/-/eba-reports-on-high-earners-and-the-effects-of-the-bonus-cap>
 showed that the number of high earners across the EU rose 21.6% to 3,865 in 
2014, from 3,178 in 2013. The majority – 2,429 – worked in investment banking. 
It was the first year when the EU bonus cap was implemented and new EBA rules 
on banks reporting staff remuneration took effect.

The overall increase was driven by a 40% leap in the number of high earners in 
the UK, to 2,926 from 2,086, which partly reflected exchange rate effects as 
most City bankers are paid in sterling.

Stripping out currency effects, the increase would have been 16%, or 339, more 
high earners in the UK. The EBA put this down to banks making higher net 
profits.

The soaring number of high earners drew criticism from the Trades Union 
Congress, which said the increase did not reflect the economic reality for most 
people.

“These are staggering numbers – for parts of the banking sector, it’s like the 
credit crunch never happened,” said a spokesman.

“It would be easier to understand if there was evidence that the activities of 
the banks were supporting stronger growth, stronger manufacturing, higher 
productivity and better wages across the board.

“But instead the economy has seriously underperformed across all these areas.”

Paul Marsland, deputy director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said efforts 
to address risky behaviour in the financial world were having little effect.

“It’s no surprise really to see London, as the main financial centre in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, with the heaviest number of 
people covered by these regulations,” he said.

“But it is a surprise to see the numbers increasing at the rate they are, 
given that the rules that have given us this information are aimed at jobs with 
an element of risk-taking.

“The fact that these are predominantly investment banking jobs seems to 
suggest that the riskier nature of their work is alive and kicking. Given the 
uncertainty of the economic climate, it’s a surprise to see that expanding.”

In Germany, the number of high-earning bankers fell to 242 from 397, mainly 
due to a decline at subsidiaries or branches of UK firms in Germany. In all 
other countries, the number remained broadly stable.

The London-based regulator’s data showed 16 people at financial firms based in 
Britain were paid more than €10m in 2014, with one earning €24m-€25m.

Since the bonus cap was introduced in 2014, limiting bankers’ bonuses to 100% 
of salary, or 200% if shareholders approve, the UK and France have implemented 
waivers.

The UK has excluded hundreds of smaller, less risky firms

 such as asset managers and brokers, the EBA found in December, and supports 
amending the EU directive to exclude small firms from the bonus cap across the 
trading bloc.

The regulator said the introduction of the bonus cap had led EU banks to shift 
remuneration towards fixed salaries. As a result, the average ratio between 
variable and fixed pay for high earners more than halved to 127% in 2014 from 
317% in 2013.

This had little impact on banks’ costs and financial stability, the regulator 
found, contrary to the fears they voiced ahead of the change.

The EBA’s Bernd Rummel said: “The banks said during the consultation of EBA 
guidelines that the bonus cap would be very negative for them in terms of cost 
flexibility and financial stability.

“We analysed this and found that there was only a small increase in the fixed 
administrative cost. There was no big impact on the financial stability or cost 
flexibility.”
