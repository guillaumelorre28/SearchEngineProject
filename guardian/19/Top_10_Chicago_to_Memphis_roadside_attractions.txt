Historic Auto Attractions – Roscoe, Illinois

This museum, one of the most surprising in America, is in an obscure 
industrial park because its owner, Wayne Lensing, works across the street and 
wants to be close to his collection. And what a collection! Much more than 
vintage and movie cars, Historic Auto Attractions has everything from the death 
hats of Bonnie and Clyde to a pair of eyeglasses destroyed by Elvis in a "fit 
of rage", according to its accompanying sign. An entire gallery is devoted to 
the Kennedy assassination, displaying a section of the fence that stood on the 
grassy knoll, and the window next to the window where Lee Harvey Oswald 
supposedly fired the fatal shot.

Mini-Golf in Funeral Home – Palatine, Illinois
 Mini golf funeral home 
Since the late 1960s, the Ahlgrim Family Funeral Home, in a suburb of Chicago, 
has offered a bonus unmatched by any other undertaker: a nine-hole miniature 
golf course in its basement. Named "Ahlgrim Acres", it includes obstacles such 
as caskets and headstones, with a one-stroke penalty for bypassing the coffin 
on hole 2. Screams and spooky music play continually. Miniature golf is offered 
by Ahlgrim's as a standard part of its funeral package – but anyone can stop by 
and play, as long as a funeral or viewing isn't in progress.

McDonald's Museum and Store Number 1 – Des Plains, Illinois

Most of America's early burger huts and milkshake palaces have been 
demolished. But McDonald's kept the property where franchise Store Number 1 
opened in April 1955, and has restored it from original blueprints. Now a 
museum, golden arches soar over its glass/metal/red-and-white tiled exterior. 
The entrance sign is an original, complete with early bun-faced cartoon mascot 
"Speedee". You can peek through the order windows in front (there was no 
seating in that era) and see original fry vats, milkshake "multi-mixers", soda 
barrels, and a crew of male mannequins in 1950s uniforms.

John Dillinger Museum – Hammond, Indiana

The world's largest assemblage of relics from bank robber John Dillinger is on 
display in a museum in an Indiana state Welcome Center. Originally curated by 
Joe Pinkston (who later died under strange circumstances), the museum contains 
one-of-a-kind treasures such as Dillinger's original tombstone – chipped to 
pieces by souvenir-hunters – and his stained trousers of death. Gory tableaux 
from Joe's original museum also survive, and include a reproduction of the 
blood-splattered morgue where Dillinger's body lay, looking appropriately waxy. 
Caution signs warn the squeamish to avert their eyes.

Dan Quayle Vice-Presidential Museum – Huntington, Indiana

Vice-President Dan Quayle (in office 1989-1993) was widely regarded as one of 
the least apt people to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. But he will 
never be forgotten thanks to his hometown museum, which has grown over the 
years to include exhibits about all of America's VPs, who, frankly, are an 
often-obscure bunch. (Quick: who was Abraham Lincoln's first vice-president?) 
The Spiro Agnew trash can is one highlight (he was Nixon's VP), as is Quayle's 
law degree, partly chewed by the family dog. It's a place that everyone should 
visit, yet you may find that you are its only customer.
• 815 Warren Street, +1 260 356 6356, quaylemuseum.org

The Creation Museum – Petersburg, Kentucky

Far more than the story of the biblical flood, the Creation Museum is a 
multi-million-dollar effort to convey a belief system that includes everything 
from dinosaurs as passengers on Noah's Ark to weeds as a byproduct of Eve 
tempting Adam. Along the way you'll encounter condemnations of the Scopes 
Monkey Trial, the movie Inherit the Wind, and the culture of modern-day 
"relative morality" – and that's all before you even get to the Garden of Eden 
with its vegetarian raptors. It's a lot to absorb, but the casual tourist soon 
realises that most visitors to the Creation Museum already know what it has to 
say.
• 2800 Bullittsburg Church Road, +1 888 582 4253, creationmuseum.org 
<http://creationmuseum.org/>. Mon-Fri 10am-6pm, Sat 9am-6pm, Sun 12 noon-6pm. 
Adults (13-59) $29.95, seniors (60 and up) $23.95, children (five-12) $15.95,

Wigwam Village Motel – Cave City, Kentucky
 Photograph: Alamy 
Who wouldn't want to spend a night in a classic Native American-style shelter, 
especially one made of cement? Built in 1937, this Wigwam Village Motel is one 
of a very few surviving "teepee-style" motels from tourism's Golden Era. 
Fourteen wigwam units are arrayed in a semicircle, facing a gift shop and guest 
registration teepee. Steam heat, tile baths, cable TV, a large playground, 
picnic tables and grills, no pets allowed. Builder Frank A Redford said he 
found his inspiration in authentic Sioux reservation teepees and in roadside 
snack stands shaped like giant ice-cream cones.

Buford Pusser "Walking Tall" Home and Museum – Adamsville, Tennessee
 Photograph: Alamy 
Buford was the Big-Stick-carrying sheriff who inspired the Walking Tall films 
of the early 1970s. He was shot, stabbed, beaten, blown up and run over. His 
wife was murdered. He wrestled a bear (and won). Buford was unstoppable – until 
his new car mysteriously crashed and exploded in 1974. His home has been turned 
into a posthumous walk-through shrine, where everyday items have become 
museum-worthy: Buford's dart board; his collection of eight-track tapes; his 
turquoise toilet. Add these mementoes to the relics of Buford's bloody career, 
and the artefacts of his violent end (including his death car), and you have a 
home tour unlike any other.

Billy Tripp's Mindfield – Brownsville, Tennessee
 Billy Tripp's Minefield 
The Mindfield resembles an immense electrical substation or wayward theme-park 
rollercoaster. Towering 13 storeys high above the small, quiet Main Street of 
downtown Brownsville, the Mindfield is the largest work of art in Tennessee and 
certainly one of the top 10 in the United States. Artist and welder Billy Tripp 
has painted this vertical mass of salvaged iron and steel a monotone battleship 
gray – his favourite colour – and makes no effort to explain it to anyone. 
Billy intends to keep building the Mindfield until he dies, which should give 
him decades to add to it.

Mud Island – Memphis, Tennessee
 Photograph: Timothy O'Keefe/Getty Images 
Memphis is famous for Beale Street, the Civil Rights Museum and Elvis, but the 
charms of its Mud Island are often overlooked. Its main draw is Riverwalk, an 
outdoor, 2,000ft scale model of the lower half of the Mississippi River. Every 
sandbar and topographic contour is faithfully reproduced in cement. The river, 
a little stream, flows lazily past minimalist cities and bridges rendered in 
steel. Visitors often remove their shoes and slog their way along the entire 
mini-1,000 miles like striding Gullivers (each footstep equals roughly one 
mile). The river twists, turns and finally empties into a large "Gulf of 
Mexico", where exhausted Riverwalkers can rent pedal boats shaped like swans.
• 125 North Front Street, +1 901 576 7241, mudisland.com 
<http://mudisland.com/>. Open April-Oct, Tues-Sun 10am-5pm. Free if you walk 
across the bridge, $4 per passenger to take the monorail
