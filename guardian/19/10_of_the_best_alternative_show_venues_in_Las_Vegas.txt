Onyx Theatre

Not too many people will visit an erstwhile shopping centre famous for its sex 
clubs just to take in a local stage production. Well, they're missing out. The 
Onyx Theatre is one of the few joints in Las Vegas that regularly showcases 
professional fringe theatre – all in a cozy 96-seat venue behind a gay-leaning 
fetish store; there's a separate entrance for the sheepish. Whether it's a 
live-action version of cult horror film theEvil Dead 
<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083907/>, drag-queen-cast parodies such as The 
Silence of the Clams, imported productions, original plays or improvisational 
comedy, the alternative offerings at Onyx regularly make an impression.

Zumanity Theatre

Despite being the main drag, the Strip – and its headliner shows in particular 
– rarely exudes the sort of sexuality and brazenness one might expect. 
Zumanity, Cirque du Soleil's adult offering, is a notable exception. A blend of 
cabaret acts, burlesque exhibitionism, bawdy audience participation skits and 
Cirque-style acrobatics, Zumanity is the lone production inside the custom-made 
Zumanity Theatre. The design of the theatre allows unsuspecting patrons to 
almost encircle the nearly naked performers.

and 10pm, tickets $69-$129

Locals have been recommending the truly outrageous, multiact production 
Absinthe to their visiting loved ones since its opening. Perhaps it's the 
spinning rollerskate couple breaking the speed limit on a platform the size of 
a breakfast table. Perhaps it's the potty-mouthed performers – led by the 
boorish MC/producer, the Gazillionaire – that would embarrass even the bluest 
comedian. Or perhaps it's the layout of the throwback-style tent, guests 
sitting in the round – close enough to be the target of the Gazillionaire's 
insults or, conversely, his affection.

Crazy Horse Cabaret
 Crazy Horse Cabaret, Las Vegas. 
Crazy Horse Paris is a tasteful update of the traditional Las Vegas topless 
show. It's also on loan from France; even its theatre is a knockoff of the 
Parisian one. Guests sit at long, narrow tables in front of a low-ceilinged 
stage that complements the intimacy of the theatre. On stage, beautiful and 
professionally trained dancers move in tandem with light projections that 
simultaneously accentuate and shadow parts of their bodies. It's as much about 
what's being suggested as what's being flashed, making sexiness elegant – and 
mysterious – once again.

Harmon Theater
 The Amazing Johnathan at the Harmon Theater. 
By night, it's a gay nightclub called Krave. But get there a few hours 
earlier, and you'll find seats on that large dancefloor. Though shows have come 
and gone at the Harmon Theater over the years, it has one steady headliner that 
gets the queues rivalling those of Krave: The Amazing Johnathan, an offbeat and 
often unpredictable magician/comedian who, among other things, indulges in the 
illusion of (graphic) self-mutilation to shock his audience. And speaking of 
unpredictable, the adjacent lounge also hosts a hypnosis show.

Theatre 7
 Theatre 7, Las Vegas. 
Comfort isn't typically a concern of alternative culture and at the upstart 
Theatre 7 amenities are scant: folding chairs, a modestly-sized projection 
screen, random art covering the side walls. However, its spartan digs are as 
do-it-yourself as its diverse, cutting-edge calendar, typically rounded out by 
premieres of features by local filmmakers, niche movie festivals, live theatre 
and related events. If there was ever a home for gritty, kitschy entertainment 
in modern day Vegas, it's Theatre 7.

Sci-Fi Screening Room

Screening Room. Photograph: c.IFC Films/Everett/Rex Features 
As with the Onyx Theatre, the Screening Room is merely a space within a retail 
complex: The Sci-Fi Center, a one-stop shop for cult film and television 
contraband. You're not going to find reclining theatre chairs or 
state-of-the-art projection systems but it's beloved by geeks who enjoy horror, 
sci-fi and B-movie fare. Here you'll see troupes perform alongside screenings 
of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Repo! The Genetic Opera. Fans of Doctor 
Who can catch episodes at the Screening Room at least twice a month. And 
nowhere else in town would dare show gross-out flick The Human Centipede – or 
its sequel, the demand for which necessitated multiple screenings throughout 
the Halloween weekend.

The Improv at Harrah's

As if the parade of freaks on the Strip wasn't enough fodder for laughter, 
there's always the more conventional parade of standup comedians playing the 
casinos on any given day. The city's oldest comedy club, the Improv, opens 
every day but Monday, and the programme is consistent even when the level of 
hilarity isn't: a headliner, two support acts and a host to keep the hour-long 
show moving along. It's all done in front of the iconic brick wall made famous 
by the pioneering New York and Los Angeles improv clubs, with the same minimal 
interior lighting that can release the heckler in all of us.

V Theater
 Gregory Popovich's Comedy Pet Theater. 
At first look, the marquee roster at V Theater looks like the Island of Misfit 
Shows but through bargain pricing and a something-for-everyone booking policy, 
the eight-year-old theatre has managed to establish a niche for itself among 
the multimillion-dollar mainstream productions with which it competes. From the 
kid-friendly Popovich's Comedy Pet Theatre – rope-skipping dogs! cats on 
parallel bars! – to the long-running Tony and Tina's Wedding dinner show and 
the comedy/mindreading TV phenomenon The Mentalist, even the fussiest showgoer 
will come away entertained.

Insurgo Theater

Of all the new amenities included in the recent renovation of the enduring 
Plaza hotel-casino downtown, only one raised eyebrows: Insurgo Theater, the 
smaller of the two performance spaces inside the property, and the second 
incarnation for gonzo local troupe Insurgo Theater Movement. The newer one has 
traded theatre seats for candlelit tables, and now boasts a real stage – one 
where Insurgo can continue reinterpreting the classics (Shakespeare, Beckett's 
Waiting For Godot) and gleefully bastardise the improvisational/sketch comedy 
artform with its late show on Friday nights, Motherfuppets.
