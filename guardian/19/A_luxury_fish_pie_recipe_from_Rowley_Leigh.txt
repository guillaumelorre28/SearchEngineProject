I grew up all over. I was born in Manchester but we lived in Bedfordshire, 
Gloucestershire, Northern Ireland – there were many childhood homes. The 
idyllic one was the last of these, a large house on a 10-acre plot of land, 
eight miles north of Belfast. I was four when we moved in and we stayed there 
for five years.

It was an odd house – it looked much smaller from the drive than it actually 
was. It wasn’t a mansion or a stately home, but it was a gentleman’s residence, 
and to me it seemed huge.

It was another world back then. I was only six but I would walk alone across 
the river to school. And children were let off school early in the summer to 
make hay.

I had three siblings, two of whom were older than me. We were reasonably 
close, but I was fairly solitary. I liked reading, and collecting things. I 
remember our rumpus room: it had been the kitchen, with large flagstones and a 
boiler, but otherwise was quite empty. We spent a lot of time playing in there, 
but mostly we played outside. It was Northern Ireland, so it was fairly wet, 
but I don’t remember it raining. The garden was huge, there were streams and 
fields. We were always building huts and playing on the swing over the river. 
We never went on holiday. We just played.

My mother was an enthusiastic, somewhat unconventional cook. My father needed 
– expected – a proper meal, three times a day. His mother was supposed to have 
been an exceptional Lancashire cook, and my mum had to survive under that 
shadow. So she never tried to do the conventionalEnglish things, but she did 
make fairly straightforward meals: scrag end of mutton with pearl barley at 
least once a week, lamb’s liver, herrings in oatmeal … As a treat we’d have 
pheasant with bread sauce and bacon, with brussels sprouts on the side. We 
probably had fish on Fridays, a hangover from my mother’s Catholic upbringing.

Her fish pie was a family favourite. She used a mixture of fresh and smoked 
fish – not smoked salmon, because that was rather special, but cod, or haddock, 
which was always bright yellow in those days. And fresh cod too, which was the 
cheapest available. She always put hardboiled eggs in it, and – 
unconventionally – sliced tomatoes, then plenty of white sauce and mashed 
potato on top. When I was working in Hong Kong a few years ago, I put a fish 
pie on the menu, and it was the one thing that everyone loved, Chinese and 
expats both. I didn’t put any sliced tomatoes in it, and I rather regret that 
now.

A luxurious fish pie

The tomatoes are a personal idiosyncrasy – discard at your pleasure. If using, 
it is worth drying them out so that they don’t make the pie watery.

Serves 6
For the sauce 
50g butter
40g plain flour
500ml milk
500g white fish bones (a cod head is ideal)
½ onion, thinly sliced
3 cloves
1 bay leaf
10 black peppercorns
125ml double cream

For the pie
3 tomatoes
750g potatoes
100ml milk
50g butter
2 egg yolks
200g salmon fillet
200g smoked haddock
200g cod or pollock
6 scallops
12 large raw prawns
6 eggs, hardboiled and quartered
2 tbsp chopped parsley

1 Melt the butter in a large saucepan, add the flour and cook to a sandy roux 
for a minute. Add a little of the milk to make a smooth paste before adding the 
remainder, whisking well as it comes to the boil. Add all the remaining 
ingredients except the cream. Cook for 40 minutes on an extremely gentle heat. 
Add the cream and then pass immediately through a fine sieve.

2 Blanch the tomatoes in boiling water, refresh in cold water and peel. Cut 
into thick slices. Lay on kitchen paper with a good sprinkle of salt for 30 
minutes.

3 Peel and cut the potatoes into smallish chunks. Cover with cold water with a 
teaspoon of salt. Bring to the boil, cook and pass through amouli food mill 
<http://mouli.co.uk/20cm-medium-mouli-food-mill-3-heavy-duty-blades/>. Put back 
on the stove, add milk and butter. Take off the heat, and beat in the egg yolks.

4 Cut the fish into bite-size chunks. Season and mix with the scallops, 
prawns, quartered eggs, parsley and sauce. Lay the tomatoes across the top. Top 
the pie with the mashed potato, a spatula and a fork to produce little hillocks 
will suffice. Bake at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 30 minutes. Serve with a green 
salad.
