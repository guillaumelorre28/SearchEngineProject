, investors across Asia turned cautious on Friday on fears that Trump could 
stifle access to the world’s biggest economy and that his expansionist fiscal 
plans could fire inflation at home and higher US interest rates.

The greenback almost hit 107 yen for the first time since July in US trade and 
it maintained most of the gains in Asia, sitting at 106.62 yen – well up from 
the 101.20 yen touched in the initial panic of Trump’s win.

China fixed its yuan reference rate beyond 6.8 against the dollar for the 
first time in more than six years, with analysts warning the unit could drop 
further raising more concerns about currency wars.


The South Korean won was 1.6% lower after the country’s central bank held 
interest rates at record lows.

Across the Pacific, the Mexican peso fell back towards record lows on worries 
about the Trump’s anti-Mexico stance. The dollar was also up 3.3% at 20.64 
Mexican pesos, close to its all-time highs.

After an initial shock, global equities rocketed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/stock-markets-defy-predictions-of-slump-after-trump-victory>
 on news Trump had beaten Hillary Clinton, with investors hoping for 
business-friendly policies and measures to boost the US economy, a key driver 
of world growth.

However, there are worries about his plans after saying he will tear up 
several trade deals while ramping up import duties.

And expectations that Trump’s plans for huge spending projects will fan prices 
have lit a fire under the dollar as dealers bet the Federal Reserve will hike 
borrowing costs more aggressively to keep prices under control.

That in turn has led to fears of huge capital outflows from Asia Pacific

The peso – as well as the Mexican stock market – has been hammered by fears 
Trump will follow through on campaign pledges to renegotiate the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as pressure the country to pay billions 
of dollars for a giant border wall.

“The dollar is up against most major currencies supported by an upward 
revision to US interest expectations and focus on Trump’s pro-growth and 
inflationary economic policies,” Elias Haddad, a senior currency strategist at 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, told Bloomberg News.

“Trump’s economic policies will force the Fed to raise the funds rate at a 
faster pace than otherwise, which [will push the dollar up].”

On equities markets, investors sent Hong Kong 1.5% lower and Seoul 0.9% down, 
while Taipei, Manila and Jakarta were all down around 2%.

The Nikkei in Japan bucked the trend as the weaker yen boosted exporters, 
although it was down from earlier highs. The CSi300 in Shanghai was up 0.2% and 
Australia’s ASX/S&P200 put on 0.3%.

Oil prices fell in early trading on Friday, as the market refocused on a 
persistent supply overhang that is not expected to abate unless Opec and other 
producers make a significant cut to their output.

Brent crude futures were trading at $45.74 per barrel at 0445 GMT, down 10c, 
or 0.2%, from their last close.

Copper, in contrast, soared 5% to a 16-month high as speculation that US 
infrastructure spending could jump under a Republican administration unleashed 
a wave of interest in industrial metals.

Zinc hit a five-and-a-half-year peak and nickel was at its highest since July 
2015.
