Jocelyn Rae is the fourth member of Keothavong’s first squad, with the Lawn 
Tennis <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/tennis> Association leaving its 
options open for the final slot.

Keothavong took over from Judy Murray in December, and backed Konta as a real 
threat in the line-up.

“In Johanna Konta <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/johanna-konta> we are 
lucky to have a player who is at the very top of the game right now, and she 
will make a formidable opponent for any player,” said Keothavong. “Along with 
Jo we have fantastic experience in Heather and Laura, with nearly 40 Fed Cup 
rubbers between them, and Joss Rae gives us a strong doubles option.

“There are some great personalities in this line-up and a robust team spirit 
will be key to supporting us through this tricky format.

“We are not underestimating the challenge in front of us, there are strong 
nations in this group, and our ambition has to be to progress and take this 
team where it belongs, into the World Group.”

The draw for the Europe/Africa Zone Group One round-robin takes place on 16 
January, with matches held from 8 to 10 February. Pool winners will then 
contest promotion play-offs on 11 February, with victorious nations then 
progressing to World Group Two play-offs in April.
