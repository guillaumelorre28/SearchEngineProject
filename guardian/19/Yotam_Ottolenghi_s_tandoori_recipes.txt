The idea of kids’ food or teenage cooking is not a natural one for me. When I 
was growing up, I simply wanted to eat what my parents were cooking: there just 
wasn’t the option (or desire) for a separate and bespoke service. It’s only in 
recent years that I’ve realised how lucky I was to take this togetherness for 
granted. For many people, feeding children can be complex – traumatic, even – 
but I’m yet to be convinced that having a kids’ menu in a restaurant, or 
routinely offering to cook something different, is the way forward.

It’s the same with cooking. If you grow up regarding it as something that only 
grown-ups do, it’s no wonder so many teenagers come to “proper” cooking really 
late in life. I find it amazing that we’ll happily teach our teenagers to drive 
a car before a lot of them know how to work the oven.

 A young Yotam. 
I’m not suggesting that, out of the blue, you ask your 16-year-old to whip up 
a tandoori paste, rub it over a chicken and make Sunday lunch; but for any 
curry-loving teenager, the possibility should not be dismissed out of hand. 
Making things yourself – seeing the ingredients, how they are combined, why the 
end result looks the way it does – helps demystify the cooking process. If you 
can read, you can cook. And if you can cook, chances are you’ll be more 
receptive to trying out a much wider range of foods than teenagers are often 
given credit for.

Tandoori paste

This takes less than 10 minutes to make, and keeps well in the fridge for at 
least three weeks. These quantities make about 300g paste, so there’ll more 
than enough to make all three of today’s recipes. It’s easily doubled (or 
more), if you want to try it out on other things: on cubes of tofu or paneer, 
say, or root vegetables for roasting. The paste also works well as a curry 
base: just mix some with plain yoghurt and use as a marinade for cubes of meat 
or fish before they are grilled.


4 Kashmiri dried red chillies 
2 tsp cumin seeds
4 tsp coriander seeds
2 tsp black peppercorns
20 cardamom pods
2 small cinnamon sticks 
2 tbsp paprika
2 tbsp tomato paste (40g)
½ tsp ground turmeric
2 tsp mustard powder
1 tsp ground nutmeg
6cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
2 large garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
2 tsp honey
60ml vegetable oil
Salt

Put the chillies in a small bowl, cover them with boiling water, set aside for 
five minutes to rehydrate, then drain.

Put the cumin, coriander, peppercorns, cardamom and cinnamon in a small frying 
pan on a medium heat, and toast for three to four minutes, until the spices 
start to brown and go aromatic. Grind to a powder (I use a spice grinder), then 
tip into a small food processor bowl. Add the rehydrated chillies, 90ml cold 
water, all the remaining ingredients and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and work 
for a couple of minutes, until you have a smooth paste. Refrigerate until ready 
to use.

Tandoori chicken

Homemade tandoori chicken beats a ready meal any day. Serves four.


150g tandoori paste (see previous recipe)
200g Greek yoghurt
2 tsp lemon juice
Salt
1 chicken (2.2kg)
2 tbsp olive oil 
5g small coriander sprigs, stems and leaves, roughly chopped

In a large bowl, mix the paste, yoghurt, lemon juice and three-quarters of a 
teaspoon of salt. Add the chicken and rub it all over with the mixture, until 
well coated, then set aside to marinate for at least an hour (or overnight in 
the fridge, if you’re preparing this in advance).

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Put the chicken in an oven tray lined 
with baking paper – you need a smallish one, so it fits snugly – and brush (or 
rub) all over with oil. Roast the chicken for 25 minutes, then baste, cover 
with foil and roast for another 45 minutes, basting twice more. Turn up the 
heat to 210C/410F/gas mark 6½, remove the foil and roast for a final five 
minutes.

Remove the chicken from the oven and leave to rest at room temperature for 
five to 10 minutes. Serve with any pan juices and the coriander sprinkled on 
top.

Grilled tandoori prawns and pineapple salad 

These sweet, spicy prawns and pineapple are gorgeous with the crunchy iceberg 
lettuce. Make sure you scrape all the cooking juices from the baking tray into 
the salad, so you get all the flavour. Toast the mustard seeds in a small pan 
on a medium heat, until they just start to pop. Serves four.

1kg tiger prawns (ie about 20 prawns; defrosted if frozen), peeled but with 
the tails intact, and deveined
60g tandoori paste (see first recipe)
1 large garlic clove, peeled and crushed
Salt
2 tbsp groundnut oil
½ medium pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into 1cm-thick rounds
2 tbsp lime juice, plus 1 lime, quartered, to serve
½ large iceberg lettuce, cut into 3cm wedges
10g basil leaves
1 tsp mustard seeds, lightly toasted 

Put the prawns, two-thirds of the paste, the garlic, a third of a teaspoon of 
salt and a tablespoon of oil in a bowl, mix to coat and put in the fridge to 
marinate for an hour.

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Put a ridged griddle pan on a high heat 
and ventilate the kitchen. Once the griddle is very hot, grill the pineapple 
slices in batches for about a minute each, turning them halfway. Once all the 
fruit is grilled and cool enough to handle, cut each slice into 10 little 
triangular wedges and put them in a large bowl.

Put the prawns on the griddle and grill for a minute, turning them once 
halfway, until blackened on both sides. Add the prawns to the pineapple bowl 
with the remaining tandoori paste and a tablespoon of oil. Toss to coat, then 
spread out on a medium oven tray lined with baking paper, and roast for five to 
seven minutes, until the prawns are just cooked through.

Spoon everything into a large bowl – make sure you get every last scrap and 
all the juices – then add the lime juice, a quarter-teaspoon of salt, the 
lettuce, basil and mustard seeds, and toss. Spoon on to a large platter (or 
into individual bowls) and serve at once with the lime wedges.

These are gorgeous: serve just as they are as a side, or maybe with plain 
yoghurt, or turn them into a starter or light meal in their own right by 
serving with a bowl of rice. Serves four as a side dish.

1 large cauliflower (1kg), leaves left on, first cut in half vertically 
through the root (so each half stays intact) and then each half cut vertically 
into 4 thick wedges
50g ghee
50g tandoori paste (see first recipe)
1 small preserved lemon, seeds discarded, flesh and skin finely chopped
1½ tsp honey
Salt
30g flaked almonds, lightly toasted

Heat the grill to its highest setting.

Put the cauliflower in a large bowl. Put the ghee, paste, lemon, honey and 
half a teaspoon of salt in a small saucepan and put on a high heat. Stir until 
the ghee melts, then pour over the cauliflower wedges. Mix well (don’t worry if 
the wedges break up slightly), then arrange on a large oven tray. Put the tray 
under the grill about 10cm away from the heat source, and cook, turning 
regularly, for about 25 minutes, until charred all over and cooked through.

Put the charred cauliflower wedges (and any bits and pieces that have broken 
off) on a large serving plate, scatter over the flaked almonds and serve hot.
