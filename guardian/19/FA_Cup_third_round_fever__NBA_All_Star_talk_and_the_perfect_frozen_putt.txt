1) It’s FA Cup third-round weekend, one of the most nostalgic in the football 
calendar. It makes sense to start with a ludicrous Liverpool comeback, at 
Kenilworth Road in 2006, when Rafael Benítez’s side dug deep to turn round a 
3-1 scoreline to triumph. Featuringnone other than Steve Howard, Stevie Gerrard 
and Djibril Cissé. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ6b2zny4Eg> Turn back the 
clock to 1992, andrecall Wrexham’s famous win over Arsenal, courtesy of goals 
from their captain, Mickey Thomas, and Steve Watkin. 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD0eTN7dkQE> Then there’s Shrewsbury Town’s 
toppling of Everton, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqCmkGg-v20> in 2003, 
featuring a 17-year-old Wayne Rooney. Plus, when two heavyweightsmet in 1998 at 
Stamford Bridge <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRFhgz8rwe4>, feat. David 
Beckham <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAkY3jI2vqE> and Gianluca Vialli. 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAZ4MipejmE> To this weekend’s ties, one of 
which will trigger memories for AFC Wimbledon, who travel to Gander Green Lane, 
Sutton United’s home, where they were reborn 14 and a half years ago. Here’s a
nice short film on their resurrection. 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaWeuRCnbVA> There’s also Jaap Stam’s return 
to Manchester United, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd9FthoDgD0> a little 
more than 15 years after he left for Lazio. His only goalcame at Leicester 
City, much to the delight of Sir Alex Ferguson.

2) Get their attention, as David Brent would say. 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-wfO6_eq-A> To get a referee’s attention? 
High-pitched screaming. Mike Mitchell of the Pittsburgh Steelers, fuming over a 
foul given in a match against the Cleveland Browns,pulls out a shriek Homer 
Simpson would be proud of <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_lISsW3dgQ>. What a 
racket: thedecibel level soars at Goodwood.

3) New year, same feeling for Notts County, who are fed up to the back teeth 
of Cambridge United, coached by their former manager Shaun Derry. In their last 
four meetings over the past two seasons, they have conceded three truly 
wretched, identical goals.Part one, 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lopn3_ckBxU> part two 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppba3QCb8JQ> and part three, from Monday.

 Woe for Notts County against Cambridge United, part three. 
4) Joel Embiid, a rookie centre for the Philadelphia 76ers, has hit quite the 
purple patch in his breakout season. 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJVUu6vmPow> His form has only kept improving, 
and with his ascent, speculation that the Camerooniancould be named an NBA All 
Star <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3axD0ztfqyA> has abounded. As if that 
weren’t enough,Embiid has extra motivation to force his way into contention.

5) With temperatures plummeting once more in western Europe, it’s the perfect 
time of year for golf on the local frozen lake.

6) And the A-League’s Tim Cahill sees his trademark celebration muted by a 
Central Coast Mariners ball boy. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfm4sYnK6Qc> 
Olivier Giroud’srecent scorpion celebration against Bournemouth 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqjrAg2vQXQ> was anything but.
