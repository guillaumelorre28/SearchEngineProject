That’s all from us

That was a real tussle in the end as the veteran pushed the 16th seed all the 
way but Tomic’s class told in the end and after close to three hours he’s 
through to the second round of his home slam! Thanks for joining us.

Tomic wins it in four sets! 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4

4th set: Tomic 6-4 Istomin - Tomic wins it in four sets!

Things started well for Tomic when an Istomin backhand clipped the tape and 
sat up to be put away, which was followed by an unforced error from the Uzbek 
as he tried for a winner down the line. Tomic’s crunching first serve then set 
up the three match points and only one was required. Tomic is through to round 
two!

4th set: *Tomic 5-4 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Istomin skips out to 40-15 on serve and he’s really unleashing with some of 
his groundstrokes but Tomic edges back ever so slightly with a defensive winner 
after withstanding the onslaught. Then he out-maneovers his opponent in a rally 
to make it deuce and goes better, establishing a break point. This is a big 
chance for the Aussie and he takes it, forcing Istomin into an awkward backhand 
that flies long. Tomic will now take a seat before coming out to serve for the 
match.

4th set: Tomic 4-4 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Something’s gotta give here and for the first four points of this game it 
looks like it’ll be the Tomic serve, but he digs in to drag himself back to 
deuce. A sliding serve sets him up for a forehand winner down the line and 
Istomin biffs one wide to help him hold serve. Another development: the most 
vocal elements of the Fanatics supporter group have absconded to the Hewitt 
match. Poor Bernie.

4th set: *Tomic 3-4 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Some stats for you: Tomic’s committed 41 unforced errors to Istomin’s 30, 
which is what’s got the Australian in trouble in a lot of instances. Istomin’s 
hit more winners (+5), more aces (+6) and holds his serve again here, but he’s 
never really broken Tomic’s when it has counted.

4th set: Tomic 3-3 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Bernard Tomic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> might have 
been reasonably happy with his draw in the lead-up to this tournament but he’ll 
be far from please with how long this is dragging on. From 40-15 on serve he 
flounders a little and it’s soon deuce. That seems to gee him up somewhat and a 
thumping ace is followed by an Istomin error to keep it on serve. We might have 
another tiebreak on our hands.

4th set: *Tomic 2-3 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Both players are showing signs of fatigue here but the match is certainly not 
suffering as a spectacle because they’re quite happy to unleash big winners. 
Tomic gets a slight opening on Istomin’s serve but it’s quickly slammed shut.

4th set: Tomic 2-2 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Tomic’s all business in this service game as he moves to 40-15 and forces 
Istomin wide and into an error with his kick serve. That was a bit simpler than 
the game that preceded it.

4th set: *Tomic 1-2 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

We’re about to tick over the two-and-a-half hour mark now as Tomic leaps into 
a big forehand winner across court and that’s followed with some finesse when 
he expertly disguises a cheeky drop shot, then another from which he gets lucky 
to open up a chance. He’s poking his tongue out in delight at that turn of 
fortune. Istomin prevails in two rallies and in between fires down an ace to 
save all three break points. A few Tomic errors later the Australian has 
spurned a golden opportunity to run away with the match.

4th set: Tomic 1-1 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

This isn’t the most convincing service game from Tomic, but he moves to 40-30 
when Istomin nets a backhand and then cannons one of his own down the line to 
keep things on serve.

The medical emergency done, we’ll now have a three-minute warm-up

Which is fair, because both players have stood idle for 17 minutes as the 
situation was attended to. It appears as though the medical attention on the 
member of the crowd affected was successful, which is also good news. What all 
this means forBernard Tomic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> 
we’ll now see. Both men have to start again.

This emergency delay continues at Hisense Arena

And I’m not exactly sure why, but it took what would seem an unusually long 
amount of time for medical help to arrive. Both players are now pacing about 
trying to keep warm but as before, maintaining an appropriate level of respect 
for the emergency medical situation faced by the fan in question.

It would appear to be quite a serious medical emergency at Hisense Arena

Some crowd members are tweeting that an epipen has been rushed from one end of 
the stadium to the other.

(Match delayed) 4th set: *Tomic 0-0 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic 
leads 2-1

I’m not sure if it’s related to either this match or Nadal’s but apparently 
Twitter has crashed. What’s Kim Kardashian up to at the moment? As that’s all 
going on, or not going on as it were, Istomin moves to a 40-15 buffer on serve 
but there’s some kind of medical emergency in the crowd so the match is held up 
for a number of minutes. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious and both players 
have taken a respectful approach, having a quick chat at their chairs as the 
spectator is seen to. I’ll have more as it’s at hand.

Tomic takes the third set and a 2-1 buffer!

3rd set: *Tomic 6-4 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

As he slices a rather frustrating backhand into the net first up in this 
service game Tomic could be forgiven for seething but he’s undemonstrative both 
then and when Istomin follows up with a big winner down the line. All of a 
sudden it’s 0-40 and three break points for the Uzbek.

Here’s a test for Tomic. He produces a big serve down the line to save the 
first and crunches a forehand winner to take care of the next. What follows is 
even better; off balance and seemingly out of the point, Tomic still finds a 
way and thumps a forehand winner. From there it’s a real arm-wrestle but 
somehow Tomic holds his composure to take the set. That was gutsy!

Istomin’s certainly not going to roll over and holds a love service game to 
make sure Tomic has to serve it out if he’s taking this third set.

3rd set: Tomic 5-3 Istomin* (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

Logic is starting to prevail a little more as this match wears on. Tomic is up 
30-0 when he stubs a backhand into the net but that’s followed by a rasping 
forehand winner down the line and he’s soon closing out the service game with 
ease.

3rd set: *Tomic 4-3 Istomin (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

Tomic’s showing a bit of ruthlessness now to try and pile into the Istomin 
serve and get this set wrapped up quickly. At 30-30 Istomin buckles with a 
double fault but Tomic wastes the break point with a wild backhand not so much 
down the line as barely in its postcode. Istomin holds with an ace down the 
middle.

3rd set: Tomic 4-2 Istomin* (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

This is far better from Tomic, who bosses Istomin around here on serve to 
establish a quick 40-0 buffer before icing it, grabbing a towel and refocusing 
his gaze once more.

3rd set: *Tomic 3-2 Istomin (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

A lightning-fast hold of serve for Istomin, who makes a mockery of Tomic’s 
wobbly preceding game. I’m still not entirely sure which way this one’s going 
to go.

This refers to Nadal, of course:

3rd set: Tomic 3-1 Istomin* (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

Hmm, interesting. There’s a bit of an opening here for Istomin when he wins 
the first two points of the Tomic service game on his way to a couple of break 
points. Tomic steps up to the plate with two ice cold serves, the second of 
which is a big ace. Istomin nets a forehand to gift the Aussie advantage but 
then pulls out a remarkable roundhouse forehand winner. They’re trading blows 
here and it takes Tomic an age to finally hold.

Meanwhile, Rafa’s just gone down 6-2 in the fifth and a shocked sigh rings out 
across the press box. Nobody can believe it.

3rd set: *Tomic 2-1 Istomin (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

He knows he might have shot his bolt in this first round clash but Denis 
Istomin smiles to himself and gets on with the task, crisply striking his first 
serve to hold in a service game that contrasts markedly with his last.

3rd set: Tomic 2-0 Istomin* (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

Tomic’s really asserting himself now with hard, flat groundstrokes and 
well-positioned serves that never give his opponent much of a sniff. He holds 
serve for the loss of only one point and looks to the stands with that thousand 
yard stare of his.

3rd set: *Tomic 1-0 Istomin (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

Istomin is still marginally winning every major statistical category in this 
match but after a rock solid start finds himself back on terms with Tomic and 
then down 0-40 in his opening service game of the third set. A heavy-handed 
backhand later he’s handed Tomic another early break. Could this unravel for 
him now? Fernando Verdasco, meanwhile, is still a chance to knock off Rafael 
Nadal.

Tomic takes the second set to level it up!

2nd set: Tomic 6-4 Istomin* (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

There’s an early wobble in this service game but Tomic holds his composure to 
set up two set points, only one of which he needs when Istomin curls a sliced 
backhand into the net. The Australian is on the board!

If the Uzbek ever opens a fish and chip shop, I reckon he should offer 
‘Isto-minimum chips’ on the menu. What do you reckon? I guess it’s an unlikely 
turn of events but you never know. He’s solid on serve here and holds easily.

2nd set: Tomic 5-3 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

A smile! Bernie’s really getting lavish with his public displays of emotion 
here after another lovely backhand winner down the line. He likes it a lot more 
than the shanked forehand that makes it 30-15 rather than 40-0. No matter, 
Istomin biffs one long himself next up and a swerving ace later Tomic leads 5-3 
in the second.

2nd set: *Tomic 4-3 Istomin (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

Ooft, there’s a cracking backhand winner here from Tomic when Istomin’s 
forehand drops a little short and that opens up a break point. Istomin serves 
strongly to save it but gets a little cute with a ‘tweener to hand the 
Australian another opportunity. Then another save from Istomin, but only with a 
lucky roll over the net. With two booming serves the Uzbek holds.

Istomaniacs?

2nd set: Tomic 4-2 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

There’s an easy grace about Tomic’s serve when he’s nailing it – as though 
he’s just rolling through the action in warm-up mode. Here he’s doing it 
perfectly to hold and apply more pressure to Istomin.

2nd set: *Tomic 3-2 Istomin (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

It’s taken him a few tries but Istomin starts to get back his serving mojo now 
and cracks his way to a cheap service game for the loss of only one point, 
sending down an ace to seal it.

2nd set: Tomic 3-1 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

Both these men are serving in the mid-60s as far as first serve percentage 
with Istomin holding the edge on winners, 22-16. Tomic bucks the trend of 
appalling service games with a belter, surging to 40-0 and then watching on in 
delight as Istomin sends a rather ham-fisted forehand past the baseline.

2nd set: *Tomic 2-1 Istomin (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

Tomic is currently winning just 38% of his points on the second serve, by the 
way. In the immediate future it’s not such a great concern because Istomin’s 
serve also misfires again to hand the Australian three break points. They’re 
mirroring each other. Istomin wallops a running forehand wide to concede the 
third break in as many games. It’s hard to make any sense of this.

2nd set: Tomic 1-1 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

Wow, this really refuses to settle into any kind of pattern and now Tomic 
falters on his serve to hand Istomin three break points to get this back on 
serve. Tomic blasts a backhand into the net to concede a love service game. 
What is going on out there?

2nd set: *Tomic 1-0 Istomin (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

Tomic has to compose himself now and put hat tiebreak behind him and he makes 
a solid start if that’s his philosophy, forcing errors and opening up a couple 
of early break points. He seizes upon the first when Istomin’s low volley 
crashes into the net.

And then his match will inevitably go five sets...

If Verdasco wins this tiebreak, Lleyton's match might not start until 8:30

Istomin wins the first set! Tomic is in early trouble!

1st set: *Tomic 6-7 (6-4) Istomin (* denotes next server)

The Melbourne crowd was very subdued as they watched their man fall to a 0-3 
deficit early in this tiebreak on account of an unforced error and some strong 
serving from Istomi and it gets far worse, with the Uzbek holding his nerve to 
ace after opening up three set points. Tomic is in a spot of bother here as he 
drops the first set. Oh dear.

1st set: *Tomic 6-6 Istomin (* denotes next server)

Istomin’s not going to hand this set over to the local boy and again quickly 
skips out to a 40-0 buffer on serve and holds easily to set up the tiebreak. 
This could be a long one, I fear.

1st set: Tomic 6-5 Istomin* (* denotes next server)

If Bernard Tomic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> is 
panicking at all on the inside, his exterior certainly doesn’t give any hint as 
he commits another unforced error to make it 30-30 on his own serve. Istomin 
unleashes a blistering forehand to set up a break point but the Australian 
spears his serve straight down the middle to make it deuce and he confidently 
holds.
 Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan is providing a stern test for Bernard Tomic.

1st set: *Tomic 5-5 Istomin (* denotes next server)

I don’t want to tempt fate here but the Fanatics haven’t been quite as 
obnoxious as some would expect so far. If you can’t hear them, are the even 
there? A philosophical question to consider. When Istomin thumps a forehand 
past the baseline and then faults there’s a little opening for Tomic at 30-15, 
but the Uzbek comes back with a strong kick serve to level it up before Tomic 
nets to hand him an opportunity to hold. With another error from the Aussie he 
does.

1st set: Tomic 5-4 Istomin* (* denotes next server)

The Australian is throwing himself into his forehand now and really belting it 
across court to push Istomin wide. He’s puffing away a little but his serve is 
formidable and allows him to wrap up another quick game.

1st set: *Tomic 4-4 Istomin (* denotes next server)

In contrast to Nick Kyrgios, the man to whom he’s most often compared, Tomic 
is giving nothing away here as he sets about his work; errors are met with the 
same downward stare as winners and there’s more of the former than the latter 
here as Istomin thumps his way to a love game on serve. Who’ll crack first?

A little scratchy early, Tomic is now finding his way on serve and rarely 
giving Istomin an opening before he caresses a sparkling forehand winner across 
court to hold.

1st set: *Tomic 3-3 Istomin (* denotes next server)

Tomic’s warming up a little now and leans into a sweetly timed double-fisted 
backhand winner down the line but Istomin counters with an equally impressive 
forehand winner to level it at 15-15. They continue to trade blows until 
Istomin aces and then keeps calm to hold serve.

1st set: Tomic 3-2 Istomin* (* denotes next server)

Denis Istomin boasts a couple of endearing traits and high among them is the 
fact that he’s sponsored by the rarely-encountered ‘Lotto’ brand, which I 
didn’t actually realise was still a going concern. As their retro logo 
transfixes me the man wearing it is powerless to stop a cheap Tomic service 
game. Maybe he should upgrade to...Diadora?

1st set: *Tomic 2-2 Istomin (* denotes next server)

Istomin’s first serve is looking very sturdy at the moment and with a couple 
of rasping examples of it he quickly opens up game point and takes it easily. 
Tomic had to labour in order to hold his last service game but his opponent 
made it look like a breeze.

1st set: Tomic 2-1 Istomin* (* denotes next server)

Hmm, Tomic’s been caught on the hop here with Istomin working him around the 
court well to win the first two points. Tomic digs in, forcing an error and 
then making it 30-30 with a cracking first serve but nets a forehand to offer 
up an early break point. Its expertly saved with a big kick serve and volley, 
followed by a lot of cat and mouse. Tomic hold win an ace down the line but 
it’s not entirely convincing stuff from the favourite. This is also happening 
right now:
Neil McMahon (@NeilMcMahon) 
Nadal 2 sets to 1 up, down a break in 4th. If this goes as long as last time v 
Verdasco, Hewitt's match will start around midnight.#ausopen

1st set: *Tomic 1-1 Istomin (* denotes next server)

There’s a typically laconic air about Tomic early in the Istomin service game 
but the Uzbek isn’t fooled one bit, remaining alert to the Australian’s weapons 
as he’s drawn into a long rally. He fires down a swerving ace to hold serve.

1st set: Tomic 1-0 Istomin* (* denotes next server)

Tomic is straight into it with a confident first serve and foray to the net, 
where he puts away a forehand. He sends his next serve too wide for Istomin to 
handle but cracks a cross-court forehand wide to make it 30-15. There follows 
our first ace of the night and thanks to an angled drop shot, Tomic wraps it up 
quickly. A solid start from the Australian.

Our men enter the arena

And Tomic does so to the strains of Men at Work’s ‘Down under’, which would 
seem a bit odd overseas let alone in a home match like this. He’s not bopping 
along to it, I can confirm. Istomin calls heads at the toss and he’s 
successful. He’ll receive first. A note for the fashionistas: Tomic will wear 
the sleeved version of Nick Kyrgios’ shirt from last night. I’m not sure how 
this will affect the result but there you go. Like Kyrgios, Tomic will also 
have support from the injured Thanasi Kokkinakis, who looks on from the front 
row.

Preamble

Hello all and welcome to our live coverage of Australian Bernard Tomic’s first 
outing in the 2016Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>, in which he’ll face 
Uzbekistan’s wily, 59th-ranked tour veteran Denis Istomin.

We know plenty about Bernie at this point – that his big aim in the first half 
of the year is to crack the world top ten and if he does, these sorts of 
matches should be his bread and butter. Istomin actually won the last clash 
between these two in Washington back in 2014 but Tomic’s taken out the other 
two matches they’ve played and certainly shouldn’t drop this one.

“If I can win in a quicker time, get off the court as soon as I can, that 
would be a favour to me,” Tomic said in the lead-up, saying he was keen to 
avoid the sweltering Melbourne heat in the opening rounds. Istomin’s not in 
super form right now, so maybe that’s likely.

“I like playing him. He strokes the ball very well. He plays very good tennis. 
Beaten good players,”Tomic said yesterday 
<http://www.foxsports.com.au/tennis/australian-open-2016-bernard-tomic-hoping-for-quick-first-round-win-over-denis-istomin/news-story/37be0bda0c18c47b3b92dc1317850ca3>
. “I prefer to step on court with him. I know his game. He knows mine.”

That’s all from us

That was a real tussle in the end as the veteran pushed the 16th seed all the 
way but Tomic’s class told in the end and after close to three hours he’s 
through to the second round of his home slam! Thanks for joining us.
 
4th set: Tomic 6-4 Istomin - Tomic wins it in four sets!

Things started well for Tomic when an Istomin backhand clipped the tape and 
sat up to be put away, which was followed by an unforced error from the Uzbek 
as he tried for a winner down the line. Tomic’s crunching first serve then set 
up the three match points and only one was required. Tomic is through to round 
two!
 
4th set: *Tomic 5-4 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Istomin skips out to 40-15 on serve and he’s really unleashing with some of 
his groundstrokes but Tomic edges back ever so slightly with a defensive winner 
after withstanding the onslaught. Then he out-maneovers his opponent in a rally 
to make it deuce and goes better, establishing a break point. This is a big 
chance for the Aussie and he takes it, forcing Istomin into an awkward backhand 
that flies long. Tomic will now take a seat before coming out to serve for the 
match.

4th set: Tomic 4-4 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Something’s gotta give here and for the first four points of this game it 
looks like it’ll be the Tomic serve, but he digs in to drag himself back to 
deuce. A sliding serve sets him up for a forehand winner down the line and 
Istomin biffs one wide to help him hold serve. Another development: the most 
vocal elements of the Fanatics supporter group have absconded to the Hewitt 
match. Poor Bernie.
 
4th set: *Tomic 3-4 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Some stats for you: Tomic’s committed 41 unforced errors to Istomin’s 30, 
which is what’s got the Australian in trouble in a lot of instances. Istomin’s 
hit more winners (+5), more aces (+6) and holds his serve again here, but he’s 
never really broken Tomic’s when it has counted.

4th set: Tomic 3-3 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Bernard Tomic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> might have 
been reasonably happy with his draw in the lead-up to this tournament but he’ll 
be far from please with how long this is dragging on. From 40-15 on serve he 
flounders a little and it’s soon deuce. That seems to gee him up somewhat and a 
thumping ace is followed by an Istomin error to keep it on serve. We might have 
another tiebreak on our hands.
 
4th set: *Tomic 2-3 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Both players are showing signs of fatigue here but the match is certainly not 
suffering as a spectacle because they’re quite happy to unleash big winners.

4th set: Tomic 2-2 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Tomic’s all business in this service game as he moves to 40-15 and forces 
Istomin wide and into an error with his kick serve. That was a bit simpler than 
the game that preceded it.
 
4th set: *Tomic 1-2 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

We’re about to tick over the two-and-a-half hour mark now as Tomic leaps into 
a big forehand winner across court and that’s followed with some finesse when 
he expertly disguises a cheeky drop shot, then another from which he gets lucky 
to open up a chance. He’s poking his tongue out in delight at that turn of 
fortune. Istomin prevails in two rallies and in between fires down an ace to 
save all three break points. A few Tomic errors later the Australian has 
spurned a golden opportunity to run away with the match.

4th set: Tomic 1-1 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

This isn’t the most convincing service game from Tomic, but he moves to 40-30 
when Istomin nets a backhand and then cannons one of his own down the line to 
keep things on serve.

4th set: *Tomic 0-1 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

Istomin gets going again and holds serve to get us kick-started in the fourth 
set. What a strange match this has been.
 
The medical emergency done, we’ll now have a three-minute warm-up

Which is fair, because both players have stood idle for 17 minutes as the 
situation was attended to. It appears as though the medical attention on the 
member of the crowd affected was successful, which is also good news. What all 
this means forBernard Tomic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> 
we’ll now see. Both men have to start again.
 
This emergency delay continues at Hisense Arena

And I’m not exactly sure why, but it took what would seem an unusually long 
amount of time for medical help to arrive. Both players are now pacing about 
trying to keep warm but as before, maintaining an appropriate level of respect 
for the emergency medical situation faced by the fan in question.

Some crowd members are tweeting that an epipen has been rushed from one end of 
the stadium to the other.
 
(Match delayed) 4th set: *Tomic 0-0 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic 
leads 2-1

I’m not sure if it’s related to either this match or Nadal’s but apparently 
Twitter has crashed. What’s Kim Kardashian up to at the moment? As that’s all 
going on, or not going on as it were, Istomin moves to a 40-15 buffer on serve 
but there’s some kind of medical emergency in the crowd so the match is held up 
for a number of minutes. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious and both players 
have taken a respectful approach, having a quick chat at their chairs as the 
spectator is seen to. I’ll have more as it’s at hand.
 
3rd set: *Tomic 6-4 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1

As he slices a rather frustrating backhand into the net first up in this 
service game Tomic could be forgiven for seething but he’s undemonstrative both 
then and when Istomin follows up with a big winner down the line. All of a 
sudden it’s 0-40 and three break points for the Uzbek.

Here’s a test for Tomic. He produces a big serve down the line to save the 
first and crunches a forehand winner to take care of the next. What follows is 
even better; off balance and seemingly out of the point, Tomic still finds a 
way and thumps a forehand winner. From there it’s a real arm-wrestle but 
somehow Tomic holds his composure to take the set. That was gutsy!
 
3rd set: *Tomic 5-4 Istomin (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

Istomin’s certainly not going to roll over and holds a love service game to 
make sure Tomic has to serve it out if he’s taking this third set.

3rd set: Tomic 5-3 Istomin* (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

Logic is starting to prevail a little more as this match wears on. Tomic is up 
30-0 when he stubs a backhand into the net but that’s followed by a rasping 
forehand winner down the line and he’s soon closing out the service game with 
ease.
 
3rd set: *Tomic 4-3 Istomin (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

Tomic’s showing a bit of ruthlessness now to try and pile into the Istomin 
serve and get this set wrapped up quickly. At 30-30 Istomin buckles with a 
double fault but Tomic wastes the break point with a wild backhand not so much 
down the line as barely in its postcode. Istomin holds with an ace down the 
middle.

3rd set: Tomic 4-2 Istomin* (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

This is far better from Tomic, who bosses Istomin around here on serve to 
establish a quick 40-0 buffer before icing it, grabbing a towel and refocusing 
his gaze once more.
 
3rd set: *Tomic 3-2 Istomin (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

A lightning-fast hold of serve for Istomin, who makes a mockery of Tomic’s 
wobbly preceding game. I’m still not entirely sure which way this one’s going 
to go.

This refers to Nadal, of course:

3rd set: Tomic 3-1 Istomin* (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

Hmm, interesting. There’s a bit of an opening here for Istomin when he wins 
the first two points of the Tomic service game on his way to a couple of break 
points. Tomic steps up to the plate with two ice cold serves, the second of 
which is a big ace. Istomin nets a forehand to gift the Aussie advantage but 
then pulls out a remarkable roundhouse forehand winner. They’re trading blows 
here and it takes Tomic an age to finally hold.

Meanwhile, Rafa’s just gone down 6-2 in the fifth and a shocked sigh rings out 
across the press box. Nobody can believe it.
 
3rd set: *Tomic 2-1 Istomin (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

He knows he might have shot his bolt in this first round clash but Denis 
Istomin smiles to himself and gets on with the task, crisply striking his first 
serve to hold in a service game that contrasts markedly with his last.

3rd set: Tomic 2-0 Istomin* (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

Tomic’s really asserting himself now with hard, flat groundstrokes and 
well-positioned serves that never give his opponent much of a sniff. He holds 
serve for the loss of only one point and looks to the stands with that thousand 
yard stare of his.
 
3rd set: *Tomic 1-0 Istomin (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

Istomin is still marginally winning every major statistical category in this 
match but after a rock solid start finds himself back on terms with Tomic and 
then down 0-40 in his opening service game of the third set. A heavy-handed 
backhand later he’s handed Tomic another early break. Could this unravel for 
him now? Fernando Verdasco, meanwhile, is still a chance to knock off Rafael 
Nadal.

2nd set: Tomic 6-4 Istomin* (* denotes next server) 1 set apiece

There’s an early wobble in this service game but Tomic holds his composure to 
set up two set points, only one of which he needs when Istomin curls a sliced 
backhand into the net. The Australian is on the board!

2nd set: *Tomic 5-4 Istomin (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

If the Uzbek ever opens a fish and chip shop, I reckon he should offer 
‘Isto-minimum chips’ on the menu. What do you reckon? I guess it’s an unlikely 
turn of events but you never know. He’s solid on serve here and holds easily.
 
2nd set: Tomic 5-3 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

A smile! Bernie’s really getting lavish with his public displays of emotion 
here after another lovely backhand winner down the line. He likes it a lot more 
than the shanked forehand that makes it 30-15 rather than 40-0. No matter, 
Istomin biffs one long himself next up and a swerving ace later Tomic leads 5-3 
in the second.
 
2nd set: *Tomic 4-3 Istomin (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

Ooft, there’s a cracking backhand winner here from Tomic when Istomin’s 
forehand drops a little short and that opens up a break point. Istomin serves 
strongly to save it but gets a little cute with a ‘tweener to hand the 
Australian another opportunity. Then another save from Istomin, but only with a 
lucky roll over the net. With two booming serves the Uzbek holds.

Istomaniacs?

There’s an easy grace about Tomic’s serve when he’s nailing it – as though 
he’s just rolling through the action in warm-up mode. Here he’s doing it 
perfectly to hold and apply more pressure to Istomin.

2nd set: *Tomic 3-2 Istomin (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

It’s taken him a few tries but Istomin starts to get back his serving mojo now 
and cracks his way to a cheap service game for the loss of only one point, 
sending down an ace to seal it.

2nd set: Tomic 3-1 Istomin* (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

Both these men are serving in the mid-60s as far as first serve percentage 
with Istomin holding the edge on winners, 22-16. Tomic bucks the trend of 
appalling service games with a belter, surging to 40-0 and then watching on in 
delight as Istomin sends a rather ham-fisted forehand past the baseline.
 
2nd set: *Tomic 2-1 Istomin (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

Tomic is currently winning just 38% of his points on the second serve, by the 
way. In the immediate future it’s not such a great concern because Istomin’s 
serve also misfires again to hand the Australian three break points. They’re 
mirroring each other. Istomin wallops a running forehand wide to concede the 
third break in as many games. It’s hard to make any sense of this.

Wow, this really refuses to settle into any kind of pattern and now Tomic 
falters on his serve to hand Istomin three break points to get this back on 
serve. Tomic blasts a backhand into the net to concede a love service game. 
What is going on out there?
 
2nd set: *Tomic 1-0 Istomin (* denotes next server) Istomin leads 1-0

Tomic has to compose himself now and put hat tiebreak behind him and he makes 
a solid start if that’s his philosophy, forcing errors and opening up a couple 
of early break points. He seizes upon the first when Istomin’s low volley 
crashes into the net.

And then his match will inevitably go five sets...

1st set: *Tomic 6-7 (6-4) Istomin (* denotes next server)

The Melbourne crowd was very subdued as they watched their man fall to a 0-3 
deficit early in this tiebreak on account of an unforced error and some strong 
serving from Istomi and it gets far worse, with the Uzbek holding his nerve to 
ace after opening up three set points. Tomic is in a spot of bother here as he 
drops the first set. Oh dear.

1st set: *Tomic 6-6 Istomin (* denotes next server)

Istomin’s not going to hand this set over to the local boy and again quickly 
skips out to a 40-0 buffer on serve and holds easily to set up the tiebreak. 
This could be a long one, I fear.
 
1st set: Tomic 6-5 Istomin* (* denotes next server)

If Bernard Tomic <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic> is 
panicking at all on the inside, his exterior certainly doesn’t give any hint as 
he commits another unforced error to make it 30-30 on his own serve. Istomin 
unleashes a blistering forehand to set up a break point but the Australian 
spears his serve straight down the middle to make it deuce and he confidently 
holds.

1st set: *Tomic 5-5 Istomin (* denotes next server)

I don’t want to tempt fate here but the Fanatics haven’t been quite as 
obnoxious as some would expect so far. If you can’t hear them, are the even 
there? A philosophical question to consider. When Istomin thumps a forehand 
past the baseline and then faults there’s a little opening for Tomic at 30-15, 
but the Uzbek comes back with a strong kick serve to level it up before Tomic 
nets to hand him an opportunity to hold. With another error from the Aussie he 
does.

1st set: Tomic 5-4 Istomin* (* denotes next server)

The Australian is throwing himself into his forehand now and really belting it 
across court to push Istomin wide. He’s puffing away a little but his serve is 
formidable and allows him to wrap up another quick game.
 
1st set: *Tomic 4-4 Istomin (* denotes next server)

In contrast to Nick Kyrgios, the man to whom he’s most often compared, Tomic 
is giving nothing away here as he sets about his work; errors are met with the 
same downward stare as winners and there’s more of the former than the latter 
here as Istomin thumps his way to a love game on serve. Who’ll crack first?
 
1st set: Tomic 4-3 Istomin* (* denotes next server)

A little scratchy early, Tomic is now finding his way on serve and rarely 
giving Istomin an opening before he caresses a sparkling forehand winner across 
court to hold.

Tomic’s warming up a little now and leans into a sweetly timed double-fisted 
backhand winner down the line but Istomin counters with an equally impressive 
forehand winner to level it at 15-15. They continue to trade blows until 
Istomin aces and then keeps calm to hold serve.

Denis Istomin boasts a couple of endearing traits and high among them is the 
fact that he’s sponsored by the rarely-encountered ‘Lotto’ brand, which I 
didn’t actually realise was still a going concern. As their retro logo 
transfixes me the man wearing it is powerless to stop a cheap Tomic service 
game. Maybe he should upgrade to...Diadora?

1st set: *Tomic 2-2 Istomin (* denotes next server)

Istomin’s first serve is looking very sturdy at the moment and with a couple 
of rasping examples of it he quickly opens up game point and takes it easily. 
Tomic had to labour in order to hold his last service game but his opponent 
made it look like a breeze.
 
1st set: Tomic 2-1 Istomin* (* denotes next server)

Hmm, Tomic’s been caught on the hop here with Istomin working him around the 
court well to win the first two points. Tomic digs in, forcing an error and 
then making it 30-30 with a cracking first serve but nets a forehand to offer 
up an early break point. Its expertly saved with a big kick serve and volley, 
followed by a lot of cat and mouse. Tomic hold win an ace down the line but 
it’s not entirely convincing stuff from the favourite. This is also happening 
right now:

1st set: *Tomic 1-1 Istomin (* denotes next server)

There’s a typically laconic air about Tomic early in the Istomin service game 
but the Uzbek isn’t fooled one bit, remaining alert to the Australian’s weapons 
as he’s drawn into a long rally. He fires down a swerving ace to hold serve.
 
1st set: Tomic 1-0 Istomin* (* denotes next server)

Tomic is straight into it with a confident first serve and foray to the net, 
where he puts away a forehand. He sends his next serve too wide for Istomin to 
handle but cracks a cross-court forehand wide to make it 30-15. There follows 
our first ace of the night and thanks to an angled drop shot, Tomic wraps it up 
quickly. A solid start from the Australian.

And Tomic does so to the strains of Men at Work’s ‘Down under’, which would 
seem a bit odd overseas let alone in a home match like this. He’s not bopping 
along to it, I can confirm. Istomin calls heads at the toss and he’s 
successful. He’ll receive first. A note for the fashionistas: Tomic will wear 
the sleeved version of Nick Kyrgios’ shirt from last night. I’m not sure how 
this will affect the result but there you go. Like Kyrgios, Tomic will also 
have support from the injured Thanasi Kokkinakis, who looks on from the front 
row.
 Men at Work - Down Under  
Preamble

Hello all and welcome to our live coverage of Australian Bernard Tomic’s first 
outing in the 2016Australian Open 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australian-open>, in which he’ll face 
Uzbekistan’s wily, 59th-ranked tour veteran Denis Istomin.

We know plenty about Bernie at this point – that his big aim in the first half 
of the year is to crack the world top ten and if he does, these sorts of 
matches should be his bread and butter. Istomin actually won the last clash 
between these two in Washington back in 2014 but Tomic’s taken out the other 
two matches they’ve played and certainly shouldn’t drop this one.

“If I can win in a quicker time, get off the court as soon as I can, that 
would be a favour to me,” Tomic said in the lead-up, saying he was keen to 
avoid the sweltering Melbourne heat in the opening rounds. Istomin’s not in 
super form right now, so maybe that’s likely.

“I like playing him. He strokes the ball very well. He plays very good tennis. 
Beaten good players,”Tomic said yesterday

. “I prefer to step on court with him. I know his game. He knows mine.”
