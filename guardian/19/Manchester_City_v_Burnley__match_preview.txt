The pass-and-move masters that were Manchester City in their 10 consecutive 
wins at the start of the season now seem a mirage. The most troubling element of
Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Liverpool 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/31/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report>
 was that it was no surprise. Pep Guardiola’s side have been misfiring for a 
while despite the three wins on the bounce beforehand. Can Burnley turn them 
over at the Etihad? Sean Dyche’s side are 11th and have won their past two 
games, so this is another test for City.Jamie Jackson
