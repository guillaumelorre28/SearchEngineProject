.

Feghouli was dismissed by Mike Dean following a collision with Phil Jones in 
the first half on Monday night

 and faced a three-match ban but the Algerian will now be available against 
Manchester City in the FA Cup on Friday.

Fernandinho will start his suspension that night. The Brazilian was dismissed 
for a third time in six appearances for a two-footed lunge on Johann Berg 
Gudmundsson and receives a four-match ban rather than the usual three games as 
it was his second Premier League dismissal of the campaign. His other red came 
in the Champions League against Borussia Mönchengladbach.

A West Ham statement read: “West Ham United can confirm that a Football 
Association regulatory commission has upheld the club’s claim for wrongful 
dismissal in respect of the red card shown to Sofiane Feghouli against 
Manchester United.”

Bournemouth have announced they have appealed against the red card shown to 
Simon Francis in the3-3 draw with Arsenal

 on Tuesday night. If the original decision is upheld, the captain will miss 
the next three games, against Millwall, Hull and Watford.
