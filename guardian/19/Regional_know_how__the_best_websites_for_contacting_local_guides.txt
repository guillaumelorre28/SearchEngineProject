With a worldwide network, this site has countless tours to choose from, which 
are rated and reviewed by users, who gives a good idea of what to expect before 
booking. Some of the most popular activities include a night photography tour 
of Paris, during which instruction is given on how to take low-light 
photographs while exploring the city’s landmarks, or a three-hour walk grazing 
the food on offer in New York City’s Chinatown.

TravelLocal


Launched in 2012, TravelLocal is an easy-to-use website that connects 
potential travellers with local travel companies to book holidays. So, rather 
than booking through a big tour operator, you communicate directly with “local 
experts” – small, independent travel companies offering great trips but who 
don’t have big marketing budgets to promote them. Booking and payment is done 
through TravelLocal, a UK company with all payments protected by Abta, 
alleviating concerns about paying into a foreign account.

Vidados is a similar concept to TravelLocal, but with a focus on activity 
holidays, ranging from surf trips to wine tours, language lessons to yoga 
breaks. It describes itself as a “marketplace” that connects travellers to 
independent hosts and is particularly popular with solo female travellers 
looking for smaller, boutique group holidays. It has a particularly large 
number of wellness holidays to browse (over 800), including everything from 
affordable long weekends doing yoga in Spain, to two weeks hiking across 
Canada, staying in swish accommodation along the way.

ToursByLocals


Launched in 2008 by a pair of Canadian travellers, ToursByLocals has over 
1,700 guides in 148 countries around the world. The website is a bit busy, but 
there’s a lot to choose from – and all the local guides have had reference and 
background checks through Thomson Reuters World-Check. There’s also a feature 
for those on cruises, for booking a private shore excursions to coincide with a 
trip.

Those looking for an adventure should check out Embark, which assists with 
booking outdoor activities led by local guides. This could be a day bouldering 
in the Fontainebleau forest in France, with a climber who knows the region, 
trekking in Chiang Mai, Thailand, or a surf/hike adventure in California. It’s 
not just for high-octane activities, either; how about mushroom hunting in 
Denver? Though the site does have worldwide coverage, the biggest range of 
activites are found across the US.

 Legends and Secrets of Barcelona history tour. 
Recently bought by peer-to-peer travel giant Airbnb, Trip4Real, a 
Barcelona-based startup that connects travellers with locals selling tours, 
activities and experiences in their home cities, looks set to become a big name 
in the sharing economy. Its focus is unique experiences on city breaks, 
experiences that put tourists in touch with the daily life of locals. This 
could be exploring Lisbon’s flea markets with an antique collector, an 
alternative night out (tweaked according to tastes) with a Parisian party-goer, 
or a private boat tour through the Amsterdam canals.

With Locals


More intimate travel experiences can be found through the With Locals site. 
While Trip4Real is still predominantely focused on Western Europe, With Locals 
has a big spread in Asia, with activities and tours (mainly food/dining 
related) to book everywhere from Indonesia to Sri Lanka, Thailand to the 
Philippines. These include an organic home-cooked meal in a bamboo house in 
Bali, tea-tasting in Old Bangkok and a riverside picnic in Saigon.

Far more old school that the new wave of local tour start-up projects, Global 
Greeters is a network of volunteers who are just super-keen to show newcomers 
around ... for free. Similar in concept toCouchsurfing 
<https://www.couchsurfing.com/>, in the sense that it’s really founded on the 
principle of helping put people in contact for the pleasure of it, it’s 
necessary to make contact by finding a local group and requesting a greeter. 
Giving a fair bit of notice is usually advisable, so this isn’t one for 
last-minute planners. The groups vary from place to place, but New York City’s 
Big Apple Greeter programme <http://bigapplegreeter.org/> has a great 
reputation and has been running since 1992, with around 300 volunteers involved.

Showaround


With 43,597 locals signed up, and counting, Showaround is a buzzy startup that 
connects travellers with friendly locals willing to show them around. It’s not 
a site for those looking for professional guide services, but it is a great 
place to start for those interested in being shown around in a more casual way 
– and many locals are offering to hang out for free. It has a super-clean, 
easy-to-use site (and an app) and makes it easy to plan and discuss what to go 
and see with the guides. The only catch is a subscription payment is required 
before contact other members is allowed.

CityUnscripted

With a focus on city tours, CityUnscripted pitches itself as an alternative to 
the guidebook. The site, which launched in London in April and has just 
expanded to 12 more cities with its “book a local” service, allows travellers 
build a custom city break itinerary with the help of more than 500 local 
guides. Each guide has a personal profile and the site encourages visitors to 
book someone who matches their personal interests.
