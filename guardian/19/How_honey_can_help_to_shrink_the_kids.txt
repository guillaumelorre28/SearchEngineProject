As children my brothers and sisters and I had a regular diet of bread and 
butter spread with honey – admittedly often laced with bees’ heads, legs and 
wings. My beekeeper father would give us the honey that couldn’t be sold. The 
advantage of honey over sugar (Is sugar the world’s most popular drug? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/05/is-sugar-worlds-most-popular-drug>
, 5 January) is that you know when you’ve had enough. You don’t crave and 
overeat, as with food sweetened with sugar. Thus we can relax and enjoy this 
sweet treat – though better perhaps without the bees’ legs.

• John Berger (Obituary 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-obituary>, 2 
January) inspired one of my favourite art quotes. In a TV interview he asked 
the artist LS Lowry how he felt about the increasingly high price of his 
paintings being beyond the pocket of the working-class people that he depicted. 
Lowry memorably replied: “Well, they never bought them when they were cheap.”

• Your Wordsearch (10 January) asked “Can you find 12 authors in the grid?”. 
It should have read “Can you find 12 male authors in the grid?” Now can we have 
one for female writers please?

• My Italian wife, Anna, frequently calls me “un broccolo” (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/09/who-was-behind-the-sting-against-hillarys-emails>
, 10 January).Unfortunately she states it figuratively, the meaning being “you 
stupid person”. Well, it is a masculine noun.
