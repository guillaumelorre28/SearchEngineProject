Laura Bingham: 7,000km cycle across South America, July 2016 


What was the high point of your trip?
When my sister joined me for a short while in Argentina. We’d been there for 
two days and a man stopped on the side of the road and began speaking to us. He 
told us how he’d cycled around Spain last year then offered us his place to 
stay that night. When we arrived at his home, his mum greeted us with open arms 
and fed us so much food that we ate like kings for the first time in months. 
The following day we met another cyclist who invited us to his home for lunch 
and made arrangements with his friend for us to stay a day later. After a 
generous lunch, we went to his friend’s place and were stopped in the local 
town by a man who gave us a large bag of oranges. He, too, offered a stay in 
his home … This level of generosity shocked me to my core. I think we forget 
how giving people can be and how a kind stranger can look after you without 
expecting anything in return. It’s funny how kindness and a warm smile can be 
the highlight of your day.

She looked at me, looked at how desperate I was, the tears streaming from my 
face, and shook her finger. Nothing.

The low point?
The moment that stands out was on day 16, just over two weeks in to my trip. I 
had been pushing my bike up the Ecuadorian Andes for four days; it was pouring 
with rain and I was extremely hungry. I had passed house after house of 
rejection: no one would help. Nothing. We reached a house and I fell to my 
knees in tears, begging the woman for help, even just her garden to put up my 
tent. She looked at me, looked at how desperate I was, the tears streaming from 
my face, and shook her finger. Nothing. I could do nothing and I felt like 
nothing. I dug deep to source any shred of energy or willpower to keep going.

What’s your advice for anyone who wants to do a similar trip?
If you’re planning a cycling trip, pack light. Very light. Weight will hold 
you back and you’ll be surprised by the amount of stuff you don’t need. Think 
practically and essentially. I would recommend Gore gloves and rain jacket as 
they are lightweight. I also loved my down jacket: it kept me warm and worked 
as a pillow too! Finally, it is important to keep positive. I was raising money 
for a charity calledOperation South America 
<http://www.operationsouthamerica.org/gift-aid-your-donations/> and the thought 
of them got me through my darkest days. And download some motivational videos 
or podcasts. I liked to listen toMotivational Madness 
<http://poddirectory.com/episode/1609565/motivation-madness-audio> – it keeps 
you strong if you’re feeling low.

What was the high point of your trip?
Stepping off the plane in Brazil. I had no money, no contacts, no solid plans 
and 7,000 miles of mystery and wonder ahead of me through lands I’d never set 
foot on. With so many of us on a quest for more stuff and more money, this is a 
perspective on Earth that few of us get to feel.

Hitchhiking is worth it because it takes you to places you never would have 
seen in any other way

The low point?
The daily challenge of finding a new source of food and water, a place to 
sleep, and a ride made the whole trip through South America strenuous. To 
hitchhike 7,000 miles when you don’t like cars isn’t always the most fun. One 
day in Peru I accidentally got off the Pan-American Highway and ended up in the 
middle of nowhere. It took me around 12 rides to go just 130 miles. But 
hitchhiking is worth it because it takes you to places and introduces you to 
people you never would have seen or met in any other way.

What’s your advice for anyone who wants to do a similar trip?
Be prepared and have the gear to be mostly self-sustaining. Carry a tent and 
sleeping gear, water purifier, cooking equipment and comfy clothes. Travel 
light and leave behind what you don’t need. Make connections for places to 
stay, and earn meals through websites such aswwoof.org <http://wwoof.org/>, 
helpx.net <http://www.helpx.net/>, and workaway.info <http://workaway.info/>. 
Ditch your expectations before beginning the journey and keep an open and 
curious mind.

 Breakfast at sunrise by Lake Toba, Sumatra 
What was the high point of your trip, so far?
There is no better feeling than when someone, without knowing who you are, 
holds out a hand to help you. One memorable experience was hitchhiking in Banda 
Aceh, Indonesia. My friend Paco went to ask an elderly Muslim lady how far the 
next town was and she looked at us like we were crazy (hitchhiking is not 
common in Indonesia). We started waving at the cars going past when suddenly 
she came over, calmly stood in the middle of the road and made a stop sign in 
front of a car going past. It stopped immediately, and she told us to get in. 
This old lady had more power and courage than most kids today! I was truly 
inspired and impressed. The power of social media also amazed me. People would 
find my blog online and contact me, inviting me to stay with them.

The low point?
The lowest point was in Germany, I had two days to get to Poland for my flight 
and I had planned to travel 300km across the north. On the way, a Brazilian guy 
who picked me up found out that there were growing neo-Nazi towns in the north 
and I could be entering a dangerous situation. I rerouted via Berlin, adding 
another 300km to my journey. I arrived late at a service station and decided it 
was too late to hitchhike, so I slept in the toilet. Then I got a message from 
someone in Berlin saying that he had read my blogand asked what he could do to 
help. I told him my situation and he offered to come and get me as well as pay 
for my bus ticket and a hotel. But before I could reply I lost Wi-Fi 
connection. I spent the next 90 minutes asking people if I could borrow a phone 
to call him: everyone said no. Finally, one girl agreed and we waited for her 
boyfriend to come out of the toilet so I could explain my location to my 
contact in Berlin. As soon as he came out the look on his face told me he was 
not going to help me, but I did not expect what was to come out of his mouth: 
“I am sorry we cannot help you. You might be trying to organise a bomb 
somewhere.”

You also cannot give up at the first 'no' … try, try, and try again until you 
get a 'yes'!

What’s your advice for anyone who wants to do a similar trip?
There is the risk something bad can happen to a lone female hitchhiker, but it 
was important to me to show the importance of freedom and independence, 
especially for women. I did almost back out after hearing the story ofPippa 
Bacca <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7344381.stm> (an Italian 
hitchhiker murdered in Turkey in 2008), but I decided to proceed with caution. 
I didn’t hitchhike at night with people I didn’t know and I started using other 
methods, like hitchhiking trains, car shares, or with friends of friends. 
Asking locals for advice, learning how to read people’s body language and 
researching countries beforehand is also important.

Emotionally, you need a positive attitude and determination. You are going to 
hear “no” a lot along your way and sometimes dirty looks and nasty comments. 
But you cannot give up at the first “no” … try, try, and try again until you 
get a “yes”.You are much more likely to hitch a ride when you’re smiling than 
when you are down and depressed. Usually when someone does stop, it ends up 
being a beautiful experience. Sweden was a difficult place for me to hitchhike 
because of the prejudice that has developed there, but the best advice that 
someone gave me is: “Focus on your end objective and don’t let anything or 
anyone get in your way.”
