Mark di Suvero at Crissy Field

Just because the San Francisco Museum Of Modern Art (SFMOMA) is closed for two 
years for major renovations doesn't mean you can't still enjoy its exhibits – 
at theAsian Art Museum <http://www.asianart.org/>, at the Legion of Honor 
<https://legionofhonor.famsf.org/>, even outdoors. In collaboration with the 
National Park Service, SFMOMA on the Go scattered eight of Mark di Suvero's 
bold, bright and rust-red steel sculptures, spanning five decades of his 
career, across Crissy Field. Each is about 15-metres high and weighs in at some 
20 tonnes but seem to – almost – move with the wind. A whimsical assemblage of 
beams and buoys, inspired by the Golden Gate bridge – which now serves as its 
backdrop.

Heath Ceramics San Francisco

You'll see its signature, mid-century-style pottery on every restaurant 
tabletop in California. Cult followers of the iconic, 66-year-old Heath 
Ceramics used to have to trek to a dusty, low-slung space in Sausalito for 
their dish sets, tiles and teapots. But Heath has since expanded to San 
Francisco's Ferry Building and down south to LA – and now to the burgeoning 
north-east section of the Mission District. Owners Robin Petravic and Catherine 
Bailey took over a former linen supply and laundry and turned it into an airy, 
light factory showroom, complete with a Blue Bottle coffee lounge, which has 
become a destination and community space for design hounds. Plus: there's a 
tightly curated selection of cookbooks, gorgeous handmade wooden clocks byHouse 
Industries <http://www.houseind.com/>, and weekend factory tours, too.

de Young Museum

There was a bit of controversy back in 2001, when the de Young Museum was 
being built. Renowned architects Herzog and de Meuron planned for a 44-metre 
tower, which many felt would be an intrusion on the natural beauty and peace of 
Golden Gate park. But today it stands proud, welcoming folks – free of 
admission charge – to ride the elevator up to a view that stretches all the way 
to Ocean Beach, albeit on a fog-free summer day. You're also free to enjoy 
lunch and wine on the lawn in the sculpture garden. Inside the museum proper, 
permanent collections include 180 objects of African art and more than 1,000 
American paintings dating back to 1670, as well as compelling rotating 
exhibits, such as photographer Anthony Friedkin's Gay Essay and Native American 
art from the Weisel family's private collection. But the modern 
copper-stone-wood-glass building itself is a work of art.

Aesthetic Union

An old-fashioned print shop run by a thirtysomething, apron-clad man named 
James Tucker, who does the letterpress profession proud, giving customers' 
business cards and party invites the look and paper stock they deserve. He 
shares studio space with Risa Culbertson of PapaLlama, a small eco-stationery 
line of exceptionally witty cards, each an original design that is transferred 
to lino-wood blocks and hand-carved. With a spare simplicity, a fun collection 
of classic office supplies like No 2 pencils, pink erasers and sharpeners – 
plus two vintage Heidelberg windmill presses on site – Aesthetic Union feels 
like a refreshing step back in pre-high-tech time.

Murals and street art
 Photograph: Michele Falzone/Alamy 
The streets of San Francisco have long been considered art galleries in their 
own right: hundreds of evocative, brightly coloured, hand-painted murals are 
splashed on sides of buildings from the Outer Sunset to the Tenderloin to 
Bayview, but some of the most impressive are the Mission – and volunteer-run 
site SF Mural Arts <http://www.sfmuralarts.com/> tells you a bit about each and 
everyone. Though murals are always changing – and new ones always popping up – 
every weekend, Precita Eyes Muralists runs artist-led walks (or guided bike 
rides) of iconic Balmy Alley or Precita Park or the digital murals atGalería de 
la Raza <http://www.galeriadelaraza.org/>.
• Mission Trail Mural Walk, precitaeyes.org <http://www.precitaeyes.org/>. $15

Town Cutler
 Galen Garretson, owner of Town Cutler 
You don't have to be a professional cook, or a stylish killer, to appreciate 
this gorgeous art gallery of a knife shop in Nob Hill. A former sous chef at
Quince <http://quincerestaurant.com/>, owner Galen Garretson has indeed become 
the town's cutler. At his long, narrow boutique, he curates a global collection 
of high-end cutlery, spends six hours a day hunched over a whetstone honing 
blades for the city's best chefs, and leads knife-sharpening classes for 
amateur home cooks. Behind a large glass wall, which you can lift by pulley, 
hang all sorts of hand-cut knives – such as the Takeda Gyuto, with a 
traditional Japanese handle fashioned from rosewood, or a pricey Random 
Damascus blade from the local Wilburn Forge.

Craftsman & Wolves

OK, yes, this is a modern patisserie, not an art gallery, and so what's it 
doing in a design round-up? But, Paris included, you've never quite seen baked 
goods as architecturally beautiful (or, for that matter, tasty) as these. If a 
jewellery shop and a bakery had a baby, it would look like Craftsman & Wolves, 
with its high ceilings, brick walls, and squeaky-clean glass pastry case, where 
chef William Werner displays his works of art, such as the "chocolate croissant 
stack" or chocolate sourdough topped with black sesame, almond, matcha and 
citrus. A perfect après-museum snack.

Flora Grubb
 Flora Grubb 
An industrial-grey no man's land is the last place in San Francisco you'd 
expect to find a lush, sprawling garden shop and true urban oasis. But Flora 
Grubb Gardens could be in Timbuktu and design types, hip homemakers and people 
who've never potted a plant in their life would still flock there. Wander 
around with a coffee from the on-site Ritual stand and survey the endless 
selection of succulents and leafy palms, ceramics and terrariums, and outdoor 
decor items ranging from solar paper lanterns to bright-purple patio chairs, to 
a first-of-its kind heated bench, hand built by Galanter & Jones. Even in the 
summer fog, you'll want to sit there all day.

Potrero Flats Art Galleries
 Brian Gross Fine Art 
San Francisco's famed art galleries have always tended to cluster around 
downtown and Union Square but, last year, several migrated south, away from the 
tourist fray to warehouses in lower Potrero Hill, aka "Potrero Flats". Now, 
within walking distance of each other are acclaimed galleries such asBrian 
Gross Fine Art <http://www.briangrossfineart.com/>, Catharine Clark Gallery 
<http://cclarkgallery.com/>, George Lawson Gallery 
<http://www.georgelawsongallery.com/>, Jack Fischer 
<http://www.jackfischergallery.com/>, joining neighbourhood pioneers like 
Hosfelt Gallery <http://www.hosfeltgallery.com/> and Steven Wolf Fine Arts 
<http://www.stevenwolffinearts.com/>, plus the city campus of California 
College of the Arts <https://www.cca.edu/about>, which has a new 
gymnasium-sized gallery that showcases students' best work.

Perish Trust 

What happens when a photographer and a stylist decide to open a shop? Perish 
Trust, a modern-day general store with an ever-changing mix of always-cool 
stuff that's been luring in San Francisco taste-makers since 2008. In a dimly 
lit, sort-of mysterious space on increasingly hip Divisadero Street, is a 
collection of things you never knew you wanted: such as cast-iron fisherman 
bookends and vintage reconditioned hatchets, Monarch typewriters and Japanese 
martini shakers from Umami Mart.
