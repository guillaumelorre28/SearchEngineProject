The closure of a Brisbane <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/brisbane>
 dental clinic over sterilisation concerns is a worrying but rare situation, 
the Australian Dental Association says.


Queensland <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland> Health has 
taken action under the Public Health Act to order Gap Free Smiles at Carina to 
shut until proper infection control standards are met, and a dentist has also 
been suspended.

Health <https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/health> officials have 
urged patients of the clinic to arrange testing for blood-borne diseases, 
including viruses such as Hepatitis C, but have said “the risk of transmission 
is very small”.


Australian Dental Association Queensland president Dr Gary Smith said the 
organisation was monitoring the situation, which was concerning but rare given 
the profession was relatively low-risk with clear infection control procedures.


“Things like this can give dentistry a bad name, and we want to protect our 
good name in the community,” he told ABC radio. “But as dentists we are about 
trying to protect the public.”

Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young has assured that public health experts 
would check relevant procedures were being followed before allowing the clinic 
to reopen.
