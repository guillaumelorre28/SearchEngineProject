worth £70,000 a week as a reward for the impressive performances that have 
earned a call-up to the England squad.

Antonio, who joined West Ham in September 2015 for around £7m, agreed a 
four-year deal last summer having established himself as one of Slaven Bilic’s 
key players by scoring eight Premier League goals.

The 26-year-old winger has carried on that form, already matching his tally 
from last season and providing all three assists for West Hamin the 3-0 victory

 at Crystal Palace on Saturday.

That prompted the vice-chairman, Karren Brady, to pay tribute to the player 
who began his career at non-league Tooting & Mitcham in the week that Dimitri 
Payet told West Ham he wanted to leave. “Michail Antonio was in bed with flu 
yesterday, got out of bed pulled on his shirt & played magnificently today – 
that’s dedication for you,” Brady wrote on Twitter.

It is understood interest from Chelsea prompted West Ham to secure Antonio on 
a long-term deal that doubles his salary of £35,000 a week.

Ham are insistent

 there is no financial pressure on them to sell a player whose deal runs out in 
2021.

West Ham are also hopeful of striking a deal to sign Brentford’s Scott Hogan, 
having seen three bids rejected for the 24-year-old. Watford and Palace remain 
interested as the Championship side hold out for a fee close to £15m for the 
former Rochdale striker.
