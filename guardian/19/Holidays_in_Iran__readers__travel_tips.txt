Winning tip: Aberkooh

The desert town of Aberkooh, between Yazd and Shiraz, was a flourishing city 
on the Silk Road in the 10th century and largely destroyed by the Afghans in 
the mid-1700s. There’s a 4,000-year-old cypress tree, one of the best coffee 
shops in Iran, and the beautifully restoredAghazadeh Mansion 
<http://www.aghazadeh.org/index.php?l=EN> with its double height windcatcher, 
using 19 wooden vents to channel cool breezes into the house. With luck you may 
run into the charming 12-year-old Amir Reza and be invited back to his home for 
lavender tea sweetened with saffron sugar.

When in Isfahan don’t miss watching zurkhaneh, a 3,000-year-old form of 
athletics originally used to train warriors, involving sweaty men in leather 
breeches doing press-ups and swinging clubs to deafening music and chanting. 
The zurkhaneh pits are difficult to locate but ask a local or guide to get you 
a ringside seat.

Brits, know this: you don’t need a tour guide. The visa process remains 
tricky, but once an agency or Iranian citizen has sponsored your successful 
application, you should have little trouble going it alone. This allows you to 
make the most of your encounters with the country’s endlessly hospitable and 
inquisitive people and the inevitable invitations for tea or to their homes. 
While you might not think of it as a country where spontaneity is rewarded, 
such chance meetings will be the highlights of your stay, as they were for me 
(a Brit) during a recent three-week trip.

Damavand is a little over 70km from Tehran and one of the most authentic of 
small cities. Mount Damavand is the highest active volcanic peak in Asia, and 
one of the best ski resorts, Aab Ali, is also nearby. There are many natural 
waterfalls and the area is famous for its honey.

Varzaneh desert at sunset

Varzaneh is a small desert town, not too far from Isfahan. Arriving at the 
small-but-quaint Chapaker Guest House (Beheshti Street, +98 913 203 0096) you 
will be greeted by the ever-smiling, energetic Mr Reza and his quirky companion 
Rouhallah. The neighbouring ladies wear shining white chadors in contrast to 
the usual black ones and peer at you with curiosity. For a couple of dollars Mr 
Reza will take you to splendid views of vast wetlands, a volcanic crater, the 
majestic salt lake and the magnificent Varzaneh desert stretching into the 
sunset.

After enjoying the Shiraz to Tehran route, take a few days to go north-east 
from Tehran to Qazvin and then into the Alborz mountains to discover the remote 
11th- and 12th-century castles of the Nizari Ismaili “Assassins”, especially 
Alamut and Lambesar. They will remind you of the mountain retreats of the 
French Cathars, with stunning valleys, high mountains and views. Zarabad makes 
an ideal village base.

Abyaneh is a 13th-century mountain village about 80km south of Kashan. Its 
culture, traditions, costumes and dialect are unlike anywhere else in Iran. In 
1973 it was registered as anational heritage site 
<http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5197/>. Houses built of mud and straw 
are stepped into the hillside; narrow unpaved roads slope up and down the 
hills. Women wear colourful headscarves – the size of the flowers denoting 
their marital status, while married men wear voluminous satin trousers. As 
everywhere else in Iran, the people are wonderfully friendly and welcoming.

In Shiraz stay in (if you can) or at least have lunch in the courtyard of the 
Niyayesh boutique hotel <http://en.niayeshhotels.com/home> (twin room £40). 
Once you have visited the incredible Nasir al-Molk mosque in the morning for 
the sun streaming through the stained glass windows, cross Lotfali Khan Street, 
and turn left, in the direction of the citadel, take the third right alley and 
on your right is a beautifulmadrasa (religious school, free). The madrasa 
courtyard is peaceful and a great place to sit quietly, watch the mullahs in 
discussion and see life unfold. Continuing down the same alley, hang left and 
you enter the famous bazaar where you can tryfaloodeh, the refreshing, if 
strange, Shirazi dessert.

organised by the site and mingled with other curious backpackers and young,

the Azerbaijani border and slept in a remote hillside village. It was amazing 
to disconnect – there was no mobile reception or Wi-Fi for miles.

Fly from Tehran or Shiraz to this island in the Strait of Hormuz, or make the 
short ferry crossing from Bandar Abbas. You do not have to be a geologist to 
enjoy Gheshm’s extraordinary geology. Eight main sites are spread around an 
island 60 miles long and can be visited by taxi: negotiate a day rate of around 
£20. Otherworldly landscapes have been carved over millennia by wind and water. 
I stayed in Tabl village, at Mr Amini’s house, which was clean and welcoming. 
(Any meal or night’s accommodation was £3.)

I had proudly taken my fiance to see Ephesus in Turkey; now it was his turn to 
show me his homeland. We arrived at our first stop, Masuleh, on a starry night, 
and awoke to incredible scenery. Perched on our rooftop, we took it all in over 
a breakfast of warm bread with saffron and carrot jam, and tea. We then drove to
Rudkhan castle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudkhan_Castle> and scaled the 
1,000 steps to absorb yet more spectacular views. Houses in Masuleh are 
available to rent upon arrival for around £35 a night and can usually 
accommodate three or four guests.

Golshan Hostel, a shining star in Shiraz

From our trip to Shiraz, I have to mention Golshan Hostel. This traditional 
hostel radiates Persian warmth and hospitality, and it’s a perfect base for 
exploring the ancient city. There is a charming courtyard with a blue-tiled 
pool, flowering vines and bright, scattered cushions. It’s hard not to mingle, 
chai in hand, in such a tranquil place.

This is a beautiful 400-year-old masterpiece, displaying the earliest 
representations of a fused European and Persian style, and the complex formed 
the foundation of Iran’s modern artistic movement. My top tips for inside the 
palace are the dramatic and awe-inducing Takht’e Marmar (Marble Throne), which 
stands in an outdoor terrace, and the magnificent Talar-e Ayaheh (Hall of 
Mirrors) which is exactly that. Only a stone’s throw away is Tehran’s famous 
Grand Bazaar.

Isfahan, for tea and coffee lovers

Navigating Isfahan by its old teahouses and new coffee shops is a nice way to 
spend an afternoon. The Azadegan Teahouse, in a lane off the north-east corner 
of Imam Square, has ceilings and walls decked with metal pots and lanterns, 
with tea, snacks andqalyan (hookah) on the menu. On the other side of the city, 
stylised coffees and virgin cocktails can be found in Café Ahang, near Charbagh 
Abasi Street. With its bookshelf and tables decorated with post-it notes, it 
has a cosy, local feel.

The desert oasis of Bam, in the province of Kerman, was largely destroyed by 
an earthquake in 2003 but has since been rebuilt. You can wander through 
gardens full of orange and pomegranate trees and date palms. A must-see is the 
impressive, Unesco-listedArg-e-Bam <http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1208> 
citadel, which is being beautifully restored. Bam is also an excellent base for 
exploring the surrounding desert, including overnight stays in desert camps.

Observing Ashura in Yazd

I recommend visiting Yazd at the time of Ashura (it will be on 1 October in 
2017). It’s the festival of mourning for the murder of Imam Hossein and there 
is a genuine grief evident in the rituals. Visitors are welcome to the upper 
galleries of mosques, generally opposite the women’s galleries, to witness 
hundreds of men beating their chests as the story is chanted. Our group was 
invited to a large temporary feeding area for a free lunch and supper 
(donations welcomed). You will also see fountains running red.
