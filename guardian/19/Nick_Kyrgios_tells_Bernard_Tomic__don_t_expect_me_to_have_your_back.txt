continued withNick Kyrgios <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nick-kyrgios> 
hitting back at Davis Cup team-mate Bernard Tomic’s claims that he faked 
illness to miss the weekend’s tie against the US.

Kyrgios pulled out of the tie at Kooyong with a virus, although Tomic was 
later picked up by court microphones complaining to team captain Lleyton Hewitt 
and questioning the legitimacy of his compatriot’s illness.

Tomic maintained his stance in the post-match press conference, suggesting 
Kyrgios had twice previously faked injuries to get out ofDavis Cup 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/daviscup> duties.

Kyrgios took to social media on Sunday night, fanning the flames of the 
dispute by referencing the unenviable record Tomic holds for the quickest 
defeat on the men’s tour – a 6-0, 6-1 defeat to Jarkko Nieminen in Miami two 
years ago.

 “Let’s not forget who holds the quickest loss on the ATP Tour lol,” Kyrgios 
posted. “#howmanyminutesagain.”

 That tweet was soon deleted but Kyrgios followed it with: “Heat of the 
moment, not gonna take it personally. Indian Wells a week away, plenty of time.

 “Just don’t expect me to have your back anytime soon.”

Former doubles champion and twice Davis Cup winner Todd Woodbridge was 
critical of the players’ behaviour, saying Tomic’s grievances – and Kyrgios’ 
response to them – should not have been aired in public.

“I thought, well that will get dropped once he comes off the court, and he 
didn’t,” Woodbridge told SEN Radio. “I was really surprised like everybody to 
hear that from him.

“You get through those moments, they are locker-room moments, they’re not 
television moments and they’re not press-conference moments.”

 Hewitt’s predecessor as Australia captain, Wally Masur, sought to play down 
the row, saying the exchange will soon be forgotten by pair – as early as next 
week’s tournament in Indian Wells.

 “What’s happened has happened and, for me, the best thing is that they both 
play Indian Wells in five days’ time,” Masur told Fox Sports News. “That they 
just meet up in the locker room ... shake hands and just get on with it.

 “We don’t play another Davis Cup tie until September so there will be a lot 
of water under the bridge from now until then.”

Tomic, who played with a wrist injury during the defeat to the US in Kooyong 
on the weekend, had suggested that Kyrgios was not really suffering from a 
virus.

“Bullshit he’s sick,” Tomic said 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/06/bullshit-hes-sick-tomic-hits-out-at-kyrgios-as-australia-go-down-to-us-in-davis-cup>
 on court during his loss to John Isner, which gave the US an unassailable lead 
in the tie, before later saying he would lose respect for his compatriot if he 
were to play at Indian Wells next week.

Kyrgios’s claims of illness were backed by the Australian team camp though, 
with Hewitt and Masur both vouching for the world No 27.

Hewitt was adamant that “there is absolutely no doubt he was sick”, while 
Masur said: “I didn’t see him but the word was that he had a virus and his 
actual mouth was ulcerated and the guy was pretty fatigued.”

John Peers, the doubles player brought into the team for the first time over 
the weekend, also backed Kyrgios and said he was a “a little” disappointed by 
Tomic’s on-court comments.

 “But I think Bernie just got a little heated in the moment but it all calmed 
itself down,” he said. “I think Lleyton made the right decision to begin with. 
Nick came down to do a fitness test and, according to medical staff, didn’t get 
through it.

 “So Lleyton had to make the tough decision and go with the strongest team we 
could put out on the field that was healthy to play.”
