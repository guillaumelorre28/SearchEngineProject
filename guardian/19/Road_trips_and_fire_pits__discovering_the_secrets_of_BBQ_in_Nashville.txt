My partner Sam and I wanted to discover the secret of American barbecue. We 
gave up our jobs in the UK and busked our way from California to the deep 
south. The US version of a barbecue is quite different to ours, it’s all about 
smoking meat in a “pit” for a long time at low temperatures.

Everyone thinks Nashville is a little honky-tonk town in the middle of 
Tennessee. It’s actually quite a commercial place, the beating heart of all the 
major record companies – there are cowboys walking around with guitars and 
Stetsons, but they tend to be commercial artists. And it’s not just country 
music – Jack White from the White Stripes has his main studio there. Broadway, 
the main strip, is cheesy and tacky, but great for a laugh. One of the most 
famous bars isTootsies <http://www.tootsies.net/>, known for craft beer and 
moonshine. Every bar in Nashville has live bands, and the musicianship is 
unbelievable, even at the smallest joints.

The Ryman Auditorium <http://ryman.com/> is one of my favourite places. It’s 
where theGrand Ole Opry <http://www.opry.com/> used to be broadcast from, the 
famous country and western radio show. Now it’s an amazing venue where you can 
catch the best up-and-coming artists – the acoustics are fantastic.

On our quest to find the best barbecue in Tennessee, we discovered Puckett’s 
<http://www.puckettsofleipersfork.com/>. This fantastic joint in Leiper’s Fork, 
just outside Nashville, has a massive custom-built smoker outside, and meat is 
served off the pit. American barbecue is a male-dominated scene, so as women we 
were a bit of a novelty. Lots of chefs shared their secrets and recipes. It’s 
wood smoke that gives the meat flavour, so you might use apple or cherry wood 
for chicken, oak or hickory for beef. It’s not marinated; you dust it with dry 
rub, and oil activates the flavour. We fell in love with the side dishes, too: 
mac’n’cheese, smoky beans, all sorts of salads.

 Puckett’s of Leiper’s Fork, near Nashville, which has a huge barbecue pit 
Craft beer is huge in America. In some bars, even on Broadway, you’ll find 200 
types. The choice is overwhelming. Prop yourself at the bar and work through 
them. I recommend Fat Cow, brewed in North Carolina.

Lots of older, retired musicians live in Franklin. In this quaint little town 
30 miles from Nashville, you’ll find everyone from Glen Campbell’s drummer to 
the harmonica player for House of Blues. It’s in the middle of amazing 
countryside and we hung out there like proper hillbillies.

road from Nashville to Natchez. Photograph: Alamy 
The Natchez Trace Parkway <https://www.nps.gov/natr/index.htm> runs through 
Tennessee, with breathtaking views. You can stop at a diner in one of the 
little towns en route for a bite and a beer, then move on. Or it’s about a 
four-hour drive to Memphis. You really do need a car to explore the US. We fell 
in love with ribs in Memphis – the best are St Louis pork ribs with Memphis dry 
shake at theCharlie Vergos Rendezvous restaurant 
<https://www.facebook.com/Charlie-Vergos-Rendezvous-131059266937444/>. And 
there’s so much to do there, from Gracelands to the Martin Luther King museum.

Nashville is the home of the cowboy boot. I bought my first pair of 
handstitched boots at Tony Lama. You can pay from $200 to $2,000. There are 
thousands to choose from in all colours, short ones, long ones … Then you’ve 
got to decide the toe: a classic round C, a winklepicker, or a J, which is 
somewhere in between.

People from Nashville are super-friendly. Don’t be surprised if you end up 
staying in people’s houses and making new friends – that’s the kind of 
hospitality you get in the south. You can go there with a plan, but the plan is 
subject to change because you meet some amazing people … and they’re likely to 
pass you around their friends.

Our restaurant, Hang Fire Southern Kitchen 
<https://www.hangfiresouthernkitchen.com/> is in the old Pumphouse in Barry. 
We’ve brought a taste of the deep south to the deep south of Wales, giving 
people the most authentic barbecue experience we can. Beyond that, though, 
there are no similarities – the two places couldn’t be more different!
